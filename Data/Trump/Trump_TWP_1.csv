President and RNC raised $463 million combined in 2019
President Trump's political operation headed into 2020 with nearly $200 million on hand, according to party officials, giving him a financial war chest that vastly outstrips the resources of his Democratic opponents weeks before primary voting begins.
Trump's reelection campaign, the Republican Party and two joint fundraising committees together raised a record $154 million in the final three months of the year, party officials told The Washington Post, a massive haul they said was fueled by backlash to the House impeachment of the president.
Of that, more than $72 million was collected by the Republican National Committee, driven in part by big checks from wealthy donors "" a sign that much of the moneyed class that shunned Trump in 2016 is now embracing him.
Small donors also continued to give to the party and to Trump's reelection campaign, which pulled in $46 million, far outpacing leading Democrats vying for their party's nomination. Among them, the biggest fundraiser last quarter was Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who raised $34.5 million.
Since the impeachment inquiry began in September, the president's campaign and the RNC gained 600,000 new donors, officials said.
In all, Trump and the RNC together scooped up a staggering $463 million in 2019, party officials said. In comparison, then-President Barack Obama and the Democratic Party raised roughly $220 million in 2011, the year before his reelection.
'President Trump's unwavering commitment to keeping his promises to the American people has propelled us to break fundraising records again this quarter,' RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. 'Democrats' baseless impeachment charade has only made support for President Trump stronger.'
Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee has trailed far behind the RNC in fundraising.
As of the end of November, the DNC had raised $83.6 million for the year and had $6.5 million in debt, according to campaign finance filings. The RNC raised $241 million for the entire year, GOP party officials said.
DNC officials have said they are not seeking to outraise the RNC, but rather build up the party to support the eventual nominee after the nominating convention this summer.
'We're seeing unprecedented enthusiasm for the Democratic Party, with half the Democratic field alone having already outraised the sitting incumbent president by tens of millions of dollars. The DNC made smart investments that led us to victories in 2017, 2018 and 2019, and is hard at work building the infrastructure necessary to do the same in 2020,' said Daniel Wessel, DNC spokesman.
The fourth-quarter figures notch a record for Trump's reelection machine, which has already raised and spent historic amounts toward securing a second term. It is unclear whether the money can overcome some of the president's challenges, including an approval rating that has hovered around 40-percent for his three years in office.
The money raised directly by the Trump campaign has been largely driven by online giving, coming in response to email, text and other appeals for $25 or $50 at a time.
As the incumbent president, Trump also benefits from big-money contributions through the joint fundraising committees with the national party. The cap for individual donors' contributions to national parties is $710,000 in the two-year period of an election cycle, far more than the $5,600 per-cycle limit for donations to a given candidate.
During his 2016 campaign, Trump attacked his rivals as beholden to large donors. But in the last year, the president increasingly participated in high-dollar fundraisers in locales such as New York and Los Angeles, with minimum ticket prices of $35,000.
He has also regularly raised money at his own hotel, raising ethical questions about driving business to his properties.
Trump's joint fundraising with the party has allowed him to use big-money contributions to finance some costly pieces of the reelection effort, including hosting big-dollar fundraisers and holding rallies for his supporters.
RNC officials say they have put $11 million into TV and digital ads against vulnerable Democrats who supported impeachment, and have built up the biggest staff in party history, with 400 people in 18 targeted states.

Lawyers Dershowitz, Starr backed president on TV in impeachment
The team of lawyers expected to guide President Trump toward an election-year acquittal in the Senate expanded suddenly Friday to include Kenneth W. Starr and Alan Dershowitz, two of the biggest legal celebrities of the 1990s, who have drawn attention with their television appearances and involvement in Jeffrey Epstein's defense against charges of child prostitution in the mid-2000s.
Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton, and Dershowitz, the Harvard Law emeritus professor who advised the defense team in football star O.J. Simpson's murder trial, were announced as the newest members of Trump's defense. The group will also include former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi and former independent counsel Robert Ray, according to Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's personal attorneys, who will lead the defense with the White House Counsel Pat Cipollone.
The four new lawyers were selected personally by Trump for their political-legal celebrity and vocal defenses of the president in the media "" and despite the significant professional baggage that several of them bring to the impeachment saga.
Trump faces possible removal from office after the House impeached him last month on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. He is expected to survive the trial, thanks to the Senate's Republican majority, though a weeks-long spectacle laying out allegations about his conduct toward Ukraine could be an embarrassing ordeal for the president.
Starr, 73, became a national figure in 1994 when he was named independent counsel to lead the investigation of the Whitewater scandal. That probe eventually focused on Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky and produced a hefty report that described their encounters in lurid detail. By the time the House impeached Clinton in December 1998, Starr had become a lightning rod and a symbol of what Clinton supporters viewed as the puritanical mania of Republicans bent on driving the president from office.
Trump sees the presence of Starr, a former solicitor general who was once considered for a nomination to the Supreme Court, as a way to shore up his credibility during the Senate trial. He repeatedly tweeted praise for Starr's friendly commentary during the House impeachment proceedings.
The president's attitude was quite different in 1999.
To MSNBC, Trump said: 'I think Ken Starr is a lunatic. I really think that Ken Starr is a disaster. . . . I really think that Ken Starr was terrible.'
To columnist Maureen Dowd, he said: 'Starr's a freak. I bet he's got something in his closet.'
To CNBC, he said: 'I mean, can you imagine those evenings when [Clinton's] just being lambasted by this crazy Ken Starr, who is a total wacko? . . . I mean, he is totally off his rocker.'
After returning to private practice in 1999, Starr became the dean of Pepperdine University's law school and then the president of Baylor University in Waco, Tex., in 2010.
In 2016, he was ousted from Baylor amid an unfolding scandal over the school's handling of sexual assault allegations involving members of the football team. An investigation found that Baylor had 'failed to consistently support' victims of sexual assault and 'failed to take action to identify and eliminate a potentially hostile environment, prevent its recurrence, or address its effects.'
Starr has claimed he did not know about the allegations, telling NPR in 2018: 'Unfortunately "" and this is going to sound like an apologia, but it is the absolute truth "" never was it brought to my attention that there were these issues.'
In the mid-2000s, Starr and Dershowitz were part of Epstein's legal team when the wealthy investor was under investigation on suspicion of child prostitution. Epstein, a convicted sex offender, was found dead in his jail cell last year in an apparent suicide. A plea deal that Epstein's accusers have criticized as overly lenient was struck with Alex Acosta, a U.S. attorney in Florida during that period.
After renewed criticism of the deal led to Acosta's resignation as labor secretary last year, Starr described his own role in the case, saying he was enlisted to make a constitutional argument that the crimes Epstein was accused of were state, not federal, offenses.
'I was making a federalism argument,' Starr told Fox News host Laura Ingraham in July 2019. 'Don't federally criminalize this area of the law that really does belong to the states. . . . There were no allegations of crossing state lines in the Florida situation.'
In the interview, Starr called the accusations against Epstein 'serious . . . obviously.'
Dershowitz's friendship with Epstein has produced a war of lawsuits and countersuits.
After Virginia Roberts Giuffre claimed she had sex with Dershowitz at Epstein's behest in the early 2000s, when she was underage, Dershowitz issued a torrent of denials, calling her a 'certified, complete, total liar' who invented the accusation to sell her story. Giuffre is suing him for defamation, and Dershowitz has countersued her for defamation.
Some White House officials hoped Trump would not pick Dershowitz, to avoid references to his entanglement with Epstein.
In an interview with The Washington Post last month, Dershowitz declined to say whether he would join the team. 'Just ask me if I've had sex with any underage girls, that I'm happy to answer. And the answer is no,' he said.
The legal drama surrounding Dershowitz's involvement with Epstein has, at times, overshadowed the 81-year-old's legacy as one of America's best-known courtroom stars. He was a constant presence in American living rooms as part of the defense team during Simpson's trial, which was televised live. But by then, he was already a household name, immortalized on the big screen in the film 'Reversal of Fortune,' which documented his successful appeal of socialite Claus von Bulow's conviction for the attempted murder of his wealthy wife.
In Trump, Dershowitz has found a client with a similar appetite for bombast "" though his embrace of the president came as a surprise to some. He opposed Trump in the 2016 campaign and has described himself as a 'loyal liberal' who has supported Democratic presidential candidates since the 1950s.
But when Trump's legal problems were mounting, Dershowitz proved to be a headline-grabbing advocate for the embattled president. On television, he made his position clear: 'A sitting president cannot be charged with a crime.' In 2018, he published a book titled 'The Case Against Impeaching Trump.'
Dershowitz told The Post on Friday that he would present arguments at the Senate trial that obstruction of Congress and abuse of power do not meet the constitutional standard to impeach a president for high crimes and misdemeanors.
Dershowitz said he was participating on Trump's legal team 'to defend the integrity of the Constitution and to prevent the creation of a dangerous constitutional precedent.'
'The president asked me to present my independent constitutional arguments in my books and my articles to the Senate. My argument is going to be directed at the constitutional criteria and why they haven't been met in this case,' he said.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's personal attorneys, called Dershowitz a 'great choice' for the defense team. Giuliani said he was kept out of the group because of his involvement in the Ukraine saga as a 'potential witness.'
Trump has been accused of withholding military aid and an Oval Office meeting with the president of Ukraine to pressure the country's leaders into announcing investigations into the Biden family and a debunked theory about the 2016 election.
The trial is set to begin in earnest on Tuesday, though it is possible that Trump's lawyers won't speak at length until early the following week after the Democratic impeachment managers from the House present their case. Cipollone is expected to be the lead speaker for the team and to avoid the media, while Dershowitz and Starr may do television appearances throughout the trial, according to a White House official familiar with the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations and planning.
Cipollone has negotiated trial strategy with Trump and Eric Ueland, the White House head of legislative affairs, according to the official. In one example, he argued against showing video footage during the trial, believing it would not be helpful to the president's case, the official said.
Trump is also expected to enlist several House members, including Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.), to help advise the legal team, but they are unlikely to speak on the Senate floor, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations and planning.
Trump wanted Dershowitz and Bondi, 54, on his team because he sees them as convincing and talented on television, said a White House official familiar with the selections who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations and planning.
Bondi, whom Trump has called a 'great woman,' helped the White House with its messaging during the impeachment proceedings. Previously, she represented a bevy of clients "" including General Motors, the government of Qatar and a Kuwaiti firm "" as a lobbyist. She stepped down as Florida attorney general in January.
Ray, 59, replaced Starr as independent counsel in October 1999 and oversaw the agreement with Clinton that averted a possible criminal trial. His final report on the Whitewater investigation stated that there was insufficient evidence to show that Bill or Hillary Clinton had committed any crimes related to the Arkansas land venture that was the subject of the case.
He resigned from the position in March 2002 before making a failed bid that year for the U.S. Senate from New Jersey as a Republican. Since then, according to his LinkedIn profile, Ray has served as a partner at six law firms, including a firm he joined this month, Zeichner Ellman - Krause.
Ray had given a number of television interviews about impeachment that were friendly to Trump before Friday's announcement.
'I think you can look for summary proceedings in the United States Senate "" without witnesses "" to resolve this, and I believe Mitch McConnell has the votes to do that,' he said on Fox Business Network this week.
Asked about the possibility of Trump's removal, Ray said: 'It's not going to happen.'

Post-impeachment purge of appointees deemed to lack fealty to president
President Trump has instructed his White House to identify and force out officials across his administration who are not seen-as sufficiently loyal, a post-impeachment escalation that administration officials say reflects a new phase of a campaign of retribution and restructuring ahead of the November election.
Johnny McEntee, Trump's former personal aide who now leads the effort as director of presidential personnel, has begun combing through various agencies with a mandate from the president to oust or sideline political appointees who have not proved their loyalty, according to several administration officials and others familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
The push comes in the aftermath of an impeachment process in which several members of Trump's administration provided damning testimony about his behavior with regard to Ukraine. The stream of officials publicly criticizing Trump's actions frustrated the president and caused him to fixate on cleaning house after his acquittal this month. 
'We want bad people out of our government!' Trump tweeted Feb. 13, kicking off a tumultuous stretch of firings, resignations, controversial appointments and private skirmishes that have since spilled into public view.
The National Security Council, the State Department and the Justice Department are targets of particular focus, according to two administration officials, and-there have recently been multiple resignations and reassignments at each of those agencies.
John C. Rood, the official in charge of Defense Department policy who had certified that Ukraine had met anti-corruption obligations, was let go this week. Victoria Coates, the deputy national security adviser who was viewed with suspicion by some White House aides, was removed from her post and was moved to an advisory position in the Energy Department.
McEntee spent part of this week asking officials in various Cabinet agencies to provide names of political appointees working in government who are not fully supportive of Trump's presidency, according to administration officials. 
The president instructed McEntee to find people in the administration who aren't aligned with Trump and 'get rid' of them, according to someone familiar with the president's directive. 
Trump did not provide additional specificity on what exactly he wanted beyond a workforce that more fully reflects his instincts, the person said, and it is-unclear what criteria are being-used to determine an official's fealty to the president. McEntee's discussions with Cabinet agencies were first reported by Axios.
The 29-year-old former campaign aide is planning to prepare a presentation for Trump about what he has found. While Sean Doocey, the former director of presidential personnel, reported to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's deputy, McEntee reports directly to the president, according to a senior administration official.
What began as a campaign of retribution against officials who participated in the impeachment process has evolved into a full-scale effort to create an administration more fully in sync with Trump's id and agenda, according to several officials familiar with the plan. It is unclear whether civil servants will be targeted as well, but it would be harder to dislodge them than removing political appointees. Civil servants, however, could be sidelined in other ways.
As he became the third president in American history to be impeached, Trump seethed against his own appointees who defied White House lawyers to comply with congressional subpoenas and testify about his conduct. The process clarified for Trump and his top advisers that they had not focused enough on personnel in the early part of the presidency, creating a loyalty deficiency the president is moving quickly to correct, officials said.
The burgeoning effort was reflected in Trump's decision this week to appoint Richard Grenell as the next acting director of national intelligence, placing a fiercely loyal but inexperienced ally atop an intelligence structure against which the president has frequently railed.
Mulvaney used a speech this week at the Oxford Union in Britain to inveigh against the 'deep state,' and he lamented that the administration could not fire more agency employees who do not implement the president's orders. He referred to some of testimony of the witnesses who participated in Trump's impeachment inquiry. 
Bureaucrats who want to make policy instead of implementing it 'should put their name on the effing ballot and run' for office, he said during remarks to a group of several hundred people, according to audio of a speech obtained by The Washington Post.
Trump's family members have been among the main champions of the effort to force out officials who have not proved their devotion to Trump.
Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and a senior adviser in the White House, has played a central role in the push, concentrating more power in the West Wing and working to combat leaks, officials said.
Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. wrote on Twitter that the impeachment investigation was helpful in 'unearthing who all needed to be fired.'
Cliff Sims, a former White House adviser who wrote a book titled 'Team of Vipers,' about his time in the White House, has said Trump's presidency has been repeatedly undermined by disloyal underlings. 
'Loyalist shouldn't be a dirty word,' he said. 'Loyalty to the duly elected president and his agenda is exactly what we should expect from our unelected appointees.'
Brendan Buck, a longtime adviser to former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), said that while Trump is entitled to have political appointees who support his agenda, the purity tests could make it difficult to find qualified people. 
'If they also insist on hiring only people who've never taken issue with something the president has done, it's going to be slim pickings,' he said. 
Trump selected Grenell, the-ambassador to Germany, to-lead the intelligence community in place of Joseph Maguire after becoming angry last week-when he learned that a U.S.-intelligence official had told-lawmakers that Russia wants to see him reelected, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Grenell has moved quickly to concentrate power within the intelligence agencies. Maguire's deputy, Andrew P. Hallman, resigned Friday. Grenell hired Kash Patel, a National Security Council aide who has worked in the past to cast doubt on the FBI's investigation into Russian election interference. Grenell has requested access to information from the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies, the New York Times reported, citing two-people familiar with the matter. 
The moves reflect the skeptical view the president has had of-the intelligence community after his campaign's links to Russia were investigated and several of his associates were prosecuted.
The anger extends beyond the intelligence agencies, and Trump has also called for law enforcement officials who investigated his campaign to be investigated or prosecuted. Even some Trump allies are feeling heat over not being aggressive enough about taking on the president's perceived enemies.
At a donor roundtable Tuesday at the Montage Hotel in Los Angeles, one participant pointedly questioned Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) on why he was not holding accountable people who were responsible for the Russia investigation.
'I see you on Fox News every night, and then you do nothing about it. What are you going to do about it?' the donor asked, according to an attendee. 
'What a fantastic question!' Trump said.
Meanwhile, administration officials are conducting a search for the 'Anonymous' author of a tell-all book about Trump titled 'A Warning,' according to White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who told CNN on Friday that the search had become a 'vocation with everybody.' 
McEntee, who lost his job in 2018 over concerns about his online gambling, has long expressed an interest in the personnel office despite having no previous government experience, two administration officials said. Within the West Wing, he is seen as fiercely devoted to the president and is well liked by first lady Melania Trump, the officials said. 
Some within the White House have bristled at his lack of experience and aggressive approach to ferreting out 'Never Trumpers.'
McEntee 'does not have the relevant experience to do this job, unless the job is to purge Never Trumpers and reward loyalists,' one official said.
Another senior administration official countered that McEntee was talented and up to the task, with the key qualification of having the president's confidence. 
As he gears up for the reelection contest, Trump has moved to surround himself with longtime allies who have proved their devotion to him while pushing away those who have not earned his trust. 
This month, Trump rehired Hope Hicks, one of his longest-serving aides and closest confidants.
During a podcast interview last week, Trump concurred when Fox News analyst Geraldo Rivera described the White House as 'a nest of vipers and snitches and backstabbers and rats.'
'I inherited a place with, you know, many different administrations, and they worked there for years and were civil service and with unions and all of it,' he said on Rivera's 'Roadkill' podcast. 'You can't do what you'd like to do.'

Many have never given before; others sat out 2016 general election

Dan Costa, who runs four apparel companies in Northern California, was never a major political donor. But last year, he made a large contribution to the GOP for the first time: $37,500 in hopes of four more years of President Trump. 
'That's a big investment for anybody,' said Costa, whose only other contribution to a presidential candidate was $1,000 to Mitt Romney in 2012. 'It's like insurance that is going to help save the country. . . . It's for me and my grandkids and the next generations.'

Trump's vaunted political money machine is helping drive record sums to the Republican National Committee, and not just from the same donors who supported him in 2016. Enticed by exclusive gatherings and ecstatic about the president's tax cuts, an eclectic new crop of donors is going all in, giving five and six figures to support his reelection.
Their ranks include investors in a South Florida hot yoga studio, a Ni ger ian American real estate developer in Dallas and the head of a trucking business in Los Angeles. They have been joined by veteran GOP donors who have returned to the fold after sitting out Trump's 2016 campaign. 

The Washington Post identified at least 220 big donors to Trump's reelection who are either new to major political giving or sat out the last presidential general election. Together, they have deluged pro-Trump fundraising committees with more than $21-million "" a cash infusion that suggests a newfound enthusiasm for the president among supporters capable of writing large checks.

The influx of these donors represents a shift for Trump, who criticized other candidates' reliance on wealthy backers during the 2016 election. This time, his campaign is actively wooing them, holding glitzy fundraisers that give people who donate large amounts a chance to mingle with his inner circle and often snap pictures with Trump himself.
Trump's take-all-comers approach this time has brought in donors with various agendas "" creating legal headaches at times. Among those newly motivated to give large sums were Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman "" characters in the impeachment saga whose contributions to pro-Trump committees in the hundreds of thousands helped them quickly insert themselves into Trump's orbit. They face campaign finance charges partly related to a six-figure donation they made to a super PAC.
And Robert Hyde, a Parnas associate who claimed to be tracking a U.S. ambassador disliked by Trump, has donated more than $41,000 since 2016 to the various pro-Trump committees, records show. Hyde, a long-shot congressional candidate in Connecticut, has said he was not particularly interested in politics before Trump. In recent days, he has denied monitoring the former ambassador to Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Trump is now also supported by a more traditional source of party money: longtime GOP donors who shunned him during his 2016 campaign. By and large, those wealthy establishment donors have fallen in line behind Trump's reelection, said Lisa Spies, a longtime Republican fundraiser.
Among those now on board are Dan and Farris Wilks, billionaire brothers who made their money in the fracking industry in Texas. They supported Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) in the 2016 primary race, then held back on support for Trump in the general election. But so far, they have given a combined $100,000 toward the president's reelection.
'There are very few 'Never Trumpers' [continuing to hold back support], and there are very few donors who are disengaged,' Spies said. Additionally, she said, Trump 'has a whole new crop of donors. A lot of these people have never been involved before.' 


Many first-time big donors contacted by The Post were enthusiastic boosters of Trump who said they were 
moved to give by the president's tax cuts, his deregulation agenda and their confidence in the economy.
They expressed trust in Trump's decision-making and shared his indignation over Democratic attacks. They viewed their contribution as an investment "" not just in the country's future but in their own personal prosperity.
Several donors said they do not love everything the president tweets but find him authentic and relatable.
'Sometimes I'm like, why did he do that? But at the same time, you've got to remember, he's not a polished politician,' said Raul Esqueda, who gave $35,000 to support Trump's reelection. 
Esqueda, who runs a commercial credit company in Austin and says business is booming under Trump, said he does not feel tied to a party. He said he preferred Mitt Romney over Barack Obama for president in 2012 but does not feel particularly enthusiastic about the Utah senator now.
Esqueda's newfound giving earned him an invite to the 2019 White House Christmas party.
'To visit the White House, that's cool,' Esqueda said. 'You get to see all the paintings around. They have hors d'oeuvres and drinks, music. Overall, it was a nice get-together. . . . We got a lot of photographs.'
Since Trump's election, more than 1.6-million new donors have contributed to the Republican Party, in both large and small amounts, party officials said. 
It remains to be seen whether these donors will continue to give in such large amounts to the Republican Party or drop off once Trump leaves office. 
'You have a group of individuals in the country who are big supporters and big believers of the president that, much like we saw in the 2016 election, are unique to him,' said Brian O. Walsh, president of the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action, which is attracting many of these donors. 'That's the magnet that attracts them to want to participate at a higher level than ever before.'
Democrats are taking note of the amounts of money flowing to the Trump reelection effort. 

Democratic strategists said Trump's ability to raise and spend massive sums from big donors to Trump Victory "" a joint fundraising committee that is drawing these new contributors "" is similar to the money advantage that Obama had in his reelection battle against Romney. With the exception of the billionaires in the 2020 Democratic race, the eventual nominee will probably need a financial boost in the general election fight against Trump.
'The [2020 Democratic] nominee will be broke, as Romney was against us,' said Jim Messina, Obama's 2012 reelection campaign manager. 'One point to look at is how much money Trump and the [joint committees] are raising. I have never seen spending like it. And it's a lot on rallies, which are expensive and speak to the base.' 

The parent company of SOL Yoga in Fort Lauderdale and Miami, which donated $100,000 to America First Action in 2019, did not respond to requests for comment. Yu Kevin Guan, a trucking company owner who donated $235,000 to Trump Victory, also did not respond to a request for comment. Both were first-time donors under Trump.
Some new donors have rapidly immersed themselves in the mix-and-mingle world of private fundraisers and 'donor appreciation' events. 
GOP fundraisers said offering such perks to new donors comes at a lower cost, because they are new to the experience. Established GOP donors have already attended marquee events such as the State of the Union address or have had private meals with previous presidential nominees. 
But new donors enjoy even modest gatherings, like a panel featuring a Cabinet member or drinks in the lobby of Trump's hotel in Washington, strategists say. Their social media feeds often include selfies with Trump loyalists and influencers, such as former White House press secretary Sean Spicer and Andre Soriano, designer of 'Make America Great Again' gowns.

At last month's winter retreat for Trump Victory donors, for example, guests socialized with Trump's family members, campaign manager Brad Parscale, Fox News's Jeanine Pirro, Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and other major figures in Trump's orbit, according to social media posts of attendees. 

Many new donors have in turn become fundraisers for Trump, recruiting people they know to give as well. 
Xinyue 'Daniel' Lou, who gave his first major donation of more than $37,000 to Trump Victory in 2017, said he felt valued when party officials described him as an 'investor' in the Republican Party. And so, he said, he urged other well-to-do people in the Chinese American community to give to Trump. Many, he said, had never been tapped by a political party before and were intrigued by Trump's presidency.

'I was privileged to be invited to a number of events' for donors, including ones where he met top White House officials and members of the Cabinet, Lou said. 'Because of my political contribution and involvement, I was in those seats and I was able to have my input.' 
Ejike Okpa, a Ni ger ian American commercial real estate developer in Dallas who started a PAC called Africans for MAGA, gave his first major political donations to Trump's reelection: $35,000 in 2017 and $10,000 in 2018. He has always preferred nontraditional candidates, he said "" he gave $250 to Obama in 2008 "" and he likes that Trump is a fighter and disrupter in Washington. 
Okpa is now a bundler for Trump Victory and boasts a collection of selfies with the president's family, a signed copy of Donald Trump Jr.'s book and an autographed thumbs-up photo with Trump. 
'What he stands for, the way he has approached doing things for America, just kind of intrigues me,' Okpa said. 'I vote, but when you match that with a financial contribution, it's an additional show of support and commitment.'

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday accused an NPR reporter of lying about whether a conversation he initiated with her had been deemed off the record, a charge that NPR denied.
Pompeo's statement, however, did not address NPR's explosive account of the conversation "" that he shouted at reporter Mary Louise Kelly, used expletives, indicated that she had questioned him about Ukraine under false pretenses in a just-completed interview, and asked her, 'Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?'
The exchange came as Pompeo, President Trump's longest-serving and closest senior adviser on national security, has been criticized for his conduct related to both Ukraine and Iran and his disregard for congressional and media questions about it.
In a statement, Pompeo called the NPR episode 'another example of how unhinged the media has become in its quest to hurt President Trump and this Administration.' 
Known for his bombast during three terms as a congressman from Kansas, Pompeo has had an increasingly rocky relationship with the news media, sometimes snapping at journalists and refusing to address questions he has labeled, among other things, 'ridiculous' and 'ludicrous.'

A major reason the president values Pompeo is because the secretary 'doesn't give an inch' in public statements and interviews, said a senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Pompeo rarely lets any criticism of the president or his policies go uncontested, and he is aware that Trump closely monitors his words.
But he has grown increasingly testy as his own conduct has been questioned. Senior Foreign Service officers, in sworn impeachment testimony, and many other current and former State Department officials, have charged that Pompeo has shown little loyalty to the department he leads, and its employees, in the face of Trump's attacks on them.
On Friday, at the end of an interview that focused largely on Iran, Kelly asked whether Pompeo owed the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, 'an apology' for failing to defend her when the president ordered her fired last spring.
Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani and his consultant on Ukraine, Lev Parnas, told Trump that Yovanovitch had bad-mouthed him to Ukrainian officials, and that she had obstructed their efforts to push Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. They have said they urged the president to get rid of her.
During a call from the department in May, Yovanovitch was told, without explanation, to depart on the next flight out of Kyiv. Trump then denigrated her in a July telephone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, saying that she was 'bad news' and that 'she's going to go through some things.'
Yovanovitch, a respected career diplomat, denied the charges against her in sworn testimony during the House impeachment inquiry. She said she was 'incredulous' that her superiors decided to remove her based on 'unfounded and false claims by people with clearly questionable motives,' including Giuliani's associates in Ukraine, who could have been threatened financially by her anti-corruption efforts there. She said Pompeo's then-deputy, John Sullivan, assured her she had done nothing wrong but said she had lost Trump's confidence.
Former senior Pompeo adviser Michael McKinley testified that Pompeo rejected repeated internal requests to publicly come to Yovanovitch's defense, and that he resigned his post over her treatment. 
In response to Kelly's question about Yovanovitch, Pompeo insisted that 'I agreed to come on your show today to talk about Iran,' an assertion the NPR reporter disputed, saying she had told his staff she would ask about Iran and Ukraine. When Kelly persisted with questions about Yovanovitch, Pompeo said, 'I have defended every person on this team.'
The interview then ended quickly. Pompeo, NPR reported Friday, 'stood, leaned in and silently glared at Kelly for several seconds before leaving the room.'
'A few moments later,' NPR reported, 'an aide asked Kelly to follow her into Pompeo's private living room at the State Department without a recorder. The aide did not say the ensuing exchange would be off the record.' The term is widely understood to mean that the conversation cannot be reported in any way.
On the Friday evening broadcast, Kelly said, 'I was taken to the secretary's private living room, where he was waiting and where he shouted at me for about the same amount of time as the interview itself. He was not happy to have been questioned about Ukraine.'
'He asked, 'Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?' He used the f-word in that sentence and many others. He asked if I could find Ukraine on a map. I said yes, and he called out for aides to bring us a map of the world with no writing. I pointed to Ukraine. He put the map away,' Kelly said.
'He said, 'People will hear about this,'-' she said.
In his written statement released Saturday morning, Pompeo said, 'Kelly lied to me, twice. First, last month, in setting up our interview, and then again yesterday, in agreeing to have our post-interview conversation off the record. It is shameful that this reporter chose to violate the basic rules of journalism and decency. This is another example of how unhinged the media has become in its quest to hurt President Trump and this Administration. It is no wonder that the American people distrust many in the media when they so consistently demonstrate their agenda and their absence of integrity.'
'It is worth noting that Bangladesh is NOT Ukraine,' Pompeo wrote.
In that final sentence, Pompeo seemed to imply that Kelly, who has worked extensively overseas and has a master's degree in European studies from Cambridge University, got her geography wrong.
Nancy Barnes, NPR's senior vice president for news, said in a subsequent statement that Kelly 'has always conducted herself with the utmost integrity, and we stand behind this report.'
The State Department did not respond to repeated requests for clarification of Pompeo's statement.
Democrats in Congress have charged Pompeo with failing to respond to requests for documents on Ukraine and other matters. On Friday, Rep. Eliot L. Engel (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the State Department had again failed to meet a deadline, this time in response to a Jan.-15 request to turn over 'records related to a potential threat' to Yovanovitch's security.
The request referenced recently released text messages between Parnas and Robert F. Hyde, a Republican congressional candidate from New York, implying that Yovanovitch was under surveillance in Kyiv. Engel had asked for a response by Thursday.
In a letter to Pompeo on Saturday, Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and four other senior Democratic senators excoriated the secretary for his NPR statement.
'At a time when journalists around the world are being jailed for their reporting . . . your insulting and contemptuous comments are beneath the office of the Secretary of State,' they wrote. 'Instead of calling journalists 'liars' and insulting their intelligence when they ask you hard questions you would rather not answer, your oath of office places on you a duty and obligation to engage respectfully and transparently.'

Shadow effort sought 
to ease out Venezuela's socialist president 

The international call came in September 2018, after months of rising tension between the United States and Venezuela, a key strategic player in South America.
On one end of the line was Venezuela's socialist president, the pariah leader of a disintegrating economy whom President Trump's administration was seeking to isolate.
On the other end: the U.S. president's personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani and then-Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.). 
Both were part of a shadow diplomatic effort, backed in part by private interests, aimed at engineering a negotiated exit to ease President Nicolás Maduro from power and reopen resource-rich Venezuela to business, according to people familiar with the endeavor.
Sessions had served as emissary in the back-channel effort, visiting Maduro in Caracas that spring. The phone call, which Giuliani joined, was a follow-up to that visit, Sessions's spokesman Matt Mackowiak told The Washington Post.
The phone conversation involving the Venezuelan president and Trump's personal lawyer, which has not been previously reported, provides another example of how Giuliani used his private role to insert himself into foreign diplomacy, alarming administration officials confused about whose interests he was representing.
Giuliani operated a similar campaign this year in Ukraine, where he pressured officials to announce investigations to benefit Trump "" an endeavor that led to the president's impeachment this month.

The impeachment inquiry pushed into the spotlight consulting work Giuliani has undertaken around the globe even as he has been representing Trump at no charge. His freelancing has triggered concerns among White House officials that his intercessions have muddied and at times undercut official U.S. policy, according to people familiar with the worries, who, like others cited in this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions. Meanwhile, federal prosecutors are scrutinizing the former New York mayor as part of an investigation into possible foreign lobbying violations.
Word of Giuliani's call with Maduro eventually reached White House officials who did not know why he was involved, according to one former senior administration official. 

Giuliani's willingness to talk with Maduro in late 2018 flew in the face of the official policy of the White House, which, under national security adviser John Bolton, was then ratcheting up sanctions and taking a harder line against the Venezuelan government.
Around the time of the phone call, Giuliani met with Bolton to discuss the off-the-books plan to ease Maduro from office "" a plan Bolton vehemently rejected, two people familiar with the meeting said. 
Giuliani did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A lawyer for Bolton declined to comment. The White House did not respond to requests for comment.
In January 2019, the United States formally recognized Maduro's rival Juan Guaidó as president, a policy move backed by Bolton. Later in the year, Giuliani would pick up a client in the region: a Venezuelan tycoon under investigation by the Justice Department for possible money-laundering. 

It is not clear why Giuliani became involved in the back-channel negotiations with Venezuela's president or the extent of his role. But the tale of behind-the-scenes talks with Maduro offers another example in which the president's personal attorney aligned with private interests to try to sway U.S. foreign policy. And the episode involves some of the figures who played a role in the Ukraine effort "" including Sessions, an 11-term congressman who pushed for the ouster of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine around the time he met with Giuliani associate Lev Parnas in 2018.


Sessions, who lost his seat that November and is now running for Congress in another Texas district, said through his spokesman that he has known Giuliani for three decades but has never worked with him on any private-sector activities. 

Back-channel mission
When Trump took office, he promised to take a tougher stand against Maduro, who has been Venezuela's president since the 2013 death of leader Hugo Chávez and has grown increasingly repressive, even as his country has sunk into economic crisis.
That approach had the backing of Republicans in Florida, which has large and politically engaged Venezuelan and Cuban communities. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) accused then-President Barack Obama of failing to hold Maduro accountable and of naively pursuing negotiations that failed to remove him from office.
Trump's personal interest in the country was piqued by a February 2017 White House visit by Lilian Tintori, the wife of a prominent Venezuelan political prisoner. She was also a former kite-surfing champion who had appeared in that country's version of the reality show 'Survivor.'
Trump quickly adopted Venezuela as a cause, surprising some in the human rights community, who noted that he did not show similar interest in abuses in countries such as North Korea and Russia.
That year, the Trump administration labeled Venezuela's vice president a drug kingpin and froze his assets in the United States. It also imposed economic sanctions on Venezuelan companies and banned travel to the United States by government officials and their families. 
'This corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere it has been tried,' Trump declared before the U.N. General Assembly in September 2017. 'To make matters worse, Maduro has defied his own people, stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule.'
Conditions worsened in Venezuela, where there were frequent shortages of basic goods including food and medicine, runaway inflation and spates of civil unrest. But Maduro remained in power.
In February 2018, Maduro announced that a presidential election would be held that spring. But most opposition candidates would be banned from running, leading to fears that the vote would be a sham election used to consolidate his power. 

U.S. business executives with interests in Venezuela "" among them Harry Sargeant III, the chief executive of a Florida-based global energy and shipping company who has worked extensively in the country "" began encouraging negotiations to ease Maduro out of office.
In a statement, Sargeant said he 'supported the idea of a back channel based on my over 30 years of firsthand experience in Venezuela and my observation of the political dynamic going on in Caracas at the time.'
'I believed then and now that an adversarial sanctions policy alone would have two profoundly negative effects,' he added. 'First, it would exacerbate Venezuela's humanitarian crisis. Second, I believed it would undermine key U.S. business interests in Venezuela to the benefit of American adversaries like the Russians and Chinese.'
It was against this backdrop that Mackowiak said Sessions accepted an invitation from Maduro to quietly visit Caracas and try to negotiate a path to improved relations between the United States and Venezuela.
Sessions, a former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee who chaired the House Rules Committee at the time, had long been interested in Venezuela, in part because many of his Texas constituents had energy interests there, according to his spokesman. 



'He was pleased to help with this back-channel mission, which was coordinated with the highest levels of the U.S. State Department,' Mackowiak said, adding that Sessions met with top U.S. officials before and after his trip. 
The State Department did not respond to requests for comment.
But people familiar with State Department officials' role said those officials did not initiate the trip or organize or participate in Sessions's meeting with Maduro. And several U.S. officials disputed the notion that the trip was done with the government's backing, noting that the White House at the time wanted to take a harder line with Maduro and was not interested in making concessions. 
National Security Council officials, in particular, were opposed to the kind of settlement with Maduro that Sessions was advocating. 
'There was absolutely no interest or appetite for negotiations,' said a former White House official. 'We generally did not welcome efforts like this one. It wasn't consistent with our policy goals. We saw it as a nuisance and a distraction.'
Sessions's spokesman dismissed such complaints as part of a 'turf battle' among Washington bureaucrats. 
'There might have been a disagreement between the State Department and the NSC about how best to bring peace to Venezuela,' Mackowiak said. 'But Rep. Sessions was pleased to be part of an effort, coordinated closely with the State Department, to bring a democratically elected president to Venezuela.'

List of concessions
Sessions's district is home to ExxonMobil and other oil companies that were once active in Venezuela but were forced to scale back amid political turbulence. But Sessions told the Dallas Morning News in 2018 that the oil interests did not play a role in his decision to become involved. He said he had been working with various players, including representatives of the Venezuelan opposition, to negotiate a solution for more than a year.
Sessions told the newspaper he was working to foster 'dialogue between parties that are trying to make progress.'
Mackowiak said Sessions used his own money to pay for the two-day trip. 
Two people with knowledge of the visit said he was hosted by Raúl Gorrín Belisario, the owner of a major television network in Venezuela who was viewed with distrust by some U.S. officials and months later would be indicted in Florida on charges of money-laundering and bribery. 
The people said that rather than staying in a U.S. facility, Sessions stayed at Gorrín's lavish, modernist, walled compound in a fashionable part of the capital. 

Mackowiak said that Sessions's trip, including where Sessions stayed, was coordinated with State Department officials. 


Sessions left Caracas with a list of concessions that had been agreed to by Maduro "" his departure from power and a commitment to allow free and fair elections in exchange for leniency from the United States "" according to Mackowiak. 
But some U.S. officials said they worried that the deal Sessions was floating was intended to legitimize the upcoming election by opening up the vote to at least some opposition candidates, which could help Maduro remain in power, rather than ease him from office, according to a person familiar with the conversations. And they were concerned that the back-channel overtures sent mixed messages to the Maduro government.


A cigar bar meeting
About five weeks after returning from Caracas, Sessions met in his Capitol Hill office with Parnas, who Mackowiak said wanted to discuss a proposal to sell liquefied natural gas in Ukraine. 
In an indictment this fall charging Parnas and his business partner Igor Fruman with illegally channeling foreign money into U.S. election campaign accounts, federal prosecutors said Parnas sought Sessions's assistance in ousting then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch at the behest of 'one or more Ukrainian government officials.'
On May 9, the same day that Parnas posted photos of his meeting with Sessions on Facebook, the congressman sent Secretary of State Mike Pompeo a letter urging Yovanovitch's removal.
Mackowiak said Sessions did not act at the request of Parnas but wrote the letter after hearing concerns about the ambassador from several members of Congress who had traveled to Ukraine. 
Meanwhile, in Venezuela, Maduro won reelection in May with nearly 68 percent of the vote. The international community largely rejected the vote because of allegations of fraud and the banning of key opposition parties, and civil unrest ensued as Maduro prepared to begin another term.

In August, U.S. prosecutors charged Gorrín, Sessions's host for the congressman's Venezuela visit, with participating in a $1 billion money-laundering and bribery scheme. Prosecutors have said Gorrín is a fugitive. Neither Gorrín nor his Miami-based lawyer responded to requests for comment. 
Around that time, Giuliani, who had joined Trump's legal team months earlier, began talks with individuals who were part of the back channel to Maduro. In August, Giuliani met in New York with Parnas and two American business executives with investments in Venezuela to discuss the effort, according to people familiar with the gathering.
The meeting took place at a favorite Giuliani hangout, the Grand Havana Room cigar bar, blocks from Trump Tower in Manhattan. Over whiskey and cigars, Giuliani agreed to try to discern whether there was a way to negotiate with Maduro and perhaps reach a diplomatic solution to the political chaos and economic collapse overtaking the country, one of the participants said.
The phone call
About a month later, Maduro was on the phone with Sessions. In the room with the Venezuelan president at the time was the country's first lady, who serves as a close adviser to her husband, as well as Venezuela's vice president and information minister, according to a person familiar with the conversation. 
Giuliani was introduced at the beginning of the call but appeared mostly to listen as Maduro and Sessions spoke, Mackowiak said.
In the nearly hour-long conversation, they reviewed the concessions that Maduro had agreed to make during Sessions's visit months earlier, according to the person familiar with the call.
The Communications Ministry of Venezuela did not respond to a request for comment.
Later, word filtered to the White House that Giuliani and Sessions had participated in a call with Maduro, causing confusion, said a former senior administration official. 
'We didn't know why Rudy was involved at the time,' the person said. 
Not long after the call, Giuliani told some of his associates that he had taken the idea of a soft landing for Maduro to Bolton, the president's national security adviser. But he said the meeting had not gone well, according to people familiar with his account.
Charles Cooper, a lawyer for Bolton, declined to comment.
Bolton's distaste for Giuliani's foreign policy freelancing emerged during the impeachment inquiry. Former national security official Fiona Hill testified that Bolton warned her not to interact with the president's lawyer, calling him 'a hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up.'
In January of this year, the situation in Venezuela disintegrated as Maduro prepared to be formally inaugurated for another term. The legislature, led by Maduro's opposition, declared that the election had been illegitimate and named legislative leader Guaidó the nation's new president. He was quickly recognized by the United States and dozens of other countries.
Some Venezuelan business leaders who had amassed vast wealth under Maduro but had been severely constrained by U.S. sanctions switched sides and began to assist Guaidó.
Among them was Gorrín, who played a key role in a failed effort to persuade the nation's Supreme Court to recognize Guaidó over Maduro, part of an effort to curry favor with the Americans, as The Post has reported.
 This summer, another wealthy Venezuelan energy executive, Alejandro Betancourt López, hired Giuliani to serve as his lawyer and help argue that he should not be charged in a $1.2 billion money-laundering case in Florida. 
Eight men "" including Betancourt's cousin "" have already been charged in the case, which alleges that top officials of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, business leaders and bankers conspired to steal money from the company and then launder it through Miami real estate purchases and other investment schemes. Two people familiar with the matter said that Betancourt is referred to in the criminal complaint as a uncharged co-conspirator.
Jon Sale, a Miami-based lawyer representing Betancourt, has said his client denies any wrongdoing. He declined to comment on Betancourt's relationship with Giuliani.
In early August, Giuliani was hosted at Betancourt's lavish estate outside Madrid when Giuliani met at Trump's direction with a top aide to the Ukrainian president, as The Post previously reported. 
Giuliani later met with Justice Department officials and urged them not to charge Betancourt, The Post reported.
In response to questions about his work for Betancourt, Giuliani wrote in a text message last month: 'This is attorney client privilege so I will withstand whatever malicious lies or spin you put on it.'
The news that Giuliani was representing the wealthy energy executive before the administration while also serving as the president's personal attorney disturbed veteran U.S. officials who have experience in Venezuela.
'You have to ask, 'Why is he doing this?' ' said one former senior administration official.

Two kindergartners in Utah told a Latino boy that President Trump would send him back to Mexico, and teenagers in Maine sneered 'Ban Muslims' at a classmate wearing a hijab. In Tennessee, a group of middle-schoolers linked arms, imitating the president's proposed border wall as they refused to let nonwhite students pass. In Ohio, another group of middle-schoolers surrounded a mixed-race sixth-grader and, as she confided to her mother, told the girl: 'This is Trump country.'

Since Trump's rise to the nation's highest office, his inflammatory language "" often condemned as racist and xenophobic "" has seeped into schools across America. Many bullies now target other children differently than they used to, with kids as young as 6 mimicking the president's insults and the cruel way he delivers them.

Trump's words, those chanted by his followers at campaign rallies and even his last name have been wielded by students and school staff members to harass children more than 300 times since the start of 2016, a Washington Post review of 28,000 news stories found. At least three-quarters of the attacks were directed at kids who are Hispanic, black or Muslim, according to the analysis. Students also have been victimized because they support the president "" more than 45 times during the same period.
Although many hateful episodes garnered coverage just after the election, The Post found that Trump-connected persecution of children has never stopped. Even without the huge total from November 2016, an average of nearly two incidents per school week have been publicly reported over the past four years. Still, because so much of the bullying never appears in the news, The Post's figure represents a small fraction of the actual total. It also doesn't include the thousands of slurs, swastikas and racial epithets that aren't directly linked to Trump but that the president's detractors argue his behavior has exacerbated.
'It's gotten way worse since Trump got elected,' said Ashanty Bonilla, 17, a Mexican American high school junior in Idaho who faced so much ridicule from classmates last year that she transferred. 'They hear it. They think it's okay. The president says it. . . . Why can't they?'
Asked about Trump's effect on student behavior, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham noted that first lady Melania Trump "" whose 'Be Best' campaign denounces online harassment "" had encouraged kids worldwide to treat one another with respect.

'She knows that bullying is a universal problem for children that will be difficult to stop in its entirety,' Grisham wrote in an email, 'but Mrs. Trump will continue her work on behalf of the next generation despite the media's appetite to blame her for actions and situations outside of her control.'
Most schools don't track the Trump bullying phenomenon, and researchers didn't ask about it in a federal survey of 6,100 students in 2017, the most recent year with available data. One in five of those children, ages 12 to 18, reported being bullied at school, a rate unchanged since the previous count in 2015.
However, a 2016 online survey of over 10,000 kindergarten through 12th-grade educators by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that more than 2,500 'described specific incidents of bigotry and harassment that can be directly traced to election rhetoric,' although the overwhelming majority never made the news. In 476 cases, offenders used the phrase 'build the wall.' In 672, they mentioned deportation.

For Cielo Castor, who is Mexican American, the experience at Kamiakin High in Kennewick, Wash., was searing. The day after the election, a friend told Cielo, then a sophomore, that he was glad Trump won because Mexicans were stealing American jobs. A year later, when the president was mentioned during her American literature course, she said she didn't support him and a classmate who did refused to sit next to her.
''I don't want to be around her,' ' Cielo recalled him announcing as he opted for the floor instead.
Then, on 'America night' at a football game in October 2018 during Cielo's senior year, schoolmates in the student section unfurled a 'Make America Great Again' flag. Led by the boy who wouldn't sit beside Cielo, the teenagers began to chant: 'Build "" the "" wall!'
Horrified, she confronted the instigator.
'You can't be doing that,' Cielo told him.
He ignored her, she recalled, and the teenagers around him booed her. A cheerleading coach was the lone adult who tried to make them stop.

After a photo of the teenagers with the flag appeared on social media, news about what had happened infuriated many of the school's Latinos, who made up about a quarter of the 1,700-member student body. Cielo, then 17, hoped school officials would address the tension. When they didn't, she attended that Wednesday's school board meeting.
'I don't feel cared for,' she told the members, crying.

A day later, the superintendent consoled her and the principal asked how he could help, recalled Cielo, now a college freshman. Afterward, school staff members addressed every class, but Hispanic students were still so angry that they organized a walkout.
Some students heckled the protesters, waving MAGA caps at them. At the end of the day, Cielo left the school with a white friend who'd attended the protest; they passed an underclassman she didn't know.
'Look,' the boy said, 'it's one of those f---ing Mexicans.'
She heard that school administrators "" who declined to be interviewed for this article "" suspended the teenager who had led the chant, but she doubts he has changed.
Reached on Instagram, the teenager refused to talk about what happened, writing in a message that he didn't want to discuss the incident 'because it is in the past and everyone has moved on from it.' At the end, he added a sign-off: 'Trump 2020.'



Just as the president has repeatedly targeted Latinos, so, too, have school bullies. Of the incidents The Post tallied, half targeted Hispanics.
In one of the most extreme cases of abuse, a 13-year-old in New Jersey told a Mexican American schoolmate, who was 12, that 'all Mexicans should go back behind the wall.' A day later, on June 19, 2019, the 13-year-old assaulted the boy and his mother, Beronica Ruiz, punching him and beating her unconscious, said the family's attorney, Daniel Santiago. He wonders to what extent Trump's repeated vilification of certain minorities played a role.

'When the president goes on TV and is saying things like Mexicans are rapists, Mexicans are criminals "" these children don't have the cognitive ability to say, 'He's just playing the role of a politician,'-' Santiago argued. 'The language that he's using matters.'
Ruiz's son, who is now seeing a therapist, continues to endure nightmares from an experience that may take years to overcome. But experts say that discriminatory language can, on its own, harm children, especially those of color who may already feel marginalized.
'It causes grave damage, as much physical as psychological,' said Elsa Barajas, who has counseled more than 1,000 children in her job at the Los Angeles Department of Mental Health.
As a result, she has seen Hispanic students suffer from sleeplessness, lose interest in school, and experience inexplicable stomach pain and headaches.
For Ashanty Bonilla, the damage began with the response to a single tweet she shared 10 months ago.
'Unpopular opinion,' Ashanty, then 16 and a sophomore at Lewiston High School in rural Idaho, wrote on April 9. 'People who support Trump and go to Mexico for vacation really piss me off. Sorry not sorry.'

A schoolmate, who is white, took a screen shot of her tweet and posted it to Snapchat, along with a Confederate flag.
'Unpopular opinion but: people that are from Mexico and come in to America illegally or at all really piss me off,' he added in a message that spread rapidly among students.
The next morning, as Ashanty arrived at school, half a dozen boys, including the one who had written the message, stood nearby.
'You're illegal. Go back to Mexico,' she heard one of them say. 'F--- Mexicans.'
Ashanty, shaken but silent, walked past as a friend yelled at the boys to shut up.
In a 33,000-person town that is 94-percent white, Ashanty, whose father is half-black and whose mother is Mexican American, had always worked to fit in. She attended every football game and won a school spirit award as a freshman. She straightened her hair and dyed it blond, hoping to look more like her friends.

She had known those boys who'd heckled her since they were little. For her 15th birthday the year before, some had danced at her quinceañera.
A friend drove her off campus for lunch, but when they pulled back into the parking lot, Ashanty spotted people standing around her car. A rope had been tied from the back of the Honda Pilot to a pickup truck.
'Republican Trump 2020,' someone had written in the dust on her back window.
Hands trembling, Ashanty tried to untie the rope but couldn't. She heard the laughing, sensed the cellphone cameras pointed at her. She began to weep.
Lewiston's principal, Kevin Driskill, said he and his staff met with the boys they knew were involved, making clear that 'we have zero tolerance for any kind of actions like that.' The incidents, he suspected, stemmed mostly from ignorance.

'Our lack of diversity probably comes with a lack of understanding,' Driskill said, but he added that he's encouraged by the school district's recent creation of a community group "" following racist incidents on other campuses "" meant to address those issues.
That effort came too late for Ashanty.
Some friends supported her, but others told her the boys were just joking. Don't ruin their lives.
She seldom attended classes the last month of school. That summer, she started having migraines and panic attacks. In August, amid her spiraling despair, Ashanty swallowed 27 pills from a bottle of antidepressants. A helicopter rushed her to a hospital in Spokane, Wash., 100 miles away.
After that, she began seeing a therapist and, along with the friend who defended her, transferred to another school. Sometimes, she imagines how different life might be had she never written that tweet, but Ashanty tries not to blame herself and has learned to take more pride in her heritage. She just wishes the president understood the harm his words inflict.
Even Trump's last name has become something of a slur to many children of color, whether they've heard it shouted at them in hallways or, in her case, seen it written on the back window of a car.
'It means,' she said, 'you don't belong.'
Three weeks into the 2018-19 school year, Miracle Slover's English teacher, she alleges, ordered black and Hispanic students to sit in the back of the classroom at their Fort Worth high school.
At the time, Miracle was a junior. Georgia Clark, her teacher at Amon Carter-Riverside, often brought up Trump, Miracle said. He was a good person, she told the class, because he wanted to build a wall.
'Every day was something new with immigration,' said Miracle, now 18, who has a black mother and a mixed-race father. 'That Trump needs to take [immigrants] away. They do drugs, they bring drugs over here. They cause violence.'
Some students tried to film Clark, and others complained to administrators, but none of it made a difference, Miracle said. Clark, an employee of the Fort Worth system since 1998, kept talking.

Clark, who denies the teenager's allegations, is one of more than 30 educators across the country accused of using the president's name or rhetoric to harass students since he announced his candidacy, the Post analysis found. 
In Clark's class, Miracle stayed quiet until late spring 2019. That day, she walked in wearing her hair 'puffy,' split into two high buns.
Clark, she said, told her it looked 'nappy, like Marge off 'The Simpsons.' ' Unable to smother an angry reply, Miracle landed in the principal's office. An administrator asked her to write a witness statement, and in it, she finally let go, scrawling her frustration across seven pages.
'I just got tired of it,' she said. 'I wrote a ton.'
Still, Miracle said, school officials took no action until six weeks later, when Clark, 69, tweeted at Trump "" in what she thought were private messages "" requesting help deporting undocumented immigrants in Fort Worth schools. The posts went viral, drawing national condemnation. Clark was fired.

Not always, though, are offenders removed from the classroom.
The day after the 2016 election, Donnie Jones Jr.'s daughter was walking down a hallway at her Florida high school when, she says, a teacher warned her and two friends "" all sophomores, all black "" that Trump would 'send you back to Africa.'
The district suspended the teacher for three days and transferred him to another school.
Just a few days later in California, a physical education teacher told a student that he would be deported under Trump. Two years ago in Maine, a substitute teacher referenced the president's wall and promised a Lebanese American student, 'You're getting kicked out of my country.' More than a year later in Texas, a school employee flashed a coin bearing the word 'ICE' at a Hispanic student. 'Trump,' he said, 'is working on a law where he can deport you.'
Sometimes, Jones said, he doesn't recognize America.

'People now will say stuff that a couple of years ago they would not dare say,' Jones argued. He fears what his two youngest children, ages 11 and 9, might hear in their school hallways, especially if Trump is reelected.
Now a senior, Miracle doesn't regret what she wrote about Clark. Although the furor that followed forced Miracle to switch schools and quit her beloved dance team, she would do it again, she said. Clark's punishment, her public disgrace, was worth it.
About a week before Miracle's 18th birthday, her mother checked Facebook to find a flurry of notifications. Friends were messaging to say that Clark had appealed her firing, and that the Texas education commissioner had intervened.
Reluctant to spoil the birthday, Jowona Powell waited several days to tell her daughter, who doesn't use social media.
Citing a minor misstep in the school board's firing process, the commissioner had ordered Carter-Riverside to pay Clark one year's salary "" or give the former teacher her job back.



Jordyn Covington stood when she heard the jeers.
'Monkeys!' 'You don't belong here.' 'Go back to where you came from!'
From atop the bleachers that day in October, Jordyn, 15, could see her Piper High School volleyball teammates on the court in tears. The sobbing varsity players were all black, all from Kansas City, Kan., like her.
Who was yelling? Jordyn wondered. 
She peered at the students in the opposing section. Most of them were white.
'It was just sad,' said Jordyn, who plays for Piper's junior varsity team. 'And why? Why did it have to happen to us? We weren't doing anything. We were simply playing volleyball.'
Go back? To where? Jordyn, her friends and Piper's nine black players were all born in the United States. 'Just like everyone else,' Jordyn said. 'Just like white people.'

The game, played at an overwhelmingly white rural high school, came three months after Trump tweeted that four minority congresswomen should 'go back' to the 'totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.'
It was Jordyn's first experience with racism, she said. But it was not the first time that fans at a school sports game had used the president to target students of color.
The Post found that players, parents or fans have used his name or words in at least 48 publicly reported cases, hurling hateful slogans at students competing in elementary, middle and high school games in 26 states.
The venom has been shouted on football gridirons and soccer fields, on basketball and volleyball courts. Nearly 90-percent of incidents identified by The Post targeted players and fans of color, or teams fielded by schools with large minority populations. More than half focused on Hispanics.

In one of the earliest examples, students at a Wisconsin high school soccer game in April 2016 chanted 'Trump, build a wall!' at black and Hispanic players. A few months later, students at a high school basketball game in Missouri turned their backs and hoisted a Trump/Pence campaign sign as the majority-black opposing team walked onto the court. In 2017, two high school girls in Alabama showed up at a football game pep rally with a sign reading 'Put the Panic back in Hispanic' and a 'Trump Make America Great Again' banner.
In late 2017, two radio hosts announcing a high school basketball game in Iowa were caught on a hot mic describing Hispanic players as 'español people.' 'As Trump would say,' one broadcaster suggested, 'go back where they came from.'
Both announcers were fired. After the volleyball incident in Kansas, though, the fallout was more muted. The opposing school district, Baldwin City, commissioned an investigation and subsequently asserted that there was 'no evidence' of racist jeers. Administrators from Piper's school system dismissed that claim and countered with a statement supporting their students.
An hour after the game, Jordyn fought to keep her eyes dry as she boarded the team bus home. When white players insisted that everything would be okay, she slipped in ear buds and selected 'my mood playlist,' a collection of somber nighttime songs. She wiped her cheeks.
Jordyn had long ago concluded that Trump didn't want her "" or 'anyone who is just not white' "" in the United States. But hearing other students shout it was different.
Days later, her English teacher assigned an essay asking about 'what's right and what's wrong.' At first, Jordyn thought she might write about the challenges transgender people face. Then she had another idea.
'The students were making fun of us because we were different, like our hair and skin tone,' Jordyn wrote. 'How are you gonna be mad at me and my friends for being black. . . . I love myself and so should all of you.' 
She read it aloud to the class. She finished, then looked up. Everyone began to applaud. 



It's not just young Trump supporters who torment classmates because of who they are or what they believe. As one boy in North Carolina has come to understand, kids who oppose the president "" kids like him "" can be just as vicious.
By Gavin Trump's estimation, nearly everyone at his middle school in Chapel Hill comes from a Democratic family. So when the kids insist on calling him by his last name "" even after he demands that they stop "" the 13-year-old knows they want to provoke him, by trying to link the boy to the president they despise.
In fifth grade, classmates would ask if he was related to the president, knowing he wasn't. They would insinuate that Gavin agreed with the president on immigration and other polarizing issues.
'They saw my last name as Trump, and we all hate Trump, so it was like, 'We all hate you,' ' he said. 'I was like, 'Why are you teasing me? I have no relationship to Trump at all. We just ended up with the same last name.' '
Beyond kids like Gavin, the Post analysis also identified dozens of children across the country who were bullied, or even assaulted, because of their allegiance to the president.
School staff members in at least 18 states, from Washington to West Virginia, have picked on students for wearing Trump gear or voicing support for him. Among teenagers, the confrontations have at times turned physical. A high school student in Northern California said that after she celebrated the 2016 election results on social media, a classmate accused her of hating Mexicans and attacked her, leaving the girl with a bloodied nose. Last February, a teenager at an Oklahoma high school was caught on video ripping a Trump sign out of a student's hands and knocking a red MAGA cap off his head.
And in the nation's capital "" where only 4-percent of voters cast ballots for Trump in 2016 "" an outspoken conservative teenager said she had to leave her prestigious public school because she felt threatened.
In a YouTube video, Jayne Zirkle, a high school senior, said that the trouble started when classmates at the School Without Walls discovered an online photo of her campaigning for Trump. She said students circulated the photo, harassed her online and called her a white supremacist.
A D.C. school system official said they investigated the allegations and allowed Jayne to study from home to ensure she felt safe.
'A lot of people who I thought were my best friends just all of a sudden totally turned their backs on me,' Jayne said. 'People wouldn't even look at me or talk to me.'
For Gavin, the teasing began in fourth grade, soon after Trump announced his candidacy. 
After more than a year of schoolyard taunts, Gavin decided to go by his mother's last name, Mather, when he started middle school. The teenager has been proactive, requesting that teachers call him by the new name, but it gets trickier, and more stressful, when substitutes fill in. He didn't legally change his last name, so 'Trump' still appears on the roster.
The teasing has subsided, but the switch wasn't easy. Gavin likes his real last name and feared that changing it would hurt his father's feelings. His dad understood, but for Gavin, the guilt remains.
'This is my name,' he said. 'And I am abandoning my name.'



Maritza Avalos knows what's coming. It's 2020. The next presidential election is nine months away. She remembers what happened during the last one, when she was just 11.
'Pack your bags,' kids told her. 'You get a free trip to Mexico.'
She's now a freshman at Kamiakin High, the same Washington state school where her older sister, Cielo, confronted the teenagers who chanted 'Build the wall' at a football game in late 2018. Maritza, 14, assumes the taunts that accompanied Trump's last campaign will intensify with this one, too.
'I try not to think about it,' she said, but for educators nationwide, the ongoing threat of politically charged harassment has been impossible to ignore.
In response, schools have canceled mock elections, banned political gear, trained teachers, increased security, formed student-led mediation groups and created committees to develop anti-discrimination policies.

In California, the staff at Riverside Polytechnic High School has been preparing for this year's presidential election since the day after the last one. On Nov. 9, 2016, counselors held a workshop in the library for students to share their feelings. Trump supporters feared they would be singled out for their beliefs, while girls who had heard the president brag about sexually assaulting women worried that boys would be emboldened to do the same to them.
'We treated it almost like a crisis,' said Yuri Nava, a counselor who has since helped expand a student club devoted to improving the school's culture and climate.
Riverside, which is 60-percent Hispanic, also offers three courses "" African American, Chicano and ethnic studies "" meant to help students better understand one another, Nava said. And instead of punishing students when they use race or politics to bully, counselors first try to bring them together with their victims to talk through what happened. Often, they leave as friends.
In Gambrills, Md., Arundel High School has taken a similar approach. Even before a student was caught scribbling the n-word in his notebook in early 2017, Gina Davenport, the principal, worried about the effect of the election's rhetoric. At the school, where about half of the 2,200 students are minorities, she heard their concerns every day.
But the racist slur, discovered the same month as Trump's inauguration, led to a concrete response.
A 'Global Community Citizenship' class, now mandatory for all freshmen in the district, pushes students to explore their differences.
A recent lesson delved into Trump's use of Twitter.
'The focus wasn't Donald Trump, the focus was listening: How do we convey our ideas in order for someone to listen?' Davenport said. 'We teach that we can disagree with each other without walking away being enemies "" which we don't see play out in the press, or in today's political debates.'

Since the class debuted in fall 2017, disciplinary referrals for disruption and disrespect have decreased by 25-percent each school year, Davenport said. Membership in the school's speech and debate team has doubled.
The course has eased Davenport's anxiety heading into the next election. She doesn't expect an uptick in racist bullying.
'Civil conversation,' she said. 'The kids know what that means now.'
Many schools haven't made such progress, and on those campuses, students are bracing for more abuse.
Maritza's sister, Cielo, told her to stand up for herself if classmates use Trump's words to harass her, but Maritza is quieter than her sibling. The freshman doesn't like confrontation.
She knows, though, that eventually someone will say something "" about the wall, maybe, or about how kids who look like her don't belong in this country "" and when that day comes, the girl hopes that she'll be strong.

STOP write More than 8 in 10 view president as racist
Pessimism runs deep, poll shows 
President perceived to have emboldened racists


President Trump made a stark appeal to black Americans during the 2016 election when he asked, 'What have you got to lose?' Three years later, black Americans have rendered their verdict on his presidency with a deeply pessimistic assessment of their place in the United States under a leader seen by an overwhelming majority as racist.
The findings come from a Washington Post-Ipsos poll of African Americans nationwide, which reveals fears about whether their children will have a fair shot to succeed and a belief that white Americans don't fully appreciate the discrimination that black people experience.
While personally optimistic about their own lives, black Americans today offer a bleaker view about their community as a whole. They also express determination to try to limit Trump to a single term in office.

More than 8 in 10 black Americans say they believe Trump is a racist and that he has made racism a bigger problem in the country. Nine in 10 disapprove of his job performance overall. 
The pessimism goes well beyond assessments of the president. A 65 percent majority of African Americans say it is a 'bad time' to be a black person in America. That view is widely shared by clear majorities of black adults across income, generational and political lines. By contrast, 77 percent of black Americans say it is a 'good time' to be a white person, with a wide majority saying white people don't understand the discrimination faced by black Americans.

Courtney Tate, a 40-year-old elementary school teacher in Irving, Tex., outside Dallas, said that since Trump was elected, he's been having more conversations with his co-workers "" discussions that are simultaneously enlightening and exhausting "" about racial issues he and his students face every day. 

 'As a black person, you've always seen all the racism, the microaggressions. But as white people, they don't understand this is how things are going for me,' said Tate, who said he is the only black male teacher in his school. 'They don't live those experiences. They don't live in those neighborhoods. They moved out. It's so easy to be white and oblivious in this country.'
Francine Cartwright, a 44-year-old mother of three from Moorestown, N.J., said the ascent of Trump has altered the way she thinks about the white people in her life. 
'If I'm in a room with white women, I know that 50 percent of them voted for Trump and they believe in his ideas,' said Cartwright, a university researcher. 'I look at them and think, 'How do you see me? What is my humanity to you?' '


The president routinely talks about how a steadily growing economy and historically low unemployment have resulted in more African Americans with jobs and the lowest jobless rate for black Americans recorded. Months ago, he said, 'What I've done for African Americans in two and a half years, no president has been able to do anything like it.' 
Those factors have not translated positively for the president. A 77-percent majority of black Americans say Trump deserves 'only some' or 'hardly any' credit for the 5.5-percent unemployment rate among black adults, compared with 20-percent who say Trump deserves significant credit. 
In follow-up interviews, many said former president Barack Obama deserves more credit for the improvement in the unemployment rate, which declined from a high of 16.8-percent in 2010 to 7.5-percent when he left office. 
Others said their personal financial situation is more a product of their own efforts than anything the president has done. 
'I don't think [Trump] has anything to do with unemployment among African Americans,' said Ethel Smith, a 72-year-old nanny who lives in Lithonia, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta. 'I've always been a working poor person. That's just who I am.'
 

Black Americans report little change in their personal financial situations in the past few years, with 19-percent saying it has been getting better and 26-percent saying it has been getting worse. Most, 54-percent, say their financial situation has stayed the same. 
A similar 56-percent majority of African Americans rate the national economy as 'not so good' or 'poor,' contrasting with other surveys that find most Americans overall rate the economy positively, although there are sharp political divides on this question. 
Beyond questions about the economy, African Americans see a range of concerns impacting the country overall as well as their own communities. 
Just 16-percent of black Americans believe that most black children born in the United States today have 'a good opportunity to achieve a comfortable standard of living.' A 75-percent majority think most white children have such an opportunity. 
More than 8 in 10 say they do not trust police in the United States to treat people of all races equally, and 7 in 10 distrust police in their own communities. 
Black Americans also widely sense that their experiences with discrimination are underappreciated by white Americans. Just about 2 in 10 say that most white Americans understand the level of discrimination black Americans face in their lives. 

The starkly negative outlook appears to be a turnabout from previous points during both the Obama and George W. Bush presidencies, according to surveys that asked related questions. A 2011 Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation survey found 73-percent of black women said it was a 'good time' to be a black woman in America, while a similar survey in 2006 found 60-percent of black men saying it was a good time to be a black man. 
Yet the Post-Ipsos poll also finds that 65-percent of black Americans say they feel optimistic about their own lives most or all of the time. This positive personal outlook crosses age and political groups. While it peaks among those who are older and with higher incomes, roughly half of black Americans with incomes under $35,000 annually say they feel optimistic about their lives. 
Dana Clark, a father of 11 in Ontario, Calif., said he tells all of his children that it's possible to succeed in America, but that they'll have to work harder than the white children they encounter. 
'I tell them we're going to set this plan up. Whatever you want to do, you're going to be able to do it,' he said. 'But it ain't going to be easy, especially if [you] want to make some money because you're going to be in a world where they're not going to expect you to be there. You can get what you want, but you've got to work harder, faster and stronger.' 
The survey, by The Post and Ipsos, a nonpartisan research firm, is one of the most extensive recent surveys focused on views of the country and Trump among black Americans, who are often represented by only small samples in customary national polls. It was conducted among 1,088 non-Hispanic black adults, including 900 registered voters, drawn from a large online survey panel recruited through random sampling of U.S. households. 
Few black voters responded positively to Trump's campaign appeal for their votes. Exit polls taken during the 2016 election showed just 8-percent of African Americans supported Trump and 89-percent backed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, although black turnout was significantly lower than in 2008 and 2012 for the election and reelection of Obama, the country's first black president. 

In the Post-Ipsos poll, roughly three-quarters of black adults say the things that Trump is doing as president are 'bad for African Americans,' while a similar majority 

says Obama's actions as president were good. 
Kenneth Davis, a truck driver who lives outside Detroit, said that when Trump was elected, co-workers who secretly harbored racist thoughts felt emboldened to publicly express them. 
'One gentleman is waving the Confederate flag on the back of his pickup truck,' said Davis, 48, who is a Marine Corps veteran. 'He was very brave to say, 'Trump's president, I'm going to get my window [painted].' '
Retired federal prison Warden Keith Battle said the political climate has exposed 'unresolved racial issues' and that Trump has emboldened white supremacists. Battle, who lives in Wake Forest, N.C., said white supremacists 'are not the majority of whites in America, but there is a significant amount still, I'd say 30-percent, and I think they're just leading the country down a path of, eventually, chaos. They're feeling jeopardized of losing their white privilege.'
Survey respondents were asked to say how Trump's presidency has affected them personally or African Americans in general. The responses illuminated the data in the poll. 
'Donald Trump has not done anything for the African American people,' said one person.
'He has created an atmosphere of division and overt racism and fear of immigrants unseen in many years,' said another.
A third said, 'He has taken hatred against people of color, in general, from the closet to the front porch.'
Others echoed that sentiment, saying that the president has emboldened those with racially prejudiced views and therefore set back race relations for years. 'I sense a separation between myself and some of my white associates,' one person wrote.
Trump's overall approval rating among black Americans stands at 7-percent, with 90-percent disapproving, including 75-percent who disapprove 'strongly.' 
Similarly large majorities of black men and women disapprove of Trump, as do black Americans across different age, education and income levels. Trump receives somewhat higher marks among self-identified black conservatives, with 25-percent approving of his performance, compared with 5-percent of moderates and 3-percent among liberals. 
Few black Americans appear open to supporting Trump's bid for reelection at this point. He receives between 4 and 5-percent support among black registered voters in head-to-head matchups against eight potential Democratic nominees. But the level of Democratic support depends on who is the party's nominee, peaking at 82-percent for former vice president Joe Biden and falling to 57-percent for former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg.
The Post-Ipsos survey was conducted Jan. 2-8 through Ipsos's KnowledgePanel, a large online survey panel recruited through random sampling of U.S. households. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points among the sample of 1,088 black adults overall and four points among the sample of 900 registered voters.

The U.S. intelligence community long ago produced evidence of Russia's illegal interference in the 2016 presidential election to try to boost Donald Trump's candidacy. Then the special counsel investigating the matter detailed myriad ways President Trump sought to stymie the probe. And then Robert S. Mueller III testified to Congress about Trump's conduct "" and warned of Russia's continued interest in thwarting U.S. elections.
But it is Trump who is trying to have the last word.
Seven months after Mueller's marathon testimony brought finality to the Russia investigation, Trump is actively seeking to rewrite the narrative that had been meticulously documented by federal law enforcement and intelligence officials, both for immediate political gain and for history.
Turbocharged by his acquittal in the Senate's impeachment trial and confident that he has acquired the fealty of nearly every Republican in Congress, Trump is claiming vindication and exoneration not only over his conduct regarding Ukraine "" for which the House voted to impeach him "" but also from the other investigations that have dogged his presidency.

This includes lawsuits filed against Trump by the state of New York over his finances as well as alleged misuse of charity funds by his nonprofit foundation. Trump sought last week to turn the page on these probes, declaring on Twitter ahead of a White House meeting with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) that 'New York must stop all of its unnecessary lawsuits - harrassment.'
Still, Russia is foremost on Trump's mind. Even before he was sworn in as president, Trump viewed the FBI's Russia investigation as a dark cloud over his administration that threatened to delegitimize his claim on the office. And more than three years in, Trump remains haunted by all things Russia, according to advisers and allies, and continues to nurse a profound and unabated sense of persecution.
As his reelection campaign intensifies, Trump is using the powers of his office to manipulate the facts and settle the score. Advisers say the president is determined to protect his associates ensnared in the expansive Russia investigation, punish the prosecutors and investigators he believes betrayed him, and convince the public that the probe was exactly as he sees it: an illegal witch hunt.

'The whole Mueller investigation was a shakedown and a disgrace. It probably should be expunged,' Trump said in an interview last week with radio commentator Geraldo Rivera, a longtime friend.
Referring to Mueller, Trump added: 'I don't call him special counsel because special counsel is not an accurate term. It's a special prosecutor, because what he and his 13-angry Democrats "" all horrible, just horrible people "" what they did to destroy the lives of people that you know, but to destroy the lives of many, Geraldo, should never be forgiven, should never be forgotten, and something has to be done about it.'
Central to this pursuit were Trump's efforts this past week to lessen the government's sentencing recommendation for longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone. Attorney General William P. Barr's extraordinary intervention in the Stone case, as well as Trump's own declaration of his right to meddle in criminal cases whenever he chooses, tested the nation's rule of law and sent chills throughout the Justice Department, which has long shielded its independence from political influences.

The criminal justice system could soon be tested further. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson "" whom Trump targeted and disparaged last week "" is set to decide Stone's sentence on Thursday. The president has indicated he may commute Stone's sentence. Asked last week whether he was open to issuing a pardon, Trump told reporters: 'I don't want to say that yet.'
Last week alone, Trump called the Russia investigation 'tainted,' 'dirty,' 'rotten,' 'illegal,' 'phony,' a 'disgrace,' a 'shakedown,' a 'scam,' 'a fixed hoax' and 'the biggest political crime in American History, by far.'
He argued that the probe into Russian election interference was based on false pretenses, despite a recent report from the Justice Department's inspector general stating the opposite even as it criticized the FBI's surveillance of a former Trump campaign aide. And he claimed, again without evidence, that Mueller, a former FBI director regarded for his precision with facts, lied to Congress "" which happens to be one of the charges Stone was convicted of by a jury last November.

Absent from the president's many public comments about the Russia investigation, however, was a warning to Russia not to interfere in the next election, or even an acknowledgment that U.S. intelligence agencies believe Russian President Vladi mir Putin is seeking to do so.
'As Bob Mueller said "" and the entire intelligence community confirmed "" Russia is still coming at us,' said Chuck Rosenberg, a former U.S. attorney and former counsel to Mueller at the FBI. 'Not only is the president offering a false narrative to the American people about that threat, but there is no leadership from him on this incredibly important issue. We are still being attacked. It is as if the Russians invaded Alaska and the president either said they are not actually there or that they are there but it does not really matter because we have 49-other marvelous states.'
Frank Figliuzzi, a former senior FBI official who also worked for Mueller, said Trump's efforts to spin a new history of the Russia investigation are cause for alarm.
'What Trump is doing is canceling what we all have proven, what the courts have proven, as in Roger Stone, as in Manafort, as in Flynn, in a form of jury nullification at a presidential level,' Figliuzzi said, referring to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
'The president is doing it on steroids because of the power of his office,' Figliuzzi said. 'People have to see the danger in that.'
Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a history professor at New York University and a scholar of authoritarianism, said she sees darker motives in Trump's actions.
'It's all about manipulating information and recasting the narrative to be what you need it to be,' Ben-Ghiat said. 'Even more than censoring, which is old-school, rulers like Trump "" and Putin is the master at this "" manipulate opinion by manipulating information.'

Trump's defenders said the president is wise to try to seize control of the public narrative of the Russia investigation at the start of a campaign year, and they argued that his retelling will find a sympathetic audience.
'Winners write the history books. President Trump is aware of this and realizes that unless he defines the previous three years of witch hunts, then it will in fact be the people who unsuccessfully launched these witch hunts who will define the legacy,' said Jason Miller, a former Trump campaign adviser who co-hosts 'War Room,' a pro-Trump radio show and podcast, with former Trump strategist Stephen K. Bannon.
'Who he's trying to speak to are the people who supported him in 2016, who think it's ridiculous what partisan Democrats and unelected administrative-state bureaucrats have tried to do to him over these past three years, and to put things into proper context as we head into this fall,' Miller added.
In private discussions with advisers and friends, Trump has long groused angrily and obsessively about the Russia investigation. The president believes he and his campaign were unfairly targeted by what he bemoans as a 'deep state' conspiracy "" and he faults former FBI director James B. Comey and deputy director Andrew McCabe, among others.
Trump regularly complains that Comey and McCabe have avoided jail time for what he is convinced is wrongdoing, while Stone, Manafort, Flynn and other Trump associates have been prosecuted.
'They put a man in jail and destroy his life, his family, his wife, his children "" nine years in jail. It's a disgrace,' Trump told reporters last week about Stone, referring to the seven- to nine-year prison sentence initially recommended by federal prosecutors. 'In the meantime, Comey walks around making book deals. The people that launched this scam investigation "" and what they did is a disgrace. And, hopefully, it'll be treated fairly.'

Trump's grievances spill beyond the Russia matter to include his conviction that former vice president Joe Biden has not faced sufficient scrutiny for his son Hunter's dealings in Ukraine.
'The president is obsessed with his view of fairness,' said one Trump adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly describe the president's state of mind. 'Most of these items have arisen because the president doesn't think things are fair. His reaction to Joe Biden's son is mostly not a reaction of trying to harm a political opponent, but it's a reaction of not believing that the treatment of the Bidens is in any way similar to how he's been treated. His reaction to McCabe, Comey, various other enemies of the president is a reaction to what he believes is an unfair result happening to his allies.'
This adviser added: 'Not only is it about fairness, but it's about making sure that when the books are written and the films are being made, that he and his allies come out in the best possible light. All of this relates to perception.'
Ben-Ghiat, the New York University professor, credited Trump for his foresight and skill.
'While Trump is impulsive and there's always the question of, is he a chessmaster or is he just moving blindly out of emotion, this strategy of manipulating information and creating a false narrative are the actions of someone who thinks long term, who thinks about legacy,' Ben-Ghiat said. 'He's a builder. He thinks about the future. And this is a story about someone building an alternate history for the future.'

President vows to make 'major issue' of younger Biden's work in Ukraine

President Trump and his Republican allies are rapidly shifting their focus to former vice president Joe Biden's son Hunter, reviving attacks that led to Trump's impeachment, in an effort to broadly define as corrupt the potential Democratic presidential nominee.
As Biden surged this week in the Democratic nominating contest - and with exit polls from Super Tuesday's primaries showing he has captured at least some of the white working-class voters that propelled Trump's 2016 victory - the president vowed to make Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine a ""major issue"" in the general election, should Joe Biden win the nomination.
Trump is getting assistance from Republicans in Congress, some of whom are trying to revive an investigation pertaining to Burisma, the Ukrainian company that hired Hunter to serve on its board, and to open new probes that could uncover information helpful to the president's reelection campaign.
Joe Biden and his aides are bracing for an onslaught of attacks from Republicans over Hunter - and are planning to mount an assault of their own on what they see as Trump's self-dealing and on his placing family members in senior White House positions. They also plan to highlight the president's refusal to release his tax returns.
Trump's congressional backers are seeking to breathe new life into the Biden-Ukraine allegations, which have been dormant since the president's impeachment. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) speculated Thursday about Biden's son as well as his brother, and he criticized Democratic committee chairmen for not opening probes into their activities.
""What did they do while he was vice president?"" McCarthy asked reporters. ""What happened to Burisma? . . . I think there's a real question out there from the American public.""

McCarthy denied that this investigative curiosity was influenced by presidential politics. His comments came less than 24 hours after Trump phoned in to his friend Sean Hannity's Fox News Channel show and accused the Biden family of being ""purely corrupt."" The president said he would go after the Bidens far more aggressively in a general election than the other Democratic candidates have in the primaries.
""The other people that are running, trying to beat him, don't bring it up,"" Trump said. ""That will be a major issue in the campaign. I will bring that up all the time, because I don't see any way out. I don't see any way - for them, I don't see how they can answer those questions.""
Tim Murtaugh, the communications director for Trump's reelection campaign, argued that Biden already has been damaged by ""the Hunter Biden-Burisma saga"" and said the matter could be a vulnerability for Republicans to exploit in the general election. Murtaugh said the former vice president needs to answer, ""What exactly did the Ukrainians think they were getting for their money?""
Hunter, 50, served for nearly five years on the board of Burisma, Ukraine's largest private energy company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Hunter was not accused of any wrongdoing in the investigation.
As vice president, Biden pressured Ukraine to fire the top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, who Biden and other Western officials said was not sufficiently pursuing corruption cases. At the time, the investigation into Burisma was dormant, according to former Ukrainian and U.S. officials.

Biden allies have noted that Republicans were largely quiet about Hunter and Burisma while Biden's campaign floundered in recent months and only picked up their scrutiny in recent days as Biden began winning primaries.
Biden's campaign has long heard the drumbeat of Trump's criticism. From the moment Biden launched his campaign last spring, Trump has attacked him on Twitter and sought to shine a spotlight on Hunter. At times, Biden advisers say, the whole enterprise has felt like a rapid-response operation.
One major lesson that Biden's advisers took from the past several months is the benefit of being aggressive and attacking the credibility of Trump's allies. 
Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman, said his team was prepared to fight back on any Ukraine-related attacks.
""Any time this conspiracy theory is raised by the President or Senators who disrespect their office enough to transform their committees into craven arms of his reelection campaign, we will hammer - with a baseball bat - the fact that Donald Trump is hands down the most corrupt American president of all time,"" Bates said in a statement. ""If they really want to go there, they should buckle up.""
Polls have long showed Biden defeating Trump in head-to-head matchups despite a year of withering GOP attacks. The former vice president's advisers argued that his name recognition and favorability ratings could inoculate him - and even some Republican politicians have said that they generally like Biden.

Indeed, Republican pollster Frank Luntz said attacks on Hunter may not prove effective for Trump.
""I don't think going after the child of a vice president is going to move any undecided voter,"" Luntz said. ""It's just not top of mind, and it doesn't rank in the 10 priorities that an undecided voter cares about.""
Fact-checkers have debunked Trump's attacks related to Hunter's work in Ukraine, and some Trump administration officials testified under oath during the impeachment inquiry that Biden did not do anything wrong.
It does not appear that Biden's campaign will modify how it handles the attacks, and Hunter continues to operate independently of the campaign. When Biden celebrated Tuesday night's election results - one of the most triumphant moments of his political career - with some members of the family in Los Angeles, he was not joined onstage by Hunter, who lives nearby with his new wife.
Trump advisers and allies see Hunter as central to an argument they plan to make that Biden is corrupt and used his decades in public service to enrich his family. The argument is similar to one Trump advanced against Hillary Clinton in 2016.
""I would expect us to be hearing a whole heck of a lot more about Hunter - and not just Hunter, but the Biden family self-enrichment game and why that means Joe Biden has the same problems that Hillary Clinton had,"" said Jason Miller, a former Trump campaign adviser who co-hosts a pro-Trump podcast and radio show.
Josh Schwerin, a senior strategist at Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC that is preparing to help the party's eventual nominee, questioned whether this could again be an effective argument for Trump.
""A big difference from 2016 is that Trump is now on the defensive on corruption,"" Schwerin said. ""He was just impeached, and there has been a constant flow of reporting on the corruption, chaos and scandals of the Trump administration.""

Unite the Country, a pro-Biden super PAC formed last fall to help bolster Biden against Trump's attacks, is also poised to play a role. Advisers there are focused on ensuring that Biden wins primary states such as Michigan and Florida, but they are also beginning to contemplate their role in a general election counteroffensive.
In addition, a super PAC funded by former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who withdrew from the race and endorsed Biden on Wednesday, could play a major role.
""You can't probably stay above it all,"" said Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who has endorsed Biden, adding that Trump would ""use every unethical tactic in the tool belt.""
It is unclear how the Biden campaign would handle attacks on Hunter that go beyond the dealings in Ukraine that were part of the impeachment hearings. Some close to Biden think that personal attacks on his substance abuse problems, or his out-of-wedlock child, could end up backfiring.
Trump also risks inviting scrutiny of his own adult children. Trump's sons Eric and Donald Jr. run the Trump Organization, which has charged the U.S. government to house the government employees who travel with the president - at rates as high as $650 a night for hotel rooms at Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida, and $17,000 a month for a cottage at Trump's club in Bedminster, N.J. The Secret Service alone has paid Trump's company more than $628,000 since Trump took office, according to receipts obtained through public-records requests.
Trump properties have also seen a huge increase in business from Republican candidates and campaign committees since Trump was elected in 2016. The company's properties have been paid $5.8 million by candidates and PACs since the start of 2017.
Bates, the Biden spokesman, said, ""Donald Trump's company is actively leeching millions off of American taxpayers as we speak. He is now in year five of breaking his promise to the American people to release his tax returns. And he is the only American president who has ever tried to force a foreign country to lie about the candidate he's too afraid to look in the eye.""

On Capitol Hill, interest in Biden is rising along with the candidate's fortunes. The most significant congressional probe targeting the Bidens is an outgrowth of a 2015 Clinton email investigation and is being directed by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. 
Johnson requested State Department documents pertaining to Hunter and Burisma last November, and last month, he requested Secret Service documents regarding Hunter's travel during his father's vice presidency. On Feb. 24, Johnson notified the top Democrat on his panel, Sen. Gary Peters (Mich.), that he intended to issue a subpoena for testimony from former Ukrainian diplomat Andrii Telizhenko, who is tied to Burisma.
Peters challenged the subpoena, and Johnson is planning a March 11 vote on the demand.

JERUSALEM "" Israel's third election campaign in a year has started with all the usual elements: the speeches, the rallies, the posters. On Thursday came another occurrence Israelis have come to expect: a move by President Trump that roils the campaign, seemingly for the advantage of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 
Trump's surprise White House invitation for Netanyahu and his opponent, Benny Gantz, to come review Trump's long-awaited Middle East peace plan this week is viewed here as the third Trump surprise in three elections. 
Both the timing of the trip "" scheduled for the very day Netanyahu faces a pivotal procedure in his controversial request for parliamentary immunity against corruption charges "" and the reported pro-Israel tilt of the proposal are widely viewed as boons for Netanyahu and traps for Gantz.
The 'Deal of the Century' has become the 'Gift of the Century,' declared the Israeli daily Haaretz.
Netanyahu accepted enthusiastically as soon as Vice President Pence, in Israel for a Holocaust commemoration, delivered Trump's invitation Thursday night. Further, Pence gave Netanyahu credit for magnanimously extending the invitation to include Gantz in the personal White House briefing. 
The invitation seemed to send Gantz's campaign into lockdown for two days in which he made no public comment about it. On Saturday, he asserted a modicum of control over the situation by saying he agreed to meet Trump on Monday, a day ahead of the planned meeting, and return to Israel on Tuesday, in time for the parliamentary talks on immunity. 
Officials with the White House and State Department did not respond to requests for comment. 
Gantz had recently warned Trump that debuting the proposal in the middle of the campaign would amount to a 'gross intervention' in the election. But had he declined, he risked being seen as snubbing a plan expected to heavily favor Israel's side in the decades-long conflict with the Palestinians, who have refused to even meet with the White House team crafting the proposal. He would also be ceding a coveted White House handshake with Trump, who is widely popular among voters here, to his rival. 
According to diplomats who have heard the plan described by White House officials, the proposal will allow Israel to incorporate large Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank into Israel proper and give Israel security oversight of the eastern flank of the disputed territory while giving Palestinians greater political autonomy and a potential path to sovereignty. The diplomats spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe confidential exchanges. 
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was reportedly not invited to the White House meeting. 
Trump's two previous pre-election cameos, which included embracing Israel's sovereignty over the Golan Heights and touting a potential U.S.-Israeli defense pact, were widely seen as intended to boost Netanyahu, at least in their timing. 
The prime minister has largely based his reelection campaigns on his ability to push Trump ever closer toward the platform of Netanyahu's Likud party, from moving the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem to dropping the view that settlements inherently violate international law.
Netanyahu failed to win a governing coalition in either previous election, and rumors have been rampant that Trump's peace plan would finally see the light of day before Israel goes back to the polls for a third go. The plan has reportedly been complete for months, as the administration waited in vain for a new government to form in Jerusalem. 
Trump has scheduled a mini-summit on the plan for Tuesday, the very day that the Knesset, Israel's parliament, is set to take up Netanyahu's request for immunity on counts of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.

Netanyahu, the first Israeli prime minister ever indicted while in office, had recently demanded formal protection from what he disparages as a 'witch hunt' prosecution. But after it became clear that he would lose such a vote in parliament, his Likud allies have fought to no avail to stall the procedure, storming out of committee meetings and seeking court intervention. 
Gantz's Blue and White party, which has doggedly pushed for the immunity vote, was forced by Trump's invitation to weigh postponing it while Netanyahu is on a diplomatic visit to Washington. Party leaders have said they intend to press on. 
'There is no question that [Netanyahu supporters] with close ties to the White House tailored this event to fit Netanyahu's dimensions,' a Gantz adviser told the Maariv newspaper.

Feeling betrayed by Trump and Giuliani, he now works against them 


Last Sunday, a New York lawyer posted photographs of the shining dome of the U.S. Capitol on Twitter, announcing that he had just visited Washington to give Congress contents of an iPhone belonging to a onetime associate of President Trump's personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
It would be a few days before the implications of his limited message became clear: The Lev Parnas hurricane was about to hit.
It was the week when the pomp and circumstance of the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history was supposed to take center stage in Washington. The House of Representatives formally voted to send the Senate charges that Trump abused his office by pressuring Ukraine to help his reelection bid. John G. Roberts Jr., the chief justice of the United States, arrived in the Senate chambers to preside over the-president's trial and the swearing-in of 100 senators.
But overshadowing that weighty moment was a cascade of revelations by a fast-talking, Ukraine-born businessman sporting an ankle bracelet who "" speaking for the first time since his October arrest on campaign finance charges "" directly implicated the president in the Ukraine scheme.
'President Trump knew exactly what was going on,' Parnas said in an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow on Wednesday that earned the cable news show the highest ratings of its 11-year history. 
'That's the secret that they were trying to keep,' he added. 'I was on the ground doing their work.'
Fueling his account were hundreds of pages of text messages, documents and photos released by the House that documented his interactions with Giuliani and a coterie of Ukrainians who claimed to have information about former vice president Joe Biden and a debunked conspiracy that their country conspired with Democrats in the 2016 election.
Parnas, with his Brooklyn-by-way-of-Odessa accent, has sought to fashion himself as the Joe Pesci version of John Dean "" the former White House counsel who was the star witness in the impeachment proceedings against President Richard M. Nixon "" casting himself as an avowedly repentant participant in a rogue operation.
Some of his most explosive claims that Trump, Vice President Pence and Attorney General William P. Barr knew of his activities remain unsubstantiated and disputed. The president's allies say his assertions are not credible, noting the serious criminal charges he faces.
 

'These allegations are being made by a man who is currently out on bail for federal crimes and-is desperate to reduce his exposure to prison,' White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said this past week.

Still, the blizzard of new details in the documents Parnas had turned over raised a host of questions about Trump's efforts in Ukraine "" ratcheting up the pressure on Senate Republicans to allow witnesses to be called during the coming trial.
In his choreographed transformation from a selfie-snapping Trump devotee to a self-described truth-teller embraced by many on the left, Parnas has blazed a path similar to that of Michael Cohen, the longtime Trump fixer who last year turned on the president in the face of criminal charges.
As a legal strategy, it's risky, experts agreed: Parnas has been indicted in New York for allegedly funneling foreign money into U.S. political campaigns. (He has pleaded not guilty). Prosecutors have said in court that they are considering bringing additional criminal counts against him, a perilous situation that defense attorneys generally advise requires extreme caution "" and silence.
Parnas's attorney, Joseph A. Bondy, has been agitating for weeks for Congress to call Parnas as a witness, an effort largely viewed as a bid to get House Democrats to extend him immunity. But then his client spoke out without any such protection.
In interviews, Parnas has said he felt abandoned and betrayed after his arrest, when Trump disavowed him and Giuliani failed to forcefully defend him.
His about-face has left him cast out of the elite realm he briefly occupied with Giuliani, a man he regularly called 'my brother' who had swept him into a world of wealth and international power-brokering.



The former New York mayor initially stood by Parnas and his onetime business partner Igor Fruman after their arrests. 'I certainly am not going to disavow them,' he said at the time, adding: 'Everything I've known about them says they would not commit a crime.'
Since then, his tone has changed dramatically. This past week, Giuliani said he would not respond to Parnas's allegations, writing in a text that 'he has no credibility.'
 'He's burning out and best to stay out of his way,' he added acidly.
For his part, Parnas said he now feels liberated.
In an interview with The Washington Post, he compared himself to someone emerging from a 'cult,' with fresh perspective on the dizzying events of the past two years.
'That arrest saved my life,' he said.
'I idolized him'

Two years ago, Parnas was fending off creditors in obscurity in Boca Raton, Fla. He shot to the tableside of the president's closest allies and family members with a few well-placed campaign donations, a die-hard loyalty to Trump and some good old-fashioned chutzpah.
Parnas, 47, was born in Ukraine but moved with his family to the United States as a child and grew up in Brooklyn. He told The Post in an interview conducted before his arrest that he got his start in real estate, at one point selling Trump condos for Donald Trump's father, Fred, and then worked in trading goods with the former Soviet Union before becoming a securities trader. He moved to Florida in the mid-1990s.
He barreled into Trump circles with a $50,000 donation to Trump's campaign and the Republican Party less than a month before the 2016 election. 
'I was really passionate about the president,' he said last fall before his arrest. 'I started really believing that he could really make a change and make it happen.'
'I tell you honestly, I think he's going to go down as one of the greatest presidents ever, even with all this negativity and everything that's going on,' he said then.
Parnas told MSNBC last week that he was so passionate about Trump that he had photos of him all over his house. After his arrest, he said, his wife was embarrassed because the FBI told her that 'I had a shrine to him.' 
'I idolized him,' he said. 'I mean, I thought he was the savior.' 
In his interview with The Post, Parnas said he was able to rise quickly in Trump's world because he discovered a 'kink in the system': the super PAC, which, unlike a candidate committee, can accept unlimited funds. 

In May 2018, the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action reported receiving a $325,000 donation from an energy company Parnas and Fruman had recently formed. 

Prosecutors have said the money did not come from their fledgling company, which had no business or revenue, but from a private loan Fruman took out against a Miami condo.
Giuliani met the two men around the same time, through a lawyer and friend who referred the duo to him, he has said.

Parnas said he sought out the former New York mayor to be a paid pitchman for a company he co-founded called Fraud Guarantee that claimed to shield investors from financial fraud. He arranged for Giuliani to be paid $500,000 by a Long Island lawyer who was an investor in Fraud Guarantee. He assumed their relationship would be a distant one, Parnas said this past week.
Instead, Parnas said, he was shocked and delighted to find himself constantly at the side of the president's personal lawyer.
Before he knew it, Giuliani was inviting him and Fruman to hang out four to five nights a week, he said. They were zipping around the country to attend Trump rallies, and then traveling around Europe to gather information about Ukraine. 

There were long nights at exclusive cigar bars and frequent strategy sessions at Trump's hotel in Washington; a visit to a palace outside Madrid owned by a Venezuelan energy executive; and a huddle at a luxury Parisian club. Parnas joined Giuliani in the dugout to meet the New York Yankees during a special overseas baseball game in London. He accompanied the former New York mayor to a special annual commemoration of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and to the state funeral of former president George H.W. Bush at Washington National Cathedral.
Parnas said living in Giuliani's world was a heady experience. 'I looked up to him. I grew up in New York and he was a legend. And here I was sitting with him, every night,' he said. 
At night, he would call his wife, Svetlana, and tell her about the powerful people he was meeting with Giuliani and the swanky fundraisers they were attending. 'You won't believe this!' he would exclaim.
'The perfect storm'

Parnas acknowledged that he had ambitions to use the connections he was making through Giuliani to improve his business prospects. He said he grew up in Brighton Beach with little money and an absent father. In recent years, he said, his career had been 'up and down.' 
'Sometimes we were buying Rolexes,' he said. 'And sometimes we were selling the Rolexes to make the rent.'

Court filings show he has been dogged by debts. When he met Giuliani, he was being pursued for more than $500,000 in Florida courts by investing in a movie deal gone bad. 

In his new environs, Parnas said, suddenly anything appeared possible: 'I figured, once this is over, we'll be kings.'
Still, he said, he understood from the start that he and Fruman, who often wore T-shirts paired with gold chains, did not fit in Giuliani's circle. 
'No one understood it,' Parnas said of their constant presence by his side. 'I didn't understand it.'
But at the time, he said, he believed Giuliani enjoyed their company "" and that Giuliani appreciated that the duo were a solicitous entourage, willing to drop anything to join him at his favorite haunts, stay out late while he drank scotch and pick up the tab.
Now Parnas believes that the president's lawyer drew the two Soviet-born men close after he realized they had connections in Ukraine, a Giuliani obsession. The former New York mayor was convinced Ukrainians had worked against Trump in the 2016 election and were in possession of evidence of Biden's corruption. 
'I think we were recruited,' Parnas said. 'It was the perfect storm.'


Giuliani has said he began looking at Ukraine after he signed on as Trump's personal attorney in April 2018, tasked with defending him in the investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. 
That November, Giuliani has said he was approached by a former colleague who said a Ukrainian prosecutor had information to share about Biden and the Democrats with U.S. authorities. 
Soon, Parnas and Fruman became Giuliani's point men for his Ukraine operation.

The cache of records released by the House this past week made clear that Parnas was acting on Giuliani's behalf and in close coordination with him. The materials ran the gamut, from photos of Parnas sporting a bulletproof vest for unknown reasons to extensive communications with top Ukrainian officials "" including members of the country's cabinet and key aides to its leaders. 
The materials sharply undercut the notion pushed by the president's supporters that the activities in Ukraine were about U.S. anti-corruption policy "" rather than defeating Biden.
The outlines of the scheme were even scribbled in blunt terms on stationery from Vienna's Ritz-Carlton Hotel "" notes Parnas took as he spoke to Giuliani by phone during a June visit to the Austrian capital, according to his attorney.
'Get Zalenksy to Annouce that the Biden case will be Investigated,' Parnas wrote, referring to the effort to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce investigations related to the former vice president.
The newly released documents showed that Ukraine's top prosecutor explicitly offered to help in the effort against Biden and the Democrats in exchange for the removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, as well as a meeting with Barr and other actions that would potentially help his boss, then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who was in a fight for his political life in Ukraine's presidential election.
And the materials laid out how Giuliani's star witness in his campaign against Biden "" former Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin "" was promised help with a visa to the United States that the embassy in Kyiv was blocking. 
At one point, in a text message to Parnas, Giuliani wrote that he had gotten 'no 1' involved in the effort to secure Shokin a visa "" a reference, Parnas said this past week, to Trump.
Other text messages show extensive contact between Parnas and Derek Harvey, an aide to Rep. Devin Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee "" indicating that Nunes's office sought to use the information Parnas was gathering. A Nunes spokesman and Harvey did not respond to requests for comment.
A hint of more to come

In December, Bondy began agitating to be allowed to provide Congress with Parnas's material, which had been seized by prosecutors after his arrest. The federal judge presiding over the case in New York agreed to allow Bondy to share the material the day before he made his delivery to the House.
The documents filled in gaps in the narrative of the Ukraine pressure campaign. For Democrats who have been pushing for the Senate to call witnesses in its upcoming trial, the new information supported their arguments that there is still more evidence to gather.
The public cache of Parnas's materials is not exhaustive. The House has released no messages, for instance, between him and his primary partner, Fruman.


And some Democrats have counseled caution in the face of his allegations, noting that he is accused of serious felonies.
'Parnas is someone whose evidence, whose testimony should be questioned, challenged, like any other witness,' Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) told CNN, adding, 'but he should be a witness.' 

Prosecutors have hinted in court that more of Parnas's activities have not come to light yet. This past month, they revealed that he received a mysterious $1-million loan in September from a lawyer for Dmytro Firtash, a Ukrainian gas tycoon facing bribery charges in the United States. In court, Bondy said the loan was made to Parnas's wife and had been intended to help the couple buy a home. He said that Firtash had cut all ties to Parnas after it started to become clear Parnas intended to assist the impeachment probe. He and Parnas have declined to comment further.

Meanwhile, Parnas's prolific photographic documentation of his time in elite GOP circles has given him ample material to taunt his detractors, often through social media posts his lawyer has set to catchy music. Last Tuesday, hours before his client's evidence became public, the lawyer tweeted a montage of photos of Parnas posing with Trump and different members of the president's family, set to the tune of Sister Sledge's 'We Are Family.'
When Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway told CNN that 'I don't know Lev Parnas,' Bondy tweeted a close-up of Parnas and Conway, their heads leaning toward one another, both smiling widely. '#LevRemembers,' his lawyer wrote.
When Trump announced that former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi was joining his legal team, his lawyer tweeted a photo of Parnas and Bondi seated at a table together, their arms around each other's shoulders.
When Trump himself told reporters on Thursday that he didn't 'know who this man is' "" an assertion he had also made shortly after Parnas was arrested "" his lawyer posted a video of Parnas chatting with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago Club in December 2016.
The video shows Parnas at the front of a crowd, introducing the president-elect to a broad-shouldered man who, according to Bondy, was then serving as the top tax official of Ukraine.
In interviews, Parnas has said he is convinced prosecutors working for Barr have pursued the criminal case against him to keep him quiet about Trump's work in Ukraine. He said he believes transparency is now his best protection against further criminal action. 
This past week, he told CNN's Anderson Cooper his goal is to make Trump understand 'he's not a king.'
 'And I think it's important for the country to find out the truth,' he said, 'exactly what happened.'

as anybody ever heard of Senator Jeff Sessions?' Donald Trump teased a boisterous crowd of thousands in Mobile, Ala., in August 2015. The people erupted in cheers. They loved their senator "" just as they were coming to love the New York real estate mogul who had been campaigning for president for only two months and was already thrashing the GOP establishment and leading the polls. Like Trump, Sessions bucked establishment Republicans "" to say nothing of the way he triggered liberal Democrats "" and the people of Alabama thanked him for it. Just the year before, they had reelected him to his fourth term, unopposed by any Republican or Democrat, with 97 percent of the vote.
'We have a man here who really helped me,' Trump told the crowd. 'He is the one person I sought his counsel. Because he's been so spot-on, he's so highly respected.' Trump scanned the football stadium. 'Where's Jeff? Get over here, Jeff.' Trump's face relaxed into a grin as he watched Sessions bound up to the stage. 'Look at him, he's like 20 years old,' marveled Trump. 'Unbelievable guy. … Come here, Jeff. Say hello.'
With a sly smile, Sessions brandished a white Make America Great Again hat. The crowd cheered. He put it on and squared his shoulders. He took off the hat before stepping to the microphone. Sessions wasn't ready to go all the way "" not yet. Total allegiance "" and an official endorsement of Trump "" came six months later at another rally, when Sessions put on a red MAGA hat. This time, he didn't take it off.
As the first sitting senator to endorse Trump, Sessions supplied an early, invaluable shot of institutional credibility at a time when other GOP lawmakers were dubious or openly hostile. Sessions traveled with Trump, advised him on national security issues, helped refine Trump's immigration message and served as an ambassador to the establishment. After Trump's victory, the president-elect presented his nominee for attorney general to a jubilant crowd back in Mobile. 'He's someone I'm very proud to call a friend,' Trump told the group. 'Jeff is an amazing man.'
How quickly the bromance soured, at least on Trump's end. Following Sessions's decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation mere weeks after his confirmation as attorney general, Trump launched a sustained war of furious disparagement and public humiliation. 'He took the job and then he said, 'I'm going to recuse myself,' ' Trump told Fox News in 2018. 'I said, 'What kind of a man is this?' ' He complained to Hill.TV: 'I don't have an attorney general. It's very sad.' Trump finally demanded Sessions's resignation in November 2018, later calling the former attorney general his 'biggest mistake.' As recently as this past October, Trump still hadn't let it go. In an interview with former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka, the president called Sessions 'an embarrassment to the great state of Alabama.'
The hypersonic rise and pitiless fall of Trump favorites is by now a familiar arc in Washington. Yet unlike so many others whom Trump has given up on, Sessions hasn't given up on Trump. He still believes. He still praises. Arguably, he has no choice, because he was an apostle of Trumpism "" tough on immigration, skeptical of trade deals "" before Trump himself entered politics.
Now Sessions seeks to be readmitted to the Eden of his own making. On Nov. 7, a year to the day after Trump fired him, Sessions, who had largely disappeared from the public stage, said on 'Tucker Carlson Tonight' that he would run again for the Senate from Alabama. He also released a video declaring his unwavering fealty to Trump. Speaking earnestly to the camera, Sessions said, 'When I left President Trump's Cabinet, did I write a tell-all book? No. Did I go on CNN and attack the president? Nope. Have I said a cross word about our president? Not one time.' In a separate video highlighting his early endorsement of Trump, he once again put on a red MAGA hat.
And yet, it is far from clear that this will be enough to recover his place in the hearts of Alabama voters. Sessions, 73, is today a somewhat diminished figure in Alabama, where the president remains more popular than in almost any other state. In the March 3 primary, Sessions faces his toughest race in decades "" against opponents including Tommy Tuberville, the well-known former football coach at Auburn University, and Bradley Byrne, the congressman from the Mobile area. The winner will take on Democrat Doug Jones, who in 2017 won a special election to finish Sessions's term against controversial former judge Roy Moore (who is also running in this year's Republican primary but is trailing).
Alabama Republicans now find themselves sorting out complicated feelings about Trump and Sessions: Can they pull the lever both for their hero president and for the former attorney general who let him down? The race is, at one level, a saga about a politician who has been cast out by Trump and now seeks to recuperate what he has lost. But it is also a test case of the difference between voters' allegiance to Trump's policies "" policies that, after all, have no more faithful advocate than Jeff Sessions "" and their personal devotion to Trump himself.


Barbara Clem appeared angry "" and she wasn't hiding it from Jeff Sessions. On a Tuesday evening in January, both Clem and the would-be senator were at a gathering of the Marshall County Republican Club in a packed oyster restaurant in Guntersville. A retired corporate counselor, Clem was wearing a red hat with 'MAGA' spelled out in costume jewels that she had applied herself. Before his remarks to the group, Sessions was greeting people and stopped by her seat. An animated discussion ensued. At one point Sessions and Clem started wagging fingers at each other.
'I'm not going to vote for somebody who goes wobbly,' Clem told me later. 'If he had talked to the president and the president said, 'You need to recuse yourself,' that would've been fine. But he didn't do that. He didn't have the courage to stand up and face the president. He hid behind this, whatever, article' "" she meant a Justice Department rule "" 'that he's putting [out], and I just don't like that.' I asked Clem if she always used to vote for Sessions. 'Yeah, he was great! But this just "" this to me has tainted his whole service as far as I'm concerned.'
'Wobbly' was an interesting word for Clem to use "" one that she probably got from Sessions himself. During his talk to the group (Byrne also spoke, and a sizable fraction of the crowd of 120 wore Byrne campaign stickers) Sessions had told the story of Margaret Thatcher instructing George H.W. Bush not to go 'wobbly' on her during the 1991 Gulf War. Sessions recalled telling voters when he first ran for Senate in 1996 that he wouldn't go wobbly on them, and he made the same vow on this night.
Yet it is exactly perceptions of wobbliness and its opposite "" resolve "" that have taken center stage in this race. Talking with scores of GOP voters from Huntsville to Mobile and back "" 100 percent of whom are enthusiastic supporters of Trump "" I found a range of opinion as people described how they are wrestling with Sessions's degree of loyalty to the president. The debate is roiling and anguished, even though the Justice Department rule that led to Sessions's recusal is clear: You can't supervise an investigation into a person or organization "" in this case, the Trump campaign "" if you're connected with it. Sessions appeared to have no choice, but that detail now seems beside the point for Trump and his most ardent supporters.
Sessions took the rare step of discussing the recusal in his address to the gathering in the restaurant. 'I usually don't talk about it, but I got asked a couple times, 'Why did you recuse yourself?' ' he told the group. 'Let me just tell you, there are rules in the Department of Justice, there are regulations in the Department of Justice. I was a part of the campaign. I was the national defense chairman of the campaign. I had an official title in the doggone campaign. ... And if the attorney general doesn't follow the rules, how can he expect anybody else to follow the rules?' The last sentence earned spontaneous applause and a cry of 'That's right!'
Sessions seemed buoyed by that response when he and I sat down at a nearby table later to chat. 'You know, the president was very frustrated and made his thoughts known,' he said. 'So that's a reality, and you can't erase that, and a lot of people believe in him. ... I don't usually talk about the recusal, and why, and defend myself about it. But I thought it was probably well received tonight when I did. Maybe we should do more of that. But I'm not into arguing about this. This is really about the future, about who can advance our agenda, who's got a record of it.' As to what he has to offer that future as a senator, he said: 'I think the Republican Party has the potential to lead the country for a decade or more, but we've got to consolidate what Trump has done, and give it legs.' He said he could help 'build a more people-oriented party that can govern and fend off what I consider to be the extreme socialist left.'
I asked if he feels as though he must, in some sense, prove himself all over again to Alabama voters after his mixed experience as attorney general. 'I don't expect to get 97 percent against some good candidates,' he said, alluding to his unopposed romp in 2014. 'And they've been at this for a year. I'm surprised, really, that we've moved so fast and seem to be in a good position. But it's a real race.'
I told him that I had met some people in the restaurant who had voted for him before but wouldn't again. 'Look, I've been around a long time,' Sessions said. 'You play the ball where it lies. And there's no doubt that a number of people, strong Trump supporters, you know, believe his critique of me. And I haven't been around [to] defensively explain it.' It had been a few years since he had been able to make his customary annual visits to all 67 Alabama counties. 'So that did leave a period of time that maybe the narrative that I did wrong on the recusal was a little deeper,' he explained. 'But I don't think it's as bad as I thought.'
Before we parted, I pointed out to Sessions that his opponents in the race are portraying themselves as more reliable backers of Trump. 'It's a question of who's authentic,' Sessions said. 'Who do you believe?'


Sessions spent the past year enjoying time with his grandchildren, traveling the country speaking to law enforcement groups, and pondering a run for Senate. 'He prayed about it a lot,' Rick Dearborn, Sessions's former chief of staff in the Senate, told me. A factor in his considerations was not wanting his public service to end on the note of being fired by Trump. 'At the end of the day, everybody in public life wants to be able to write their own chapter,' Dearborn says.
But Sessions's recent history has had the effect of making Trump the leading issue in the GOP primary: Which candidate has been or would be the strongest advocate and ally for Trump? What role might the president play in the race? Trump told associates in the fall that if Sessions tried to return to the Senate, he would attack him. So far that is looking like a Trumpian bluff.
'I hope that the president will stay out of this race,' Republican Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, a strong Sessions supporter and fervent admirer of Trump, told me in his office on Capitol Hill in December. When Sessions announced, Shelby quickly organized 10 other Republican senators to co-sign 'an open letter to conservatives' endorsing Sessions's candidacy. It was a subtle attempt at preempting a presidential endorsement going the other way. 'That'd split the caucus up,' Shelby said. If 'the president got involved and half the Senate was on the other side, that'd be a nasty fight.' Shelby "" who thinks Sessions 'probably did the right thing to recuse himself' "" is convinced that, despite Trump's scorn, his former colleague's name recognition and deep connections to conservative circles would give him the easiest path to defeating Doug Jones.
Still, Alabama Republicans have been reading the Trump tea leaves closely. They hung on the president's words when reporters asked his position on the race the day after Sessions announced. 'Well, I haven't gotten involved,' Trump said. 'I saw he said very nice things about me last night, but we'll have to see. ... I haven't made a determination.' Trump couldn't help adding: 'He's got tough competition.' Voters also parsed the significance of Trump sitting with Byrne and other elected officials in a box at the Alabama-LSU football game in November. Then, a month later, when Byrne visited the White House for an education roundtable, Trump posed with him alone for a picture in the Oval Office (and would later tout his education bill in the State of the Union). But the president offered no public endorsement.
There has been scant public polling in the race so far, mostly from potentially biased sources. The Sessions campaign released a poll in late January showing him at 43 percent, followed by Byrne at 22 percent and Tuberville at 21 percent. The poll said Sessions's overall favorability in the state was 72 percent. But the influential Alabama Farmers Federation, whose grass-roots political wing, FarmPAC, endorsed Tuberville, released a poll in early December that had Sessions at 35 percent, Tuberville at 31 percent and Byrne at 12 percent. (Another tea leaf: In late January, Trump tweeted the results of the farmers poll with the comment: 'I LOVE ALABAMA!') If no candidate surpasses 50 percent in the March 3 primary, the top two will compete in a runoff. Sessions has not faced a runoff since his first Senate campaign.
In the end, Trump may have second thoughts about sticking his neck out in another Senate race in Alabama, where his record is 0-for-2. In the special election primary runoff after Sessions vacated the seat to join his administration, Trump endorsed Luther Strange over Roy Moore, and Moore won. In the general, he endorsed Moore over Jones, despite allegations that Moore made unwanted sexual advances toward teenage girls as an adult decades ago "" and Jones won, handing the Democrats their first Senate seat from Alabama in a generation.
For now, the candidates have been energetically filling the vacuum of Trump's absence with a competition for who can pledge the strongest allegiance to the president. Sessions's announcement video set a standard that Tuberville and Byrne seem intent on surpassing.
'As attorney general, Jeff Sessions handed the ball to the other team and walked off the field the moment play started getting rough,' Tuberville, 65, said in a statement on the eve of the impeachment trial in the Senate. 'As a result, history's greatest president will face his darkest day tomorrow as liberal Democrats looking to turn our country socialist argue for his removal from office in a bogus impeachment trial. If Jeff Sessions had stood up and fought instead of letting a bunch of anti-Trump attorneys in the Justice Department bully him into recusal, the Democrats' persistent persecution of the president could have been stopped a long time ago.'
Byrne, 65, highlights his record in Congress of voting 97 percent with the president and his aggressive defense of Trump against impeachment. He was one of the Republicans who showily stormed the room where a House committee was taking impeachment testimony out of public view. 'I think Jeff was controlled by the career people, the swamp, at the Justice Department,' Byrne told me shortly before his turn came to address the crowd in the oyster restaurant in Guntersville. He told the group: 'President Trump needs a second term "" right? "" to finish the job.' The crowd broke into applause. 'But in order to do that, he's going to have to have some fighters there with him in the United States Senate!' 


Houston, Ala., set among the pines and lakeshores in the northwest part of the state, is the bull's eye of Trump Country in Alabama. It sits within Winston County, where Trump got over 89 percent of the vote in 2016, his strongest support in the state. The Houston precinct itself went even more heavily for Trump, about 95 percent, according to local officials. In recognition of that extraordinary result, Trump sent a letter of thanks to the annual Ronald Reagan Dinner, says Tim Wadsworth, who represents the area in the state legislature.
If anywhere could serve as a barometer of Sessions's support among Trump voters, it would be Houston. Sessions made one of his first campaign stops of the new year at Chef Troy's Talk of the Town Restaurant, next door to the fire hall where the Houston precinct votes. More than a dozen local officials and party activists ate lunch with the candidate at a long table. Sessions gave no speech but had brief private conversations with each guest before eating part of a hamburger steak with onions, mushrooms, gravy and turnip greens.
'I just think he knows the Trump policies, and I think he follows the Trump policies and he's a heavy Trump supporter,' Wadsworth, a fellow Trump originalist who had joined Sessions at that early rally in Mobile, told me at Chef Troy's. 'Bradley Byrne, Tommy Tuberville, none of those folks that are running were there in August of '15. These folks that want to be associated by name down the road, they weren't there from Day 1.'
Sessions 'did what he thought he was supposed to do,' Randy Lee, a member of the county school board, said of the recusal. 'He felt like that's what the Constitution told him to do, and I respect him for his decision, because it eventually cost him his job. He wouldn't be sitting right there now' "" taking small bites of his hamburger steak "" 'if he had gone along with the president, I'm sure. I think they'll work together when they get back there.'
Those were voices of official Winston County, the institutional view. Sessions has always found support (and campaign contributions) from institutional sectors of Alabama "" political, industrial, commercial, civic, agricultural (not counting the recent defection of the farmers PAC to Tuberville).
I left Chef Troy's to find what others might think. Across the street is the sprawling work yard of Houston Wood, which specializes in giving a look of weathered timelessness to fresh-cut boards. I met the operation's founder, Ellis Wade, in his trailer office. 'I'm a Trump guy,' Wade declared. 'Obamanomics was not good for us at all. ... The economy has never been this good. We had the busiest December we ever had.'
He used to be a Sessions guy, too "" 'bless his heart' "" but he said he hadn't bothered to attend the lunch for Sessions at Chef Troy's. Now, he said, 'I'm a Tuberville man.' Many factors went into his conversion, including Sessions's increasing resemblance to a 'career politician.' Wade read an interview with Tuberville in the local Daily Mountain Eagle and was impressed. When I looked up the piece later, it consisted of Tuberville taking Trumpian positions on immigration, health care, economics and trade, plus some choice zingers such as: 'There is one person that changes climate in this country and that is God.'

'I didn't see that he really needed to excuse his self,' Wade continued about Sessions. 'I think he was looking at all of the pressure that was coming from the left, and there's so much of it. Listen, I felt for him. I felt for the man, I really did.' I asked if it had been hard to hear all the harsh things Trump said about Sessions. 'It was terrible hard,' Wade said, 'because he has represented Alabama so good.'
Wade's voice was sorrowful, as if he were lamenting a family member gone astray. I heard that tone many times across Alabama, as voters puzzled over what had become of the Sessions they had known before his doomed tour in the Trump administration. 'I feel like that he's lost a lot of respect,' Wade said. 'And the thing of it is, there is probably no finer person than Jeff Sessions.'
A few miles down a winding road, in the town of Arley, I stopped at a coffee shop. A 'Trump 2020' T-shirt was for sale for $15. On the walls were a wooden American flag and a framed jersey from the local high school with the words, 'Jesus Loves Me and I Love Jesus.' Byron Farmer, a mechanic who served 17 years in the Air Force, was having the catfish with his two middle-school-aged daughters.
'Grow a backbone,' Farmer said, referring to the recusal. 'To me, that wasn't Jeff Sessions. I don't know if he just had us all buffaloed and made us believe he was something that he wasn't, and when he got up there he showed his true colors.' Farmer said he is intrigued by Tuberville but hasn't decided which of the alternatives to Sessions he'll vote for.
At another table sat Ronnie Scott and a friend. 'I probably won't support him, and I always have in the past,' said Scott. 'If he was younger, he would have a chance to rebuild his credibility, but I don't think at his age "" to me, it's a good time for him to just fade away.'


Unlike many Southern conservatives of a certain age who started as Democrats early in their careers before switching to the GOP "" including Richard Shelby and Bradley Byrne "" Sessions has been a self-consciously active Republican his entire adult life. He started reading the conservative journal National Review in high school. 'I was able to tell Mr. Buckley' "" the late National Review founder William F. Buckley Jr. "" ' 'Mr. Buckley, you warped my brain when I was a teenager, and I've never recovered from it!' ' Sessions said recently on the campaign trail.

In a television ad during his first race for the Senate, a boyish-looking Sessions dressed in a blue work shirt sketches aspects of the worldview that would define him: 'I am a conservative, I believe in fundamental values, I believe there is truth. I believe there are principles which are unchanging, that there is a God in heaven who orders this universe, that honesty and hard work and discipline of our millions of Americans is the key to success.'
His victory margins got larger with each election as he became more popular with voters and invincible to potential opponents. Presaging Trump's top campaign issue a decade before Trump took it up, Sessions was a leading opponent of any compromise on illegal immigration and a proponent of a border fence. He was already at work trying to scuttle the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal in 2015 before Trump joined the cause and delivered the coup de grace. Stephen Miller, architect and advocate for Trump's anti-immigrant, America-first portfolio in the White House, got his start as communications director in Sessions's Senate office.
There is a deep well of affection and nostalgia for this version of Sessions among Alabama primary voters "" the pre-recusal Sessions, the crusading conservative senator. For many it's enough to compensate for the ambiguities of his two-year interlude as attorney general.
'I think he's an amazing man,' said Joy Gunn, a registered nurse for the state veterans home in Bay Minette, the county seat of Baldwin County, outside Mobile, where Trump got 77 percent of the vote in 2016. She and her husband were having the lunch buffet at Street's Seafood Restaurant, where co-owner Eugene Overstreet displays his Purple Heart from the Tet offensive in Vietnam by the door. 'He cares about the people of Alabama,' Gunn said. 'He cares about the economy here. He's always been straightforward. I was kind of sad when he went to Washington because we were losing him in Alabama, and I'm really excited about the fact that he's coming back.' In case there was any doubt, she added: 'President Trump is my president. I'll vote for him 50 times, I don't care.' But she sees strength, not wobbliness, in Sessions's recusal. 'I have a lot more respect for him standing by what he believed in than if he had just buddied up with President Trump to do what he wanted him to do.'
'Sessions is my man,' said Arthur Glennon Gunn, Joy's husband and a retired Marine. He added, 'Now, I love President Trump. I'll vote for him, I don't care what he's running for.' I asked how he can reconcile his love for Trump and his support for Sessions given Trump's own opinion of Sessions. 'The president is the main man,' Gunn said. 'And if he didn't think Jeff Sessions should have excused his self, that's his opinion. He's the boss, and when he makes a decision, we all should support it, whether it's right, whether it's wrong.'
What gets lost in the Sessions narrative is that while Trump spent nearly two years belittling his attorney general, Sessions went about methodically dismantling significant portions of the legacy of Barack Obama's Justice Department. 'He was a staunch ally of the president's, and that was the cruel irony of their relationship,' Charles J. Cooper, a former assistant attorney general under President Ronald Reagan and a friend of Sessions's, told me. 'He became, and for two years I believe was, President Trump's most consequentially effective Cabinet minister.'
Under Sessions, the Justice Department rolled back federal oversight of troubled police departments, defended Trump's immigration crackdowns and travel restrictions, reversed workplace-discrimination protections for transgender people, encouraged federal agencies to take a more conservative approach to disputes over religious freedom and became more skeptical of alleged voting rights violations. In his resignation letter to Trump, Sessions emphasized other achievements, including prosecuting a record number of violent offenders, targeting transnational gangs and cracking down on enablers of the opioid epidemic. He also took credit for a drop in violent crime and homicides.
As striking as this record is "" whether one admires it or not "" voters I spoke with in Alabama had not heard much about it. Trump effectively defined Sessions as the recuser, as if Sessions had done nothing to advance the president's agenda in the 20 months afterward. 'Sessions kind of disappointed me as an AG, mainly because he didn't do an incredible amount,' said Michael Pinkston, a software engineer I met eating a bowl of ramen in Huntsville. 'But as a senator, I loved him. So I don't know if I would vote for him again.' When I mentioned some of Sessions's record as attorney general, Pinkston replied: 'It wasn't things that made the headlines. What made the headlines was recusing himself from the Russia probe.'
'I'm so disappointed that he was there and then you didn't hear anything else about Jeff Sessions for the entire time he was there,' said Sue Graham, an interpreter for the deaf from Sylacauga, who is voting for Tuberville. 'I'm sure he did something right, but I'm not aware of anything that he did.'
Other voters spoke bitterly about Sessions's failure to indict Hillary Clinton, agents of the so-called deep state and other Trump antagonists. 'No indictments came out on the deep state "" why didn't he pursue that course of action?' said Tom Byars, a corporate public relations retiree from Tuscaloosa. At first I didn't know what these voters meant, until I went back and read some more of Trump's tweets about Sessions: 'So why aren't the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillarys crimes - Russia relations?' And: 'Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren't they the subject of the investigation? Why didn't Obama do something about the meddling? Why aren't Dem crimes under investigation? Ask Jeff Sessions!' To devastating effect, Trump had masterfully turned Sessions into a character "" the Fool "" in his political drama.
The phone lines were jammed with a half-dozen callers stacked up on news-talk station 93.1 FM WACV in the state capital of Montgomery "" slogan: 'All the headlines the mainstream media won't touch!' "" where co-hosts Joey Clark and Jack Campbell chew over Alabama and national politics for three hours every weekday morning. On this Friday in January, they had asked listeners to call in to their show 'News and Views' and say whom they were voting for in the Senate primary and why. They also invited me to the studio, a detail they shared on the air. 'He's here on a fact-finding mission,' Campbell told listeners. 'You know, Yankee coming down here and getting in our business.'
Tuberville jumped out to an early lead in the radio straw poll. Because he's not a politician was the leading reason his supporters gave to vote for the man they simply refer to as 'Coach.' They also liked his open emphasis of his Christian faith and his promise to make education a priority.
Soon enough, callers for Byrne began chiming in, as if in response to the Tuberville surge. They said Byrne was better prepared for the blood sport of Washington. 'We don't need a football coach' in the Senate, said one. They praised Byrne's record of cleaning up problems in the Alabama community college system as a state official and his advocacy for Trump in Congress.
The radio hosts knew an organized call-in campaign when they saw it. 'It seems to me that the Bradley Byrne people have been calling their people, because they're all calling at the same time,' Campbell teased on the air. 'With good talking points, I might add.'
I kept waiting for Sessions partisans to mount a response, but they weren't dialing in. 'We have, like, two or three callers that are still in the Sessions camp that call regularly,' Clark told me off-air, during a station break. 'And also, a lot of his supporters I would guess tend to be a little older, have been around the block, so they don't necessarily engage quite as much in talk radio.' Clark, who said he was still undecided on his primary vote, added: 'I think Jeff Sessions may have had to recuse himself, but I think he was so quiet for so long that it was jarring to see him on Tucker Carlson making that announcement. It was like: Where's this guy been? And so he needs to do a lot to repair the reputation just from his stint with the Trump administration.'
'You know, people were kind of p---ed that he announced from Washington and not from Alabama,' said Campbell, a retired political consultant and walking almanac of state GOP politics who said he is leaning toward Tuberville. 'I was talking to a prominent lobbyist the other night. I was at a restaurant. And I won't say his name because he wouldn't want me to quote him. ... He's with a trade association. He said, 'Oh, we're going to get involved in the Senate race.' I said, 'Who are y'all supporting?' And he said, 'Sessions.' I said, 'Why?' He said, 'To tell you the truth, Richard Shelby told us to.' That's kind of interesting.'
'To me, it's a little unfortunate the race has become who's going to give Donald Trump the biggest hug,' Clark said.
Back to the phones. Clark couldn't resist playing a clip of Trump recently describing his proposed name for a combined NATO-Middle East alliance (NATOME) and explaining it would be as easy to remember as his new treaty with Canada and Mexico (USMCA). 'Like the song 'YMCA,' ' Trump said. Clark chuckled appreciatively. 'That's part of the guy's appeal,' he told listeners as he played a few bars of the Village People anthem. 'Oh, man, he's like a stand-up comic.'
After 90 minutes, Campbell announced the results of the call-in poll, for whatever they might be worth: 24 calls for Tuberville, 14 for Byrne, 3 for Sessions.


Violent thunderstorms and likely tornadoes were forecast, but that didn't stop 150 people from filling a community room in the Vestavia Hills Public Library, outside Birmingham, for the monthly meeting of the Mid Alabama Republican Club on a Saturday morning in January. They wanted to hear from Jeff Sessions, after having listened to Tommy Tuberville and Bradley Byrne at previous meetings.
Here, as everywhere, some Alabama Republicans were still making up their minds, still taking the measure of the man they used to reflexively send to the Senate. And as everywhere, it was impossible to talk about Sessions without talking about Trump "" and it was impossible for Sessions to talk about himself without talking about Trump.
Before the program, as Sessions mingled, club board member Randy Mazer, who used to own a Baskin-Robbins ice cream store, was chatting with Mike Morgan, also a board member. 'I hope he addresses the fact of his recusal,' said Mazer, who was thinking about voting for Tuberville but hadn't decided.
'We may have to ask him the question, put him on the spot,' said Morgan, who was leaning toward Byrne.
'Someone should ask him the question,' Mazer agreed. 'We come to these meetings and everybody throws softballs.'
A few minutes later, Sessions passed near and Mazer seized the opportunity. They shook hands. 'I hope you're going to address your recusal,' Mazer said point blank.
Sessions stared at him and measured his words. 'Well, we don't need to argue that every day,' he said amiably. 'I don't want to do anything that "" '

'I think a lot of people want to hear it,' Mazer interrupted.
'Okay, all right,' Sessions said. Then he leaned in close to Mazer as if to pass on a secret. 'You know what I'm seeing?' he said. 'The media has been trying to get me relentlessly to [criticize] Trump. ... I refuse because I don't want to undermine him in any way, you understand that? So it's a very difficult thing. Anyway, I get you.' After Sessions moved on, Mazer told me he agrees that the media is trying to exploit Sessions's rift with Trump "" but he still wanted to hear Sessions talk about the recusal.
Sessions had a much warmer exchange with Luisa Kay Reyes, a lawyer, who afterward told me that he had been right to recuse himself: 'I think it speaks very well for Sessions how gallant he's been about the whole matter. ... It's a quality he has, and it's why we want him back as senator.'
When it came time for Sessions to address the group as a whole, he stepped away from the lectern toward the people and adopted the deferential tone of a candidate alert to the warning signs that he has something to earn all over again. 'I really just kind of want to talk to you from my heart today,' he said quietly. 'I hope that you will consider me.'
He reminded the audience of his battles against 'amnesty' and globalism; of how, despite having supported the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, he agrees with Trump that foreign entanglements must be more carefully scrutinized; and of his prowess as a culture warrior: 'Y'all know one of the biggest things in America today is whether or not that people actually believe there is a truth and a right and wrong. This crowd, this left-wing group, are socialist, they're secularist, they believe in their revolution, and they don't believe in tradition and order and law and the Constitution. It's a big deal. I feel strongly about it, and if we do this thing right, the American people agree with us. Don't you think?' Yes! came the reply from the audience. 
But as if introducing himself for the first time, he also dwelled on his origin story as a young Republican, and his rebirth as a precocious campaigner for Trump. 'I had never endorsed another presidential candidate,' he said. He argued that he is the candidate to help usher in a lasting Trumpian future. 'I believe steadfastly that if this Republican Party will welcome the new voters Donald Trump identified ... and make them a part of our party enthusiastically, we can have a majority, a working Republican conservative majority in America for a decade, maybe two,' he said. The Trump voters he was referring to are working-class Americans, people who could form the backbone of what he calls a 'Republican workers party.'
In his 20-minute address, he never did get around to mentioning his recusal. But he offered the pledge he has been making across the state: 'I'll say one more time, if you elect me, send me again, I won't go wobbly on you.'
The audience clapped enthusiastically, and then a club official reported that the area was now under a tornado watch. The meeting was promptly adjourned with brave jokes about the weather. Outside, the air was gusty and strangely warm, thick with unpredictable energy. Sessions climbed into a silver SUV, intent on making the trip home to Mobile and weathering the storm.

The 2020 presidential campaign began more than a year ago, and it has been a whirlwind of Democratic town halls, kaffeeklatsches, candidate debates, fundraising appeals, Twitter spats and nonstop punditry "" all competing for attention against the overriding presence of President Trump. What still lies ahead could be a political season like none other.
After all the 2019 preliminaries, voters will finally begin to speak in Iowa on Monday night at that state's precinct caucuses. New Hampshire's primary will come eight days later, followed in February by caucuses in Nevada and a primary in South Carolina. 
From there, the contest for the Democratic nomination will immediately fan out across the country in a rapid series of primaries and caucuses that could make clear by the end of March the identity of the likely Democratic nominee "" or foreshadow a potentially wrenching fight among two or more candidates all the way to July's national convention in Milwaukee.
Whenever the Democrats finally settle on their nominee, that person will enter a general-election contest that Trump and his reelection campaign have been waging almost from the time the president took the oath of office three years ago. The Trump machine is likely to be the best-funded in history and, by the assessment of some Democratic strategists, might be the most sophisticated presidential campaign operation they have encountered.
 The Nov. 3 general election is seen by many voters, regardless of their party allegiance or ideology, as the most important in their lifetimes. Trump's presidency has been one of controversy and division from the very beginning, one that has further polarized an already divided country. 
All reelection campaigns are judgments on the incumbent, but this year's stands as one in which strong passions about the president, pro and con, and assessments of what his presidency means for the future override almost everything else "" the economy being one wild card "" in determining how people will vote.
Campaign 2020 is unique in many ways: the number of candidates who have sought the Democratic nomination; the increasing reliance on small-dollar donations from grass-roots activists; a primary calendar that gives no pause for candidates until the end of March; a general election that could have fewer true battlegrounds than ever. What makes this year different, Democratic media strategist Jim Margolis said, is that 'everything is on amphetamines.'
The year also will mark the first time in the nation's history that an impeached president will be seeking reelection, assuming the Senate acquits Trump at the end of the trial now underway. Twice before, presidents have been impeached but not convicted: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Neither was on the presidential ballot in the subsequent general election. Trump will be the first to try to convert the stain of impeachment into a political asset to win a second term.
Democrats hope that the desire to drive Trump from office will become the salve that repairs any lingering wounds after their nomination contest. Right now, however, there is little time to ponder that, as the candidates and campaigns are almost singularly focused on one another and on winning the nomination.




The early states
Iowa and New Hampshire kick off the year amid recurring controversy over the role those two small and predominantly white states play in the selection of presidential nominees. That debate will continue well beyond this election year. For now, the candidates know that the calendar is fixed and that the results Monday in Iowa and Feb. 11 in New Hampshire will shape everything going forward.
The last four Democratic winners of the Iowa caucuses "" Al Gore in 2000, John F. Kerry in 2004, Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016 "" all went on to win the nomination. Since 1976, there have been only two cases when the Democrat who led at the caucuses did not become the Democratic nominee, the last occurring in 1992 when no one competed against favorite-son Tom Harkin. That is why the record-large field of Democratic candidates has spent so much time, money and organizing effort focused on turning out what will be a fraction of Iowa's population.
The biggest turnout for the Democratic caucuses in Iowa was 240,000 in 2008, when Obama and Clinton (and others) waged an epic battle. Many Democratic strategists believe this year's turnout will eclipse that record. They base that assumption on the number of well-organized campaigns actively working to get people out on caucus night as well as the perceptible enthusiasm and energy among Democrats, who turned out in big numbers in the 2018 midterm elections and have swamped presidential candidate events since early 2019.
New Hampshire's role is equally important. Since the start of the modern primary in 1952, only three candidates of either party have lost the New Hampshire contest and gone on to win the presidency that same year: Bill Clinton in 1992, George W. Bush in 2000 and Obama in 2008. 

William M. Gardner, the longtime secretary of state and the guardian of New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary status, noted that the election there is about more than winning: A weak finish can be crippling. No candidate of either party who has finished below second in New Hampshire has won the presidency that year. And since 1972, no candidate of either party has finished lower than second and ended up as the nominee.

Today there are at least four Democrats who believe they could finish in one of the top two slots in both states. Former vice president Joe Biden, who finished far behind Obama and Clinton in Iowa in 2008, is one. The others are Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who narrowly lost to Clinton in Iowa in 2016 and who ran away with the New Hampshire primary the following week; Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.); and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg.
The Washington Post's average of state polls shows Biden and Sanders virtually tied in Iowa and Sanders leading Biden and the others by a few points in New Hampshire.
In Iowa, each of the four top candidates has led in one or another version of the highly regarded Iowa Poll, conducted by J. Ann Selzer for CNN, the Des Moines Register and Mediacom over the past half-year. The final Iowa Poll will be released Saturday night. 
Biden, Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg aren't the only ones working to gain a foothold in Iowa. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) is looking for a surprise finish to give her candidacy the jolt it needs to go forward. Andrew Yang, the entrepreneur turned candidate, has been stumping the state this month with his own hopes riding on what happens. Investor Tom Steyer is campaigning hard on the issue of climate change. Former congressman John Delaney of Maryland has spent more time in Iowa than other candidates, so far to little impact with voters.
Iowa's caucus rules can skew the support that candidates end up with on caucus night. Candidates who do not reach a 15 percent threshold of support in any precinct get nothing to show for it, their backers freed to shift their votes to someone else. 
The result reported by the Iowa Democratic Party reflects that realignment. In the vernacular of Iowa Democrats, the final results will be percentages of 'state delegate equivalents,' or SDEs.
But the state party also plans to report two other numbers: the percentage of supporters who show up for each candidate and the percentage of supporters for each candidate after the final vote. 
The three-part reporting raises the prospect of a free-for-all in which multiple candidates seek to gain ground by seizing on whichever numbers give them the best talking points.

New Hampshire's rules are straightforward: The candidate with the most votes wins. But the state's substantial cadre of independent voters is free to participate in the Democratic primary, and the makeup of the electorate will be influenced by how many do so. 
Tad Devine, a Democratic strategist who worked for Sanders in 2016 and now is working for Yang, predicted that Sanders victories in the first two states would open an intraparty battle. 'If he wins Iowa and New Hampshire, the lines are going to be drawn between the progressive wing and the establishment,' Devine said. 
The votes by Nevada Democrats on Feb. 22, and by South Carolina Democrats on Feb. 29, will mark the first time nonwhite voters will play substantial roles "" Latinos in the western state and African Americans in the east. The latter vote will take place only three days before the Super Tuesday contests deliver the single biggest haul of delegates.
'I think South Carolina matters so much more than it ever has,' said Jen O'Malley Dillon, who was campaign manager for former congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas before he dropped out of the race and who was deputy campaign manager for Obama in 2012. 'In part because of this short timeline but also because of the way we've built this cycle with the question of who has the support of the Obama coalition. That carries much more weight than it ever has.'

The second wave
Winning the Democratic nomination on the first ballot in Milwaukee will require amassing 1,991 pledged delegates. A second-ballot fight would open the contest to roughly 771 superdelegates "" party leaders and elected officials "" and the winner would then need a majority of the total pledged and superdelegates, according to Democratic National Committee officials. 
The first four states on the calendar account for 155 pledged delegates, or 4 percent of the total that will be selected through June. Super Tuesday on March 3 will see primaries or caucuses in 14 states, including California and Texas, and other locations. On that single day, candidates will be competing for 1,357 delegates, or 34 percent of the 3,979 pledged delegates at stake.
That means beginning March 3, the campaign will shift from its opening stages, when building momentum is the goal, to the period when accumulating delegates claims overriding importance. 
Sanders's goal is to win Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, aiming to ride into Super Tuesday as the leading candidate and then to position himself as the front-runner. Faiz Shakir, Sanders's campaign manager, said that, if they're successful in the early states, 'getting into California and Texas and putting ourselves into position to expand our delegate lead would be crucial.' 
Biden's team has said he can afford to lose Iowa and possibly New Hampshire, and recoup in South Carolina, where he continues to enjoy strong support from black voters. 'We knew that the strength of our campaign is the diversity of our support,' said Greg Schultz, Biden's campaign manager. 'No matter what happens in the first two, it's not until Nevada, South Carolina and Super Tuesday that the country as a whole is represented. We have built our campaign for that.'
Buttigieg's team knows he must do exceedingly well in Iowa to demonstrate that a young, gay former mayor of a fairly small city can truly be a competitive candidate for the presidency. 'We really are counting on the mayor doing well in the first two contests,' said Mike Schmuhl, Buttigieg's campaign manager, 'to show that he can beat other people and to buttress our electability argument and also our change argument, that people are looking for something different.'
Like Biden, Warren has signaled she is looking to play a long game, though she cannot afford to fall far behind in the earliest states. Her campaign is betting that the results in the first four states will be enough of a muddle to set up the March primaries as a possible showdown. 'We think Super Tuesday and all the March states as a whole are important,' said Kristen Orthman, Warren's communications director. 'We've allocated resources as such basically throughout the year.' 
She added that the campaign began building operations in Super Tuesday states many months ago and that Warren has visited every state voting March 3, with the exception of Maine and Vermont, both adjacent to Massachusetts, and Arkansas. 'That wasn't by accident,' she said.

Super Tuesday also will be the first day that Mike Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, will be on ballots. Bloomberg is skipping the first four contests, a strategy no successful candidate has pursued in the modern era. He has already dropped more than a quarter of a billion dollars into television ads and organizing in Super Tuesday states and has the capacity to do what no other candidate can afford to do to reach voters.
But Bloomberg's hopes of becoming competitive rest almost entirely on whether, after the first four contests, Biden is doing well or gasping for support, and if any other moderate "" Buttigieg or Klobuchar, for example "" has swept into contention.
'It may be that what we have seen since 1976 largely repeats itself, that these two contests [Iowa and New Hampshire] help pick who will go on and win the nomination,' said Kevin Sheekey, Bloomberg's campaign manager. 'Or this may be a very different kind of year. At least one candidate is running a nominal test of running a national campaign.'
The sprawling nature of the Super Tuesday competition and the lack of time for any campaign besides Bloomberg's to invest broadly will require candidates to make difficult choices about where they spend time and money. 'The whole exercise is targeting resources,' said Robby Mook, who was the 2016 Clinton campaign manager. 'You cannot do everything.'
Past years have given candidates some time to regroup after the first primaries and to campaign in the swath of states that follow. Not this year. There are just three days between the last of the initial four elections and the Super Tuesday contests, meaning the winner of South Carolina will have an edge in media coverage.
 'A win in South Carolina is the last thing people are going to hear before Super Tuesday,' said Lily Adams, who was communications director for the campaign of Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who dropped out in December. 
The pace doesn't slow after Super Tuesday. The next two Tuesdays will account for an additional 23 percent of the delegates available; the surviving candidates will have to run a gantlet of big states like Michigan, Illinois, Florida, Ohio and Arizona. By the end of March 17, 61 percent of the pledged delegates will have been selected.
'March 3 to March 17 is as brutal a thing as we've seen in presidential politics, with big states, all the time zones and territories,' said David Plouffe, Obama's 2008 campaign manager, who helped guide the 2012 reelection from a perch in the White House. 'I can't describe how different running that race is from the race they're running now.'

The delegate battle
Except in Texas, which apportions party delegates by state Senate district, most delegates are determined proportionally by results in congressional districts, with the remainder awarded to the statewide winner. This arithmetic of allocation means it can be difficult for a candidate to gain a significant advantage "" and even more difficult for a trailing candidate to catch up or overtake the leader. 
That makes delegate hunting a complex matrix that requires campaigns to know the demographics of every district in the country and how they match up with the appeal of their candidate. Most important, it requires decisions about where it's worth competing hard and where it isn't. 
Under the party's proportional rules, some districts award an even number of delegates and others award an odd number. In those with an even number, gaining a split is relatively easy "" while winning an advantage requires blowing away the competition. In odd-number districts, a narrow victory can produce an extra delegate.
Moreover, districts where Democrats get their highest percentages in presidential races have extra delegates to award. Many of these have a high proportion of minority voters, especially African Americans. That was a strength for Clinton against Sanders in 2016 and could be valuable to Biden if he holds on to strong support from black Democratic voters.
Insurgent or inspirational candidates, like Obama in 2008 and Sanders in 2016, took advantage of the many caucuses on the calendar to add to their delegate counts. Caucuses tend to draw more energized party activists, even as they disenfranchise voters who are not able to attend at the time they are held. This year, however, the DNC "" with the assent of Sanders's representatives "" cut the number of states with caucuses from 14 to seven.

'Every campaign will look at what are their strengths demographically and regionally, and try to put together a profile of where they will do well by state and by congressional district,' said Jeff Berman, who helped craft Obama's successful delegate strategy in 2008. 
Berman added that campaigns must look for opportunities to win states 'so their candidate appears on the election night results chart as a winner in multiple states.' Still, the race remains all about winning delegates.
In recent campaigns, the early election night commentary focused on a candidate's wins in premier states, but when the delegates from all the contests that night were counted, a different picture emerged. One night in 2016, for example, Clinton netted far more delegates from her less-noticed win in Mississippi than Sanders did in his high-profile victory in Michigan.
Several candidates are likely to have the resources to continue their campaigns well into the spring and, potentially, all the way to the July convention. The big question is whether there will be a protracted fight, even if one candidate has a clear, if modest, delegate lead by the end of the March contests.
'After the first four [states] and out of Super Tuesday, I think you'll begin to see some clarity emerging in the delegate advantage and other advantages,' said Michael Donilon, one of Biden's senior advisers. 'And I think there will be a force that exerts itself, that voters will want to move toward a resolution and not leave this open-ended for a long time.'
Yet even if there is some clarity about a likely nominee there's no guarantee that the leader will have the 1,991 delegates needed to win on a first ballot wrapped up by the end of the primaries. Would the hundreds of superdelegates who could vote on a second ballot turn to someone other than the delegate leader? That's a particularly pertinent issue for someone like Sanders, whose possible nomination causes angst among the establishment Democrats who dominate that category. 
'That is the path we are trying to avoid,' said his campaign manager, Shakir. 'The goal is to win Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, sweep into Super Tuesday and crush it. That has dictated every spending decision, resource decision of this campaign.'


Trump and the general election

As Democrats wage their contest, Trump's campaign will be operating on a separate track, free from any serious challenge for the nomination and focused on the general election. But he will be in the faces of the Democrats at every opportunity, whether through Twitter commentary on his potential rivals or with state-by-state rallies. 
He will be on the caucus ballot in Iowa the same night the Democrats hold their caucuses, and he held a rally in Des Moines Thursday "" days before the vote. Another rally is set for Manchester the night before the New Hampshire primary.
Trump has challengers for the nomination "" among them former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld and former congressman Joe Walsh of Illinois "" but his grip on the Republican Party is so strong that he is free to ignore them. The GOP is helping to assure that; a number of states have either scrapped their primaries or given more control to state party leaders to allocate convention delegates.
Through the end of last year, the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee raised half a billion dollars, and they began the election year with $200 million in the bank. Collectively, Democrats contributed $1 billion to candidates and organizations through online donations, but whoever becomes the Democratic nominee, with the exception of Bloomberg, is likely to begin the general election cash-strapped by comparison with the president. 

Trump's operation has been building and building, identifying the voters it believes will determine the outcome in November in the states Trump must win to assemble another electoral college majority. 'Time is one of the great advantages the president's reelection campaign has enjoyed, and we have not squandered it,' Tim Murtaugh, the campaign's communications director, said in an email message.
Murtaugh reiterated that the reelection operation will target not only the swing states Trump won narrowly but other states that Democrats captured four years ago, where the president's team hopes to put them on the defensive. Pointing to the financial disparity between Trump's campaign and that of the likely Democratic nominee, he added, 'The Democrats will not be able to match the president in resources or organization.'
In many of those states, there has been minimal to no Democratic presence yet. Bloomberg's hefty advertising campaign is beginning to compensate in some of the most important general-election battlegrounds. The billionaire ex-mayor is setting up field offices in those states and has promised to keep them open until November, even if he isn't the nominee.
'It has become clearer to me how strong Trump is in the . . . swing states and how much work he has done,' said Bloomberg's campaign manager, Sheekey. 'The more time I spend in Wisconsin or Michigan or North Carolina, the more I realize how difficult those states are going to be to win.'
Trump also will start with the advantage of a more sophisticated understanding of which voters he needs beyond his core supporters to win a general election. His campaign already is testing various messages on many issues. 
The Democratic nominee will start well behind on that front, relying instead on any organic Trump opposition to help narrow the margin. Plouffe recalled that after Obama won the nomination in 2008, and after campaigning in every state, it was like starting over to attract a new set of voters. 
'The voters who make the difference don't know you,' he said. 'Yeah, you've got staff and volunteers, but you're not talking to voters who will be front and center in the general election.'
That will be the challenge for whoever becomes the Democratic nominee. But that is at least several months into the future, and only after the biggest field in the history of the Democratic Party is narrowed to the last person standing.

Reporters penned off, unable to roam the Senate halls freely. No press photography or recording devices within the chamber. A (nearly) single-focus view of the historic proceedings "" offered only by government video cameras, with not even C-SPAN allowed in to jazz things up.
It's the ultimate contradiction: The Senate impeachment trial of the media-obsessed president is a remarkably bloodless TV spectacle.
There can be little doubt that these restrictive rules are the brainchild-of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has declared himself firmly on the side of President Trump.
And they have an end in mind: Make the trial seem as boring and pallid as possible.-
'We are not able to see what is the emotion, what is the state of consciousness of the members of the Senate,' Fox News analyst Chris Wallace commented during a Tuesday broadcast.
To their credit, journalists and news organizations found-ways around the restrictions and did their jobs anyway.
The New York Times, among others, sent a sketch artist to capture images,-including a senator nodding off only a few hours in.-
Punditry continued apace on cable and broadcast news "" analysts held forth, lawyers parsed the arguments. Nothing can stem that tide of talking heads.
And innumerable stories got written or broadcast, perhaps with less color than they might have had otherwise, but getting the facts across effectively.
But that doesn't make the restrictions any more right, as Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) complained in a letter to the Senate-sergeant at arms: 'To place limitations on the press is to place limitations on the American people's ability to learn about the character and conduct of their elected leaders.'
Security concerns are-said to be behind all of this "" a lame argument given that these credentialed reporters go-through security checks whenever they enter the Capitol complex.
And it's hard to understand why more camera angles pose a threat to safety.
No, this isn't about security at all. It's about trying to keep at bay a sense of historic importance. It's about trying to weary and stultify the American public into not caring about what's happening.
Ever helpful to the Trumpian cause, Steve Doocy made that case Wednesday morning on 'Fox - Friends':-'It was unbelievably boring. I don't know how people can follow it.'
Having the proceedings continue well into the evening hours is another part of the same effort to dull the senses, to file the edges off what could hardly be-more significant.
Yet for those watching closely "" those who were still tuned in to-cable-after 9 p.m., long after the networks had resumed their prime-time programming "" Tuesday's proceedings offered worthwhile moments, ones that didn't need special camera angles to succeed.
Take the 'mic drop moment' by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) who picked up on the mocking question by Trump's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow in his opening-statement: 'Why are we here?'
'We are here, sir, because President Trump pressured a foreign government to target an American citizen for political and personal gain,'-Jeffries said. 'We are here, sir, because President Trump solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election and corrupted our democracy.'- 
And, he added, we are here to 'follow the facts, apply the law, be guided by the Constitution and present the truth to the American people.'
He concluded, 'That is why we are here, Mr. Sekulow.' Then he delivered a line, one also familiar to 'Hamilton' fans, from late rapper Notorious B.I.G.: 'And if you don't know, now you know.'-

Conservative columnist Quin Hillyer of the Washington Examiner called the Jeffries speech a 'tour de force.'
Those who had stuck with the first day's proceedings up to that point-"" or who had tuned in to take a peek "" couldn't have declared themselves bored.-
It wasn't the only memorable or effective moment. In particular, the video flashbacks of testimony made by diplomats and White House officials "" used in House managers' exhibits "" were effective reminders of what's at stake. (On Twitter, Susan Glasser of the New Yorker noted, with a touch of sarcasm, that these were exclusively devices used by Democrats: 'The President's legal team forgot to bring their slides to the Senate trial. They don't have video clips for senators to look at either.')
As the trial begins in earnest, there's plenty of reason to stay involved and stay focused.
The American public may not be delighted or riveted by the trial, but they're unavoidably aware "" as has been made clear in recent public opinion polls that show more Americans support removing Trump from office than approve of him.
And although removal is extremely-unlikely, Americans will remember at least some of what they've seen and heard.
That, to most Senate Republicans and President Trump, is quite a vexing problem.
And it's one that can't be solved by artless camera angles or reporters kept behind ropes.

MANCHESTER, N.H. "" President Trump, who held a campaign rally here just hours before the first-in-the-nation primary, has inserted himself into the Democrats' nominating contest with a fervor that exceeds his predecessors "" many of whom were reluctant to directly involve themselves in another party's political selection process.
For Trump, visits to early-voting states allow him to inject his trademark bombast into a crowded and muddled field of Democrats, while also conducting a kind of political warfare against a party that is enduring bouts of disunity and uncertainty at the very moment that Republicans appear most unified behind him.
Before leaving for New Hampshire, Trump wrote on Twitter that he wanted to 'shake up the Dems a little bit.' The president also held a rally in Iowa last month ahead of that state's critical caucuses. 
'They always talk about the Democrats, they have enthusiasm, right?' Trump told a crowd at the SNHU Arena here. 'We have so much more enthusiasm, it's not even close. They're all fighting each other. They're all going after each other. You got them all over the place. They don't know what the hell they're doing. They don't know what they're doing. They can't even count their votes.'

Trump's campaign argues that the draw of Air Force One, a stable of Cabinet officials and White House aides, and a president known for lively rallies combine to boost Trump's supporters and deflate his detractors in key states where Democrats are trying to build momentum. 
Democrats have tried to capitalize on Trump's presence as well, using his visits to cast themselves as an alternative to his divisive brand of politics. 
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who has been leading in the polls in New Hampshire, spent considerable time contrasting himself with Trump ahead of the president's visit Monday. 
'I will not be lying to the American people every single day about everything,' Sanders said in Manchester.
Jeff Weaver, a Sanders adviser, said Trump's visit makes it easier for voters to imagine what a general election would look like.
'Trump's presence in New Hampshire is an opportunity to contrast Senator Sanders's agenda against Trump's record of division and betraying working families,' he said.
A Quinnipiac University poll released Monday found Sanders and several other Democratic candidates beating Trump nationally in a head-to-head matchup.
But the power of incumbency and the fervor of Trump's political base have presented uncomfortable images for the group of Democrats trying to convince voters they would be the best positioned to defeat the president. 
Hours before Trump's rally in Manchester, hundreds of people lined up in the cold, waiting to get into the arena. The scene mirrored a similar event last month in Des Moines, where the Trump campaign had to turn away supporters after Drake University's Knapp Center reached capacity. While Democrats have not had crowds as large as the throngs showing up to Trump's rallies, often many hours in advance, they have seen strong enthusiasm at events.
In Des Moines, Trump used his 80-minute speech to attack several of the Democratic candidates, including former vice president Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind. 
After the caucuses, which were plagued by technical difficulties on the Democrats' side, Trump reveled in his opponents' misfortune and praised his 97-percent showing among Iowa Republicans.
Before leaving Washington on Monday, Trump repeatedly referenced the large crowds in Manchester, including by retweeting an ABC News reporter who wrote: 'Despite the miserable weather, there are already more people lining up outside the venue of @realDonaldTrump's rally tonight than you see at most of the events for the Democratic candidates.'
Trump's campaign has followed suit, with aides and surrogates traveling en masse to early states to tout the president's record and to handicap the Democratic races.
'If Biden doesn't win big, I mean, he's probably in a lot of trouble,' Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. said last week in West Des Moines, Iowa, just hours before the first-in-the-nation caucuses in which Biden ultimately placed fourth. 
Vice President Pence, who toured parts of New Hampshire ahead of Trump's rally, will travel to Nevada on Feb. 21 for two political events a day before the Democrats' Nevada caucuses.
'We did the same thing in Iowa, and it's safe to say you'll see us around quite a bit,' said Marty Obst, Pence's top political aide. 
Campaign officials said they were pleased with the reception Trump received in Iowa ahead of the caucuses, noting that the president was featured on the front page of the Des Moines Register after his rally. 
Trump liked that the Democrats, who spent millions of dollars to compete in competitive and critical first-in-the-nation caucuses, were pushed off the front pages by Trump's reelection machine, according to the officials. 
'The thinking is, if everyone in the world has their eyes on the state, why aren't we there?' said a campaign official who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. 
While Trump won Iowa by more than nine percentage points in 2016, his narrow 0.4-point loss in New Hampshire has made the state a top target for Trump campaign officials looking for ways to expand the electoral map.
For that reason, Tuesday's primary "" where Trump faces nominal opposition from former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld "" is serving as a kind of training ground for the volunteers, campaign aides and supporters Trump is hoping will power his reelection, said Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman.
'We will have dozens of top surrogates in the state and have made tens of thousands of voter contacts by phone and door knocking, recruiting volunteers and continuing to build the Trump army,' Murtaugh said.
The Trump campaign's effort to counter the Democratic race extended to a 'Cops for Trump' gathering on Monday afternoon in Portsmouth, N.H. Pence and White House senior adviser Ivanka Trump both spoke at the event, which was attended by about 200 police officers, before later joining the president in Manchester.
The Trump campaign has been active in New Hampshire for weeks, sending legions of surrogates to the state and booking them on state-based talk radio programs and at local Republican events. 
For Trump and his loyalists, New Hampshire holds a particularly special place in their collective political memory: It was his first primary victory and a significant boost that pushed him toward the 2016 Republican nomination. Its industrial history, working-class demographics and independent streak have kept it a prime target for the Trump campaign.
Flashes of Trump's dominance of the GOP were everywhere as Pence toured the state with Ivanka Trump and Corey Lewandowski, the president's former campaign manager.
At the Sheraton Portsmouth Harborside Hotel, former New Hampshire GOP senator Kelly Ayotte "" who was long an ally of establishment military hawks in the Senate "" enthusiastically talked up the president's record, putting an emphasis on the administration's foreign policy, such as the president's decision to order a strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force.
Ayotte also cast the Democrats as socialists, taking direct aim at Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist.
'Make no mistake, socialism is on the ballot,' she said.
Pence, who accepted the endorsement of the New England Police Benevolent Association, attacked Sanders over his opposition to the strike that killed Soleimani.
'Today's Democratic Party has been taken over by radical leftists,' Pence said in Portsmouth. 
There were tensions and signs of the nation's intense political divide. Early on in Pence's remarks, several protesters started to shout 'Trump endangers Jews.' Some police officers in the room, sitting near the disruption, grabbed the protesters' homemade signs, pulling them out of their hands. The protesters were quickly pulled out of the room by security. 
Trump has used his pre-vote rallies to highlight that the Republican Party is unified behind him while Democrats were struggling to rally behind a standard-bearer. He has also tested out attack lines against several of the Democratic candidates, tending to focus most on whichever contender is atop the polls.
Lewandowski, who has served as a senior adviser to Trump's 2020 bid, said Trump's willingness to insert himself into the Democratic primary races will ultimately help him in November. 
'Donald Trump has once again demonstrated his ability to drive a narrative, coming to New Hampshire and taking the spotlight away from the socialists and reminding America about what he has delivered,' he said. 'If the president doesn't go out and tell his message, nobody will.'

In Senate trial, defense clings to argument about corruption in Ukraine
Mounting evidence released amid the ongoing presidential impeachment hearings indicates that the pressure President Trump and his aides put on Ukraine was driven by a focus on his political rivals, even as Trump's defenders say the president was acting out of general concern about corruption in that country.
The White House is emphasizing that argument anew as the defense makes its case in the Senate trial. 
'Asking a foreign leader to get to the bottom of issues of corruption is not a violation of an oath,' Jay Sekulow, an attorney for Trump, told the senators Monday.
But that assertion was dramatically undercut by reports Sunday about a draft book manuscript by former national security adviser John Bolton. In it, he recounts that Trump told him he was holding up military aid to Ukraine until the country's leaders agreed to open investigations into Democrats, including former vice president Joe Biden, according to people familiar with the book.
Trump has denied that account, which was first reported by the New York Times, tweeting Monday, 'I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens.'
'The transcripts of my calls with President Zelensky are all the proof that is needed,' he added.
But a rough transcript of the July call released by the White House shows that Trump specifically urged the Ukrainian president to pursue two investigations: one into the Bidens and the other into a discredited theory involving an Internet security company that probed the Democratic National Committee hack in 2016. 
He never mentions the word 'corruption,' the transcript shows.
Text messages and congressional testimony also show that, behind the scenes, the president's envoys repeatedly rejected efforts by Ukrainian officials to commit to broadly cracking down on corruption "" insisting instead that their public statements mention the Ukrainian gas company where Biden's son was on the board and allegations about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
In exchange, the Ukrainians were hoping to secure a coveted meeting at the White House for President Volodymyr Zelensky, which has still not occurred.
Trump's allies have suggested that a president concerned about corruption would be irresponsible to ignore the allegations of wrongdoing about Biden. However, the president only began speaking out about the role of Biden's son on the board of a Ukrainian gas company after the former vice president emerged as a potential 2020 rival.
While Trump has fixated on Biden, he has expressed sympathy for his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who pleaded guilty to failing to pay taxes on $30 million he earned in political consulting fees in Ukraine, where he worked with an array of officials around former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled the country amid corruption accusations.
 Trump has repeatedly said in recent months that he was urging Ukraine to look at corruption broadly.
'I don't care about Biden's campaign, but I do care about corruption,' he told reporters outside the White House in October.
The president reiterated that in recent weeks, telling reporters at his Florida resort on Jan. 1, 'We did nothing wrong,' adding: 'We have to check corruption.'
His Republican allies have echoed that argument.
'A president always has the constitutional authority and in fact, the responsibility to investigate serious evidence of corruption,' Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) said Monday. 

However, the political aim of the Ukraine pressure campaign is underlined in the newest batch of text messages released by the House from Lev Parnas, a onetime associate of Trump's personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
The messages show a concerted effort to secure statements regarding Biden from then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko for U.S. news outlets, just as special counsel Robert S. Mueller III geared up to release his report about Russian interference and Biden prepared to announce his presidential run. 
At one point, Lutsenko wrote to Parnas that he was prepared to 'screw over your opponent,' in an apparent reference to Biden. 
Texts between the two men also show they discussed a clear deal: In exchange for making the damaging statements about Biden, Lutsenko was seeking the ouster of the then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, as well as a visit to the United States to meet Attorney General William P. Barr and other unspecified help for his boss, Poroshenko, who was fighting for his political life in a presidential election he would ultimately lose. 
The messages show that Giuliani became angry when Lutsenko reversed his previous public suggestions of wrongdoing by Biden.
None of the exchanges between the men make mention of U.S. aims to end corruption in Ukraine.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Parnas said that Giuliani emphasized the importance of the Ukrainians singling out Biden in a face-to-face meeting with Zelensky adviser Andriy Yermak in the lobby of a five-star luxury hotel in Madrid in early August.
'They had to include a statement about Burisma and Biden,' said Parnas, who was at the meeting. 
Burisma is a gas company owned by a former Ukrainian government minister accused by authorities and anti-corruption activists there of abusing his office to build his energy fortune. ​Hunter Biden served on the firm's board from 2014 to 2019. 
Parnas's account matches what Giuliani told The Post in September, when he said that he urged Yermak to pursue investigations into Burisma and alleged coordination between Democrats and Ukrainians in 2016.
'Your country owes it to us and to your country to find out what really happened,' Giuliani said he told Yermak during the Madrid meeting. 
Yermak, according to Giuliani, indicated that the Ukrainians were open to pursuing the investigations. The aide reiterated the Ukrainians' plea for a meeting with Trump, a summit that would be an important signal to Russia of Washington's support for Ukraine.
Parnas said Giuliani told Yermak that he planned to follow up with two U.S. diplomats, Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland, and that the three Americans would discuss the precise wording of Zelensky's statement. 
'They were supposed to work it out,' Parnas said.
After the Madrid meeting, Yermak texted Volker that the Ukrainians would announce probes into Burisma, as well as the 2016 election, according to messages released by House investigators.
'Once we have a date, will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations,' he wrote.
'Sounds great!' Volker responded.
But two days later, Yermak sent Volker a draft statement that referred only generally to 'the problem of interference in the political processes of the United States,' text messages show. 
Volker and Sondland consulted with Giuliani on the statement. The president's lawyer did not find it 'convincing,' Volker recalled in his testimony.
'Mr. Giuliani was the one giving the input as to what the president wanted in the statement. He wanted Burisma and 2016 election mentioned in the statement. And I don't believe the Ukrainians were prepared to do that,' Sondland told House investigators.
In a group text with Sondland, Volker sent new language to Yermak that included an 'insert at the end for the 2 key items' "" specific references to Burisma and the 2016 election.
But privately, Volker said, he warned Yermak that releasing the statement 'was not a good idea' and could entangle the Ukrainians in U.S. domestic politics. 
'Because of conversations with Giuliani, I wanted to make sure that I was cautioning the Ukrainians, 'Don't get sucked in,' ' Volker recounted.
​The Ukrainians ultimately did not release the statement "" and Zelensky has still not received an official White House meeting. 
Text messages released by the House show that the pressure on Ukrainian officials to make a statement about Trump's Democratic opponents began in early 2019, before Zelensky's election.
Texts written in Russian show Lutsenko urging Parnas early last year to force out Yovanovitch in exchange for cooperation regarding Biden. At one point, Lutsenko suggested he wouldn't make any helpful public statements unless 'madam' is removed.
The messages show that Lutsenko became frustrated as the ambassador remained in her post for months, and Parnas failed to get him a meeting with Barr and help Poroshenko.
Lutsenko wrote on March 13 that he was 'sick of this,' using an expletive. 'I haven't received a visit,' he added. 'My boss hasn't received jack. I'm prepared to screw over your opponent. But you just want more and more. We're over. I'll deal with you later. This isn't honest.'
After Poroshenko lost, putting Lutsenko's political future in doubt, he gave an interview to Bloomberg News saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens in Ukraine.
Giuliani became incensed, the text messages show. Parnas immediately texted Lutsenko: '911 911 call me.' He demanded to see Lutsenko in person in the middle of the night. 
'Yura tell me where I should come I have to see you urgently,' Parnas wrote in a frenzy, using a nickname for Yuri. 'Yura it is very very very important.'

REPORT JOINS word it favors TRUMP
Senator condemns efforts to sway U.S. election
U.S. officials have told Sen. Bernie Sanders that Russia is attempting to help his presidential campaign as part of an effort to interfere with the Democratic contest, according to people familiar with the matter.
President Trump and lawmakers on Capitol Hill also have been informed about the Russian assistance to the senator from Vermont, those people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence.
It is not clear what form that Russian assistance has taken. U.S. prosecutors found a Russian effort in 2016 to use social media to boost Sanders's campaign against Hillary Clinton, part of a broader effort to hurt Clinton, sow dissension in the American electorate and ultimately help elect Donald Trump.
'I don't care, frankly, who [Russian President Vladimir] Putin wants to be president,' Sanders said in a statement. 'My message to Putin is clear: Stay out of American elections, and as president I will make sure that you do.
'In 2016, Russia used Internet propaganda to sow division in our country, and my understanding is that they are doing it again in 2020. Some of the ugly stuff on the Internet attributed to our campaign may well not be coming from real supporters.'
The disclosure of Russian assistance to Sanders follows a briefing to lawmakers last week in which a senior intelligence official said that Russia wants to see Trump reelected, viewing his administration as more favorable to the Kremlin's interests, according to people who were briefed on the comments.
In that closed hearing for the House Intelligence Committee, lawmakers were also told that Sanders had been informed about Russia's interference. The prospect of two rival campaigns both receiving help from Moscow appears to reflect what intelligence officials have previously described as Russia's broader interest in sowing division in the United States and uncertainty about the validity of American elections.
At a rally Friday in Nevada, Trump called reports that Putin wanted to help him 'disinformation.'
'Wouldn't he rather have Bernie, who honeymooned in Moscow?' Trump asked, referring to the senator's travels in the former Soviet Union.
Sanders told reporters Friday after The Post's report was published that he received the briefing 'about a month ago.' Asked why he did not disclose the briefing publicly, Sanders replied, 'Because I go to many intelligence briefings which I don't reveal to the public.'
Sanders offered few details about what officials told him.
'Well, it was not clear what role they're going to play,' he said, referring to Russia. 'We were told that Russia, maybe other countries, are going to get involved in this campaign. And look, here's the message, to Russia "" stay out of American elections.'
Asked why the briefing was reported now, a month later, Sanders said: 'I'll let you guess about one day before the, the Nevada caucus. Why do you think it came out?' Sanders pointed to a Post reporter and said sarcastically: 'It was The Washington Post? Good friends.'
'We report news when we learn it,' said Kristine Coratti, a spokeswoman for The Post.
A spokesperson for the FBI declined to comment. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not respond to requests for comment.
The intelligence assessment that Russia had a preference for Trump infuriated the president. Trump lambasted his then-acting intelligence director, Joseph Maguire, and DNI staff for sharing that information with lawmakers, believing that Democrats would use it to hurt Trump in the election.
The president has been told that the Russians are also trying to sow discord among Democrats and want to influence the primaries, a senior administration official said. Intelligence officials also have told Trump that Russia wanted to help Sanders, the official said, declining to say when Trump was informed.
Sanders has frequently warned about the threat of foreign interference in U.S. elections and criticized Trump for not doing enough to stop it.
'Let me be clear: We must not live in denial while allowing Russia and other state actors to undermine our democracy or divide us,' the senator said in January. 'Russia targets the divisions in our society; we will work to heal those divisions.'
Sanders's opponents have blamed some of his most vocal online supporters for injecting toxic rhetoric into the primaries. At a Democratic candidates debate Wednesday in Las Vegas, Sanders indirectly blamed Russia, saying it was possible that malign actors were trying to manipulate social media to inflame divisions among Democrats.
'All of us remember 2016, and what we remember is efforts by Russians and others to try to interfere in our elections and divide us up,' Sanders said. 'I'm not saying that's happening, but it would not shock me.'
In recent weeks, Sanders's rivals have raised concerns about the behavior of his supporters, blaming them for viciously attacking an influential Nevada culinary union that criticized his health-care plan and said the senator did not do enough to tamp down the online rhetoric of his most ardent advocates.
The senator has responded by distancing himself from such actions, questioning on several occasions whether the online rhetoric was coming from genuine Sanders supporters.
Sanders spent Friday campaigning in California and planned to finish the day in Nevada with an evening rally designed to build excitement for his campaign ahead of Saturday's caucuses.
Despite Trump's skepticism of Russian efforts to damage American democracy, officials in his administration have repeatedly warned that Russia has ongoing plans to interfere in U.S. elections and foster divisions among Americans, part of a strategic goal to undermine U.S. standing in the world. Some analysts believe the Kremlin's goal is to cause maximum disruption within the United States and that it throws the support of its hackers and trolls behind candidates based on that goal, not any particular affinity for the people running.
'Russian attempts to sow discord in the Democratic primary would be consistent with its strategy of undermining Americans' faith in democratic institutions and processes,' said Laura Rosenberger, a former National Security Council aide in the Obama administration who is now an election security expert with the Alliance for Securing Democracy. 'We have seen consistent messaging from Russian sources pushing the narrative that the primary process is rigged, and driving the idea that the 'establishment' favors some candidates over others.'
​'Many of us have been warning for some time that the Russians would likely try to drive divisions and discord in the Democratic primary, as they did in 2016,' Rosenberger said.
Russia has tried to assist Sanders in the past.
In a February 2018 indictment of 13 Russian individuals and three companies alleged to have orchestrated the 2016 social media scheme, prosecutors charged that the group 'engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.'
Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III also alleged that, working with WikiLeaks, the Russian government purposely released stolen internal Democratic Party emails on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in July 2016, so as to exacerbate party divisions and a sense of grievance by Sanders supporters.

Sen. Mitt Romney sealed a place in history Wednesday by voting to convict President Trump of abuse of power, becoming a lone voice of dissent in a Republican Party that otherwise has marched in lockstep with the president throughout the impeachment proceedings.
Romney voted against the second article of impeachment, which accused the president of obstruction of Congress. But on the first article, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee said that he found the evidence against Trump overwhelming and the arguments by the president's defense ultimately unconvincing. 
Romney's decision, announced in a deeply personal speech on the Senate floor, where he spoke of his faith and constitutional duty, sparked an immediate and intense outcry among Trump's supporters "" fury that Romney acknowledged is unlikely to fade.
Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, called for Romney to be 'expelled' from the GOP, while many of Trump's congressional allies cast him as a bitter and irrelevant relic of a Republican establishment that has all but crumbled before Trump in recent years.
The senator from Utah stood by his decision as Republican criticism mounted Wednesday, maintaining that Trump abused his office by pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political rival.
'I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me,' Romney said in his floor remarks, calling Trump's conduct 'grievously wrong.'
Romney added, 'We're all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on Earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that is distinction enough for any citizen.'
Romney's vote "" coming after other centrist GOP senators such as Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) decided to acquit Trump even as they scolded him for acting inappropriately "" was hailed by many Democrats as an example of unflinching political courage from a Republican they have long battled.
Following Romney's speech, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), walked off the Senate floor in tears and remained speechless for several seconds.
'He literally restored my faith in the institution,' Schatz said.
Presidential historian Jon Meacham said Romney is an 'emblem of what so many of us feared was an entirely vanished kind of moderate voice that is guided by reason and not passion. What he did was in the tradition of Dwight Eisenhower, his own father, and George H.W. Bush and Gerald Ford.'
'There's no question that the president asked a foreign power to investigate his political foe,' Romney said in an interview with The Washington Post ahead of his floor statement. 'That he did so for a political purpose, and that he pressured Ukraine to get them to help or to lead in this effort. My own view is that there's not much I can think of that would be a more egregious assault on our Constitution than trying to corrupt an election to maintain power. And that's what the president did.'
The crux of the case against Trump was the allegation that he withheld military aid and a White House meeting to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son. Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, while his father was vice president.
Romney was one of two Republican senators who supported the effort to summon witnesses and documents. He was the only Republican who crossed party lines Wednesday to join Democrats in voting to convict Trump on the first charge, abuse of power, while voting to acquit on the second, obstruction of Congress.
Inside the Senate GOP cloakroom, Romney's decision was greeted with disappointment but little surprise. Ever since Romney was elected to the Senate in 2018, the 72-year-old senator has parted ways with his party at times and has occasionally criticized Trump "" an approach that has won him few allies in a chamber where Trump's political capital and favor is a prized commodity.
'He's made it very clear from the beginning, even on the witness vote, that he was going to go his own way,' Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said. 'This is one of those historical votes where everybody has to do what they think is the right thing.'
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) appeared ready to move on from the trial and did not threaten Romney. 
'I was surprised and disappointed, but we have much work to do for the American people, and I think Senator Romney has been largely supportive of most everything we've tried to accomplish,' McConnell said.
For Romney, breaking with Trump carried not just political consequences in a party he once led as its standard-bearer, but also an issue of family dynamics. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, the daughter of Romney's older brother, is one of the president's loyalists "" and she firmly stood by Trump on Wednesday.
'This is not the first time I have disagreed with Mitt, and I imagine it will not be the last,' McDaniel tweeted. 
The RNC also sent an email to reporters Wednesday taking aim at Romney, under the subject line, 'Mitt Romney turns his back on Utah.'
Other Trump allies were far harsher in their response to Romney. 'He's now officially a member of the resistance - should be expelled' from the party, Trump Jr. tweeted.
Romney knew his vote to remove the president from office would bring consequences. Already, there is a bill in the Utah legislature that would allow voters to remove a sitting senator. Last week, the Conservative Political Action Conference disinvited Romney to its annual event. He expects worse in the days ahead. 
When Romney was in Florida last weekend, a person at the airport called him a traitor, and someone else later told him to 'get with the team,' followed by an epithet.
 'It's going to be there a long, long, long time,' he said in the interview. 'And you know, the president's going to, you know, use me in rallies. I mean, he likes theater, and I can be part of that. So it's going to be tough.'
Recently appointed Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), facing a tough intraparty primary fight from Rep. Douglas A. Collins, has already used Romney as a foil, attacking him last week for supporting the call for witnesses.
Romney said his decision to vote to convict the president was 'the hardest decision' he has ever had to make and one that he hoped he would never have to make. 'When [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi indicated we're now going to pursue impeachment, my heart sank in dread,' he said. 
For a time, he thought "" or at least hoped "" that Trump's request to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for an investigation into the Bidens during a July 25 phone call represented little more than a throwaway line. As more information came out, Romney came to a different and more worrisome conclusion: that the president had committed a potentially impeachable act.
'He's the leader of my party,' Romney said of Trump. 'He's the president of the United States. I voted with him 80 percent of the time. I agree with his economic policies and a lot of other policies. And yet he did something which was grievously wrong. And to say, well, you know, because I'm on his team and I agree with him most of the time, that I should then assent to a political motive, would be a real stain on our constitutional democracy.'
Romney said he hoped the president's defense team would present evidence during the trial that would exonerate the president. 
He said he even contacted the White House counsel's office, through a fellow senator, asking if it would provide affidavits from officials such as former national security adviser John Bolton or acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, but to no avail.
Romney dismissed arguments that a president could be impeached only if there were a statutory crime, calling that 'absurd on its face,' and saying he could not think of 'a more egregious assault on our constitutional system than corrupting an election and getting a foreign power to do it for you.' What Trump tried to do, he said, is 'what autocrats do in tinhorn countries.'
He also dismissed the arguments that the president was justified in asking Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. He said the former vice president might have been guilty of a conflict of interest but added that a conflict of interest is 'a matter of judgment, but it's not a crime.' As for Hunter Biden, he said, 'He got a lot of money for his father's name. That's unsavory. But again, it's not a crime.'
Some of Romney's Republican colleagues have suggested the issue should be left to the voters in this year's election, rather than having the Senate render judgment. Romney said his reading of the Constitution and the Federalist Papers led him to conclude that the Senate must make the decision.
'The Constitution doesn't say that if the president did something terribly wrong, let the people decide in the next election what should happen,' he said. 'It says if the president does something terribly wrong, the Senate shall try him. And so the Constitution is plain.'

impeachment trial takes shape today 
McConnell proposes rules to gain a quick decision
The White House argued in a legal brief filed Monday that the two articles of impeachment against President Trump are 'structurally deficient,' decrying a 'rigged process' and urging senators to 'immediately' acquit the president of the charges that will be formally presented at his trial that starts in earnest this week.
The filing came as the House's designated impeachment managers and Trump's legal counsel conducted final preparations ahead of the trial proceedings that will begin Tuesday, marking the substantive start of just the third Senate trial of a U.S. president in history. On the Republican side, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) circulated ground rules for a rapid trial, while Senate aides and GOP lawyers were also weighing contingency plans in case Democrats are successful in forcing witnesses to testify.
Trump's legal team, led by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, wrote that Trump 'did absolutely nothing wrong' as it accused the House Democrats who impeached the president of attempting to overturn the results of the 2016 election and 'to interfere in the 2020 election.'
'The only threat to the Constitution that House Democrats have brought to light is their own degradation of the impeachment process and trampling of the separation of powers,' Trump's lawyers wrote in the 171-page legal brief. 'Their fixation on damaging the President has trivialized the momentous act of impeachment, debased the standards of impeachable conduct, and perverted the power of impeachment by turning it into a partisan, election-year political tool.' 
Some of the preparations Monday came in the form of walk-throughs of the Senate chamber by both sides, scoping out the surroundings that will house all 100 senators for hours of opening arguments and questions in Trump's impeachment case over the next several days. 
But the two sides also spent Monday previewing the case they'll make on the Senate floor through dueling filings and efforts to refute the other side's arguments about whether Trump's attempts to pressure Ukraine amount to impeachable conduct. Both the Democratic House managers and Trump's legal team are battling to persuade a small group of swing GOP senators who will decide whether they will need additional witnesses and evidence to determine Trump's fate. 
McConnell's organizing resolution, which he circulated late Monday afternoon, offers each side 24 hours to make its opening arguments, starting on Wednesday but compressed into two session days. It is unclear whether Democrats would press to use all their time, which could push testimony past midnight.
After the House managers and Trump's lawyers make their case, senators will be allowed 16 hours to question the opposing sides.
After that, the sides will debate for a maximum of four hours on whether to consider subpoenaing witnesses or documents at all, followed by a vote on whether to do so. If a majority of senators agree, then there will probably be motions from both sides to call various witnesses, with subsequent votes on issuing subpoenas.
The resolution also allows Trump's team to move to dismiss the charges at any time "" although it is not explicitly mentioned in the four-page measure "" because doing so is allowed under standard impeachment trial rules. The Senate trial also won't automatically admit evidence from the House process, according to GOP officials, a key difference from the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton more than two decades ago. Though the material will be printed and made available to senators, it won't be automatically admissible unless a majority of senators approve it.
The resolution infuriated Democratic senators, with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) calling the document a 'national disgrace' and accusing McConnell of shrouding testimony and rushing the trial. 
'We are gratified that the draft resolution protects the president's rights to a fair trial, and look forward to presenting a vigorous defense on the facts and the process as quickly as possible, and seeking an acquittal as swiftly as possible,' said Eric Ueland, White House director of legislative affairs.
The administration laid out two main points as it seeks a quick acquittal for Trump: that the articles of impeachment are 'deficient' because they don't involve any violations of law, and that the House's charge of obstruction of Congress will damage the constitutional separation of powers. 
House Democrats "" in a separate filing that was also due Monday "" disputed the White House's argument, asserting that abusing the powers of his presidency was an impeachable offense and that Trump was the 'Framers' worst nightmare come to life.' 
The White House's legal brief submitted to the Senate "" offering the first detailed glimpse into its defense against the two impeachment charges "" was adamant that Trump did nothing wrong, deploying a legalese version of the scorched-earth rhetoric commonly used in the president's Twitter feed. One Democratic aide working on the impeachment trial, who spoke to reporters in a briefing on the condition of anonymity, likened the brief to an 'extremely extended version of a presidential tweet.'
The proceedings Tuesday will formally begin with a debate over the McConnell resolution. The impeachment managers and the president's lawyers will have an opportunity to debate the proposed rules, while Schumer is expected to offer changes to the measure that would allow the Senate to call several witnesses desired by Democrats at the outset. Democrats could also push for more than one vote on witnesses and documents.
But all 53 Republican senators are expected to support the rules as written by McConnell. Once those parameters are set, the formal arguments will begin.
After spending several hours in a nearly empty Capitol, holding talks with staff on the resolution, McConnell left at 7 p.m. Monday, saying the final touches were now in place.
'As you can imagine, we're discussing getting ready for tomorrow. And we'll be ready to go,' he told reporters, indicating he had no real discussions with Schumer about how Democrats would fight the resolution. 'That's a good question to ask him.'

In their own 111-page brief filed Saturday, the House's seven impeachment managers laid out their case against Trump that they will present to senators, arguing that the president's conduct posed a national security threat and that he obstructed congressional efforts to obtain testimony and documents about his dealings toward Ukraine. 

The House's legal brief reiterated many of the findings and arguments that Democrats have made for months "" including allegations that Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military aid for Ukraine and a coveted White House meeting with its leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, to pressure the country into conducting investigations into former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
The president's lawyers argued in their filing, however, that House Democrats had no evidence to back up its accusation that Trump conditioned the aid and the White House visit on an investigation into a political rival. The attorneys also defended Trump's conduct, saying a July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky that is at the heart of the House's impeachment case was 'perfectly appropriate' and that the Ukrainian leader has not indicated any impropriety with the conversation.
The lawyers pointed to a rough transcript of the call as proof that Trump did not seek a quid pro quo in his request for the probe of the Bidens and of a debunked theory alleging Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.
In the call, Trump told Zelensky that 'I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.' Those favors do not involve Trump's personal interests, argued the White House lawyers, who added: 'The President cannot be removed from office because House Democrats deliberately misconstrue one of his commonly used phrases.' 
That transcript of the call, Trump's lawyers also said, shows that the president was speaking about issues of burden-sharing among European nations as well as corruption "" two foreign policy issues that not only were in his purview as commander in chief but reflected his 'longstanding concerns' about foreign aid. 
The lawyers said it would have been 'appropriate' and 'entirely proper' for Trump to ask Zelensky about those issues, including about Hunter Biden, who served on the board of Burisma, Ukraine's largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing. 
In response to the White House's argument that there was no underlying crime, Democrats are likely to cite an opinion issued after Trump's impeachment from the Government Accountability Office that the administration's withholding of aid was a violation of law. Trump's legal team is expected to argue that senators must focus solely on the information relied upon by the House in its Dec. 18 vote to impeach the president. 
As for the obstruction-of-Congress charge, the president's legal team called it 'frivolous and dangerous' because Trump had the right to assert certain executive branch privileges. 
'Accepting that unprecedented approach [from Democrats] would fundamentally damage the separation of powers by making the House itself the sole judge of its authority,' the lawyers wrote in the brief. 'It would permit Congress to threaten every President with impeachment merely for protecting the prerogatives of the Presidency.' 
Earlier Monday, the seven Democratic managers walked in procession from the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to the Senate chamber a few minutes after 11 a.m. Reporters were not allowed to view the walk-through, as the doors to the third-floor galleries above the Senate chamber were locked, and aides said the lawmakers would not discuss the visit.

The White House also announced late Monday that eight of the president's most ardent House Republican defenders would join the impeachment team to 'help expeditiously end this brazen political vendetta.' The GOP lawmakers are Reps. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), Mike Johnson (La.), Jim Jordan (Ohio), Debbie Lesko (Ariz.), Mark Meadows (N.C.), John Ratcliffe (Tex.), Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) and Lee Zeldin (N.Y.).

House prosecutors on Saturday argued for President Trump's conviction in the Senate, insisting he poses a threat to national security, while the White House rejected the impeachment charges as a 'highly partisan and reckless obsession' of Democrats intent on ousting Trump.
With opening arguments in the Senate trial to begin Wednesday afternoon, the seven House managers filed a 111-page legal brief that lays out their case against Trump, arguing that the Senate 'must eliminate the threat' by convicting and removing him from office. 
The White House defense team has until noon Monday to file its legal brief outlining why the president should be acquitted. 
The House's legal filing reiterates the findings of the House Intelligence and Judiciary panels, which, after hearing from witnesses and experts, charged Trump last month with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The House impeached him on Dec.-18. 
'The evidence overwhelmingly establishes that he is guilty of both,' the managers wrote in the brief. 'The only remaining question is whether the members of the Senate will accept and carry out the responsibility placed on them by the Framers of our Constitution and their constitutional Oaths.' 

Trump's legal team released a seven-page response to the charges against Trump, which it filed shortly after the House made its brief public, dismissing the case as a 'dangerous attack on the right of the American people to freely choose their president.'
Echoing months-long criticism of the investigation by Trump and his allies, the White House said the charges were the result of a 'lawless process' and assailed House Democrats for a 'transparently political act.'
In the White House response, lawyers Jay Sekulow and Pat Cipollone said there was no basis for either article of impeachment. They argued that Trump did nothing wrong in his dealings with Ukraine and that his release of a rough transcript of his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was 'unprecedented transparency.'
'The articles of impeachment violate the Constitution. They are defective in their entirety,' the White House said.
The response from Trump's legal team did not directly address the allegations against the president "" that he withheld a White House meeting and congressionally appropriated aid to pressure Ukraine into announcing and launching investigations into former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
A House aide working on the impeachment case who was not authorized to speak publicly about it said Trump's position as set forth in the response filed Saturday was 'not just wrong, but dangerous.' 
'If the president were correct, it would represent a fundamental alteration to the American constitutional order,' the aide said on a conference call with reporters.
The Democrats' brief "" which the House framed as an explanation of 'why the Senate should convict and remove President Trump from office, and permanently bar him from government service' "" reiterates and summarizes arguments that Democrats have made for months: that Trump's alleged effort to trade nearly $400-million of U.S. security aid and a coveted White House meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for politically motivated investigations is the height of constitutional malfeasance.
The Ukraine plot, the House managers argue, was compounded by Trump's effort to obstruct the congressional probe by defying subpoenas for documents and testimony.
'If the President could both avoid accountability under the criminal laws and preclude an effective impeachment investigation, he would truly be above the law,' they wrote. 'But that is what President Trump has attempted to do, and why President Trump's conduct is the Framers' worst nightmare.'
The impeachment inquiry began after an intelligence agency whistleblower reported the July 25 phone call between Trump and Zelensky in which Trump asked Zelensky to do him a 'favor' and investigate Biden and his son. Hunter Biden sat on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma while his father was vice president to Barack Obama.
The meat of the 111-page filing is a constitutional argument for Trump's conviction and removal, one that frequently appeals to the nation's Founding Fathers and their warnings about foreign influence on domestic matters.
'The Framers therefore would have considered a President's attempt to corrupt America's democratic processes by demanding political favors from foreign powers to be a singularly pernicious act,' the managers wrote, adding that 'they would have viewed a President's efforts to encourage foreign election interference as all the more dangerous where, as here, those efforts are part of an ongoing pattern of misconduct for which the President is unrepentant.'
Most of the brief, however, is a recitation of key 'material facts' gathered in the four-month House investigation, citing the dozens of depositions and hearings the investigating committees conducted from October into December, but also media reports about Trump's comments and actions relevant to the Ukraine affair.
Absent from the brief is how or whether the House managers will use the trove of text messages and other materials gathered from Lev Parnas, the former associate of Rudolph W. Giuliani's who acted as an intermediary between Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, and officials in Ukraine. Parnas claimed in recent days that Trump was aware of 'everything' he and Giuliani were doing to pressure Ukraine to open a public investigation into Biden. 
There's only one reference to Parnas in the footnotes, crediting him with handing over a letter from Giuliani to Zelensky in which Giuliani requested a meeting in his capacity 'as personal counsel to President Trump, and with his knowledge and consent' to discuss a 'specific request.'
The brief also cites an opinion from the Government Accountability Office that was issued after the articles were transmitted to the Senate, in which the GAO said the administration's withholding of aid from Ukraine was unlawful.
In seven instances, the House brief refers to the evidence against Trump as 'overwhelming' or 'compelling,' arguing that the House has gathered enough proof of the malfeasance the managers allege against Trump. The managers do not, in the brief, make the argument that has dominated the past four weeks since the House adopted the articles of impeachment "" that the Senate should hear from additional witnesses at trial.
House aides who briefed reporters Saturday on the condition of anonymity said they expected the managers to make that case separately Tuesday.

Many of the most endangered Republicans have concluded that fully embracing President Trump is their only credible path to victory in November, rallying to his side in the final days of the Senate impeachment fight and indulging his most controversial actions and statements.
At-risk Republicans "" including those in battlegrounds such as Arizona, Colorado and Georgia "" are calculating that a strong economy and an energized pro-Trump base will be enough to carry the party as it works to retain the White House and its Senate majority in 2020, according to interviews and private discussions with more than a dozen Republican senators, Senate aides and veteran strategists and officials.
More broadly, most Republicans have also largely jettisoned plans to break ranks with Trump to woo independents and suburban women, who turned on the party in 2018 and helped hand the House to the Democrats. This political positioning is driven in part by their view that Democrats are again poised to nominate a uniquely vulnerable presidential standard-bearer weighed down with ideological or establishment baggage.
'There's nothing in the middle of the road other than dead possums and yellow lines,' said Will Ritter, co-founder of Poolhouse, a center-right ad agency. 'Like no other president before, Republican voters want you to wrap yourself around Trump. There is no upside to doing any distancing.'

Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) has concentrated in recent weeks on rallying base Republicans rather than appealing to moderates for her tough reelection fight, pushing for a swift acquittal in Trump's impeachment trial while raising money off a feud with a CNN reporter she called 'a liberal hack.' Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who is running for reelection in a state Hillary Clinton won by five points in 2016, came under attack by his likely Democratic opponent, former governor John Hickenlooper, after deciding against calling for impeachment witnesses and evidence this week.
And Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), facing a tough intraparty primary fight from Rep. Douglas A. Collins (R-Ga.), has gone all-in on supporting Trump in a state that Democrats are targeting for its growing diversity and booming Atlanta suburbs, including an attack this week on fellow Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) for supporting the call for witnesses.
Loeffler, who has been personally friendly with Romney and who has donated to him in the past, accused him in a tweet of trying to 'appease the left' and concluded: 'The circus is over. It's time to move on!'
Trump's uncontested grip over his party came into focus again Friday as two key Republican senators "" Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is retiring, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who is not up for reelection "" supported the president by blocking Democratic attempts to extend the trial, couching their positions as driven by frustrations with Democrats. It will mark the first time in U.S. history that no witnesses will be called in a Senate impeachment proceeding.
'There is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the United States Constitution's high bar for an impeachable offense,' Alexander said in a statement, arguing that while Trump had taken 'actions that are inappropriate,' they did not merit his removal from office.

It was the most significant political move made by Senate Republicans this week: Their refusal to join Democrats in calling for additional evidence or witnesses in Trump's impeachment trial, ensuring that it could wrap up in the coming days.
At the center of the calculation was Trump himself, and just how much Republicans feel they can distance themselves from a president who, in just over three years, has traveled from troublesome outsider to Republican Party standard-bearer.
Ritter said some vulnerable Republicans running in swing states and House districts may be able to differentiate themselves from Trump and appeal to the center on specific policy issues, but on something hyper-politicized like impeachment, they cannot afford to cross the president.
'On Trump, it's binary,' Ritter said. 'You're either a treacherous Democrat or you're with the president.'
The 2018 midterm elections did provide a flashing alarm for Republicans about the risks of being inextricably bound with Trump. Democrats retook the House majority after toppling Republican incumbents in many suburban districts and in state and local races "" a takeover that laid the groundwork for impeachment.
Former Republican senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania said challenges in suburbs, such as those surrounding Philadelphia, remain troubling for the party. But he said opposing Trump on impeachment is seen by most at-risk Republicans as the 'wrong way to try to win over those voters.'
'You won't get seen as playing to the suburbs,' Santorum said. 'You'll be seen as playing to the angry leftists who hate the president.'
Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who as the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee worked to keep the probe of Russian election interference as bipartisan as possible, said he fully supports Trump and is surprised that anyone might be surprised.
'He's a Republican, he's president and we support his agenda,' Burr said. 'The media, of course, tries to drive a wedge and wonder, but every poll today shows the president actually stronger today than he was four years ago.'
For Trump, Republican unity on impeachment is the fruit of the ultimate pressure campaign in a short political career defined by them. The president has upended so many norms that he has simply become the norm, with everyone else in the party scrambling to adjust.
That doesn't mean Republicans all personally like Trump or cheer his conduct, either on foreign policy or other matters "" in fact, many Republican lawmakers still complain loudly about him behind closed doors, sometimes mocking him as incompetent and undisciplined.

But many also privately acknowledge that Trump dominates the party in a potent and visceral way and say they are operating out of the partisan reality of an intensely divided nation.
Democrats, they add, should stop expecting a Republican establishment to stand up and block Trump, since Trump himself is now the establishment.
'I regularly talk to five or six Republicans who I feel some closeness to,' said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). 'I've heard for months that they know the president lies a lot. . . . They worry about his character. But they aren't willing to come forward and say that publicly. That's one of the tragedies of this era.'
Former Republican Georgia congressman Jack Kingston said he once had reservations about Trump but has since become an ardent admirer and booster. He explained his transformation with a shrug, saying his party and Washington 'needed a shake-up.'
'I accept it,' he said.
The Georgia primary fight brewing between Loeffler and Collins is a classic Trump-era standoff, he added.
'Any GOP candidate is going to want to show he or she is close to Trump,' Kingston said. 'If you think about the Republican Party, he's the center of the orbit. You don't want him to say something bad about you.'
The impulse for Republicans to link themselves tightly to the president spans the country, and includes some lawmakers not even currently up for reelection. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who doesn't face reelection for four years, released a 30-second ad in Iowa that sided with Trump and attacked former vice president Joe Biden and other Democrats.
'I'd like to thank the Democrats for badly botching this impeachment charade and for spending so much time in a coverup for Joe Biden,' says Scott, who introduces himself as a juror in the Senate trial. 'The real story here is the corruption Joe Biden got away with.'
The ad goes on to levy a series of factually problematic charges against Biden and his son Hunter, but its mere existence is sure to delight Trump "" and sparked speculation that Scott is eyeing a 2024 presidential bid, seeking to cast himself as the torchbearer of Trump's brand.
Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general under Trump who is now running to retake the Alabama Senate seat he vacated to join the administration, is also pushing to prove his fealty to the president "" despite the fact that Trump, furious at Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, publicly and privately berated and humiliated his attorney general for the majority of his tenure.
Nonetheless, on Wednesday, Sessions touted his loyalty to Trump in a trio of tweets focused on former national security adviser John Bolton, whose forthcoming book directly ties Trump to the Ukraine decision at the heart of his impeachment trial. Sessions emphasized that he never publicly criticized the president and dismissed Bolton's memoir as 'an act of disloyalty.'

Former senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he understands if Republicans poke holes in the Democrats' case against Trump and vote for acquittal but cannot accept Republicans insisting that Trump did nothing wrong. Those who do the latter, he said, are willfully taking a position they know is false.
'That's the difference. Vote to acquit? Okay. You can make that argument. But to say this wasn't an egregious abuse of his presidential duty? That's where this party has problems,' Flake said. 'To suggest otherwise signals complete subservience to the president.'

But Scott Reed, senior strategist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, pointed to Trump's 'unprecedented high approval ratings with the GOP rank and file.'
'It's Trump's party now "" there's no way around that,' Reed said. 'You may not agree with the boxes, but he's checking all the boxes.'
Democrats, meanwhile, have had their own challenges holding their ranks together as Trump voters in red states have made clear to Democratic senators that they will pay a price for opposing the president.
Two centrists who won election last year "" Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) "" as well as Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), who will face voters this year after a long-shot win in a special election in 2017, have been coy about how they will vote on acquittal, giving hope to Trump's allies that the president could win bipartisan support.
Many Republicans also believe that Trump stands a strong chance of reelection against a flawed Democratic opponent, whether a nominee from the left like Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), or a longtime politician like Biden.
Dick Wadhams, a longtime Republican strategist based in Colorado, said the specific choice between Trump and the eventual Democratic nominee will help Republicans who have tacked to the right to appease the party's base win over moderates, as well.
'It's going to be a choice on the ballot and not a referendum in 2020, and that's what makes this very different than 2018,' Wadhams said. He added that he was a begrudging Trump voter in 2016 but now is fully supportive. He pointed to Trump accomplishments like passing a tax cut and appointing conservative judicial nominees, as well as his concern about where the Democrats would take the country.
'I still have concerns about the way he behaves, his tweets drive me nuts, and a lot of Republicans feel that way, but at the same time "" Medicare-for-all, Green New Deal, killing fracking "" spare me,' he said, rattling off a list of liberal proposals. 'Democrats are driving people who might want to vote for them back to Trump.'

MIAMI "" President Trump's reelection campaign on Friday launched a new coalition to court evangelicals at a Latino megachurch in Miami, part of an effort to shore up support among Latino evangelicals whose backing for the president has so far lagged behind that of their white counterparts.
In a 75-minute rally-style address "" but with more religious overtones "" Trump touted his record on social issues and noted that the evangelical vote helped power his improbable victory in 2016, proclaiming: 'We're gonna blow those numbers away in 2020.'
'Evangelicals . . . have never had a greater champion, not even close in the White House, than you have right now,' Trump told a racially diverse crowd of thousands at El Rey Jesús in Miami. 'Just look at the record, because we've done things that nobody thought was possible.'
Trump is counting on equal or stronger support from evangelicals during his reelection bid, and he garnered some of the loudest applause of the event when he promised to deliver more from the community's agenda, announcing that he'll 'very soon' move to 'safeguard students' and teachers' First Amendment rights to pray in our schools.' 
And he drew boisterous applause again when he denounced socialism "" a line of attack he has used against the field of Democratic candidates vying to take him on in November's election.
'America was not built by religion-hating socialists,' Trump said. 'America was built by churchgoing, God-worshiping, freedom-loving patriots.'
He began the event by defending his decision to greenlight the killing of Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, one of Iran's top military figures, in Baghdad early Friday but spent the rest of his time on remarks tailored to the evangelical audience seated before him.

The president appeared at the Miami megachurch led by Guillermo Maldonado, one of the most prominent Hispanic evangelical leaders in the nation, who has been a key ally and adviser to Trump. 
But the decision to appear at a church attended by thousands of Latinos also underscored a tense subject for Trump with the community: the hard-line immigration policies that have been a hallmark for Trump since the first day of his 2016 presidential campaign. 
That was highlighted by assurances Maldonado gave his congregation earlier this week that members did not have to be U.S. citizens to attend the event, which was held about 90 miles south of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., where the president has been staying since Dec. 20.
'It's certainly a good opportunity for the president,' said former congressman Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), who until 2019 represented the district where the church is located. But the appearance, he added, is 'not without risk, because I don't think the president's immigration policies are very popular among the congregation.' 
Yet Trump's references Friday to immigration "" his boasting about the border wall and criticisms of 'loopholes' in U.S. immigration law "" drew a loud ovation from the crowd.
The Trump campaign called El Rey Jesús, also known as King Jesus International Ministry, a 'natural fit' as the launch spot for the new coalition, Evangelicals for Trump. Maldonado's backing of the president reflects the 'great and overwhelming support President Trump has among the evangelical community at large,' campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said. 
Maldonado declined an interview request made through the church. But he offered reassurances to immigrants during Sunday's services, according to the Miami Herald. 
'I ask you: Do you think I would do something where I would endanger my people?' Maldonado said. 'I'm not that dumb.'

Gabriel Salguero, president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition, said Latino evangelicals have been put off by Trump's remarks about people of Mexican descent, his repeal of an Obama-era program that granted work permits to undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children, and the name-calling of his political opponents. 
However, he said, they have appreciated his efforts on criminal justice reform and on antiabortion policies. 
'The nation is waking up to the reality that Latino evangelicals are an independent voting bloc,' Salguero said. 'They have their own spokespersons, their own leaders. As people have been drilling down deeper into evangelicalism, they recognize they're not a monolith.'
Latino evangelicals say Maldonado is one of the most respected Hispanic leaders in the country. He is a Honduran immigrant with a bilingual ministry, a show on Trinity Broadcasting Network and 2.7 million followers on Facebook.
Maldonado is considered part of the prosperity gospel, a movement within some churches that teach that God blesses followers with health and material wealth. The prosperity gospel, generally considered to be on the fringes of U.S. Christianity, has grown globally and received attention under Trump because several of his faith advisers are part of the movement.
Samuel Rodriguez, a nationally known Hispanic evangelical leader who is part of a core dozen evangelical leaders who have been advising the administration, called Trump's decision to show up at Maldonado's church 'politically brilliant' because it could shore up support from a Latino slice of evangelicals in a key swing state. 
Curbelo also said many congregants at King Jesus International are non-Cuban Hispanics, who tend to be less aligned to the GOP and are more likely to be swing voters, allowing Trump to simultaneously reach evangelicals "" a core part of his base "" and persuadable voters. 
'You have to choose whether to go for your base voters or your swing voters,' said Curbelo, a critic of Trump during his time in Congress. 'In that congregation [on Friday], you'll have a lot of people who fit into both categories.' 

The event Friday afternoon was designed to be a show of force of evangelical support that comes on the heels of a scathing editorial from a major Christian publication calling for Trump's ouster after he was impeached by the House last month. Nearly 40 influential evangelical leaders from across the nation planned to attend the launch, according to the campaign. 
The opinion piece, from Christianity Today, argued that Trump has a 'grossly immoral character' and harshly criticized his attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival "" actions that made him just the third impeached U.S. president in history. 
It also provoked a furious response from Trump, who took to Twitter to inaccurately criticize Christianity Today as a 'far left magazine' and to tout his record on issues important to evangelical voters. It's that policy record "" opposing abortion, nominating conservative jurists and moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem "" that has attracted many evangelicals to Trump. 



The Pew Research Center's 2018 national survey of Latinos found that 36 percent of Hispanic evangelical Christians approved of Trump's job performance in summer and early fall of that year "" a figure that was just about half the level of approval Pew has found among white evangelical Protestants, which was 69 percent in early 2019 and similar in more recent polling. The 2018 Pew survey on Latinos found that 55 percent of Hispanic evangelical Christians disapproved of Trump. 
An NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist poll from early December found that 75 percent of white evangelical Christians approved of Trump, compared with 42 percent of U.S. adults overall.
Even though they share similar beliefs about Jesus and about the Bible, white evangelical attitudes diverge from those of Latino evangelicals on many policy issues, including immigration reform, climate change, health care and taxing the wealthy, said Janelle Wong, a professor of American studies at the University of Maryland. 
A statement published on the church's website says Maldonado is participating in the evangelical coalition in his personal capacity and that King Jesus International Ministry does not endorse any political candidates. The Trump campaign is picking up the tab for the use of the church, which is receiving 'fair compensation' in exchange, according to the statement. 
The Trump campaign expects Evangelicals for Trump to grow ahead of the Nov. 3 election, and it also plans to continue outreach to Hispanic and black voters through its other coalitions: Latinos for Trump and Black Voices for Trump.
Campaign officials have said that even a small surge in support among black or Latino voters could help make the difference for Trump in key swing states, including Florida.

'Promises and principles, those two words come to mind,' said Jack Graham, the pastor of Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, Tex., who is also a part of the campaign coalition.

Democrats at a turning point, torn between investigations and policy 
Democrats find themselves at a crossroads after Wednesday's acquittal of President Trump, torn between continuing investigations into a president they call a danger to democracy and a desire to concentrate on health care and other issues more likely to resonate with voters.
The party seized control of the House in 2018 in part on a promise to hold Trump accountable. But in the past year, Trump has emerged unscathed from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe into 2016 election interference and a nearly five-month impeachment inquiry. The latest polls show Trump attaining the highest approval ratings of his presidency.
Democrats, by contrast, face a muddled presidential primary field, with no obvious front-runner to take on Trump in November. And the party was embarrassed this week when chaotic caucuses in Iowa failed to produce a clear winner. Hours before Trump's acquittal, House Democrats gathered in a private meeting in the Capitol to vent their frustrations while others fretted about the need for a new election-year strategy.
One of the first decisions they face is whether to subpoena Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton, who details in a forthcoming book that Trump told him that he withheld military aid to Ukraine to force that country to pursue investigations of a political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, and his son Hunter "" the charges at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. 
On Wednesday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) suggested that it was a matter of time before the chamber would call Bolton.
'When you have a lawless president, you have to bring that to the fore. You have to spotlight that,' Nadler told reporters. 'You have to protect the Constitution, whatever the political consequences.' 
But other Democrats cautioned that no decision has been made about Bolton and expressed a desire to move on.
'We also have to have our own idea and vision. We can't win the next election just being against Trump,' said Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.). 'We have to be for something.'
Republicans, meanwhile, were in soaring spirits. While Democrats have accused the GOP of a coverup in ending the impeachment trial without calling witnesses, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) seemed unconcerned. Shortly after the acquittal vote, he told reporters that swing-state polls indicate Democrats' decision to impeach Trump is backfiring.
'Right now, this is a political loser for them,' McConnell declared minutes after Trump's acquittal. 'They initiated it. They thought this was a great idea. And at least for the short term, it has been a colossal political mistake.' 

The party's frustration with their predicament was on clear display Wednesday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) vented to her colleagues in the private caucus meeting that Trump's Tuesday night State of the Union address was a 'pack of lies.' 
Democrats, including Pelosi, often say they can both investigate and legislate. But they're also vexed by a reality that investigations of Trump overshadow other accomplishments, drowning out work on trade and prescription drugs that is vital to keeping their majority and winning the White House. 
Privately, some Democrats fear that if they continue investigating Trump in such a public fashion, it could backfire and embolden him further before the election. 
'We need to be better prepared, better ready to take on the attack-and-smear machine, less inclined to quarrel amongst ourselves and more eyes on the prize than we have been,' said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).
The soul-searching for Democrats comes as Trump has experienced perhaps one of the best weeks of his presidency, highlighted by a prime-time address to the nation that was largely well received by Republicans with surprising reality TV moments.
House Democrats, meanwhile, were still angry about Trump's State of the Union address, in which the president claimed some of their policies as his own "" though his administration has pursued the opposite. 
Trump, for example, vowed that he would protect Americans with preexisting health conditions "" a promise at direct odds with his administration's legal efforts to gut the Affordable Care Act, which includes the guarantee that patients can't be denied that coverage.
Pelosi, in a dramatic gesture after Trump finished his address to Congress on Tuesday evening, shredded a copy of his words while standing on the dais behind him. On Wednesday morning, a visibly irritated Pelosi told her colleagues that she was looking for 'one page I could spare that didn't have a lie on it' and couldn't find it "" and that she had no regrets about what she did.
'He disrespected the chamber he was in . . . to use it as a backdrop for a reality show . . . to give a speech that had no connection with reality,' she said, according to multiple Democratic officials in the room, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly. 'It was a pack of lies. . . . About a quarter through it I thought: 'You know "" he's selling a bill of goods like a snake oil salesman. We cannot let this "" we cannot let this stand.' '
Pelosi's fury resonated with her members, who gave her a standing ovation in the private caucus meeting. 
Rep. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.) argued after the meeting that the State of the Union was no venue for a 'political campaign' and that the award of the Presidential Medal of Freedom to conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh was 'nutty.' 
Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) agreed Democrats 'need to remind people what [Trump's] record is, and the fact that he just is a pathological liar.'
'Her instinct for where the caucus is at is unerring. It did capture the way people are feeling,' said Rep. Andy Levin (D-Mich.) of Pelosi ripping up the document.
Pelosi's leadership team has signaled a desire to focus on policy in the coming months. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) and Rep. Katherine M. Clark (D-Mass.) used a weekly news conference Wednesday to discuss a host of legislative proposals that have been stalled in the GOP-controlled Senate. And the Democratic response to the State of the Union barely mentioned impeachment, focusing instead on things like gun control, income inequity and infrastructure.
And yet some impeachment investigators say they also have a duty to keep digging on Trump, probing his financial interests, allegations that he used his office for self-enrichment and that he obstructed justice. As he left the caucus, Nadler, for example, argued to reporters that Democrats needed to continue investigating the Ukraine matter and the broader probe into the 2016 campaign despite the pending Senate acquittal. 
Between investigating and legislating, Democrats appear genuinely torn. And the Democratic split screen was on full display within 30 seconds in a news conference that Pelosi's lieutenants held after the morning caucus. 
'As far as I'm concerned, the shredder wasn't available and so she did what she needed to do,' Jeffries said of Pelosi ripping apart Trump's speech. A few breaths later he pledged to keep working with the president. 
'We are going to work with President Trump whenever and wherever we can on behalf of the American people, but disagree when we must,' he said, suggesting the president's values would 'decimate the middle class.'

President Trump was acquitted Wednesday by the Republican-controlled Senate of charges that he abused the powers of his office and obstructed Congress as it probed his attempts to pressure Ukraine into political investigations "" capping a tumultuous, three-week impeachment trial that leaves his fate in the hands of voters in November.
Democrats fell far short of the two-thirds majority required to remove Trump from office, as senators voted 52 to 48 to acquit him on the abuse-of-power allegation and 53 to 47 to clear him of obstruction. 
The outcome represented a political triumph for the White House and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who successfully held together nearly the entire GOP caucus in blocking witnesses or additional evidence from the proceedings. Just one Republican, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, voted to convict the president of abuse of power.
Shortly after the twin acquittal votes, Trump tweeted that he will deliver a statement Thursday on 'our Country's VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax!' He also tweeted a clip featuring a mock magazine cover with signs showing him staying in office far beyond the two terms permitted under the Constitution. And Brad Parscale, Trump's 2020 campaign manager, proclaimed that he had been 'totally vindicated.' 
'Throughout this wholly corrupt process, President Trump successfully advanced the interests of the United States and remained focused on the issues that matter to Americans,' White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said. 'He spent his time achieving real victories for the people of this country, and the Democrats "" once again "" have nothing to show for their fraudulent schemes.'
The third impeachment trial of a president in U.S. history concluded one of the most bitter episodes in recent memory in Washington "" marked by partisan fighting over what constitutes a fair trial, furious debates over the propriety of Trump's dealings with Ukraine and outsized pressure on a small core of Republican senators who held considerable sway in whether the trial would subpoena key witnesses from the Trump administration who had defied calls to appear before the House during its investigation.
But the vote by Romney, the party's 2012 presidential nominee, robbed the president of the unified GOP opposition against impeachment that he had enjoyed and repeatedly boasted of since the inquiry began in September. Romney is the first senator in history to vote to remove a president of his or her own party.
Romney called Trump's demand to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter a 'flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security and our fundamental values.' In a July 25 phone call with Zelensky that he has repeatedly described as 'perfect,' Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate not only the Bidens but a discredited theory that it was Ukraine rather than Russia that attempted to interfere in the 2016 election. 
'There's no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the president would never have done what he did,' Romney said in an eight-minute speech delivered in a Senate chamber that was nearly void of his colleagues. Later, he added: 'Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.' 
Romney was the sole senator who not only defected from his own party but split his vote, choosing to acquit Trump of obstructing Congress. 
Democrats accused Republicans of emboldening an unchecked president who sought foreign influence in U.S. campaigns for his personal benefit. Republicans portrayed Democrats as a party still embittered by its loss in the 2016 presidential elections that has now decided to weaponize the constitutional impeachment process. 
'This sham process is the low point in the Senate for me,' said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), once a Trump foe who has transformed into one of the president's closest allies. 'If you think you've done the country a good service by legitimizing this impeachment process, what you have done is unleashed the partisan forces of hell.' 

The question of whether Trump should stay in office now moves from the Senate chamber to the campaign trail. Just one day prior, Trump stayed away from any mention of impeachment in Tuesday's State of the Union address, although he is almost certain to tout his acquittal at rallies and in other venues, such as Thursday's planned statement, as he campaigns for a second term.
The issue is also likely to surface in competitive Senate races, mostly as Democrats target GOP senators for aligning themselves with Trump and his conduct. But in a victory lap news conference after the votes, McConnell said the Democrats' decision to proceed with impeachment was a 'colossal political mistake.'
The majority leader noted that Trump is enjoying some of his strongest approval ratings now and added that 'as a poll watcher who's looking at polls in certain Senate races, every one of our people in tough races . . . is in better shape today than they were before the impeachment trial started.' 
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) insisted that Democrats were not motivated by politics and said 'Democrats walked out of the Senate chamber with their heads held high.'
Ripples from impeachment also may continue in the House, with Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and one of the impeachment managers, saying Wednesday that Democrats will probably subpoena former national security adviser John Bolton in the near future.
'When you have a lawless president, you have to bring that to the fore, you have to spotlight that,' Nadler told reporters. Bolton has said he would appear before the Senate if subpoenaed but has been silent on whether he would appear before the House.
Despite weeks of protests from Democrats, the Senate last week voted not to hear from additional witnesses, including Bolton, during the trial. An unpublished manuscript from the ex-White House official's forthcoming book has alleged that Trump directly tied the withholding of nearly $400 million in military assistance to Ukraine to the political investigations the president had demanded. 
The tone inside the chamber during the historic vote was solemn, as each senator took turns standing up at his or her desk and proclaiming 'guilty' or 'not guilty' to each article of impeachment. The public galleries were the most crowded they have been throughout the trial, as the backbenches on the chamber floor, reserved for members of the House who wanted to attend the trial, filled in with congressmen from both parties.
Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the lead prosecutor for House managers, sat in the first chair of their table, turned at a three-quarters position so he could swivel his head around the chamber with every senator's name called out, glancing around the room. When each of the two roll calls ended, he pivoted around to stare at the clerks and parliamentarians as they double checked the votes. 
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. read the results after each vote, proclaiming Trump not guilty of both charges. Shortly after, McConnell thanked Roberts for presiding over the proceedings with a 'clear head, steady hand and the forbearance that this rare occasion demands.' 
Trump was impeached by the House on Dec. 18, as nearly all Democrats there proclaimed that he had abused his powers and then obstructed Congress's attempts to investigate him. At the heart the case against Trump presented by the impeachment managers was the allegation that he withheld military aid and a coveted White House meeting to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. The younger Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, while his father was vice president. 
Throughout the acrimonious Senate trial, the only real point of suspense "" aside from where a handful of senators would land on the conviction vote "" was whether a majority of senators in the narrowly divided chamber would decide to call more witnesses, particularly after the Bolton revelations. 
Democrats cited polling that showed the public broadly favored summoning witnesses to Trump's impeachment trial, and argued it was only fair to hear from Trump administration officials whom the White House had summarily blocked from testifying before the House, some even under a subpoena. But most Senate Republicans, many of whom took no public issue with the president's conduct, said it was not their responsibility to secure witnesses and documents, particularly when House Democrats didn't exhaust their options to obtain them, such as going to court. 
Unlike in the House, in which a handful of Democratic lawmakers split from their party to oppose either article of impeachment, Senate Democrats stayed united in their stance that Trump deserved to be removed from office for his conduct. 
Sen. Doug Jones (Ala.), who faces the toughest reelection bid for an incumbent Democrat this fall, chose to convict on both impeachment articles, saying he was 'deeply troubled' by the White House legal team's case arguing for 'virtually unchecked presidential power.' Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.), a freshman senator who has bucked her party on occasion, also voted guilty on both. 
So did Sen. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.), one of the few Democratic lawmakers who has a relationship with Trump and was seen as perhaps the White House's best chance at a bipartisan acquittal. Manchin, who in recent days began floating a censure resolution that gained little traction in either party, announced his decision shortly before senators gathered to vote at 4 p.m., and inside the chamber, Sinema approached him and the two whispered to one another and hugged.
'Despite the false claim that a president can do no wrong, the president is not entitled to act with blatant disregard for an equal branch of government or use the superpower status of the United States to condition our support of democracy and our allies on any political favor,' Manchin said. 
As for the lone party defector, the GOP backlash against Romney began to mount immediately, with the president's son, Donald Trump, Jr., calling on Senate Republicans to expel him from the conference. Romney's own colleagues were gentler in their disagreement, with Republican leaders saying they did not try to persuade him one way or another on the conviction vote. 
'He's made it very clear from the beginning, even on the witness vote, that he was going to go his own way,' said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.). 'This is one of those historical votes where everybody has to do what they think is the right thing.' 
The impeachment trial also became entwined with the 2020 Democratic presidential campaign, forcing the four senators still in the race "" Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Michael F. Bennet (Colo.) "" off the trail just weeks before the first nominating contests began Monday in Iowa.
At a campaign stop Wednesday morning in Derry, N.H., before he zipped back down to Washington, Sanders called Trump a 'pathological liar' who 'probably doesn't know the difference between truth and lies.'

President Trump on Tuesday made a theatrical prime-time appeal for the success of his divisive and turbulent stewardship after three years, projecting confidence that a strong economy and a reset of U.S. standing in the world has put the nation on the right path despite the historic impeachment that has marred his term.
In his third State of the Union address "" and final one before voters will cast their verdict on his presidency this fall "" Trump made no mention of the impeachment battle that has consumed him for months, even as he faced down his Democratic adversaries in the House chamber where they had voted to charge him with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress less than two months ago. 
But Washington's poisonous political atmosphere was palpable throughout the evening. Several prominent Democrats, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.), chose to boycott the address, and a handful of others walked out as the president was speaking. As Trump basked in applause after concluding his 77-minute speech, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), standing behind him on the dais, tore up a printed copy of the remarks in four separate piles. 
Though Trump avoided the kind of personal attacks and inflammatory rhetoric that have defined his fierce fight for political survival on impeachment, his speech was laced with inaccuracies and heightened partisanship as he offered an implicit argument that Americans have prospered and would be foolhardy to remove him from office.
'In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of America's destiny,' Trump said. 'We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never going back.'
The extraordinary scene punctuated months of severe acrimony and accusations between Trump and Democratic lawmakers who made him just the third president to be impeached in U.S. history. Trump has burned with anger over the House investigation into his efforts to persuade Ukraine's president to conduct an investigation into former-vice president Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential contender. 
 Aides said the theme of the speech was 'The Great American Comeback,' which could be read as an allusion to Trump's own political fortunes. 
Trump took the dais buoyed by a poll showing a 49 percent job approval rating, his strongest since taking office, and radiating a sense of vindication that the Republican-controlled Senate is expected to vote Wednesday to acquit him of the House articles that he abused his powers and sought to obstruct Congress.
Wearing his trademark solid-red tie and a dark-blue suit, the president entered the chamber just after 9 p.m. and took his place at the dais in front of Vice President Pence and Pelosi, who along with dozens of Democratic women was dressed in white, the-color of the suffragist movement. 
As Trump handed them printed copies of his remarks, Pelosi offered her hand to shake, but Trump did not reciprocate, and Pelosi awkwardly withdrew it. It was not clear whether the president had seen her gesture, but the lack of coordination seemed appropriate: The nation's two most powerful political leaders reportedly have not spoken in four months, since Pelosi confronted Trump during a White House meeting on Syria and stormed out with other Democratic leaders.
The president, who had railed on Twitter earlier in the day against 'phony Witch Hunts and Hoaxes,' sought to convince the public that he had made good on his promises to improve the economy, tighten border controls, toughen the nation's image abroad and disrupt establishment Washington.
In doing so, Trump sought to portray his presidency as a success for more than his hardcore conservative base, on which he has focused extensively for three years. Though he has consistently sown and exploited divisions along lines of race, ethnicity and gender, the president peppered his remarks with nods to prosperity among minority groups and women. His guests seated in first lady Melania Trump's viewing box featured broad diversity.
'The vision I will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society,' said Trump, who has attacked African American lawmakers and sports stars and demonized undocumented immigrants, 'one where every citizen can join in America's unparalleled success, and where every community can take part in America's extraordinary rise.'
And the former reality television star produced moments of pronounced theatrics, including having the first lady drape the Presidential Medal of Freedom around the neck of conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh, who announced this week that he is suffering from pronounced lung cancer, and staging the surprise reunion of a U.S. service member back from a tour in Afghanistan with his family, including two young children. 
In a rare moment of bipartisanship on policy, Democrats and Republicans stood to applaud as Trump introduced Juan Guaidó, Venezuela's opposition leader whom the United States has recognized as that nation's rightful president over the authoritarian regime of Nicolás Maduro. 
For Trump's adversaries, the evening offered a reminder that he remains in a strong position for reelection with nine months to go. After months of testimony from former Trump administration officials who sketched a picture of a president working with a team of outside advisers, including his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, to pressure a foreign leader for his own political gain, Democrats had hoped to win the battle of public opinion even if the president's GOP allies ultimately protect him in the Senate trial.
Trump did not mention the Democratic presidential contenders vying for the nomination to challenge him in November. But ahead of the speech, he sought to create a sense of momentum for his presidency and reelection campaign, offering it as a contrast to the Democrats, who were reeling in the wake of their botched Iowa presidential caucuses, the results of which were still not fully known nearly 24 hours after polls closed Monday evening.
The president and his surrogates touted his own easy victory in the GOP caucuses in Iowa, a result that is expected of an incumbent, promoting it as a sign of Republican Party unity. Trump gloated in a series of tweets, mockingly suggesting Democrats would blame 'RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, instead of their own incompetence' "" a reference to the 17-month special counsel investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and the Trump campaign's contacts with Russian operatives.
'The Democrat Party in Iowa really messed up, but the Republican Party did not,' Trump declared. 
Trump touted the low unemployment rate and spiking stock market, new trade deals with Mexico, Canada and China, progress on construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, and the killing of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Iranian general Qasem Soleimani. 
The Gallup poll released Tuesday puts Trump's approval at 94-percent among Republicans, where it has held steady, and 42-percent among independents, up five points since early January. The survey highlighted the stark partisan divide "" just 7-percent of Democrats approve, making the 87-point gap between the parties the largest in Gallup's history "" but it also laid bare how low unemployment and strong economic growth have powered Trump's standing recently: 63 percent of Americans approve of his handling of the economy, up six points since November. 
In his speech, Trump highlighted successful legislation to provide federal workers with paid family leave, his administration's investment in a new Space Force branch of the military and efforts to slash 'job-killing regulations.' 
Twice he railed against the ills of socialism, possibly intended as a dig at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a self-described 'democratic socialist' who is a leading contender for the Democratic nomination. 
In an apparent attempt to clean up a recent suggestion that he would consider cutting entitlement spending, Trump said: 'I have also made an ironclad pledge to American families: We will always protect patients with preexisting conditions. And we will always protect your Medicare and your Social Security.' Trump and Republicans, however, are asking the courts to toss out the Affordable Care Act, which guarantees protections for preexisting conditions, and have not offered any replacement.
With the president commanding a national audience in the tens of millions, the Democrats faced an uphill task in countering his message. The party tapped a young female governor from a Midwestern swing state, Michigan's Gretchen Whitmer (D), 48, to offer their rebuttal, in an address that traditionally reaches a far smaller television audience. 
Like the president, she did not mention impeachment, focusing on health care and pocketbook issues, a message that helped Democrats take control of the House and win several key statewide elections in the 2018 midterms.
 'It doesn't matter what the president says about the stock market,' Whitmer said. 'What matters is that millions of people struggle to get by or don't have enough money at the end of the month after paying for transportation, student loans or prescription drugs.'
But the policy talk was promptly overshadowed after the formal remarks were over as the vicious political combat resumed. Asked by a reporter what she thought of Trump's speech, Pelosi responded bluntly: 'I tore it up.'

When President Trump sought to reassure a nation on edge over the coronavirus, he was flanked Wednesday evening at the White House by more than a half-dozen public health experts.
But the very officials whose expertise the president is now counting on are part of the vast bureaucracy of scientists and other public servants that Trump has repeatedly maligned, ignored and jettisoned.
Throughout his more than three years as president, Trump has obsessed, at times conspiratorially, over what he calls the 'deep state' "" the thousands of career government specialists in national security, intelligence, science and other areas whose expertise he shuns in part because he suspects they are disloyal saboteurs.
And so, with the first case of coronavirus not tied to foreign travel being announced in California on Wednesday, Trump finds himself grappling with a crisis for which his record suggests he is particularly ill-suited to respond.
At a moment that demands sobriety and honesty, Trump is a leader prone to hyperbole and falsehoods. As the financial markets and the public crave order and clarity, Trump has a penchant for creating chaos and confusion. And at a time when expertise is paramount, Trump has hollowed out the government agencies responsible for the tasks at hand.
'People should speak without hyperbole and try to be cool, calm and collected and pay attention to the experts,' said Andrew Card, a White House chief of staff in the George W. Bush administration who helped manage the response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the SARS outbreak in the early 2000s. 'Try not to be driven by emotion, and don't say things that are not true. This is when you stick to the facts and don't invite fear or impulsive behavior.'
Trump's charge is to calm, rather than con, a frightened nation. But now in his fourth year in office, he lacks credibility with broad swaths of the country "" the sort of safety net that many of his predecessors could fall back on in moments of crisis.
Stephen Morrison, a senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, where he directs the center's global health work, said that while the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has done 'a fine job' in regularly updating the public with guidance, 'the trick and the missing part is the communications at a higher level to the American public, and that's from the president and the president's designated surrogates.'

Trump has already contradicted his top health officials. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Tuesday that it was not a question of 'if' coronavirus spreads in the United States but 'when.'
A day later, Trump offered a different assessment: 'I don't think it's inevitable,' the president said at his news conference. 'I think that there's a chance that it could get worse. There's a chance it could get fairly substantially worse. But nothing's inevitable.'
He also claimed that the virus might dissipate by April, when the weather warms "" but while some viruses do falter in warmer temperatures, there is no clear evidence that this coronavirus will behave similarly.
Ron Klain, who led the Obama administration's response to the Ebola outbreak in 2014 and is now an adviser to former vice president Joe Biden's presidential campaign, said a challenge for Trump in managing this crisis is his 'desire to happy-talk away every problem.'
By downplaying coronavirus concerns, Klain argued, Trump may be 'trying to pump the stock market, but the virus is not going to be persuaded by Trump's tweets. He needs to communicate straightforwardly with the American people what's happening.'
It is not the first time Trump has provided questionable information in the middle of a crisis. Last year, as Hurricane Dorian bore down on the Eastern Seaboard, Trump used a thick black Sharpie marker to doctor an official National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration map to support his tendentious warning to the people of Alabama that the storm would probably hit their state.
Trump's presidency has been guided by an ethos that then-candidate Trump articulated at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland: 'I alone can fix it.'
Once in office, Trump shunned government experts. He shortened or tuned out some of his intelligence and national security briefings and rejected some of the conclusions of scientists. He relied on his instincts, rather than the expertise of those around him, to make decisions in virtually every realm.
'I have a gut, and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me,' Trump said in a 2018 interview with The Washington Post "" a statement about his feud with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell but one that also illustrates his overall governing philosophy.

In the scientific community, Trump has been similarly dismissive. By the spring of his first year in office, there were nearly 700 vacant positions at the CDC because of a hiring freeze that officials said would affect programs supporting infectious-disease control and health-emergency readiness.
Trump's 2021 budget, submitted to Congress this month, proposes cuts to a broad array of health and scientific programs, including trimming the CDC's funding by almost 16-percent and reducing overall funding for global health initiatives.
'You're going to have to beat this with the 'deep state' "" that is, the experts inside [the National Institutes of Health] and CDC and Homeland Security,' Klain said. 'But there's a general view in this administration that they don't trust these permanent experts who've served Democratic and Republican administrations both.'
For Trump, the political stakes of bungling the coronavirus response could be devastating. The president and his advisers have long relied on robust financial markets, low unemployment and high consumer confidence to smooth his path to reelection. 'I'll be running on the economy,' Trump said in 2019.
But faced with fears of a global pandemic, U.S. markets fell sharply throughout the week "" making it one of the worst weeks since the financial crisis of 2008.
Past presidents who have failed to manage crises have often faced swift political backlash. Bush struggled to recover from his handling of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, which left over 1,200 dead and displaced thousands more across the Gulf Coast. In the next year's midterm elections, Bush's Republican Party lost control of both houses of Congress.
'The Katrina comparison is very apt,' Morrison said. 'This has potentially enormous consequences for the United States. It has enormous consequences that will touch many more citizens than Katrina touched, potentially.'
It remains unclear just how the coronavirus will play out "" whether it will become Trump's Katrina or, defying alarmist assumptions, prove a testament to Trump's managerial prowess.

But already there are signs that the administration's handling of the current crisis has assumed a distinctly Trumpian sheen. The president initially weighed in on Twitter while traveling abroad in India, offering an uncomfortable dissonance from the facts playing out on the ground in the United States and around the globe.
'Stock Market starting to look very good to me!' he wrote on the day the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 1,000 points. In another, later tweet, he misspelled the name of the virus as 'caronavirus.'
Meanwhile, the president was fuming, in public and in private, over news coverage of the virus and the market collapse and quickly personalized the crisis. Trump accused news organizations and Democratic congressional leaders of intentionally trying to scare people to make him look bad.
Only upon his return to Washington, as he realized that the coronavirus was dominating all news cycles, did Trump decide to try to assume more of a leadership role, scheduling a news conference that he would lead Wednesday evening.
But even that had a slapdash quality. All day, reports of infighting among Trump's top staffers, including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, leaked to the news media. And the president's announcement that he was deputizing Vice President Pence to oversee all handling of the outbreak blindsided administration officials, including those deeply involved in the response.
The president "" an avowed germophobe "" also couldn't help but insert himself squarely into the discussion. As he talked about preventive measures, he offered his own personal-hygiene perspective, suggesting people treat the coronavirus like the common flu.
'When somebody sneezes,' Trump began, 'I mean, I try and bail out as much as possible when there's sneezing.'

White House lawyers are trying to engineer the fastest impeachment trial in American history, aiming to have President Trump acquitted by the Senate without witnesses and after just a few days of proceedings, according to senior administration officials. 
Trump's desire for a short trial has solidified over the past few weeks, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) delayed transmitting two articles of impeachment to the Senate because of concerns about how the trial would be structured. The White House, which previously supported a more expansive trial in the GOP-led Senate, has now accepted the idea that senators should make quick work of acquitting Trump.
'I think it's extraordinarily unlikely that we'd be going beyond two weeks,' said a senior administration official, who briefed reporters Wednesday on the condition of anonymity. 'We think that this case is overwhelming for the president, and the Senate's not going to be having any need to be taking that amount of time on this.'
President Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial in 1868 lasted 11 weeks. President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999 lasted more than a month.
The trial, which begins Thursday in the Senate, will be the Trump legal team's first official attempt to substantively defend the president against charges that he abused his power by politicizing the U.S. relationship with Ukraine and obstructed Congress by blocking lawmakers' attempt to investigate him.
The White House has derided the House impeachment inquiry as politically motivated and based on secondhand information and flimsy evidence. The president's lawyers plan during the Senate trial to dissect the testimony of Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, according to senior administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Sondland, a Trump donor, made explosive revelations during a televised November hearing implicating the president and others in a 'quid pro quo' scheme to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Trump's political rivals.
Sondland revised his testimony several times between his closed-door meeting with lawmakers and his public appearance before Congress, an issue the president's lawyers hope to use to cast doubt on his reliability.
White House aides are also gaming out how to manage Trump during the trial, which they expect him to watch and possibly tweet about while it is underway, as he did during the House impeachment hearings, according to the officials. Trump allies plan to have several surrogates on television defending the president during the trial. Republican House members, many of whom jockeyed for official roles on the defense team for the Senate trial, will instead fan out across television networks to ensure that the president's message gets out and that Trump feels he is receiving a robust defense, the officials said. 
White House Counsel Pat Cipollone is expected to lead the president's team during the trial, after Trump heeded the advice of Senate Republicans who urged him not to appoint House members to his legal team. Trump's outside counsel Jay Sekulow and deputy White House counsel Pat Philbin are also likely to have a role in the Senate proceedings, officials said.
Some White House officials are wondering whether Cipollone, a longtime commercial lawyer who does not usually appear on television, will turn in the kind of performance that will please Trump during the televised proceedings and keep him supportive of the trial strategy that his aides and Senate Republican leaders are advocating.
Trump, who has vacillated on the desirability of having a lengthy trial vs. quick proceedings, has been influenced by his recent travel to friendly locales outside Washington. 
Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who attended the college football national championship game with the president in Louisiana on Monday, said the cheers from the crowd 'buoyed Trump's spirits' significantly. 
This helped get Trump on board with the plan crafted by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to conduct a swift trial without hearing from key witnesses.
'He wants it done sooner rather than later,' Graham said in an interview. 'I've told him, in my view, 'The sooner the trial is over, the better.'-'
The briefing for reporters Wednesday came after House Democrats named seven impeachment managers and voted to send the two articles of impeachment to the Senate. Democrats said the managers, six lawyers and one former police chief, signify a desire for a full trial with witnesses, documents and other evidence implicating Trump. Anything short of that would be a 'coverup,' Pelosi said.
The crux of the case is the allegation that Trump tried to leverage a White House meeting and military aid, sought by Ukraine to combat Russian military aggression, to pressure Zelensky into announcing and launching an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, as well as a probe of an unfounded theory that Kyiv conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
'The president violated his oath of office, undermined our national security, jeopardized the integrity of our elections, tried to use the appropriations process as his private ATM machine . . . to advance his own personal and political advantage,' Pelosi said Wednesday. 
A senior administration official briefing reporters said that House Democrats' case lacked evidence of wrongdoing by Trump, but the official refused to address new documentary evidence that Democrats say further implicates the president.
The official indicated that Trump is likely to block efforts by Democrats to further build their case through new witnesses, including former national security adviser John Bolton. Allowing testimony from a former presidential aide about his discussions with Trump on foreign policy would be 'extraordinary,' said the official, who added that he did not think the Senate should hear from any witnesses. Another official said the White House was prepared to exert executive privilege if the Senate subpoenas Bolton, who has said he is willing to testify under subpoena about Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
On Wednesday, House Democrats continued to press Republicans to allow evidence that the White House has so far blocked.
'We have only obtained a very small sample of the universe of documents that the president is withholding,' said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), after he was named one of the impeachment managers. 'If Mr. McConnell wants to follow the Clinton model, as he keeps professing, all of the documents were provided before the trial. Those documents should be demanded by the senators.'
Several members of Trump's legal team, including Cipollone and Sekulow, have expressed expansive views on executive power and have experience in rebuffing congressional inquiries. 
Cipollone was at the White House last weekend preparing for the case, and White House legislative affairs director Eric Ueland has talked to aides extensively about rules and procedural motions they can make during the trial, officials said. Ueland worked as a staffer for a Republican senator during the Clinton impeachment trial. 
In an Oct. 8 letter to the House, Cipollone declared the impeachment inquiry unconstitutional and illegitimate and said the Trump administration would not participate in it. 
Erwin Chemerinsky, the dean of the University of California at Berkeley's Law School, said the 'very disturbing' letter was an indication that Cipollone would take the same antagonistic approach to the Senate trial. 
 'The October 8 letter was very disturbing because of its very aggressive and combative tone. It also reflected no recognition of the importance of accountability and congressional oversight,' he said. 'I expect that his taking the lead will mean the same very aggressive and combative approach that puts the president above the law.'
During Clinton's impeachment trial, his legal team spent three days methodically addressing the various charges against him as the chief justice of the United States presided and most senators sat silently. 
Trump's defense could be considerably shorter. A senior administration official said the White House would mount a 'strong case' for the president but that a long trial would not be necessary. 
'The reason it doesn't take a very long time is that the facts are simple, and the facts are on the president's side,' the official said. 'When you have an easy case, you don't need a long time to present it.'
Trump will spend some of his time trying to build a case for his presidency outside the halls of the Senate, officials said. 
Over the next two weeks, Trump plans to travel to the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, host a political fundraiser in Florida, speak to farmers in Texas and hold at least two political rallies. 
Trump, the first American president to face impeachment while running for reelection, has spent much of his time recently discussing his reelection, talking to advisers about rallies and specific states, according to people familiar with the situation. He spent a good part of the day Friday with former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, aides said, and regularly asks about specific states and Democratic presidential candidates. 
Graham said the president is already thinking of ways to turn the page from the Senate trial. 
'He's really thinking about what to do after impeachment,' he said. 'He wants to come out with something strong after impeachment to challenge Democrats.'

President Trump's decision to authorize the killing of a top Iranian general and his threats since are quickly reshaping the contours of the 2020 presidential race, with leaders in both parties evaluating advantages and risks as they attempt to position themselves for maximum gain.
Trump, who rarely makes major moves without first calculating the ramifications for his popularity and self-image, has confided to advisers that he sees a political upside in his hard-line approach to Iran at the dawn of this year's campaign, according to two White House officials and several senior Republicans.
Trump believes he has an opportunity to expand his support among voters as a wartime commander in chief and is trying to cast his Democratic critics as soft on terrorism, they said. They added that he sees his party as more united behind him than ever, even as his impeachment trial looms in the Senate, with some Republicans now arguing it would be irresponsible and dangerous to remove a president amid a national security crisis.
Trump struck a harshly partisan tone Monday that foreshadowed the political battles to come. Calling into Rush Limbaugh's nationally syndicated radio show, the president maligned Democrats as 'trying to make' Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani 'sound like he was this wonderful human being' and argued that 'elements of that party [are] openly supporting Iran, an enemy of the United States.'
Still, Trump risks cracking apart his support among voters who cheered his noninterventionist streak in 2016, when he called the Iraq War a 'horrible mistake' while using militaristic and brutal language when speaking of Muslims and Middle Eastern issues.
Many of Trump's Democratic challengers, meanwhile, believe the president's actions carry a political benefit for them among swing voters fearful of yet another war, who could more sharply question Trump's worldview and fitness for office.

On the campaign trail in Iowa, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) repeatedly has blasted the killing of Soleimani as 'reckless' and said she would not have ordered the strike were she president. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has been critical as well, trying to rally antiwar Democrats to his side ahead of what his advisers envision as a potential showdown with former vice president Joe Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination.
But with less than a month to go before Iowa's Feb. 3 caucuses, the consequences for the Democrats' primary contest are so far unclear, as the party's antiwar wing takes on the more moderate polling leader, Biden, who once supported military intervention in Iraq.
It is too early to accurately measure the political fallout, and operatives from both parties warned against making assumptions about public sentiments.
'President Trump is probably getting a lot of 'attaboys' from his friends, and he is producing a daily reality show, but politically and policy-wise, this is going to be much more complicated than just saying, 'Hey, I took a bad guy out,' ' said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama.
Michael Steele, a former Republican National Committee chairman, said: 'The Republican Party is going to own this and they need to be careful. You can cheerlead the president, but do you really know what he wants to do here, in the middle of a 17-year narrative, and how it'll play out? No, you don't.'
On Capitol Hill, congressional Republicans rallied around the president on Monday. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a floor speech that some Democrats 'rushed to downplay Soleimani's evil while presenting our own president as the villain.' He added, 'Can we not maintain a shred, just a shred of national unity for five minutes, for five minutes before deepening the partisan trenches?'

Beneath the veneer of unity, however, there is some dissent among Republicans. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has long been a noninterventionist, shied away from a direct confrontation with Trump but tweeted Monday: 'Great nations avoid endless wars by becoming LESS involved in the turmoil of the Middle East, which would mean less troops not more.'
At his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida over the past week, Trump privately told advisers he was surprised at how many Democrats criticized him for taking action "" and he has spoken encouragingly about how his decision is being received by many Americans on social media and in news coverage, according to two White House officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
Trump has boasted that he feels like he caught the Iranians 'red-handed' as they attempted to plan future attacks and finds it 'almost funny' that Democrats 'can't say, 'Wow, this is great,' ' according to one of the officials.
Trump's confidence in himself and Republicans has been bolstered by Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who have repeatedly assured the president that congressional Republicans support taking military action, the officials said. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who dined with the president Thursday night, has done the same, they added.
Trump's private comments, in phone conversations and as he mingled with guests there over dinner, have also routinely come back to his reelection chances "" going between foreign policy decision-making and 2020 talk.
As last week's strike was unfolding, Trump casually discussed whether 'Bernie or Biden' would be easier to beat, according to conservative talk-show host Howie Carr, who published an essay about his time Thursday night at Mar-a-Lago.
'Who'd be better to run against? Bernie or Biden?' Trump asked, according to Carr's account. 'He wanted to talk 2020 politics.'

In particular, Trump is keeping close watch on Biden, whom he continues to see as his likely future rival in the fall election campaign, the officials and others close to the president said.
White House officials and leading Republicans said, however, that Trump should not be considered a hawk and that he was prone in meetings to bemoan 'nation-building.' 
For Trump, appearing tough on Iran while remaining reluctant to commit ground troops is an uneasy balance but one achieved by past GOP presidents who wanted to be seen as strong but not as interventionists, according to former House speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump ally.
'Nobody thought of [Ronald] Reagan as a wartime president because he was very surgical, used our strengths and didn't put American boots on the ground,' Gingrich said.
For Trump, there are considerable political risks as he weighs options with Iran and contemplates additional military actions.
History is replete with examples of presidents accruing short-term benefits from war and military confrontations but suffering long-term consequences. Americans initially rallied around President Jimmy Carter in 1979 during the Iran hostage crisis, but public opinion quickly turned on him and Carter was defeated for reelection a year later.
More recently, George W. Bush initially was buoyed after sending Americans to war in Afghanistan and Iraq, but support for those conflicts waned, and he only narrowly won reelection in 2004 and his party lost its congressional majorities in 2006.
'Ask George W. Bush about how these things go,' said former Arizona senator Jeff Flake (R), a Trump critic. 'It's all fraught with danger.'

There are serious differences with today's crisis, in part because of Trump's provocative posture.
'If something bad happens, it will be more than on his watch; it will be on him individually,' said Peter Hart, a veteran Democratic pollster. 'He precipitated the action, versus something that happened to the country therefore we rallied around him. The downside is he owns it from beginning to end.'
Robert Shrum, who advised Democrat John F. Kerry's unsuccessful campaign to defeat Bush in 2004, warned: 'A new war in the Middle East would create incredible and unpredictable problems for Trump. Now, the country is not up for a new war.'
Former Vermont governor Howard Dean, who rode antiwar sentiment to a strong showing early in the 2004 Democratic presidential primaries, said Sanders could benefit from a renewed interest in Iraq but that such an upswing was far from certain. He said the 'big push 29 days before Iowa is going to be about the whole chess game that's going on among the front-runners, not just one issue.'
'The real way this matters down the road is in how Trump handles it, and it could show more people he's incompetent. The more people who see that, the better,' Dean said. 'As for the antiwar wing of the Democratic Party, they're already galvanized against Trump, so it's more about picking up voters around the margins.'
Sanders and Warren are not the only Democratic candidates seizing on Iran as an issue. Others, too, are navigating the terrain with new vigor, including two contenders rising in Iowa polls: former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).
Klobuchar has stressed her experience, while Buttigieg, a retired military intelligence officer, has spoken about understanding the cost of war. 'My mind is with the troops who are moving to the Middle East, and having known what it's like to be on the inside of one of those airplanes, you need to be able to trust that everybody up your chain of command has thought through what's ahead,' Buttigieg said Monday on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe.'
But Joseph I. Lieberman, a former senator and Democratic vice presidential nominee, issued a warning to the party's leaders about a negative reaction to Trump's order to kill Soleimani. 
'If enough voters decide that Democrats can't be trusted to keep America safe, Mr. Trump won't have much trouble winning a second term in November,' Lieberman, who has long been known for his hawkish foreign policy views, wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed.

For each of the three nights of prosecutors' opening arguments, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) delivered emotional finales to the day's impeachment testimony that received high praise from Democrats and even from some of President Trump's closest GOP allies. 
But when Trump's legal defense team took over Saturday morning, Schiff went from lauded orator to the top target of the effort to undercut the House managers' case against the president. The president's lawyers bookended their two-hour presentation with attacks on Schiff's character and credibility.
Democrats were delighted when Schiff's passionate appeal to Republican senators to put country before Trump went viral "" a cinematic moment for the congressman from Hollywood who once dreamed of writing screenplays.

His performance this past week even prompted Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), one of Trump's friends in the Senate, to stop him in the Capitol on Wednesday night to tell him 'good job' and praise him as 'well-spoken.' Graham said he praised Schiff's performance to Trump, too.
Even if some Senate Republicans found Schiff to be a compelling speechmaker, they also agree with Trump's lawyers that the congressman is an unreliable storyteller, a criticism that echoes the president's more biting invectives against the House Intelligence Committee chairman. And his passionate pleas are unlikely to sway GOP senators, most of whom made up their minds long ago to vote to acquit Trump.
Immediately, Trump's team put front-and-center one frequent GOP attack on Schiff: his decision, at the outset of the first hearing under impeachment auspices on Sept.-26, to read a dramatized version of Trump's July-25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pressuring him to investigate his domestic political rivals.
Schiff said it was 'meant to be at least part in parody,' but it fueled scores of attacks over the ensuing months. 
Beginning his presentation Saturday, Deputy White House Counsel Mike Purpura played video of Schiff at the September hearing and used it to launch a broadside against the House probe.
'That's fake. That's not the real call,' he said. 'We can shrug it off and say we were making light or a joke. But that was in a hearing in the United States House of Representatives discussing the removal of the president of the United States from office. There are very few things, if any, that can be as grave and as serious. Let's stick with the evidence.'
Schiff anticipated the attack in his closing argument Friday. 'I discovered something very significant by mocking the president, and that is for a man who loves to mock others, he does not like to be mocked,' he said, drawing chuckles in the chamber "" including from some Republican senators. 'Never mind that I said I wasn't using his words. . . . 'It's an outrage! He mocked the president! That Schiff "" terrible!' '
There were more assaults on Schiff's credibility to come, including his insistence throughout special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's exhaustive investigation that Trump was guilty of colluding with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election. 
Deputy White House Counsel Patrick F. Philbin played a recording of a March 2017 television interview in which Schiff claimed there was 'more than circumstantial evidence' of collusion. 
That claim was not supported by Mueller's final report, Philbin said, and thus should color senators' willingness to believe Schiff's present charges against Trump.
'He has been telling you things like: What's in President Trump's head? What's in President Zelensky's head? It's all his interpretation of the facts and the evidence, trying to pull inferences out of things,' Philbin said. 
Philbin also poked at another problematic issue for Schiff: the question of his committee's interaction with the anonymous whistleblower who sparked the impeachment investigation. Schiff initially claimed no contact with the whistleblower, then later admitted Intelligence Committee staff had contact and had encouraged the person to seek legal counsel and speak to the inspector general.
The Trump team showed clips of Schiff at the start of the probe saying he would be open to calling the whistleblower to testify, and they questioned why Schiff ultimately decided not to interview the person. 
Schiff has said the account of the whistleblower, who only knew about the July-25 call secondhand, became irrelevant once the committee had corroborated the accusation with people in the Trump administration who had more direct knowledge. 
Schiff offered a preemptory defense of his handling of the whistleblower in his closing argument Friday night. 
'There were certain questions I didn't allow "" questions like, who's the whistleblower?' he said. 'Because, yes, some of us [lawmakers] believe we ought to protect whistleblowers. . . . We don't think, though the president might, that they're traitors and spies.'
Ever since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) entrusted the impeachment inquiry to Schiff in his capacity as chairman of the Intelligence Committee "" and even before that "" the 10-term congressman has been a constant in Trump's name-calling rotation. 
At rallies and on social media, Trump calls him 'Shifty Schiff' and makes fun of what the president says is his thin neck. Trump's campaign sells a T-shirt of Schiff with a red clown nose and a pencil for a neck. The description says: 'Schiff's neck size is only 9-inches!'
On Saturday morning, the president tweeted: 'Our case against lyin', cheatin', liddle' Adam 'Shifty' Schiff, Cryin' Chuck Schumer, Nervous Nancy Pelosi, their leader, dumb as a rock AOC, - the entire Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrat Party, starts today at 10:00 A.M. on @FoxNews, @OANN or Fake News @CNN or Fake News MSDNC!' 
Trump's focus on Schiff as a foe has opened the congressman up to attacks not just from Trump's base, but also from GOP members of Congress, many of whom seemed gleeful that Trump's lawyers went so hard on him. 
Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), the No. 3 Senate GOP leader, said the White House case 'truly undermined the credibility of Adam Schiff' and brought up the Schiff 'fictionalized, made-up' dramatized reading of the rough transcript of the July-25 phone call. 

Republicans are expected to keep hammering Schiff next week and could seek to put him on the spot with these critiques when the trial moves to its question-and-answer phase. 
The Republican National Committee blasted an email celebrating the lawyers' attacks on Schiff and knocking him for a comment he made during Friday night's closing remarks. 
Schiff, citing a CBS News report, said Republicans who voted against Trump would find their 'head on a pike.' GOP senators claimed outrage over the suggestion that they are threatened by Trump, though none said they were offended by Trump's tweet disparaging Pelosi and other Democrats.
'He lost and offended us,' said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa). 'It's hard to keep an open mind when there's so much baloney being thrown at you.'
Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.) accused Republicans of seizing on that one comment by Schiff and feigning outrage to distract from the charges against Trump. 
 Schiff had a similar take on all the verbal shots being directed at him, calling the criticism over his mention of the CBS report 'pretty thin gruel.'
'They just want to attack the House managers "" that's what you do . . . when your client is guilty, when your client is dead to rights. You don't want to talk about your client's guilt, you want to attack the prosecution,' he said.

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani talks to The Post's


DAVOS, SWITZERLAND

Afghan President Ashraf Ghani is in a tough spot. President Trump has made no secret of his desire to bring home U.S. troops, a classic election year gambit. The Trump administration is now talking directly to the Taliban "" which once ruled Afghanistan, oppressing women and allowing terrorist groups to thrive "" and has excluded Ghani from the discussions. Still, Ghani tells The Washington Post's Lally Weymouth in a wide-ranging interview at the World Economic Forum here, he admires Trump and gets along well with him. Edited excerpts follow.


Q: Have the Taliban fundamentally changed? Don't the current negotiations between the Taliban and the U.S. hinge on that?

A: The leadership has not changed, but the Taliban are not unified. The group that is in Doha [where negotiations take place] has not embraced change. They are after conquest. But the rank and file are really sick and tired of war. Two years ago we had a comprehensive cease-fire countrywide. Every single one of them came to the cities and mixed with our people. After all, they were the ones who were dying, not the leadership in Doha. 
There is a set of really important questions that need to be posed: Are they truly willing to disassociate themselves from transnational terrorist networks "" not just al-Qaeda but the entire range? I have not seen the evidence. There is also the question of the Taliban and its relationship to drugs. They are running the drug network, not just being supported by it. Will they give it up? Because now, there are millions of addicts inside of Afghanistan. And will they accept elections as the key mode of governing in the future? Until now, they have not accepted elections.


Q: I heard that the Taliban are having discussions with members of your government. Is that true?

A: Talks are taking place across the country. This is a society that is very close.


Q: But aren't the Taliban saying in Doha that they won't negotiate with your government?

A: Yes. But without negotiating with us, who are they negotiating with?


Q: What do you think about the fact that the Trump administration is talking to the Taliban without your government?

A: We've not been excluded. We've been briefed continuously. President Trump took a very principled step when he did not accept the draft agreement last fall.


Q: The agreement that was to be finalized at Camp David? President Trump pulled those plans at the last minute.

A: It was because the president had not been briefed before. When he was briefed, we were very happy with the decisions that he made. President Trump's visit to Afghanistan during Thanksgiving was a very productive visit.


Q: Did the president give you any commitments?

A: He thought we had done a lot, and he was pleased with the direction. The loss of American lives has come down radically. Since President Trump took office, less than 50 U.S. soldiers have died. However, thousands of Americans have sacrificed their lives previously, paying the ultimate price.


Q: If the proposed Camp David deal had gone through, President Trump would have reduced U.S. forces in Afghanistan from 14,000 to 8,600. Could you have lived with that?

A: Two things have happened. One: President Trump and the U.S. administration have invested considerably in technology so the numbers are no longer the key. Secondly, the Afghan forces are now doing the bulk of the fighting and managing the war.


Q: Could Afghan forces win the war without U.S. help?

A: We're advancing. In 2014, when I became president, 100,000 NATO troops withdrew, and everyone was saying that we would collapse in moments. We didn't. . . . The remaining U.S. troops are not for the defense of Afghanistan but for the prevention of attacks on the United States.


Q: So do you need a small number of U.S. troops to stay in Afghanistan?

A: A small number is required in order to deal with the threat of terrorism and to support us because it's an advise, assist and training mission "" not a fighting mission.


Q: If the U.S. withdraws, leaving no one behind, will Afghanistan turn into a pre-9/11 terror haven?

A: We would prevent that. The United States helped us in a moment when our resilience was extraordinarily low in 2001. Tyranny, war and five years of drought had really exhausted the people. In the years since, U.S. assistance has been critical in enabling us to build back our resilience. But like all countries, we have to be responsible for securing our own future.


Q: Do you believe that you can enter into negotiations with the Taliban and get a meaningful peace?

A: Yes. We have to try. But not a peace at any cost.


Q: What would you ask the Taliban for?

A: They have to accept elections.


Q: Doesn't the Taliban want to restore Afghanistan to an Islamic emirate?

A: The emirate is not acceptable because that's a dictatorship. The people will not accept it.




Q: But isn't that what the Taliban are saying they want?

A: Before negotiations, people can have any kind of position. They're maximalists. But if they want to be part of an Afghan society, they need to change, and Afghan society needs to accept and adjust to integrate them.


Q: Is that possible?

A: Judging from what we saw during the cease-fire in 2018, yes. The people of Afghanistan want an end to violence.


Q: So there is hope?

A: There is hope. I'm always an optimist.


Q: The Washington Post recently published The Afghanistan Papers, a major investigation in which internal U.S. documents showed how three U.S. presidents, as well as military officials, misled the American public about the Afghan war. What was your reaction to this series?

A: When I was finance minister between 2002 and 2004, I warned about this abuse, waste and mismanagement of foreign aid. I've worked pro bono from 2001, when I returned to Afghanistan, to now. I've never had any dealings with an American company or contractor. . . . I secured the retirement of 2,000 colonels and generals.


Q: Because they were corrupt?

A: Yes, and inefficient.


Q: Is it hard for you, because one minute President Trump is saying he's withdrawing most U.S. troops, and the next he seems to be willing to leave them in place for the moment?

A: I'm one of the few world leaders who has an excellent relationship with President Trump.


Q: But it must have been difficult for you when all of a sudden he said he was going to withdraw U.S. troops.

A: President Trump has not said anything new that he did not say during the campaign. He's had consistency.


Q: Why do you have an excellent relationship with the president?

A: Each time we talk, we've been able to talk very cordially and very well. He has made the right decisions.


Q: He almost had the Taliban come to Camp David and sign an accord.

A: But he didn't. 'Almost' is not what makes history. What makes history is actions.


Q: Didn't President Trump cancel the Camp David talks because the Taliban killed a U.S. soldier in an attack in September 2019, just before the talks were set to begin?

A: Whatever the set of reasons, the critical issue is that he's made the right decisions.


Q: A lot of world leaders complain that Washington is unreliable. Do you feel that way?

A: I've had a very reliable relationship with Washington. Because I don't demand of President Trump what he doesn't want. What I've always said is, 'Give us his parameters of the American interest, and within those parameters, we need to forge the relationship.'


Q: How much of Afghanistan does your government control?

A: The accusation previously was that the president of Afghanistan was just the mayor of Kabul. Today the government controls over 85 percent of the population. Even the Taliban districts rely on government services.


Q: How much territory does the Taliban control?

A: The formal number of districts is now 12 districts out of 386 districts. They used to control 22. . . . We've beaten ISIS.


Q: But ISIS is active in Afghanistan now.

A: But we beat the hell out of them in eastern Afghanistan.


Q: But be honest "" isn't ISIS back in action in your country?

A: ISIS is back in certain parts.


Q: How do you see the future?

A: Afghanistan needs leadership that is clearly oriented towards the future, that understands the present, and that knows it cannot depend on just goodwill or manna from heaven. We have to get our act together.


Q: It seems difficult.

A: It's probably the most difficult job on Earth.


Q: What do you see as the role of women in Afghan society?

A: I want a prominent role for women. Could you have imagined that two Afghan women are now ambassadors both to the United Nations and to the United States?


Q: I read there are 3.5 million women in school in your country.

A: Yes. I have brought women to the center of life in Afghanistan. Now no one bats an eyelash when a woman is appointed to a high-level position. . . . There used to be one woman ceremonially in a high-level position or possibly two. They are everywhere now. Moreover, we have one of the youngest cabinets in the region. Generational change has happened.


Q: The recent election in Afghanistan in September 2019 was very close and is still contested. A ballot recount is ongoing. Do you worry about this?

A: No. The recount is going on. We are fully observing the law. Thus far, the number of votes for my ticket has increased, not decreased. I have fully respected the electoral process.


Q: What is your top worry when you go to sleep at night?

A: To make sure that people are not hungry, that they have hope and that we end violence "" not just that we change the nature of violence. People want stability, prosperity and dignity. I'm elected to deliver those things. I hope that I can deliver on these expectations.

Acquittal, economy, Iowa flop feed angst over odds of fall Democratic victory




Anxiety is coursing through the Democratic Party as President Trump emerges from his impeachment proceedings as a potent threat for reelection, with party leaders and activists uncertain about how to beat the incumbent and worried about a nominating race that remains crowded and is growing more acrimonious.
While Democrats see Trump as a corrosive figure and a threat to the nation, they also see the president and his well-funded campaign tailoring a reelection bid around the strong economy and visceral appeals to his ardent supporters.
Trump's robust political standing came into view this past week, as he claimed vindication from his acquittal in his Senate trial despite damaging House testimony about his conduct with Ukraine "" and set off on a path of retribution by ousting some officials who were witnesses. At the same time, his Gallup approval rating ticked up to 49 percent, its highest point yet.
The developments have generated convulsions of angst among Democrats, who watched their first-in-the-nation Iowa presidential caucuses conclude in a chaotic fiasco and deliver an inconclusive result. Many in the party are now sounding the alarm that denying Trump a second term could be far more difficult than they had calculated.

'We have a president who isn't merely unconventional or challenging institutions and elites, or coloring outside the lines. He's unmoored,' Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) said. Yet, Coons added, he is 'very aware' that Trump could win reelection 'with these economic numbers at his back, all as millions of Americans grow numb to his behavior.'
Since Democratic presidential hopefuls began running through the starting gates a year ago, party activists have been consumed with the question of electability "" specifically, which of the roughly two dozen initial candidates could best stack up against Trump. The result so far has been a form of paralysis, with no presumptive favorite in the race and each leading contender struggling to overcome vulnerabilities and erase doubts.
'The obsession with concocting the Frankenstein to take on Trump has confined us all,' said Jennifer Palmieri, a longtime party strategist who advised Hillary Clinton in 2016 and is not aligned with any candidate this time. 

Palmieri spent the past couple of weeks on the ground in Iowa and New Hampshire observing the candidates up close, including the president, who staged a large rally in Des Moines before the caucuses. She came away deeply concerned about her party as it grapples with how to counter a norm-shattering executive who relishes political combat.
'We are letting Trump drive our process and getting ourselves all tangled up in who might be the best person to foil him,' Palmieri said. 'That became really clear to me just being in Iowa. The voters were so lost. They didn't have any orientation, no grounding. . . . They felt paralyzed by this choice.'



Former Ohio governor Ted Strickland, a supporter of former vice president Joe Biden, agreed: 'The party is torn. It's polarized about what it wants to do. There is a world of difference between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden and no one really knows which way it's going to go "" and you have Pete Buttigieg, a talent, in the mix, and Mike Bloomberg rearing his head here before Super Tuesday.'
Many Democrats lament that they feel stuck in a cycle controlled by the president, with Trump shaping the contours of the race just as he did in 2016 with a blizzard of incendiary statements, lies and provocations "" and, this time, a loyal Republican Party that cheers him at every turn.
'We spend too much time chasing whatever foolishness Trump throws out there, and he's masterful at it,' said Cornell Belcher, a veteran Democratic pollster. 'This has got to be an election fundamentally about Democrats' vision for bringing the country together and solving the big problems that confront us. And if a Democrat can do that, a Democrat can have a good chance of cobbling back together and even expanding the Obama coalition "" and that will beat Trump.'

In his State of the Union address last Tuesday, Trump laid out what he sees as his road map to reelection. 
Trump boasted of his stewardship of the economy under the theme a 'great American comeback.' He threw red meat to his base, in the form of hard-line rhetoric on illegal immigration and policies on religious liberty, guns and charter schools. He made direct appeals to black voters who had shunned him in 2016 by touting his work on criminal justice reform and other issues. 
Trump also orchestrated dazzling reality-show reveals, such as first lady Melania Trump awarding talk-radio icon Rush Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And the president's speech featured his customary litany of false statements that outrage Democrats, such as casting himself as a guardian of health coverage for those with preexisting conditions, despite his administration's repeated efforts to repeal and gut former president Barack Obama's health-care law "" all but daring the fact-checkers to blow their whistles.

Trump's speech at the Capitol "" and an hour-plus event Thursday in the East Room of the White House where he bragged and demeaned his opponents "" has created more urgency than ever among some Democrats about calling out Trump or else risk having him define the terms of debate. 
'We've got to be a little more dramatic about exposing him,' Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said. 'You can't just be anti-Trump alone. You've got to go at the truth.'
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has tried to play umpire, standing over the president's shoulder at the conclusion of his State of the Union and ripping printed pages of his prepared text because, as she later told reporters, she considered it 'a manifesto of mistruths.'

Many Democratic lawmakers celebrated Pelosi, their party's de facto leader until a presumptive presidential nominee emerges, seeing her as a forceful guide at a turbulent crossroads.
'One of Trump's real skills is that he's a fighter, and if someone is going to punch you, punch back 10 times harder,' Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.), a Pelosi ally, said. 'I like a fighter and how she stands up to him. We've worked with him on a number of issues, but you can't back down to a bully.'
Still, Trump's address was a sobering moment for Democrats.
'The last 24 hours have been a big wake-up call for Democrats. The Iowa caucus was a debacle. Then Donald Trump produced a very strong, clinical speech that shows exactly what he thinks he needs to do to win,' Van Jones, chief executive of Reform Alliance and a former Obama adviser, wrote Wednesday in an op-ed on CNN's website.
Trump is making a deliberate effort to court minority voters. During last weekend's Super Bowl, the president's reelection campaign aired an ad during the game's broadcast spotlighting the criminal justice law. The ad showed Alice Marie Johnson, a 64-year-old black woman from Mississippi who was freed after Trump commuted her prison sentence for a nonviolent drug offense. She is seen in the ad hugging her family and friends, thanking Trump and declaring, 'Hallelujah!'
Trump and his campaign team are banking that this kind of messaging helps him overcome his history of making racist comments and questioning Obama's love of country and credentials. He has a difficult road ahead. A recent Washington Post-Ipsos poll of black voters showed that more than 8 in 10 say they believe Trump is 'a racist,' and 9 in 10 say they disapprove of the president's performance in office. 

Republicans are eager to echo Trump as they try to chip into Democratic strongholds throughout the South and Midwest. Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), a Trump ally who is running for reelection this year, said Trump's emphasis on criminal justice reform and stoking economic opportunity for minority communities 'sure does' help his own Senate campaign in a state where black and Latino voters are pivotal.
'We've got [historically black colleges and universities], we've got criminal justice reform, we've got the economy going,' Perdue said, arguing that Trump has been the best president for the black community since Abraham Lincoln in the 1860s "" a claim that, like many of Trump's, infuriates Democrats. 
Some Democratic leaders believe their party stands the best chance of defeating Trump with a nominee who can inspire a movement of new voters to register and cast ballots in November's general election, as opposed to one focused on mobilizing existing voters. 
'The other side will try to purge the heck out of existing voters, but if you flood the zone with new voters and arm them with information, they will come out,' said Maria Teresa Kumar, president of Voto Latino. 'If I were selling Nikes, I would not go into saturated markets, because how many people will buy that fifth pair of Nikes? I'd rather go into new markets where people might say, 'Hey, I'd like to buy a pair of Nikes.''
There are tensions, however, about who is best positioned to expand the party's reach: a grass-roots liberal favorite like Sanders (I-Vt.) or Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.); a new face like Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind.; or a self-funder building a massive political machine like Bloomberg, the former New York mayor. 
Biden's weak performance in Iowa has caused particular concern among many of the party's older donors and establishment figures since they have long thought the former vice president could stitch much of the Obama coalition back together and serve as a uniting force in a party divided between left and center.
Democrats believe they retook the House majority in 2018 by focusing on health care and other pocketbook issues in suburban districts, and Pelosi has tried to keep her party following that playbook. She tweeted last week that the three most important issues to Americans are '1) Health care, 2) Health care, 3) Health care.'

But there are sharp differences of opinion on that strategy within the party. Former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, who withdrew from the presidential race last fall, said in an interview that Democrats should not stray from speaking in stark terms about Trump's conduct and the stakes for the nation, even if polling suggests they concentrate on other issues.
'There is a school of thought that you shouldn't talk about impeachment and instead talk about infrastructure and health care, as if they're mutually exclusive,' O'Rourke said. 'You can't shy away from the most obvious threat to this country, and if you do, you accept Donald Trump, and then we become complicit in it and we won't win the next election.'
O'Rourke added: 'Many are tempted to despair right now with the president being acquitted or this freak show of a presidency and the cult of personality that the Republican Party has become. But if you give into that, it's over.'
Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), a party stalwart who has been involved with presidential campaigns in her state for decades, said Democrats must keep in mind that political dynamics can quickly change.
'I remember the 1992 campaign at this point when everybody was throwing up their hands, worried that we had 'the seven dwarfs' running against George H.W. Bush,' Shaheen recalled, nodding toward the then-incumbent president's high approval ratings following the Gulf War.
'And then we won,' she said, when Bill Clinton beat Bush later that year.
Shaheen demurred when asked who is 2020's version of Bill Clinton. 
'We'll just have to find out,' she said.

Lawyers Dershowitz, Starr backed president on TV in impeachment
The team of lawyers expected to guide President Trump toward an election-year acquittal in the Senate expanded suddenly Friday to include Kenneth W. Starr and Alan Dershowitz, two of the biggest legal celebrities of the 1990s, who have drawn attention with their television appearances and involvement in Jeffrey Epstein's defense against charges of child prostitution in the mid-2000s.
Starr, the independent counsel who investigated President Bill Clinton, and Dershowitz, the Harvard Law emeritus professor who advised the defense team in football star O.J. Simpson's murder trial, were announced as the newest members of Trump's defense. The group will also include former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi and former independent counsel Robert Ray, according to Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's personal attorneys, who will lead the defense with the White House Counsel Pat Cipollone.
The four new lawyers were selected personally by Trump for their political-legal celebrity and vocal defenses of the president in the media "" and despite the significant professional baggage that several of them bring to the impeachment saga.
Trump faces possible removal from office after the House impeached him last month on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. He is expected to survive the trial, thanks to the Senate's Republican majority, though a weeks-long spectacle laying out allegations about his conduct toward Ukraine could be an embarrassing ordeal for the president.
Starr, 73, became a national figure in 1994 when he was named independent counsel to lead the investigation of the Whitewater scandal. That probe eventually focused on Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky and produced a hefty report that described their encounters in lurid detail. By the time the House impeached Clinton in December 1998, Starr had become a lightning rod and a symbol of what Clinton supporters viewed as the puritanical mania of Republicans bent on driving the president from office.
Trump sees the presence of Starr, a former solicitor general who was once considered for a nomination to the Supreme Court, as a way to shore up his credibility during the Senate trial. He repeatedly tweeted praise for Starr's friendly commentary during the House impeachment proceedings.
The president's attitude was quite different in 1999.
To MSNBC, Trump said: 'I think Ken Starr is a lunatic. I really think that Ken Starr is a disaster. . . . I really think that Ken Starr was terrible.'
To columnist Maureen Dowd, he said: 'Starr's a freak. I bet he's got something in his closet.'
To CNBC, he said: 'I mean, can you imagine those evenings when [Clinton's] just being lambasted by this crazy Ken Starr, who is a total wacko? . . . I mean, he is totally off his rocker.'
After returning to private practice in 1999, Starr became the dean of Pepperdine University's law school and then the president of Baylor University in Waco, Tex., in 2010. In 2016, he was ousted from Baylor amid an unfolding scandal over the school's handling of sexual assault allegations involving members of the football team. An investigation found that Baylor had 'failed to consistently support' victims of sexual assault and 'failed to take action to identify and eliminate a potentially hostile environment, prevent its recurrence, or address its effects.'
Starr has claimed he did not know about the allegations, telling NPR in 2018: 'Unfortunately "" and this is going to sound like an apologia, but it is the absolute truth "" never was it brought to my attention that there were these issues.'
In the mid-2000s, Starr and Dershowitz were part of Epstein's legal team when the wealthy investor was under investigation on suspicion of child prostitution. Epstein, a convicted sex offender, was found dead in his jail cell last year in an apparent suicide. A plea deal that Epstein's accusers have criticized as overly lenient was struck with Alex Acosta, a U.S. attorney in Florida during that period.
After renewed criticism of the deal led to Acosta's resignation as labor secretary last year, Starr described his own role in the case, saying he was enlisted to make a constitutional argument that the crimes Epstein was accused of were state, not federal, offenses.
'I was making a federalism argument,' Starr told Fox News host Laura Ingraham in July 2019. 'Don't federally criminalize this area of the law that really does belong to the states. . . . There were no allegations of crossing state lines in the Florida situation.'
In the interview, Starr called the accusations against Epstein 'serious . . . obviously.'
Dershowitz's friendship with Epstein has produced a war of lawsuits and countersuits.
After Virginia Roberts Giuffre claimed she had sex with Dershowitz at Epstein's behest in the early 2000s, when she was underage, Dershowitz issued a torrent of denials, calling her a 'certified, complete, total liar' who invented the accusation to sell her story. Giuffre is suing him for defamation, and Dershowitz has countersued her for defamation.
Some White House officials hoped Trump would not pick Dershowitz, to avoid references to his entanglement with Epstein.
In an interview with The Washington Post last month, Dershowitz declined to say whether he would join the team. 'Just ask me if I've had sex with any underage girls, that I'm happy to answer. And the answer is no,' he said.
The legal drama surrounding Dershowitz's involvement with Epstein has, at times, overshadowed the 81-year-old's legacy as one of America's best-known courtroom stars. He was a constant presence in American living rooms as part of the defense team during Simpson's trial, which was televised live. But by then, he was already a household name, immortalized on the big screen in the film 'Reversal of Fortune,' which documented his successful appeal of socialite Claus von Bulow's conviction for the attempted murder of his wealthy wife.
In Trump, Dershowitz has found a client with a similar appetite for bombast "" though his embrace of the president came as a surprise to some. He opposed Trump in the 2016 campaign and has described himself as a 'loyal liberal' who has supported Democratic presidential candidates since the 1950s.
But when Trump's legal problems were mounting, Dershowitz proved to be a headline-grabbing advocate for the embattled president. On television, he made his position clear: 'A sitting president cannot be charged with a crime.' In 2018, he published a book titled 'The Case Against Impeaching Trump.'
Dershowitz told The Post on Friday that he would present arguments at the Senate trial that obstruction of Congress and abuse of power do not meet the constitutional standard to impeach a president for high crimes and misdemeanors.
Dershowitz said he was participating on Trump's legal team 'to defend the integrity of the Constitution and to prevent the creation of a dangerous constitutional precedent.'
'The president asked me to present my independent constitutional arguments in my books and my articles to the Senate. My argument is going to be directed at the constitutional criteria and why they haven't been met in this case,' he said.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's personal attorneys, called Dershowitz a 'great choice' for the defense team. Giuliani said he was kept out of the group because of his involvement in the Ukraine saga as a 'potential witness.'
Trump has been accused of withholding military aid and an Oval Office meeting with the president of Ukraine to pressure the country's leaders into announcing investigations into the Biden family and a debunked theory about the 2016 election.
On Friday, House Democrats released new documents showing extensive contact between Lev Parnas, a former Giuliani associate, and an aide to Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, regarding the effort to obtain material from Ukrainian prosecutors. The text messages deepen questions about how much Nunes knew about the pressure campaign "" even as he served as one of Trump's most vociferous defenders during the House impeachment hearings. Nunes's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The trial is set to begin in earnest on Tuesday, though it is possible that Trump's lawyers won't speak at length until early the following week after the Democratic impeachment managers from the House present their case. Cipollone is expected to be the lead speaker for the team and to avoid the media, while Dershowitz and Starr may do television appearances throughout the trial, according to a White House official familiar with the planning who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations and planning.
Cipollone has negotiated trial strategy with Trump and Eric Ueland, the White House head of legislative affairs, according to the official. In one example, he argued against showing video footage during the trial, believing it would not be helpful to the president's case, the official said.
Trump is also expected to enlist several House members, including Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and John Ratcliffe (R-Tex.), to help advise the legal team, but they are unlikely to speak on the Senate floor, according to a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations and planning.
Trump wanted Dershowitz and Bondi, 54, on his team because he sees them as convincing and talented on television, said a White House official familiar with the selections who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations and planning.
Bondi, whom Trump has called a 'great woman,' helped the White House with its messaging during the impeachment proceedings. Previously, she represented a bevy of clients "" including General Motors, the government of Qatar and a Kuwaiti firm "" as a lobbyist. She stepped down as Florida attorney general in January.
Ray, 59, replaced Starr as independent counsel in October 1999 and oversaw the agreement with Clinton that averted a possible criminal trial. His final report on the Whitewater investigation stated that there was insufficient evidence to show that Bill or Hillary Clinton had committed any crimes related to the Arkansas land venture that was the subject of the case.
He resigned from the position in March 2002 before making a failed bid that year for the U.S. Senate from New Jersey as a Republican. Since then, according to his LinkedIn profile, Ray has served as a partner at six law firms, including a firm he joined this month, Zeichner Ellman - Krause.
Ray had given a number of television interviews about impeachment that were friendly to Trump before Friday's announcement.
'I think you can look for summary proceedings in the United States Senate "" without witnesses "" to resolve this, and I believe Mitch McConnell has the votes to do that,' he said on Fox Business Network this week.
Asked about the possibility of Trump's removal, Ray said: 'It's not going to happen.'

Ambassador to Germany, a loyal Trump confidant, takes post on acting basis
President Trump on Wednesday named Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany, as the next acting director of national intelligence, placing a fiercely loyal ally atop an intelligence structure he has frequently railed against. 
It is unclear whether Trump intends to nominate Grenell to fill the top intelligence post on a permanent basis, which would require Senate confirmation. 
The appointment took many in Washington, including on Capitol Hill, by surprise. 
Grenell, a former State Department official and communications executive, has been a Trump confidant and ad hoc adviser on issues beyond his ambassadorial work in Berlin.
He is a conservative foreign policy hawk and sometime media critic, as well as a vocal supporter of Trump on social media. He has sparked controversy in his diplomatic role, but also won praise in Germany and elsewhere for taking on issues such as gay rights in Eastern Europe and the long-running tensions between Kosovo and Serbia. 
Grenell would be the first openly gay member of the Trump Cabinet. He did not respond to a request for comment. 
Trump was being pushed by some in the intelligence community to nominate the current acting intelligence director, Joseph Maguire, to take the job permanently, but the president has been fixated on appointing people he believes are loyal to him, according to White House officials who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. 
In recent weeks, he has asked aides which employees are 'bad' or 'leakers' and deserve to be fired, aides said.
In a statement, Maguire said 'it has been an honor to work alongside the men and women of the intelligence community' as acting director of national intelligence, and that he was 'committed to leading [them] until Ambassador Grenell assumes the role.'
Maguire, who was scheduled to meet with White House officials Thursday afternoon, was blindsided by the news, said a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive situation.

The New York Times first reported Grenell's expected appointment. 
Grenell's loyalty to the president extends beyond his public statements. In 2018, internal documents from the Trump International Hotel in Washington listed Grenell as a 'Gold' level member of the Trump Organization's 'Trump Card' loyalty program. 
This is the second time that Trump has given a prominent post to a high-level Trump Card member. Kelly Craft, Trump's ambassador to the United Nations, also had gold status, according to the 2018 documents "" 'VIP Arrivals' lists that the hotel used to alert employees to important guests. The lists were obtained by The Washington Post.
Grenell's appointment is likely to exacerbate tensions between the president and members of the intelligence community, who have been frequent targets of Trump's ire. 
Current and former officials questioned Grenell's qualifications to lead the intelligence agencies and said his loyalty to Trump appeared to be the reason for his appointment. 
'Nothing in Grenell's background suggests that he has the skill set or the experience to be an effective leader of the intelligence community,' said Nicholas J. Rasmussen, who was the director of the National Counterterrorism Center under Trump and President Barack Obama and who has known and worked with Maguire for over a decade. 
'His chief attribute seems to be that President Trump views him as unfailingly loyal "" hardly sufficient to make someone qualified to perform the duties of the DNI.' 
Marc Polymeropoulos, a former senior CIA official, questioned why the White House had again chosen not to nominate a permanent intelligence director. 
'How are both sides of the aisle not outraged by yet another 'acting' role?' he said. 'We are in need of the DNI designate to provide his thoughts on the whistleblower statute, the intelligence community plan to thwart potential Russian interference in the 2020 elections, possible Iranian retaliation for the Qasem Soleimani strike and other key national security challenges.'
Grenell inspired controversy almost from the moment he became ambassador in 2018. In a tweet he posted hours after Trump said the United States would exit the Iran nuclear deal, Grenell wrote that 'German companies doing business in Iran should wind down operations immediately.' 
Germany and other key U.S. allies said they intended to remain in the agreement and the perceived ultimatum angered some officials in Berlin. Grenell has also focused on NATO and the shortfall in German defense spending, an issue Trump mentions frequently.
Grenell also drew criticism from diplomats and foreign officials for an interview with the right-wing Breitbart news site, in which he said he wanted to 'empower' conservatives in Europe.

One U.S. official familiar with the decision said Grenell is expected to take up his new post quickly.

Some security experts wary of tactic, pointing to stakes of Iran conflict
Days after President Trump ordered a drone strike that killed a top Iranian general, the commander in chief's 2020 campaign turned the attack into a political pitch, purchasing roughly 1,000 ads on Facebook that touted his military credentials "" and sought to raise money for his reelection push.
The online advertising blitz began late Monday as Trump's team sought to defend the killing of Qasem Soleimani, a major general in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Many of the ads solicited personal information from voters that could be useful as the campaign seeks to mobilize voters on Election Day.
The digital strategy mirrors Trump's previous social media campaigns concerning impeachment, immigration and other signature issues, relying on a mix of narrowly targeted messages "" along with headline-grabbing tweets seen by millions "" to command the political conversation, mobilize his base and advance his policy agenda with an eye to the election. Trump's campaign also alerted supporters with a series of similar text messages highlighting Soleimani's death.
'From a campaign perspective, any time the president accomplishes something "" and fighting terrorism is among his biggest campaign promises, keeping our country safe "" that is grounds for making the argument that he should be reelected,' said Matt Braynard, the data director for Trump's 2016 campaign, who says he is not involved in the president's reelection effort.
But some experts bristled at Trump's tactics in the context of national security, stressing that the stakes are higher than usual: Every ad, tweet and social media statement from Trump carries significant weight in a rapidly developing conflict, they said.
'Growing campaign email lists based on fear and online fundraising for political gain should hardly be a priority of the commander in chief during a national security crisis,' said Graham Brookie, the leader of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, which studies disinformation. He previously served in the Obama administration.
A spokesman for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
Democrats and Republicans long have sparred over efforts to advertise their military accomplishments in the course of a major election. In 2012, GOP lawmakers and candidates blasted President Barack Obama for running television spots touting his order to kill Osama bin Laden, which critics said were unseemly.
But Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites have become even more pervasive and powerful in the years since Obama left office, an evolution heralded by the successful digital strategy that catapulted Trump to the White House in 2016.
Tweets helped Trump push his political views to millions instantly, and Facebook ads allowed the president's team to target narrow slices of voters with specific messages that would most outrage, engage or persuade them. Both have been put to great use again by the president's campaign in the days after he ordered the attack on Soleimani, dismaying Democrats, some of whom long have called on tech giants to place limits on Trump, one of the most prolific but controversial social media users in U.S. politics.
Beginning this week, Trump's team has run scores of Facebook ads highlighting Soleimani's death, many pitching an 'Official Military Survey' that asks supporters a series of questions, including whether they agree with the president's 'decision to take out the very dangerous Iranian terrorist leader.'
Those who fill it out are asked to submit their personal information, including their emails and phone numbers "" a standard practice for candidates like Trump, whose campaign has spent $27-million on Facebook ads since May 2018 in part to build lists of supporters, the company's archive shows. After clicking a button to submit responses, participants also are asked for donations ranging up to the maximum of $2,800 per election.
Trump's campaign and his Republican allies also have sent a series of texts in recent days highlighting the Soleimani killing. 'Pres Trump made our Military STRONG again!' began one message from the Republican National Committee, according to Nomorobo, an app that helps smartphone users block robocalls and texts. The texts link to the Trump campaign's data collection survey.
Another batch of texts "" sent Wednesday after Trump spoke about Iran "" included a 'presidential address approval poll,' which asks viewers to rate if he was 'historic,' 'great,' 'good' or 'other.'
'A huge piece of Trump's message and platform from day one is about presenting himself as a strong, machismo leader to his base,' said Tara McGowan, who leads the progressive-leaning digital group Acronym, which estimated that Trump has run roughly 1,000 ads so far.
'It is clear from the amount of messaging and resources the Trump campaign is putting behind this messaging that he sees this as an advantage for his campaign for reelection,' McGowan said, decrying what she called the president's 'politicizing this military event.'
To be sure, Trump's Facebook ads do not appear to violate the platform's policies. Dozens of Trump's ads have been removed from Facebook, according to the company's public archive, but only because they broke the company's technical rules for how ads with buttons should be formatted.
At least one of Trump's 2020 Democratic rivals, former vice president Joe Biden, has run ads of his own this week touting his experience on the world stage and questioning Trump's fitness as commander in chief.
Other 2020 Democratic contenders have ratcheted up their criticisms of Trump on the campaign trail. Speaking to reporters following a town hall in Iowa on Sunday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) questioned the timing of the strike, noting that it unfolded 'as Donald Trump faces a potential impeachment trial in the United States Senate next week.'
Andrew Yang, the entrepreneur and former tech executive who has made prolific use of the Internet to power his outsider bid for the Democratic nomination, said matters of war were a bridge too far for quick advertising tactics.
'You hope that our government is making decisions based upon national security concerns and what's best for the country,' he said in an interview, 'and not using that as an opportunity to gather voter data.'

He has long attacked the intelligence agencies and foreign partners he now needs
Presidents on the brink of war tend to rely on an array of Oval Office assets: teams of experienced advisers, trusted sources of intelligence, strong ties with U.S. allies and credibility with the broad American public.
For President Trump those assets may be in short supply as he faces the prospect of an escalating conflict with Iran. 
Trump's decision to approve an airstrike that killed Qasem Soleimani, the leader of Iran's paramilitary Quds Force, came at a moment in his presidency when his national security team has been depleted by waves of departures and distracted by months of impeachment hearings before Congress.
But even before the Ukraine crisis, Trump had spent much of his first three years in office attacking critical capabilities ordinarily cultivated by commanders in chief: He has disparaged U.S. intelligence agencies, disrupted relationships with European partners and diluted the power of the bully pulpit with thousands of falsehoods.
In many ways, Trump's approach to the presidency adds to the uncertainty of an increasingly volatile situation in the Middle East, with the administration deploying thousands of additional troops to the region even as Iran vows to take revenge with attacks on unspecified American targets.

Former U.S. national security officials described the situation as worrisome in part because of Iran's capabilities but also because of Trump's tendency to ignore advisers and favor instinct over hard information.
'That's going to be a problem going forward if this situation deteriorates,' said John McLaughlin, a former deputy director of the CIA. Trump and members of his Cabinet with critical roles in a potential conflict with Iran have two defining qualities, McLaughlin said: 'low credibility and limited experience.'
So far, Trump appears to be leaning heavily on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for guidance on the decision to target Soleimani and the strike's aftermath, as well as making the public case that the operation was warranted.
Pompeo is the longest-standing member of Trump's inner circle, having served as CIA director before moving to the State Department. He is also regarded as a credible voice among conservatives, including in foreign policy circles otherwise skeptical of Trump.
Even so, the administration's initial statements about the airstrike "" including those made by Pompeo in a string of television appearances and calls to foreign counterparts "" have at times been contradictory and greeted with skepticism.
In a television interview Friday, Pompeo repeatedly emphasized that the decision to target Soleimani was driven by U.S. intelligence assessments warning of 'imminent' danger to American lives overseas. 
Members of Congress emerged from private briefings with U.S. intelligence officials on Friday saying they heard nothing to suggest that the threat posed by the paramilitary forces led or guided by Soleimani had changed substantially in recent months.
More broadly, Pompeo asserted that 'the world is a safer place today,' even as Americans were urged to evacuate from Iraq, and that the strike had decreased the chance of conflict with Iran, even as thousands of additional American troops were reportedly being rushed to the Middle East.
Pompeo's elevated standing in the Cabinet is in part a reflection of the stream of departures from the administration's upper ranks. Former defense secretary Jim Mattis, who served as a Marine general in Iraq and Afghanistan, resigned a year ago. Trump has also gone through three national security advisers, including retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, retired Army Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster and John Bolton.
The current national security adviser, Robert C. O'Brien, stepped into the job in late September as the impeachment investigation was accelerating in the House. He is a lawyer who served in the U.S. Army Reserve with little known expertise on Iran or the Middle East.
Turmoil within the National Security Council has further eroded critical areas of expertise, including counterterrorism, officials said.
U.S. officials fear that Iran may seek to retaliate for Soleimani's death by using its networks of paramilitary proxies in Iraq and Syria, or its links to terrorist groups including Hezbollah. If so, coordinating the counterterrorism efforts of the CIA, FBI and other agencies could prove critical to safeguarding potential American targets.
But the top counterterrorism official at the NSC was installed in the job late last year and has less experience than many of his predecessors. Kash Patel, a former aide to Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), also has a strained relationship with the CIA and FBI, current and former officials said, in part because of his involvement in efforts by Trump and his allies to discredit those agencies and accuse them of seeking to undermine the president.
Trump has spent much of his presidency attacking U.S. spy agencies, rejecting their conclusions on critical national security issues ranging from Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election to the complicity of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
And yet Trump and other officials have pinned the decision to target Soleimani on intelligence from the same agencies the president so frequently disparages. 'The risk of doing nothing was enormous,' Pompeo said Friday on CNN. 'Intelligence community made that assessment and President Trump acted decisively last night.'
In explaining his reluctance to trust U.S. spy agencies, Trump has often pointed to the erroneous assessments they made 17 years ago that Iraq had stockpiles of banned weapons "" judgments cited by President George W. Bush as a rationale for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.
Those faulty prewar claims have had a lasting impact on American credibility in the Middle East and beyond. Trump's penchant for making false or exaggerated claims "" something he has done more than 15,000 times while in office, according to a tally by The Washington Post "" has probably compounded that credibility gap.
McLaughlin recalled a famous episode in the Cold War when President John F. Kennedy dispatched Dean Acheson, a former secretary of state, to Paris to brief French President Charles de Gaulle on the U.S. discovery of Soviet attempts to install missiles in Cuba.
Acheson brought satellite images to show de Gaulle, but the French president "" reportedly miffed that he was merely being 'informed' about the development rather than 'consulted' on any U.S. response "" waved the photos away, saying that the word of the president was sufficient.
'That's not going to happen with Trump,' McLaughlin said.

Concern high after activists rush the stage at Super Tuesday rally
Joe Biden's presidential campaign on Wednesday began privately deliberating whether to formally request Secret Service protection for the candidate, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, a day after protesters rushed the stage at his event in Los Angeles in what experts called a major security breach.
Both Biden and fellow candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) rely on private security firms to handle their public appearances, which is unusual this late in a presidential campaign cycle in comparison with 2016, 2012 and 2008. But their emergence over the past week as the clear front-runners in the Democratic primaries has prompted calls for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the U.S. Secret Service, to authorize full-time protection for both of them.
""Taking into consideration the remaining candidates' large campaign operations, high polling averages, as well as physical threats to their safety . . . I urge you to immediately initiate the consultation process to determine whether to provide USSS protection"" to Biden and Sanders, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss), the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, wrote in a letter Wednesday to acting DHS secretary Chad Wolf.
Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.), a member of the Homeland Security Committee and co-chair of Biden's campaign, told reporters that Democratic lawmakers were ""worried about"" security for the Democrats on the campaign trail even before the incident at Biden's speech on Super Tuesday.
The Biden campaign has begun deliberating over whether to move forward with a formal request to the Secret Service, according to the person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to comment freely about a sensitive security matter. The Sanders campaign did not immediately respond to questions on the subject. The DHS also did not respond to a request for comment.
The onstage skirmish during the former vice president's remarks in Los Angeles highlighted the potential risks for candidates addressing large crowds. A pair of vegan activists holding signs reading ""Let Dairy Die"" rushed the stage before being physically pushed and pulled away by bystanders including Biden's wife, Jill, and a campaign aide in a video that has circulated widely online.
The incident was a ""massive security failure,"" said Jonathan Wackrow, a risk-management consultant at Teneo who served as a Secret Service agent in the agency's Presidential Protective Division. ""These were environmental activists. Anyone aligning with a specific ideology is potentially dangerous. I think both Bernie and Biden would want it at this point.""
The question over which presidential candidates deserve taxpayer-funded Secret Service protection, and when such protection should begin, can be a tricky calculation - for federal officials and the candidates themselves. Under federal guidelines, a candidate must meet minimum standards that include being a ""major"" candidate in his or her party - generally defined as a someone who is regularly appearing at rallies, conducting a national campaign and receiving at least 15 percent support in established polls. Biden and Sanders both meet such requirements.
Campaigns must request protection from the DHS, and a bipartisan congressional advisory committee - led by the Senate majority leader, currently Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) - helps review the request before the DHS secretary makes a decision.
Outsourcing security to the federal government can be a boon for cash-strapped campaigns and also bestow a heightened legitimacy on candidates. But some candidates in past presidential campaign cycles have tried to hold off over concerns that a large security entourage could hamper their ability to interact more directly with supporters.
Both Biden, during his eight years as vice president, and Sanders, during his 2016 contest against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, have received Secret Service protection in the past.
""Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden need secret service protection,"" Robert Gibbs, a White House press secretary under President Barack Obama, said on MSNBC on Tuesday. Of the skirmish at Biden's event, he added: ""What happened tonight was nothing short of genuinely scary. . . . They should have Secret Service protection in the next 24 to 48 hours.""
Obama received Secret Service protection earlier than any other candidate - in May 2007, nearly a year and a half before the 2008 election. The congressional advisory committee at the time warned that the first viable African American candidate for the White House faced an unusually high security risk. (Hillary Clinton, who also was running for the Democratic nomination at the time, already received Secret Service protection in her capacity as a former first lady.)
In 2012, the eventual Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, got protection in February of that year, while Donald Trump and Ben Carson, running for the GOP nomination in the 2016 cycle, began receiving Secret Service coverage in November 2015.
In 2016, Trump and Clinton had instances at their campaign events in which Secret Service agents jumped onstage to surround them over concerns about protesters.
As president, Trump receives round-the-clock protection. Former presidents continue to have smaller Secret Service details - but Biden no longer is granted such protections as a former vice president.
Wackrow, the former agent, has not seen intelligence reports about the 2020 candidates. But he suggested Biden's threat profile might be magnified because of President Trump's unfounded allegations that the former vice president had acted improperly when his son Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.
That accusation led Trump last summer to privately pressure Ukraine's president to open an investigation into the Bidens, a demand that ultimately led House Democrats to impeach Trump. The president has berated the Bidens in public remarks and called on China to open an investigation into Hunter Biden's business activities in that country.
""They've now made him a target,"" Wackrow said. ""It's all rhetoric, but rhetoric can transcend to physical harm.""

MIAMI "" President Trump's reelection campaign on Friday launched a new coalition to court evangelicals at a Latino megachurch in Miami, part of an effort to shore up support among Latino evangelicals whose backing for the president has so far lagged behind that of their white counterparts.
In a 75-minute rally-style address "" but with more religious overtones "" Trump touted his record on social issues and noted that the evangelical vote helped power his improbable victory in 2016, proclaiming: 'We're gonna blow those numbers away in 2020.'
'Evangelicals . . . have never had a greater champion, not even close in the White House, than you have right now,' Trump told a racially diverse crowd of thousands at El Rey Jesús in Miami. 'Just look at the record, because we've done things that nobody thought was possible.'
Trump is counting on equal or stronger support from evangelicals during his reelection bid, and he garnered some of the loudest applause of the event when he promised to deliver more from the community's agenda, announcing that he'll 'very soon' move to 'safeguard students' and teachers' First Amendment rights to pray in our schools.' 
And he drew boisterous applause again when he denounced socialism "" a line of attack he has used against the field of Democratic candidates vying to take him on in November's election.
'America was not built by religion-hating socialists,' Trump said. 'America was built by churchgoing, God-worshiping, freedom-loving patriots.'
He began the event by defending his decision to greenlight the killing of Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, one of Iran's top military figures, in Baghdad early Friday but spent the rest of his time on remarks tailored to the evangelical audience seated before him.
The president appeared at the Miami megachurch led by Guillermo Maldonado, one of the most prominent Hispanic evangelical leaders in the nation, who has been a key ally and adviser to Trump. 
But the decision to appear at a church attended by thousands of Latinos also underscored a tense subject for Trump with the community: the hard-line immigration policies that have been a hallmark for Trump since the first day of his 2016 presidential campaign. 
That was highlighted by assurances Maldonado gave his congregation earlier this week that members did not have to be U.S. citizens to attend the event, which was held about 90 miles south of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., where the president has been staying since Dec. 20.
'It's certainly a good opportunity for the president,' said former congressman Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.), who until 2019 represented the district where the church is located. But the appearance, he added, is 'not without risk, because I don't think the president's immigration policies are very popular among the congregation.' 
Yet Trump's references Friday to immigration "" his boasting about the border wall and criticisms of 'loopholes' in U.S. immigration law "" drew a loud ovation from the crowd.
The Trump campaign called El Rey Jesús, also known as King Jesus International Ministry, a 'natural fit' as the launch spot for the new coalition, Evangelicals for Trump. Maldonado's backing of the president reflects the 'great and overwhelming support President Trump has among the evangelical community at large,' campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said. 
Maldonado declined an interview request made through the church. But he offered reassurances to immigrants during Sunday's services, according to the Miami Herald. 
'I ask you: Do you think I would do something where I would endanger my people?' Maldonado said. 'I'm not that dumb.'
Gabriel Salguero, president of the National Latino Evangelical Coalition, said Latino evangelicals have been put off by Trump's remarks about people of Mexican descent, his repeal of an Obama-era program that granted work permits to undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children, and the name-calling of his political opponents. 
However, he said, they have appreciated his efforts on criminal justice reform and on antiabortion policies. 
'The nation is waking up to the reality that Latino evangelicals are an independent voting bloc,' Salguero said. 'They have their own spokespersons, their own leaders. As people have been drilling down deeper into evangelicalism, they recognize they're not a monolith.'
Latino evangelicals say Maldonado is one of the most respected Hispanic leaders in the country. He is a Honduran immigrant with a bilingual ministry, a show on Trinity Broadcasting Network and 2.7 million followers on Facebook.
Maldonado is considered part of the prosperity gospel, a movement within some churches that teach that God blesses followers with health and material wealth. The prosperity gospel, generally considered to be on the fringes of U.S. Christianity, has grown globally and received attention under Trump because several of his faith advisers are part of the movement.
Samuel Rodriguez, a nationally known Hispanic evangelical leader who is part of a core dozen evangelical leaders who have been advising the administration, called Trump's decision to show up at Maldonado's church 'politically brilliant' because it could shore up support from a Latino slice of evangelicals in a key swing state. 
Curbelo also said many congregants at King Jesus International are non-Cuban Hispanics, who tend to be less aligned to the GOP and are more likely to be swing voters, allowing Trump to simultaneously reach evangelicals "" a core part of his base "" and persuadable voters. 
'You have to choose whether to go for your base voters or your swing voters,' said Curbelo, a critic of Trump during his time in Congress. 'In that congregation [on Friday], you'll have a lot of people who fit into both categories.' 
The event Friday afternoon was designed to be a show of force of evangelical support that comes on the heels of a scathing editorial from a major Christian publication calling for Trump's ouster after he was impeached by the House last month. Nearly 40 influential evangelical leaders from across the nation planned to attend the launch, according to the campaign. 
The opinion piece, from Christianity Today, argued that Trump has a 'grossly immoral character' and harshly criticized his attempts to pressure Ukraine to investigate a political rival "" actions that made him just the third impeached U.S. president in history. 
It also provoked a furious response from Trump, who took to Twitter to inaccurately criticize Christianity Today as a 'far left magazine' and to tout his record on issues important to evangelical voters. It's that policy record "" opposing abortion, nominating conservative jurists and moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem "" that has attracted many evangelicals to Trump. 


The Pew Research Center's 2018 national survey of Latinos found that 36 percent of Hispanic evangelical Christians approved of Trump's job performance in summer and early fall of that year "" a figure that was just about half the level of approval Pew has found among white evangelical Protestants, which was 69 percent in early 2019 and similar in more recent polling. The 2018 Pew survey on Latinos found that 55 percent of Hispanic evangelical Christians disapproved of Trump. 
An NPR-PBS NewsHour-Marist poll from early December found that 75 percent of white evangelical Christians approved of Trump, compared with 42 percent of U.S. adults overall.
Even though they share similar beliefs about Jesus and about the Bible, white evangelical attitudes diverge from those of Latino evangelicals on many policy issues, including immigration reform, climate change, health care and taxing the wealthy, said Janelle Wong, a professor of American studies at the University of Maryland. 
A statement published on the church's website says Maldonado is participating in the evangelical coalition in his personal capacity and that King Jesus International Ministry does not endorse any political candidates. The Trump campaign is picking up the tab for the use of the church, which is receiving 'fair compensation' in exchange, according to the statement. 
The Trump campaign expects Evangelicals for Trump to grow ahead of the Nov. 3 election, and it also plans to continue outreach to Hispanic and black voters through its other coalitions: Latinos for Trump and Black Voices for Trump.
Campaign officials have said that even a small surge in support among black or Latino voters could help make the difference for Trump in key swing states, including Florida.

'Promises and principles, those two words come to mind,' said Jack Graham, the pastor of Prestonwood Baptist Church in Plano, Tex., who is also a part of the campaign coalition.

Coordinated attacks come as Democratic rival blasts handling of Iran
President Trump and his campaign have launched their most sustained attacks yet on Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, highlighting the Vermont senator's rising poll numbers and sharp criticism of the White House's handling of tensions with Iran.
In a coordinated string of press statements, Twitter posts and televised digs over the past week, Trump and his allies have trained their sights on Sanders, seeking to tarnish his foreign policy credentials and commander in chief appeal. The attacks represent a shift for Trump, who had previously devoted more of his energy to criticizing former vice president Joe Biden. 
Trump's allies say the president drives the campaign's political strategy, acknowledging that he is an avid consumer of the public polling and the cable-TV punditry that has documented Sanders's growing strength in the Democratic presidential primary. 
Trump mentioned Sanders by name 10 times during his rally last week in Ohio "" more than any other candidate. He continued the attacks on Twitter over the weekend and on Monday, singling Sanders out for more direct criticism than other Democratic contenders.
'Wow! Crazy Bernie Sanders is surging in the polls, looking very good against his opponents in the Do Nothing Party,' Trump wrote Sunday on Twitter. 'So what does this all mean? Stay tuned!'
Sanders, who has pilloried Trump for authorizing the drone strike that killed Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, had a curt response: 'It means you're going to lose.'
Trump's campaign has released three statements in the last week specifically attacking Sanders on foreign policy, a significant escalation that has been mirrored by top Twitter accounts managed by campaign aides.
On Monday, the campaign accused Sanders of defending 'the world's top terrorist' and 'pushing a naive, dangerous policy of appeasement toward Iran.' Other aides attacked Sanders on issues ranging from student loans to human rights.
Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, said the focus on Sanders is not a sign of fear of the Vermont senator or any other candidate, arguing that 'Trump would beat any of them handily.'
'Over the last year, the campaign has engaged various Democrats when the opportunities have presented themselves,' Murtaugh said. 'In Sanders's case, his surge in the polls coincided with his emergence as the chief apologist for the Iranian regime. We needed to point out that he would be dangerous as president since he made clear he would appease terrorists and terror-sponsoring nations.'
Sanders, who has been staunchly opposed to America's entanglements in the Middle East, has used the conflict with Iran to draw a contrast both with Trump and with his Democratic rivals. He has accused Trump of abandoning his 2016 pledge to extract the U.S. from costly wars and has made a direct appeal to Trump voters who are disillusioned by the president's performance in office. 
'Bernie, who has spent his entire life standing with the working class, is going to spend every moment of the general election reminding working Americans that Trump was lying when he said he would stand with them and that he would end the endless wars,' said Mike Casca, the Sanders campaign communications director. 'He's the most corrupt president in American history, and Bernie Sanders is going to sweep him out of the White House.'
Earlier this month, Sanders introduced legislation to block funding for military conflict with Iran, something he said would be 'disastrous.'
'At a time when we face the urgent need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, to build the housing we desperately need, and to address the existential crisis of climate change, we as a nation, must get our priorities right,' he said in a joint statement with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.).
Sanders has seen his poll numbers rise and his fundraising improve as he has campaigned on bringing about a 'revolution' capable of ousting Trump from office. A poll released Friday by the Des Moines Register and CNN showed Sanders narrowly leading a close race in Iowa just three weeks before the Feb. 3 caucuses there. The survey is the first to have Sanders leading in the state, and it showed that he enjoys support from 20 percent of likely voters.
Sanders raised $34.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, a massive sum fueled by his online fundraising machine that bested all Democratic contenders. 
Some Trump allies have described Sanders's fundraising as an impressive sign of his potential staying power in the Democratic primary. 
And while most of the Trump campaign's recent attacks on Sanders have focused on foreign policy, the president's surrogates have ramped up their critiques of his domestic agenda as well. Aides said they expect the onslaught against Sanders to continue and intensify, as Trump uses the liberal senator as a stand-in for the entire field of Democrats. 
Trump is scheduled to hold a rally today in Wisconsin, a state where Sanders has said his appeal to working-class voters could put him in a strong position to defeat Trump. Last year, Sanders embarked on a 'Bernie Beats Trump' tour to highlight his strength against the president in key states.
'FACT: Bernie Sanders Is A Wealthy, Fossil Fuel-Guzzling Millionaire,' read one statement from the Trump campaign on Thursday, a day after the campaign released a statement saying he 'Can't Be Trusted To Defend American Lives.'
Sanders has cast doubt on the Trump administration's shifting explanations for the strike that killed Soleimani, accusing the president of concocting a reason to conduct an 'assassination' of a foreign official.
'The difficulty that we have, and I don't mean to be rude here, is we have a president that's a pathological liar,' he said Friday on NBC's TODAY show. 
Trump's campaign has responded by trying to brand the senator as soft on terrorism, a scorched-earth tactic that has come to define the strategy of the president's reelection bid. 
'How many American children have to be left fatherless before Bernie Sanders will defend American lives?' Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted Sunday.
Some of Trump's advisers say they are spoiling for a general election fight with Sanders, describing him as a 'socialist' who turns off moderate voters. 
'I'd rather face Bernie versus Biden,' said Bryan Lanza, who advised Trump's 2016 campaign and transition. 'Let's have the real contrast of who these parties are. Let's have the real debate.'
Trump appeared to egg on a battle between Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Monday, tweeting that the two liberals are fighting over voters. He also turned his fire on former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who has been running ads targeting Trump on health care and other issues. 
'Bernie Sander's volunteers are trashing Elizabeth 'Pocahontus' Warren. Everybody knows her campaign is dead and want her potential voters,' he wrote, misspelling the slur he regularly uses against Warren. 'Mini Mike B is also trying, but getting tiny crowds which are all leaving fast. Elizabeth is very angry at Bernie. Do I see a feud brewing?'

President Trump's company charges the Secret Service for the rooms agents use while protecting him at his luxury properties "" billing U.S. taxpayers at rates as high as $650 per night, according to federal records and people who have seen receipts.
Those charges, compiled here for the first time, show that Trump has an unprecedented "" and largely hidden "" business relationship with his own government. When Trump visits his clubs in Palm Beach, Fla., and Bedminster, N.J., the service needs space to post guards and store equipment.
Trump's company says it charges only minimal fees. But Secret Service records do not show that.
At Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club, the Secret Service was charged the $650 rate dozens of times in 2017, and a different rate, $396.15, dozens more times in 2018, according to documents from Trump's visits. 

And at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster, the Secret Service was charged $17,000 a month to use a three-bedroom cottage on the property, an unusually high rent for homes in that area, according to receipts from 2017. Trump's company billed the government even for days when Trump wasn't there.
These payments appear to contradict the Trump Organization's own statements about what it charges members of his government entourage. 'If my father travels, they stay at our properties for free "" meaning, like, cost for housekeeping,' Trump's son Eric said in a Yahoo Finance interview last year.

The full extent of the Secret Service's payments to Trump's company is not known. The Secret Service has not listed them in public databases of federal spending, as is usually required for payments over $10,000. 
Instead, documents have come out piecemeal, through public records requests from news organizations and watchdog groups. The Washington Post compiled available records and found 103 payments from the Secret Service to Trump's company dated between January 2017 and April 2018. 
The records show more than $471,000 in payments from taxpayers to Trump's companies. But "" because these records cover only a fraction of Trump's travel during a fraction of his term "" the actual total is likely to be higher.
'It is more than a little disconcerting, knowing this is going on, and not knowing what the actual numbers are,' said Jordan Libowitz, of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. 'That's kind of crazy that we know the president is benefiting from the presidency, and we do not know how. We do not know how many taxpayer dollars are in his pocket.'
The White House did not respond to questions about Trump's knowledge of these payments. 
In a statement, the Secret Service said that its spending 'balances operational security with judicious allocation of resources.' By law, Secret Service agents are exempt from the government's usual per diem spending limits while they are protecting the president. The Secret Service did not respond to a question about why the purchases weren't listed in public databases.
Trump still owns his company. In response to questions from The Post, a company spokesperson said Mar-a-Lago does not charge the Secret Service $650 per room but did not address whether it had charged that rate in the past. The company also noted that the rental cottage at Bedminster contains 'multiple rooms and [includes] numerous common spaces.'
The company did not answer questions about the rates it charges the Secret Service now. 
'We provide the rooms at cost and could make far more money renting them to members or guests,' Trump Organization Executive Vice President Eric Trump said in a statement. He gave no details about how the company calculates the 'at-cost' price.




During the 2016 campaign, Trump told voters that "" if he was elected "" he would not have time for travel. 
'I would rarely leave the White House because there's so much work to be done,' Trump told the Hill in a June 2015 interview. 'I would not be a president who took vacations. I would not be a president that takes time off.' 
But since taking office, Trump has spent more than 342 days "" a third of his entire presidency "" at his private clubs and hotels, according to a tally by The Post. Trump has said he works during these trips.
The Secret Service always comes with him, as it does with all presidents. But the Trump Organization has assured the public that it is giving the government a great deal. Last year, Eric Trump told Yahoo Finance that when his father does visit his properties, he is legally required to charge something.
 Eric Trump did not say what law required Trump to charge his own government, and the Secret Service did not respond to questions asking what law he was referring to. The Secret Service is part of the Department of Homeland Security, whose internal directives state, 'DHS may accept gifts to carry out program functions.'
'If he stays at one of his places, the government actually . . . saves a fortune because, if they were to go to a hotel across the street, they'd be charging them $500 a night, whereas, you know we charge them, like 50 bucks,' Eric Trump said. 
That appears to be wrong. 
The Secret Service is required to tell Congress twice a year about what it spends to protect Trump at his properties. 
But since 2016, it has only filed two of the required six reports, according to congressional offices. The reasons, according to Secret Service officials: key personnel left and nobody picked up the job. 
Even in those two reports, the lines for Bedminster and Mar-a-Lago were blank. 
The Secret Service officials said only that they abide by the law, but they did not elaborate. They are probably referring to a provision that requires them to tell Congress about 'permanent' costs. They may not consider anything they've done at either club permanent.
Senate Democrats have asked the Trump administration to provide more details on the costs of Trump's travel as part of negotiations over a bill governing the Secret Service. But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has told the Senate committee that he opposes a requirement to deliver those details until December 2020 at the earliest, which falls after the election.
'They've really stonewalled us,' said Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.). 'He's trying to hide the details from the public, because he knows how bad it looks. That's the truth of it. He's a billionaire, but we're spending millions of dollars to support his for-profit clubs and for-profit businesses.'

The Post sought to quantify one part of that spending "" the money that goes directly to Trump's own businesses.
Most of the 103 payments discovered by The Post went to just three Trump properties: the Trump International Hotel in Washington and the president's clubs at Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster. 
They showed that Trump had quickly shattered past precedent. Other recent presidents have allowed the Secret Service to use their properties "" George H.W. Bush's compound in Maine, Bill Clinton's home in suburban New York, George W. Bush's ranch in Texas "" free, according to the Secret Service and spokespeople for those former presidents.
The Post could find only one other recent example of a president or vice president charging his own Secret Service rent. Former vice president Joe Biden charged $2,200 a month for a cottage on his property in Delaware. Unlike the payments to Trump, Biden's payments were listed in public spending databases. Biden was paid a total of $171,600 over six years.
Trump exceeded that total within three months, records show.
In February 2017, for instance, Trump made his first presidential trip to Mar-a-Lago "" a for-profit club with guest rooms and suites available to members. The Secret Service sent dozens of people. Most of them stayed at other hotels nearby.
But they also rented at least three rooms at Mar-a-Lago, records show.
The rate: $650 per night, according to two people who saw receipts. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter.
That was more than triple the normal limit on federal spending for a hotel room in that area, which was $182. It was even more than what the State Department paid for rooms at Mar-a-Lago around the same time, which was $520 to $546. 
'The operational needs of the Secret Service can differ from those in the Department of State,' a Secret Service spokeswoman said, to explain why their rooms had cost more than the State Department's.
Presidents are exempt from federal conflict-of-interest rules. And the Secret Service is exempt from hotel-room spending limits.
So Trump's company was free to charge what it wanted.

And, according to one former senior administration official with direct knowledge of the operation, his club often treated the Secret Service like any other customer. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve relationships with the Trump administration.
'The club wanted to charge the rack rate,' the former official said, saying that sometimes officials had to call Eric Trump to lobby for a lower rate. 'The club managers were not always that accommodating.' 
In 2018, the room rate charged to the Secret Service was lower: $396.15 per night, according to public records obtained by the watchdog group Judicial Watch. One possible reason for the drop in price: The 2018 receipts list the Secret Service as an 'honorary member' of the club, which could have made it eligible for a member discount.
But in 2018, receipts show, the Secret Service tended to book more rooms and stay longer than they had in 2017 "" in one case, when Trump came for two weekends in a row, the Secret Service rented four rooms for nine nights apiece. They stayed all week, even while Trump was gone.
In Bedminster, records show, the Secret Service went further: It paid not by the day "" but for a whole month at a time. The Secret Service rented the club's 'Sarazen Cottage,' a three-bedroom building near Trump's own villa, from July 1 to Oct. 1, 2017.
The former senior administration official said the cottage was needed to store equipment and provided living space for five or six agents. So "" even though Trump was only there about a third of the time "" the equipment was there every day. So they paid every day.
'You can't rent the villa part of the year to someone else because it has to stay a Secret Service space,' said the official.

The Trump club does not publish data on the normal rates for these cottages "" even to its own members. They are told to contact management for a quote, according to member brochures obtained by The Post.
But the rate of $17,000 per month seems unusually high for a monthly rental. Since fall 2017, there have been 100 rental listings for homes with three or more bedrooms in Bedminster, according to the website Zillow.com. None were anywhere near Trump's rate; the average rental rate was $3,400, and the highest rent listed on Zillow was $8,500. Trump charged twice that.
It is unclear whether the monthly payments to Trump's company began earlier or continued after the date of the last record. Documents obtained by Property of the People "" a watchdog group set up to seek documents on Trump's administration "" also appear to show the $17,000 per month rate being paid in May 2017. 
And former housekeepers from the Bedminster club have said that the Secret Service continued to use the cottage long after these records end, through 2018. 
Another visitor to the club "" who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve access to the club "" reported seeing Secret Service agents in the cottage as recently as December. 
The Secret Service did not answer questions about whether it was still paying. 
The many gaps in the Secret Service data leave many unanswered questions.
Among them: Why were these payments to Trump's clubs not listed in public databases of federal spending, such as usaspending.gov? The Secret Service has publicly listed many other transactions related to Trump's stays at his clubs "" rentals of golf carts, tents and portable toilets. 
But it has not listed any of these payments to Trump's own businesses. 
'It is a surprise' that these payments are not listed, said Sean Moulton of the watchdog group Project on Government Oversight. Without public data about payments to Trump, he said, 'the public doesn't even know the questions they should be asking.'
Also: Why did the Secret Service spend so much at Trump's D.C. hotel, a place where "" unlike Bedminster and Mar-a-Lago "" Trump has not stayed overnight since taking office? In response to records request from NBC News, the Department of Homeland Security released a listing of 39 payments there during Trump's first year, totaling $159,000. 
The documents do not give the reasons for those payments "" or give the rate that Trump's company charged.

On Twitter, Trump hints at pardon for ally; judge issues a veiled rebuke
A federal judge on Thursday sentenced Roger Stone, President Trump's longtime friend and political adviser, to serve three years and four months in prison for impeding a congressional investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The penalty from U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson comes after weeks of infighting over the politically charged case that threw the Justice Department into crisis, and it is likely not to be the final word. Even before the sentencing hearing began, Trump seemed to suggest on Twitter that he might pardon Stone. With the proceedings ongoing, Trump questioned whether his ally was being treated fairly. Afterward, he attacked the jury in the case and said he would 'love to see Roger exonerated.'
In a lengthy speech before imposing the penalty, Jackson seemed to take aim at Trump, saying Stone 'was not prosecuted for standing up for the president; he was prosecuted for covering up for the president.' She also appeared to call out Attorney General William P. Barr, saying his intervention to reduce career prosecutors' sentencing recommendation was 'unprecedented.' But she said the politics surrounding the case had not influenced her decision.
'The truth still exists; the truth still matters,' Jackson said, echoing prosecutors' closing arguments at trial in November. 'Roger Stone's insistence that it doesn't, his belligerence, his pride in his own lies are a threat to our most fundamental institutions, to the foundations of our democracy. If it goes unpunished, it will not be a victory for one party or another. Everyone loses.'
She added, 'The dismay and disgust at the defendant's belligerence should transcend party.'
Trump, meanwhile, weighed in from afar "" again bucking Barr's public and private warnings to stop talking about Justice Department criminal cases. As the hearing was ongoing, the president, who was traveling on the West Coast, suggested in a tweet that Stone was being treated unfairly compared with political rivals he wants to see charged with crimes, including former FBI director James B. Comey, former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe and former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who ran against him for president in 2016. 

Not long after Stone's hearing ended, Trump made similar comments in an appearance before former inmates in Las Vegas. Trump sought to make common cause over the criminal justice system. 'These people know more about bad juries than everybody,' he said. Then he specifically attacked the panel and forewoman who decided Stone's case. 
'This is a woman who was an anti-Trump person, totally,' he said. 'Is that a defrauding of the court? You tell me.'
Trump said he was 'following this very closely, and I want to see it play out to its fullest because Roger has a very good chance of exoneration in my opinion.' But he added, 'I'm not going to do anything in terms of the great powers bestowed upon a president of the United States. I want the process to play out.'



Overnight, Trump had hinted he could pardon Stone, tweeting a video clip in which Fox News host Tucker Carlson said, 'President Trump could end this travesty in an instant with a pardon, and there are indications tonight that he will do that.'
Stone, 67, was convicted by a federal jury on seven counts of lying to Congress and tampering with a witness about his efforts to learn about hacked Democratic emails related to Clinton. 
A jury found the longtime GOP operative guilty of lying during testimony to the House Intelligence Committee in September 2017 to conceal his central role in the Trump campaign's efforts to learn about computer files hacked by Russia and made public by the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks. Stone also threatened a witness who was an associate of his in an attempt to prevent the man from cooperating with lawmakers.
Stone did not speak in court and showed no visible emotion as the sentence was read. Emerging from the courtroom in a wide-striped suit and polka-dot tie, he appeared calm.
'I have nothing to say,' Stone said. 'Thank you.'
Stone, his wife and a large entourage exited the courthouse to a large crowd of photographers, supporters and antagonists. As he climbed into an SUV, protesters shouted 'Lock him up!' while supporters yelled 'Pardon Roger Stone!'
Stone requested a new trial last week, after Trump suggested the forewoman in Stone's case had 'significant bias.' Jackson, the judge, said previously that she would delay implementing his sentence until she resolves that request. A filing is due from Stone's defense team Monday. In addition to prison, Jackson ordered Stone to pay a $20,000 fine and serve two years of supervised release. He remains out of prison on bond, and even if he loses his motion for a new trial, he will have at least two weeks to turn himself in "" unless an appeal further delays things.
The penalty capped an unusual sentencing hearing in which Jackson sought not only to resolve disputes between prosecutors and defense attorneys, but also to seek answers on the internal Justice Department haggling over what punishment the government would endorse.
The initial team of four career prosecutors recommended that Jackson impose a term of seven to nine years, only to see Trump tweet about the matter and Barr personally intervene. All four prosecutors then quit the case "" with one leaving the government entirely "" and their replacements filed a new recommendation suggesting that three to four years was 'more typical' in cases like Stone's.
Yet the new prosecutor in court Thursday defended his predecessors and argued for the same stiff sentencing enhancements as they had.

'The Department of Justice and the United States attorney's office is committed to following the law without fear, favor or political influence,' Assistant U.S. Attorney John Crabb Jr. said. 'This prosecution was and this prosecution is righteous.' 
Crabb said the court 'should impose a substantial period of incarceration,' although he did not propose a specific number of months or years.
At the Justice Department, one senior official expressed relief that the sentence was more in line with Barr's preferred recommendation than the career prosecutors' guidance of seven to nine years. 'It was messier than we wanted, but we ended up in the same place,' the official said.
Jackson acknowledged the case's underlying political tension and pressed Crabb to explain why prosecutors filed two very different sentencing memos. She asked why the Justice Department ultimately chose to recommend bucking the guidelines "" when department policies do not allow that without approval from supervisors "" and questioned why Crabb was in court at all. 
'I fear that you know less about this case than possibly anybody else in the courtroom,' Jackson said. 'What is the government's position today?' 
Crabb said the case's original prosecutors had approval from U.S. Attorney Timothy Shea to make their recommendation and that their filing was 'done in good faith.' He said his understanding was there had been a 'miscommunication' between Barr and Shea, centered on 'what the expectations were from the attorney general and what the appropriate filing would be.' He refused to say whether he had written the softer sentencing recommendation, which bore his signature, because it would expose 'internal deliberations.'
Stone had asked for probation, citing his age and lack of a criminal history. 
Defense attorney Seth Ginsberg said Stone is 'a real person, not a media figure, not a political character, but a real person,' who is soon to be a great-grandfather. He emphasized Stone has 'devoted himself' to various causes "" including veterans, animal welfare and football players suffering from traumatic brain injuries.
That, he said, is 'who Mr. Stone really is "" not the larger than life political persona that he plays on TV.'


Ginsberg argued that New York City comedian and radio host Randy Credico, the witness Stone was convicted of threatening, understood Stone was 'all bark and no bite.' Credico also appealed for leniency, saying in a letter to the court: 'Stone, at his core, is an insecure person who craves and recklessly pursues attention. . . . Prison is no remedy.'

Jackson noted that Stone threatened her personally during the trial and stirred up claims that the process was rigged. Doing so, she said, 'willfully increased the risk that someone with even poorer judgment than' Stone would take action and put the entire courthouse in danger.
Barr's intervention in Stone's case set off a crisis for the Justice Department, where some worried that Trump "" who called the penalty initially suggested by prosecutors 'horrible and very unfair' "" had pushed his chief law enforcement official to get involved in a criminal case because Stone was the president's friend. Barr, though, insisted in an ABC News interview that he had made the decision independent of Trump and issued a remarkable public rebuke, saying Trump's tweets 'make it impossible for me to do my job.'
This week, those close to Barr said the attorney general has told Trump advisers that he has considered resigning over the president's tweets. But Trump continued to tweet about the Stone case. This week, he suggested his friend deserved a new trial "" just as the Justice Department, with Barr's blessing, made clear it had opposed Stone's request on that front. Like prosecutors, Barr has called Stone's prosecution 'righteous' and added, 'I was happy that he was convicted.'


Senior Justice Department officials are increasingly resigned to the idea that Trump is likely to continue to publicly upbraid the department and the FBI and that it may be a theme of his reelection campaign "" an incumbent president bashing his own Justice Department, an official said. But the official was also cautiously optimistic that the president seems to have avoided dragging Barr directly into those discussions in recent days.
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment.
Stone is one of six Trump advisers and confidants who have either been convicted or pleaded guilty in connection with former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation. 
In Las Vegas, Trump sought to distance himself from his longtime friend. 'I know Roger, but a lot of people know Roger,' he said. 'Everybody sort of knows Roger.'

President Trump's defense team spent more than 10 hours over three days alternately trying to dispute the facts of the impeachment case and going on the political offensive against one of his leading 2020 rivals. 
But in the final minutes of the presentation, Trump's lead attorney returned to a subtle, but critically important, subtheme of their argument: Let the voters decide the president's fate. 
Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, closed out Tuesday with a break-the-glass strategy designed to steer even the most skeptical of Trump's Republican critics away from calling witnesses or even considering voting to convict the president. 
'Most importantly, most importantly,' Cipollone said, explaining what he asked of them, 'to respect and defend the sacred right of every American to vote and to choose their president. The election is only months away. The American people are entitled to choose their president.'
This has always been the ultimate fallback strategy for Trump's lawyers. Even if senators find the president guilty of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, they should not administer Trump the political death penalty because the 2020 campaign has already begun.
So much so that Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) bolted once Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. gaveled Tuesday's session shut before 3 p.m., the earliest weekday ending so far, giving her enough time to race to Iowa to campaign ahead of Monday's critical caucus in the fight for the 2020 Democratic nomination. 
This line of defense became more critical after Sunday's New York Times report that former national security adviser John Bolton had sent a book manuscript to the White House for review, including allegations that Trump ordered nearly $400-million in security aid to be withheld until Ukraine announced investigations that would benefit the president politically. 
What had seemed like a glide path to witness blocking and swift acquittal, perhaps by Saturday, hit a roadblock as GOP senators voiced new concern about hearing what Bolton had to say. 
The White House had stonewalled the House probe, denying evidence and witnesses.
On Saturday, in their brief opening remarks, Trump's legal team referred to the effort to remove the president as its own form of 'massive election interference,' the very accusation lodged against Trump for his actions with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.
By Monday evening, Cipollone gave a more direct 'let the voters decide' mantra, a position he returned to in his closing remarks Tuesday afternoon. 
It almost gave license to GOP senators to, preferably in hushed tones, admit that the president might have done something wrong but that the ultimate jury is the American people, who will cast their ballots in November.
But Cipollone's client "" famous for labeling 'perfect' a call to Zelensky that set off this investigation "" is not willing to cede an inch of ground when it comes to right and wrong.
He does not want Republicans to admit he did anything wrong in his bid to pressure Zelensky to start investigations into Trump's political rivals, which has left Republicans in an awkward dance outside the Senate chamber. 
The anti-Russia hawks have struggled the most trying to explain Trump's delay of $391-million in congressionally appropriated aid to Ukraine "" in the midst of the fight against Russian aggression, they feared angering a president to whom loyalty among GOP voters is fierce. 
By Tuesday, they finally felt a little more free to simply defend the president by saying that nothing he did warrants his removal from office. Alan Dershowitz, the celebrity lawyer and emeritus Harvard law professor, spent an hour Monday evening outlining his belief that nothing Trump had been accused of necessitated his ouster from office. 
Citing Dershowitz's discussion of 'corrupt motive,' Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) explained that any president who is doing something that is constitutionally acceptable "" such as leveraging foreign aid for a nation to fight corruption "" is within his rights even if the demand is one that will benefit the president personally. 
'There may be mixed purposes; one, policy-wise, and the other political,' Cornyn said, paraphrasing Dershowitz's defense. 
Does Cornyn acknowledge that Trump's bigger motivation was to influence his own 2020 reelection? 
'At best there were mixed motives, that there was a policy decision that had incidental, personal political benefits,' Cornyn said. 'But if that's the standard, then you're going to make impeachment the new normal, and we might as well kiss elections goodbye.'
It was not quite a full admission that Trump did something wrong, but Republicans finally felt that Dershowitz had given them a legal basis for their decisions to block witnesses and ultimately vote to acquit the president. 
But, in between their attacks on former vice president Joe Biden's family and relitigating 2016 controversies, his legal team found ways to circle back to their slightly more reasonable position for those Republicans who feel that Trump has acted against U.S. interests in Ukraine. 
'At the end of the day, the most important thought is this: This choice belongs to the American people. They will get to make it months from now,' Cipollone said during Monday's closing remarks. 
He argued that there was 'no basis' in the facts of the case or the Constitution, but the experienced lawyer understood that a critical bloc of his jury felt uncomfortable with the latest development regarding Bolton. 
So, he went to back to the fail-safe answer: 'I would urge you to quickly come to that conclusion so we can go have an election.'
Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), a hawk on matters related to Russia, appreciated that touch because he felt that the bar for impeaching and removing a president is higher than for federal judges serving lifetime appointments. 
'Which has been historically the place on elective office. That's what it was for Johnson,' Lankford said before Tuesday's session started. 
In 1868, when Congress was dominated by Republicans, they tried to impeach Andrew Johnson in a highly politicized setting. Just a few Senate votes saved Johnson, who went on to lose the Democratic nomination later that year, as Ulysses S. Grant won the election.
So, knowing the vast majority of GOP votes were in his pocket, Cipollone ended his pitch Tuesday by aiming at those few wavering Republicans and possibly one or two Democrats. 
'The American people are entitled to choose their president,' he said. 'Overturning the last election and massively interfering with the upcoming one would cause serious and lasting damage.'

It's been an extraordinary few weeks for the stock markets. After reaching record highs just a few weeks ago, markets have plunged dramatically on coronavirus fears. The past week marked the worst for markets since the height of 2008 financial crisis. Investors are panicked that the coronavirus is spreading so quickly, with each day bringing more countries to a standstill, that it threatens the global economy.
So far, relatively few new cases have been appeared in the United States, but public health officials have warned Americans to prepare, which coincided with the beginning of the market slide. The sell-off comes at a precarious time for President Trump who has branded himself as personally responsible for so much of the market gains since he took office. Yet in the past week, Wall Street lost more than a third of stocks gains since President Trump's election in November 2016.

Most expensive event of reelection campaign is reversal of 2016 criticism
President Trump will be the guest of honor at a Saturday fundraiser at the palatial Palm Beach estate of billionaire Nelson Peltz. Trump's fellow guests: donors who gave $580,600 per couple to support the president's reelection, making it the most expensive such fundraising event since Trump took office.
The dinner, taking place just a few miles from Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club, shows how enthusiastically Trump has embraced big-dollar fundraising in his bid for a second term "" a dramatic about-face from 2016, when he criticized the influence of wealthy donors on the politicians who court them.
It also shows the special access enjoyed by many of Trump's wealthiest donors, including business executives and lobbyists, who get the chance to air their grievances with the president's tariffs or promote their pet projects, often while dining on Trump's favorite foods.
Since October 2017, Trump has attended at least 48 intimate gatherings with the Republican Party's elite donors, including dinners or roundtable discussions, according to a Washington Post analysis of his fundraising schedule. Tickets to these events can range from $50,000 to six figures per person. 
Republican officials note that previous presidents also raised large amounts from wealthy people and that President Barack Obama regularly held small dinners with top donors.
'President Trump is the most accessible president in history, both with the press and with supporters. These roundtables, which previous presidents attended as well, are an opportunity for our supporters to get an update on the campaign and his record as president, all things the president discusses publicly all the time,' said Mike Reed, a spokesman for the RNC.
But they go against the president's rhetoric from the 2016 campaign, when he rode a populist wave into Washington vowing to 'drain the swamp.' Back then, he denounced the chase for wealthy backers and criticized his opponents for doing so, saying it made candidates beholden to donors and declaring it was 'not going to happen with me.'
'Somebody gives them money "" not anything wrong "" just psychologically when they go to that person, they're going to do it,' he said in a January 2016 CNN interview. 'They owe them.'
He has repeatedly said that New York politicians are indebted to him because he gave them large checks.
Now, he has adopted a take-all-comers approach to raising money "" from wealthy backers and low-dollar givers alike "" and has built a historically large reelection money machine that has allowed his campaign to leap ahead as Democratic presidential candidates squabble over the appropriate role of wealthy donors in politics. 
The president and the Republican Party have assembled a formidable war chest, with about $200-million on hand as of last month for the general-election fight, party officials said.
Those who seek to reduce the role of wealthy donors in politics said Trump's embrace of the world of wealthy political donors contradicts his promise to his voters and fuels the same frustrations they were rejecting when they elected him. 
'He's undercutting the spirit of the energy that he's helping foment, by hanging out with and possibly doing the bidding of the wealthy and special interests,' said Nick Penniman, founder and chief executive of Issue One, a bipartisan group working to reduce the influence of wealthy interests on politics.
'You've got to wonder now if the Trump presidency is the continuation of the kind of oligarchy that many people think is taking over in America, or whether or not it is a corrective measure like many people thought it would be,' Penniman added.
A spokeswoman for Peltz's company "" he is an investor worth $1.7 billion, according to Forbes "" did not respond to requests for comment. His 13-acre beachfront estate lined with hedges was worth $94.9 million in 2014, according to the Palm Beach Post. 
An invitation obtained by The Washington Post for the $580,600 dinner says the price includes a photo with the president and lists other GOP bigwigs expected to be in attendance.
The dinner is expected to attract about 30 people and raise more than $10 million for the president's reelection committee and the party, according to an RNC official. Others on the guest list are Ike Perlmutter, a Trump friend and chairman of Marvel Entertainment, and Louis DeJoy, fundraising chair for the 2020 Republican convention, according to a person with knowledge of the gathering, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the event is private.
Though it is the most expensive such event Trump has headlined for the party, other pricey gatherings are planned as the election nears.
Interviews with people who have attended these fundraisers say the president is highly engaged, conversational and charming. Trump often asks the guests what they need from the administration "" but not before ticking off dozens of accomplishments in extended opening remarks.
The conversations are often held over a meal of the president's favorite dishes, such as New York strip steak with a dessert of two scoops of vanilla ice cream, served on ornate place settings. Unlike many politicians who leave their food untouched, attendees say Trump usually eats.
The roundtables are typically side events to less expensive fundraisers involving a larger group of people. The president often arrives through a side door reserved for him, greets the crowd leisurely, takes photos and then veers off to a smaller room for an intimate roundtable with the top-tiered donors, said one donor who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private settings.
Dan Eberhart, a donor who has attended several roundtables featuring the president, recalls one gathering where Trump made a show of praising an attendee wearing a Trump-branded tie.
Though Trump appears to enjoy himself, he has complained about visiting so many houses of people he did not know, said a former White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. Since then, more events have taken place at a friend's home or at one of his properties, the person said. Trump considers Peltz a friend.
But the opportunity to have close interactions with the president is a particular perk enjoyed by attendees with agendas.
'Trump wants to talk about the news of the day and personalities,' Eberhart said. 'The donors want to talk about policies and what's affecting them.'
At a Texas roundtable at the stately Belo Mansion in Dallas, donor Doug Deason, the organizer of the event and several others, said supporters spoke with the president about energy and oil policy while offering support for his deregulation agenda. The room was packed with Texas Republican business figures.
'People say, look, these kinds of regulations are kicking my butt. And then Trump responds that he understands and is ideologically with you,' Eberhart said.
Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, the two indicted associates of presidential lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani who, according to Parnas, discussed the Ukrainian ambassador with Trump, gained access to the president at two separate such events in 2018 after promising to donate $1 million. Trump later fired the ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, who became a central figure in the impeachment. Their company ended up donating $325,000 to the super PAC supporting the president's reelection. 
Some donors disputed the idea that attendees at these gatherings have special pull with the president.
'I just don't see it. [Administration officials] pay more attention to maybe the Chamber of Commerce [and other business groups], pay more attention to the source of actual votes, than they do to some individual who's giving a lot of money,' said the donor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. 
One lobbyist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations, said he told several clients that it did not make sense to pay for the events "" because it would not solve their political issues and would put them on the radar screen for news coverage.
Donors who turn up regularly at these events say they have developed a camaraderie. But every once in a while, a new donor attends and asks a question that is 'annoying' to the rest because it relates too specifically to that person's business, said one donor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private settings.
'What do I care about the drilling rights in freaking Kansas, or a particular permit, or something? These are broader audiences and broader participants,' the donor said. 
'There's always someone in the group who is asking him to stop tariffs,' Deason said. 'They'll say, 'No, you're killing me on this.' A lot of people are worried about themselves and they are worried about their particular industry. A lot of people are concerned about how this or that might affect them.'
Trump often refers such requests to his staff and senior aides. Senior staffers sometimes interject and offer to talk to the donors later.
'What he doesn't like is someone pushing for a contract for a particular company,' Deason said of Trump. 'It just really frustrates him.'

On a recording of one of the fundraisers released by a lawyer for Parnas last month, a steel executive can be heard pressing the president on removing tariffs. Another donor can be heard pitching the president on his Korean golf course for a potential summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Guests are not allowed to bring their phones in anymore, GOP officials said, for fear that they will record the discussion. 
Aside from a cursory Secret Service check, the White House does not vet guests, campaign and White House officials said. 
At one event, Deason said he encouraged the president to tell Immigration and Customs Enforcement to ease off Iraqi Christians in Michigan, arguing that it could hurt his election chances in a reelection year. Deason said he encouraged Trump to be more positive toward Hispanic audiences in his tweets.
But the tone at the events is predominantly jovial. He often calls out noteworthy donors "" such as oil magnate Harold Hamm, or Paul Singer, a New York billionaire who originally did not support him "" for being so rich. Deason said that White House staffers on several occasions made a slashing sign for the president to wrap up but that Trump wanted to keep talking. 'He would say, 'One more question, one more question,' ' Deason said. 
Eberhart, an oil executive, said that the opportunity to speak directly to the president was just an added bonus for being a donor to the party and that he would have given money anyway.
'I want that ideology to prevail,' he said. 'It's very energizing to be in the room with the people who have momentum on the causes you believe in.'

Some Democrats fear president's charm may be winning converts 

In attempting to court black and Hispanic voters ahead of November, President Trump and his allies are focused on swaying one group in particular: minority men.
The effort has been on display in the Trump campaign's Super Bowl ad highlighting criminal justice reform, throughout Trump's State of the Union address that featured a Tuskegee Airman and two black men benefiting from Opportunity Zones, and in the president's almost daily references to historically low minority unemployment rates.
Trump has increasingly welcomed black athletes and celebrities into the Oval Office, and last week he spoke at a graduation ceremony for ex-inmates in Nevada, a state where a majority of prisoners are black or Hispanic men.
'We're here to reaffirm that America is a nation that believes in redemption,' Trump said during the ceremony, in which he compared the prosecution of his ally Roger Stone with the legal challenges faced by the graduating felons. 'These people know more about bad juries than everybody here,' he said.
On Wednesday, the president's campaign team hosted reporters at its Arlington, Va., offices to announce plans for more than a dozen 'Black Voices for Trump' community centers across the country, in cities ranging from Atlanta to Detroit to Jacksonville, Fla.
The advisers "" including Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and a senior White House adviser; campaign manager Brad Parscale; and Katrina Pierson, a senior campaign adviser who is black "" showed mock-ups of the spaces, which they said will have the vibe of sleek retail storefronts crossed with campaign field offices in predominantly black areas. Voters will be able to volunteer, attend events, learn more about Trump's message and buy merchandise, including 'Black Voices for Trump' sweatshirts and baseball caps that say 'Woke.'
'You're never going to get the votes you don't ask for,' Kushner said, adding that after nearly four years in office, Trump has a positive message to share with black voters. 'Last time it was, 'What the hell do you have to lose?' Now, you show them what they've gained from President Trump and what more they can gain if they get four more years of President Trump.'
Some Democrats are concerned that the president's charm offensive may be wooing black and Latino men to his camp "" or at the very least blunting the kind of voter enthusiasm that helped propel Barack Obama to the White House in 2008 and 2012.
'It keeps me up at night,' said Terrance Woodbury, a partner at HIT Strategies, a firm that conducts research on minorities and other under-researched demographic groups. 'The Trump campaign recognizes that while the Democratic Party is spending a significant amount of resources and effort to persuade white suburban women back into their coalition, the Trump campaign has found a very susceptible and very different swing voter in black men.'

Woodbury said that in focus groups he conducted recently in Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, Atlanta and Detroit, he found minority men are 'the most susceptible audience' to Trump's message.
Democrats are relying on high voter turnout in those and other urban areas to compete with Trump in swing states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania "" places where even a modest shift in the nonwhite vote share could tip the 2020 race.
Exit polls from 2016 showed Trump won 13 percent of black male voters and 32 percent of Hispanic men, compared with 4-percent of black women and 25-percent of Hispanic women. Combined with a drop in turnout among those traditionally Democratic voters, Trump's meager minority support "" buoyed by male voters "" helped him narrowly win key states en route to an electoral college victory over Hillary Clinton.
Now, Trump's campaign is trying to marginally improve those numbers with a public appeal to minorities that analysts say doubles as a stealth effort to win back suburban white voters turned off by his history of racist rhetoric and divisive politics.
Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee have touted the multimillion-dollar investment the president has approved for minority outreach as a sign he is serious about competing for nonwhite voters in 2020. They point to internal RNC data to make the case that the efforts "" and Trump's record on key issues important to minority men "" are working.
Those internal figures, which appear to contradict some public polling, show that Trump's approval rating has improved 8 points with black men and 12 points with Hispanic men since 2016, according to the RNC.
The campaign, which launched a group called Black Voices for Trump in November, has been holding outreach events to carry Trump's message into minority neighborhoods in major cities. Most of the attendees have been men, Republican officials said.
Paris Dennard, a campaign adviser who is on the Black Voices for Trump advisory board, said he was not surprised to see the mostly male crowd during a town hall he helped host last month in Philadelphia. Trump's long history of being cited by black entertainers and athletes as a symbol of unabashed wealth and bombast is part of the reason men of color have been willing to hear his pitch, Dennard said.
'The president is aspirational "" he's just a boss. He's confident,' he said, referring to the popularity of Trump's former reality television show, 'The Apprentice,' with black viewers. 'He's always had the appeal to black men.'

Trump's brash behavior partially explains the large gender gap in his overall approval rating, with women of all races consistently rating him more poorly than their male counterparts, said Amy Walter, national editor of the Cook Political Report.
'What is appealing to many men about his style "" that kind of take-no-prisoners, keep punching, don't show weakness "" is exactly what makes him so unappealing to women,' she said. 'The lack of empathy, the lack of consideration.'
Some of Trump's most acerbic comments during his presidency have been about race, and it is unclear if the president will be able to avoid controversy while his campaign seeks to make a case to minorities.
The president equivocated on condemning white supremacists after a deadly Virginia rally in 2017, referred to African nations as 'shithole countries' in 2018 and told four minority congresswomen to 'go back' to their ancestral nations in 2019.
Before running for president, Trump promoted the 'birtherism' conspiracy theory claiming falsely that Obama was born in Kenya and called for the death penalty for five black and Hispanic teenagers wrongly convicted of raping a woman in Central Park in the 1980s.
A Washington Post-Ipsos poll of African Americans released last month found that more than 8 in 10 view the president as racist. Trump's approval rating among black male registered voters in the poll was 8 percent.
The president's allies say his record will help him improve his standing with minority voters, pointing to the economy, criminal-justice legislation and increased funding for historically black colleges and universities as areas where he can make a compelling case.
'There is simply no denying that minority communities are thriving under President Trump,' said Kayleigh McEnany, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign.
Democrats have decried Trump's minority outreach effort as a cynical election-year gambit that will eventually succumb to the president's more divisive instincts.
'In the end, the card Trump always plays is to inflame racial tensions and fear in order to divide people and distract them about how he's picking the pockets of people of all races,' said Ben Wikler, chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party. 'When Trump's back is against the wall, the mask falls away. And I suspect that's likely to happen now.'
Still, Wikler said he is taking the president's repeated overtures to minority voters seriously and working to ensure Democrats avoid a repeat of the kind of tepid black voter turnout that cost them the key swing state in 2016.
Woodbury, who conducted a focus group in Milwaukee recently, said he found that black voters have not felt motivated by the field of the Democratic presidential candidates. The Trump campaign is hosting a panel for black voters at a Republican Party field office in Milwaukee on Feb. 29.

Doug Heye, a Republican strategist and former spokesman for the RNC, said such events could boost Trump's 2020 chances even if they only win over a few voters.
'He doesn't need to make major inroads with minority voters. He just needs a few cul-de-sacs here and there,' he said. 'If you can just peel off some voters here and there, then you're changing maps.'
Touré, a cultural critic and host of podcast 'The Touré Show,' said Trump could peel off a few minority male voters based on the personality traits that have been so controversial with the broader public. He said Trump's alliance with rapper Kanye West is rooted in their shared egoistic and contrarian personalities, rather than policy.
'There's an unbridled id to him,' he said. 'He seems to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and I think sometimes as humans, especially as men, we kind of look up to the nobody tells me what to do, and that's definitely been a carry-over from his previous life to this chapter of his life.' 
After spending more than $5-million for a Super Bowl ad aimed at boosting his support with minorities, Trump plans to continue making overtures to groups that typically vote for Democrats, campaign officials said.
Alaysia Berton, whose boyfriend was graduating from the HOPE For Prisoners program last week in Las Vegas, said Trump's mere presence at the ceremony had made an impact. Berton, who is black, said she plans to support Trump in November.
'I don't really think he's a bad guy, definitely not the most evil guy everyone is trying to make him out to be,' she said. 'And just him being here, speaking out, means a lot.'

On cusp of acquittal, he may trade rancor for 'relentless optimism'

President Trump will stride Tuesday night into the House chamber where he was impeached just 48 days earlier to deliver his annual State of the Union address, seizing the dais on the cusp of acquittal by the Senate to position himself to fight for a second term.
The theme of Trump's speech will be 'the Great American Comeback,' which is how he and his advisers see his presidency now after nearly six months of impeachment proceedings that have scrutinized the president and his administration's conduct with Ukraine.
Trump plans to present a vision of 'relentless optimism,' as one aide put it, and to summon lawmakers from both parties to work together on economic policies and other issue areas. But the traditionally presidential tone previewed by the White House has been belied by the president's own messages of discord and disunity, and his vow to seek retribution on the Democrats he feels wronged him by searing his impeachment into history.
The pervasive toxicity at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue all but forestalls the possibility of legislative accomplishments this year. Rather, Trump's speech, coming one night after Democratic voters began choosing their presidential nominee, will be the sounding gun for the march toward Election Day in November.
'This is such a brutal election cycle and Trump has a take-no-prisoners-or-collaborators approach, it's going to be scorched-earth 2020,' presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said. 'Congress is virtually going to be at a standstill.'
Last year, Trump delivered a delayed State of the Union address in the wake of the government shutdown that he helped instigate and for which a majority of voters blamed him. 
Trump was visibly on the defensive, staring into a sea of Democratic women wearing bright white in tribute to suffragists while newly empowered House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) perched stone-faced over his shoulder. The tableau was a reminder of the peril his presidency faced with the House under Democratic rule "" and the president's own words that night revealed his concern.
'An economic miracle is taking place in the United States "" and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations,' Trump said. 'If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation.'

One year and numerous investigations later, Trump will return to the chamber probably feeling emboldened by his all-but-certain acquittal by the Republican-controlled Senate.
It is an open question whether Trump will use the address to complain as he has in other forums about his impeachment or to prematurely celebrate the trial's likely outcome. Some Republican lawmakers have urged the president not to do so, in part because the Senate is not expected to vote to formally conclude its trial until Wednesday.
'If I was writing the speech or delivering it, I wouldn't include it, but I'm doing neither of those two things, and Donald Trump has been very successful being Donald Trump,' Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said. 'Most people that have suggested he be something different have never been president, and he has.'
On the Senate floor Monday, as he delivered closing arguments on behalf of the president, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone insisted that Trump wants to work with Democrats following the impeachment trial.
'This is something that we should reject together and we should move forward in a bipartisan fashion, and in the way that this president has done successfully,' Cipollone said. 'He's achieved successful results in the economy and across so many other areas working with you on both sides of the aisle, and he wants to continue to do that.'
Yet Trump in recent weeks has offered a stark counter to the bipartisan bonhomie described by Cipollone. Almost every day, Trump has fired off Twitter broadsides against the 'Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats,' as he referred to them in one such tweet Sunday, and maligned the party's leaders. In a single tweet on Jan. 25, the president called the House speaker 'Nervous Nancy Pelosi,' the Senate minority leader 'Cryin' Chuck Schumer' and the House Intelligence Committee chairman 'lyin', cheatin', liddle' Adam 'Shifty' Schiff.'

Looking ahead to Tuesday night's address, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said: 'I expect the president will be in full campaign mode, probably pretty bellicose and boasting. I wish it were otherwise because I think my Republican colleagues are hoping for a more conciliatory approach.'
Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) added: 'I'd be surprised if he wasn't bombastic and self-congratulatory. I'd be surprised if he didn't take potshots at the press and Democrats and the impeachment managers. My expectations are so low these days.'
Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) stopped short of a detailed prediction. 'I think he's just going to be the president,' Tester said, leaving his comment open to interpretation.
In a briefing with reporters to preview the speech, a senior administration official said Trump would focus on five issue areas: a 'blue-collar boom' for which he credits his trade negotiations with China, Mexico and Canada; domestic policies to help working families, including paid family leave; health care; illegal immigration; and national security. 
'The speech will celebrate American economic and military strength and present an optimistic vision of America's future,' said the official conducting the briefing, who declined to be identified by name.
Trump also plans to use the speech to sound appeals to his conservative base. For instance, he intends to pitch a tax break to support scholarships for private and religious schools, a pet issue for advocates on the right.
Meaningful legislative achievements in the year of a presidential election are rare in normal times, but Democrats said they are even more pessimistic about the likelihood of any breakthroughs this year in the aftermath of impeachment.
'It doesn't feel like we're setting ourselves up to pass anything big,' Murphy said.

For Trump, the State of the Union address presents an opportunity to set the foundation for a post-impeachment Washington and to establish a tone for his reelection. He has shown an interest in broadening his coalition, despite language at rallies and on social media that seems less welcoming, such as with a television ad that aired during the Super Bowl promoting the passage of bipartisan criminal justice reform.
Brinkley said Trump would be wise to sound optimistic and inclusive, and to ask himself, ' 'What can I say that will make people in Wisconsin or Ohio or Michigan or Pennsylvania feel better?' . . . He's the worst at pretending to be a statesman . . . but he needs to operate with humor and be above the fray and try to represent all of the American people and not a red-meat rally.'
One way Trump will try to expand his connection to viewers is with guests seated in the gallery with first lady Melania Trump and other dignitaries, a tradition for State of the Union addresses. 
The White House has announced that the guests will include Tony Rankins, who served in the Army in Afghanistan, suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and now works in the construction industry through an 'opportunity zone' program in Cincinnati. Another guest will be U.S. Border Patrol Deputy Chief Raul Ortiz, who has been honored for his leadership in the force.
As for what Trump might say on impeachment, if anything, Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.) said he, too, would advise him not to bring it up.
'I think the American people want to have bipartisanship, to actually know that we can get stuff done,' Cassidy said.
Asked if he really thinks Trump will steer clear of impeachment, the Louisianian confessed ignorance.
'Does anybody imagine that they know what President Trump's going to do?' Cassidy said. 'Not me!'

Collins in favor; Alexander opposed 
Trump allies hope to bring trial to a close today
The impeachment trial of President Trump is headed for a critical vote Friday that will determine whether the Senate hears from witnesses over allegations that the president pressured Ukraine to launch investigations for his own political benefit.
But Senate Republicans are increasingly confident no new testimony will be heard and they can start on a sprint toward Trump's acquittal.
On Thursday, Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) said she will break with Republican leadership and vote to hear witnesses. But Collins still needs three other Republicans to vote with her if new evidence is to be allowed and it was unclear late Thursday night who, if anyone, in the party would join her. 
Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) was considered a possible supporter of allowing testimony, but he announced Friday that he's ready to end the trial even though he found Trump's behavior 'inappropriate' and leave the president's fate in the hands of voters during the upcoming election. 
'Let the people decide,' he said in a statement.
Some Republicans said they hope the trial will be completed Friday with a vote to acquit Trump.
'We still feel very positive about it,' said Sen. John Barrasso (Wyo.), the third-ranking Republican leader. 'More and more members are saying, 'I'm ready to go to a final [vote]. . . . I've heard enough.' '
One outside possibility is that the Senate will deadlock on the question of calling witnesses. That would put Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. in the position of breaking the tie "" a role Democrats are urging him to play. But there is little expectation Roberts would weigh in on such a politically thorny question and instead would allow the tie to result in no witness being subpoenaed.
Trump will almost certainly revel in a vote to acquit him on the impeachment charges, but House Democrats have said they will continue to investigate the president and are hoping the allegations they have made against him will resonate with voters and help make him a one-term president.
Trump was impeached by the House in December "" charged with abuse of power after being accused of soliciting the Ukrainian government's help in undermining his political rivals and obstructing the House's investigation into his actions.
The final outcome of Trump's Senate trial has never been in doubt. It takes only 34 votes to acquit. The GOP has 53 seats. And with Republican primary voters strongly supportive of Trump, these senators have shown little interest in crossing him.
Instead, the main drama has been about how much more Republican senators want to learn about what Trump may have done before deciding whether he should be convicted.
 On Thursday, the answer appeared to be: not much.
'Even if you take everything else that is levied on him by others … is it an impeachable offense?' said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who said she would not vote to call witnesses. 'I don't see that it rises to the level of being an impeachable offense.'
Earlier this week, the New York Times reported that Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, wrote in a forthcoming book that Trump told him in August that he wanted to continue freezing military assistance to Ukraine until its leaders launched investigations into former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
That revelation provided a key firsthand witness to an alleged pressure campaign at the heart of the impeachment trial. Democrats accused Trump of pressuring Ukraine's president into investigating Biden to gain an edge on his possible 2020 rival. Republicans have dismissed this account as being based on second- or third-hand witnesses. 
But Bolton said he was told directly by the president about his reason for holding the aid in a book that will be titled 'The Room Where It Happened.'
If all Democrats agreed, it would take four Republican votes to call Bolton, or anyone else, as a witness. Earlier this week, that seemed possible: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told other Republicans the vote was in doubt.
But since then, several Republicans seen as possible swing votes "" Ernst, Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Martha McSally (Ariz.), all facing competitive election contests "" rejected the idea of hearing more testimony.
Along with Collins, Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) is still viewed as the likeliest Republican contender to side with Democrats for more testimony, while Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) could join as well. She said late Thursday night that she is going to review her notes and reflect on the decision. It's unclear who would be the fourth vote "" Alexander was considered the most likely to join the other three before he said he was against subpoenaing witnesses.
While Alexander's announcement was cheered by Republicans, he took a swipe at Trump and contradicted the president's claim that his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was 'perfect.'
'It was inappropriate for the president to ask a foreign leader to investigate his political opponent and to withhold United States aid to encourage that investigation,' he said. 'When elected officials inappropriately interfere with such investigations, it undermines the principle of equal justice under the law. But the Constitution does not give the Senate the power to remove the president from office and ban him from this year's ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate.'
Republicans on Thursday mused about Roberts's potential role in breaking a tie on witnesses, but appeared unconcerned he would to take any decisive action.
'If it's two [voting for witnesses], deal is over. If it's three, we don't know, because we're in uncharted territory,' said Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.).
That's because three yes votes would create a 50-50 tie. Normally, tie votes are broken by the vice president. But in an impeachment trial, the presiding officer of the Senate is Roberts, not the vice president.
Could Roberts vote to break the tie? Would he?
'There's no real certainty what the power of the presiding officer is,' said Braun, who added that Republicans consider it 'unlikely' that Roberts would intervene.
Democrats have mostly been solicitous of Roberts during the trial, but on Thursday Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tried to put the chief justice on the spot.
The presidential contender asked whether Americans would lose faith in the chief justice, the Supreme Court and the Constitution if Roberts presided over a trial where no new witnesses or evidence was allowed.
Roberts performed his duty and read the question aloud, after which House Democrats' lead impeachment lawyer came to his defense.
'It reflects adversely on us,' House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) told lawmakers concerning the lack of witnesses and new evidence being allowed. He added that Roberts has performed 'admirably.'
Republican leaders said they want to move quickly toward the vote to acquit if the Senate decides not to hear new testimony Friday.
In the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, the Senate heard a combined five hours and 28 minutes of closing arguments. Then, the Senate entered four days of closed-door jury deliberations totaling nearly 26 hours, before voting to acquit Clinton on two articles of impeachment.
In this case, some Republicans said, they want to skip the closing arguments and the deliberations and move ahead to the last step.
'If 51 [senators] say we've heard enough, we can move to that final vote,' said Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.), the second-ranking Republican.
That would leave Senate Democrats with few cards to play. They could not stop an acquittal vote. 
But they could delay it "" and force Republican senators to take uncomfortable votes against hearing more evidence or allowing more debate.
One idea proposed by Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) is a motion to require Roberts to issue a subpoena for additional documents and witnesses if he thinks they are relevant to the trial. 
It would probably fail, but the vote could be used against Gardner, Ernst and other Republicans facing reelection.
'The minority has rights, and we will exercise those rights,' Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Thursday.
Schiff on Thursday proposed allowing for one week for deposing witnesses, a time during which the Senate could conduct legislative business, but Republicans are unlikely to agree to that.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who has remained relatively quiet throughout the proceedings, previewed an attack on Republicans to come if no additional evidence is allowed to be presented.
'You cannot be acquitted if you don't have a trial. You don't have a trial if you don't have witnesses and documentation,' she wrote on Twitter. 'If Republican Senators choose a coverup, the American people and history will judge it with the harshness it deserves.'
Still, delays eventually end "" even in the Senate. Even if Democrats force extra votes, the final vote to acquit Trump could come as early as Friday night or Saturday, unless leaders decide to move it to Monday, just one day before Trump's State of the Union address.
On Thursday "" on the last day of questions and answers in the Senate "" the day was mostly devoted to softballs, lobbed by senators at their own side. At one point, Republican senators asked Trump's lawyers to, in effect, recount Trump's accomplishments in office.
Trump attorney Eric Hershmann said that, if Trump's actions are 'for his personal and political gain and not in the best interests of the American people then I say, 'God bless him. Keep doing it, keep doing it, keep doing it.' '
Democratic senators asked Schiff who was paying the legal bills of Trump's private attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani "" who served as an intermediary to Ukraine.
'I don't know who's directly paying the freight for it, but I can tell you the whole country is paying the freight for it because there are leaders around the world who are watching this, and they're saying the American presidency is open for business,' Schiff said.
At the start of the day's session, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) submitted a question for Roberts to read aloud. The question contained the name of a person who conservative media have alleged is the intelligence community whistleblower whose complaint last year about Trump's actions toward Ukraine sparked the impeachment inquiry.
Roberts didn't read it.
'The presiding officer declines to read the question as submitted,' Roberts said. 
After that, Paul stood up, gathered his papers and walked out of the Senate chamber to address reporters. He then said the name that Roberts would not.
Trump traveled Thursday night to a rally in Iowa, where he criticized House Democrats for impeaching him but said he was unfazed by the trial.
He said he was enjoying a 'happy period' unlike the 'dark' impeachment cases of his predecessors Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon and Andrew Johnson.
'This is a happy period for us,' he said. 'It's a happy period because they call it 'impeachment light.' '

It was an extremely eventful year.

We are using 'eventful' in the sense of 'bad.'
It was a year so eventful that every time another asteroid whizzed past the Earth, barely avoiding a collision that would have destroyed human civilization, we were not 100 percent certain it was good news.
We could not keep up with all the eventfulness. Every day, we'd wake up to learn that some new shocking alleged thing had allegedly happened, and before we had time to think about it, the political-media complex, always in Outrage Condition Red, would explode in righteous fury, with Side A and Side B hurling increasingly nasty accusations at each other and devoting immense energy to thinking up ways to totally DESTROY the other side on Twitter, a medium that has the magical power to transform everything it touches, no matter how stupid it is, into something even stupider.
Fact: This year O.J. Simpson got a Twitter account, and the reaction of nearly a million people was: 'What? The attention-seeking psychopath who got away with murdering two innocent people wants followers? Count me in!'
Speaking of attention-seeking psychopaths: The epicenter of the year's eventfulness was of course Washington, D.C., an endlessly erupting scandal volcano, belching out dense swirling smoke plumes of spin, rumor, innuendo, misdirection and lies emitted by both sides, A and B "" or, if you prefer, B and A "" filling the air with vicious rhetoric, always delivered with the pious insistence that OUR side, unlike the OTHER side, is motivated not by ego, power-lust, greed or hatred, but by a selfless desire to Work for the American People.
Meanwhile, from out beyond the Capital Beltway, the actual American people warily watched the perpetual tantrum that was supposed to be their government. And more and more their reaction, whatever side they considered themselves to be on, was: Nah.
Which is pretty much how we feel about 2019 in general. And not just because of politics. There was a continued general decline of human intelligence, as epitomized by the popularity of increasingly elaborate 'gender reveal' events. Originally these involved simply cutting open a cake that had been dyed with food coloring, but they have escalated to the point where this year they resulted in "" we are not making this up "" a fatal explosion and a plane crash. It is only a matter of time before a major city is leveled by a pink or blue mushroom cloud.
Can we say anything good about 2019? Was there any positive news, a silver lining, a reason to feel hopeful about the future "" to believe that we, as Americans, can recognize our common interests, overcome our differences and work together to build a better tomorrow, for ourselves, for our children and for the world?
Nah.
Anyway, before we shove 2019 down the garbage disposal of history, let's take one look back and remind ourselves why we want to forget this train wreck of a year, starting with …
JANUARY

… which begins with the federal government once again in the throes (whatever a 'throe' is) of a partial shutdown, which threatens to seriously disrupt the lives of all Americans who receive paychecks from the federal government. At issue is the situation at the Mexican border, which either is or is not a Crisis depending on which cable news network you prefer. President Trump wants a high concrete wall, but at the moment there is only enough money for a sternly worded south-facing billboard.
Finally the president and Congress reach a temporary budget agreement that will not address the border situation but will enable them to resume spending insane amounts of money that the nation does not have until such time as they are able to reach a permanent budget agreement enabling them to continue spending insane amounts of money that the nation does not have, this being the primary function of our federal leadership.
Meanwhile in the Robert Mueller investigation, which feels like it began during the French and Indian War, a grand jury indicts longtime Trump confidante and professional lunatic Roger Stone on a number of charges, including that he threatened to kidnap another witness's therapy dog, Bianca (really). This news elates the courageous guerrilla fighters of the Resistance, who since 2016 have been evading the fascist authorities by hiding out underground, constantly on the move from CNN panel to CNN panel. The Resisters see the Stone indictment as a sure sign that Mueller is getting ready to release his much-anticipated report, which will prove, at last, that Trump colluded with the Russians and then, at last, it will be IMPEACHMENT TIME, BABY.
Abroad, Britain is in turmoil over 'Brexit,' which is a very important thing we should all endeavor to learn about.
In sports, the Los Angeles Rams win the National Football Conference championship game after the referees, on a critical play, fail to notice when a Rams defensive back attacks a New Orleans Saints receiver with a chain saw. Responding to the ensuing outrage, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says he will 'conduct a thorough review of league policy regarding power tools,' adding that 'New England is scheduled to win the Super Bowl anyway.'
In other sports news, the Clemson football team defeats Alabama to win the college national championship and is rewarded with an invite to the White House for a classy shindig. 'I served them massive amounts of Fast Food (I paid), over 1000 hamberders,' tweets the president, who by his own admission has a genius-level IQ.
Speaking of intelligence: The burning question of whether the nation is capable of producing a social media craze even stupider than last year's Tide Pod Challenge "" in which YouTube dimwits sought to impress other YouTube dimwits by eating compressed laundry detergent "" is answered in the affirmative ('yes') when Netflix is forced to issue a cautionary tweet to people who are inspired by the movie 'Birdbox' to take the Birdbox Challenge, in which YouTube dimwits engage in everyday activities "" including driving "" while blindfolded. Meanwhile, as a polar vortex grips the nation, other YouTube dimwits are injuring themselves attempting to demonstrate that it is cold outside by flinging pots of boiling water into the air.
From somewhere beyond our solar system hostile aliens are monitoring all this and concluding that they need not waste energy exterminating humanity, as we're doing fine on our own.

february

… President Trump, despite suffering from bone spurs, goes to Vietnam for a second summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un. After a one-on-one closed-room meeting, the two leaders agree via hand gestures that next time they should definitely bring interpreters.
In domestic politics, Virginia is rocked by a series of scandals involving elected Democratic state officials, originating with the publication of a 1984 photo from Gov. Ralph Northam's medical-school yearbook showing a man in blackface. Northam initially says he is 'deeply sorry' for appearing in the photo; the next day, however, he calls a news conference to declare that he does not believe he is in the photo, although he does recall one time that he was in blackface, that being when he entered a dance contest dressed as Michael Jackson and did the moonwalk. Northam further asserts that he won the contest, and at the request of a reporter appears to be on the verge of demonstrating to the press corps that he can still moonwalk, only to be stopped by his wife. We are not making any of this up.
As pressure builds on Northam to resign, Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax prepares to succeed him, only to become embroiled in a scandal of his own when he is accused of sexual assault. The third person in line is Attorney General Mark Herring, who, several days after calling on Northam to resign for wearing blackface, issues a statement admitting that as a college student he wore blackface when he went to a party as rapper Kurtis Blow. We are still not making this up.
At this point Virginia's political leaders realize that if they keep moving down the chain of succession they're going to wind up with a Labrador retriever as governor or, worse, a Republican. And just like that the Great Virginia Scandals Scandal of 2019 goes 'poof.'
Winter storms blast the Midwest, causing havoc in Iowa as snowdrifts close major highways and strand hundreds of Democratic presidential contenders in rural communities with limited supplies of voters. In one harrowing incident, a farmer and his family are trapped inside their home for six hours while Cory Booker pounds on the front door, demanding to be let in so he can outline his plan to reduce income inequality. 'We tried to escape by the back door,' the farmer later tells reporters, 'but Amy Klobuchar was waiting out there with a seven-point program to rebuild America's infrastructure.'
In business news, Amazon (whose CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post) cancels plans to build a huge corporate campus in New York City, citing local political opposition and the fact that Amazon's vice president for business development, during a visit to the site in Queens, was carried off by what a company spokesperson described as 'a rat the size of a Volkswagen Jetta.'
Abroad, 'Brexit' continues to be a very important thing with many significant developments.
In sports, the New England Patriots, led by 63-year-old Tom Brady, defeat the Los Angeles Rams, 13-3, in a Super Bowl featuring one touchdown and 14 punts. During the national anthem, TV cameras clearly capture Patriots coach Bill Belichick pouring liquid from a bottle labeled 'SEDATIVES' into the Rams' Gatorade, but the NFL referee crew fails to notice. Asked about this after the game, Commissioner Roger Goodell says, 'To be honest, I was watching Netflix.'
Several weeks after the Super Bowl, Patriots owner Robert Kraft is charged in connection with a police sting operation in Florida at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa (motto: 'Where Your 'Day' Lasts About 90 Seconds'). Kraft will ultimately avoid jail time after his lawyers convince a judge that he is in the line of succession for the governorship of Virginia.
At the 91st Academy Awards, the Oscar for best picture is awarded to 'Goodfellas,' which came out in 1990 but never should have lost to 'Dances With Wolves.'

march

… Robert Mueller finally delivers his report to Attorney General William Barr, who promises to release it to the public 'as soon as we have blacked out the sex parts.' The cable news networks prepare for the release by bringing in panels of distinguished legal authorities to declare that the report means exactly the opposite of whatever the distinguished legal panels on the enemy networks are declaring it means.
In other political developments, President Trump, faced with mounting hostility from congressional Democrats, spends several days vigorously attacking ... John McCain. For the record, McCain (A) was a Republican and (B) died in 2018. Nobody can say for certain whether the president (A) is playing some kind of four-dimensional political chess or (B) has the reasoning skills of a Chihuahua on meth.
The Iowa state legislature considers a bill that would fund construction of a border wall around the state to stop the influx of Democratic presidential hopefuls, now estimated at several dozen a day. 'It's a humanitarian crisis,' says one legislator, his voice rising in alarm. 'They're swarming all over the state, barging into pancake breakfasts. Many of them die within days from pancake bloat, but THEY JUST KEEP COMING.'
Abroad, 'Brexit' continues to be a matter of grave concern, and for good reason.
The higher education community is rocked by scandal when federal prosecutors charge 50 people, including test administrators, wealthy parents and college coaches, in connection with a widespread bribery and fraud scheme to get students admitted to some of the nation's most prestigious universities. In one particularly egregious case, Yale admitted Trevor Buncombe-Plotzner IV, who supposedly was recruited to play varsity badminton, despite the facts that (A) Yale does not have a varsity badminton team and (B) Trevor is a cat.
In an official statement, the Association of College Admissions Officers says: 'Bribing coaches to get unqualified applicants admitted is completely unacceptable. The correct way is to give a large sum of money directly to the college.'
In a controversial legal development, actor Jussie Smollett, who was indicted by a grand jury for allegedly faking a hate crime against himself, has all charges dropped by Chicago prosecutors following a review of the evidence by an NFL officiating crew.

april

… Attorney General Barr finally releases the Mueller report, which accomplishes two things:

l It finally settles, to everyone's satisfaction, all of the controversies surrounding the 2016 presidential election.

l It proves that oysters speak German and can play the trombone.
Just kidding! In fact the Mueller report does neither of these things, although it comes closer to the second accomplishment than the first. The pro-Trump people say the report proves there was no collusion; the anti-Trump people say it proves Trump obstructed justice, which means that it is, at last, IMPEACHMENT TIME, BABY. Both sides emit thousands of impassioned tweets, which go unread by the American public, which long ago moved on to 'Game of Thrones.'
In other political news, Joe Biden launches his estimated 17th presidential campaign, with the slogan: 'Let Uncle Joe Give You a Great Big Hug.' Biden immediately becomes the leader of the crowded Democratic field based on the fact that his name sounds vaguely familiar.
As millions of people around the world watch in shock and disbelief, the iconic Notre Dame cathedral in Paris is ravaged by flames after being struck, in what appears to be a deliberate act of provocation, by a North Korean missile.
Elsewhere abroad, 'Brexit' continues to be a vitally important thing.
In science news, some astronomers at a party, after several rounds of tequila shots, take a blurry snapshot of a flaming gas-stove burner and release it to the news media, claiming that it's the first-ever photograph of a black hole. The photo instantly becomes worldwide news, much to the delight of the astro-pranksters, who begin work on a plan to pass off a dental X-ray as the Loch Ness Monster.
In golf, Tiger Woods wins his fifth Masters tournament, catching and passing leader Francesco Molinari after two of Molinari's shots "" on the 12th hole and then again on the 15th "" hit NFL referee crews that have strayed onto the fairway.
In entertainment news, 'Avengers: Endgame' breaks box office records, proving that now, more than ever, people crave stories about time-traveling superheroes using magic stones to defeat a genocidal intergalactic warlord with no neck.

… Robert Mueller resigns as special counsel, saying that he plans to return to private life and 'whimper in the fetal position.' In his final statement, he clears up any lingering confusion about his investigation by noting that the Justice Department cannot charge the president with a federal crime, adding, 'not that I am, or am not, saying, or not saying, that the president did, or did not, do anything that was, or was not, illegal. Or, not.'
Congressional Democrats, firm in their belief that the American public wants nothing more than to continue refighting the 2016 election until the Earth crashes into the sun, take Mueller's statement as a call for IMPEACHMENT TIME, BABY.
For his part, Trump emits a tweet stating, quote: 'Russia, Russia, Russia! That's all you heard at the beginning of this Witch Hunt Hoax…And now Russia has disappeared because I had nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected.' This wording seems to suggest that the president thinks Russia helped him to get elected, so a short while later he clarifies his position by telling reporters, 'No, Russia did not help me get elected.' And thus the matter is finally laid to rest.
As far as we are aware, none of this has anything to do with 'Brexit.'
On the domestic political front, disgraced former New York Congresscreep Anthony Weiner is released from a halfway house and, in a sincere display of remorse, announces that he is running for president.
Just kidding! In fact Weiner is one of the estimated four Democrats not running for president. Among those entering the race is New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who, having solved all of his city's problems, announces that he is running under the campaign slogan 'This Slogan Is Currently Out of Order.' De Blasio heads for Iowa, where he quickly surges to 13,357th in the Des Moines Register/CNN poll, just behind swine dysentery.
In sports, the Kentucky Derby is won by Country House after the apparent winner, Maximum Security, is disqualified for trampling an NFL officiating crew on the backstretch.

june

… tensions in the Mideast, which have been escalating for over 3,000 years, escalate still further when Iran attacks two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, then shoots down a U.S. spy drone. In retaliation, President Trump orders a military strike against Iran, only to call it off at the last minute when he is advised that it could result in serious damage to a golf course.
In other presidential action, Trump travels to England, where, in his role as leader of the United States on an official visit to America's greatest ally at a critical time, he attacks ... Bette Midler. In a tweet emitted at 1:30 a.m. London time, the president describes Ms. Midler as a 'Washed up psycho.' Fox News confirms this.
Later in the month Trump becomes the first sitting U.S. president to set foot in North Korea, where he and Kim Jong Un engage in denuclearization talks, capped off with a ceremonial Prisoner Shoot.
This seems like a good place to mention 'Brexit.'
Meanwhile as the 2020 U.S. presidential race heats up, several hundred Democratic presidential contenders gather in Miami for the first major debates. The front-runner is Joe Biden, but he suffers a setback when Sen. Kamala Harris, in what is clearly a planned attack, points out that Biden is wearing his pants backward. Biden's staff hastily releases a statement explaining that the former vice president 'thought it was Friday.' Also getting a lot of attention is Marianne Williamson, who qualifies for the debates based on the number of campaign donations she received from other dimensions.
For his part, President Trump launches his 2020 reelection bid with a rally in Orlando attended by 246 million people, as confirmed by Fox News.
In entertainment news, James Holzhauer's record-breaking victory streak on 'Jeopardy!' finally comes to an end when, in the Final Jeopardy round, he is flagged for a face mask violation by an NFL officiating crew.
San Francisco, always on the forefront, becomes the first U.S. city to ban exhaling, which according to scientists is a leading cause of carbon dioxide. Meanwhile the city of Riviera Beach, Fla., pays nearly $600,000 in bitcoin to hackers who paralyzed the city's computer system by attacking it with 'ransomware,' which is sort of like a Windows update except that at least there's somebody who knows how to fix it.
Speaking of Internet menaces, in …
july

… President Trump, having dealt with the existential threat to the nation that is Bette Midler, turns his attention to four Democratic first-term members of Congress known as 'The Squad,' tweeting that if they hate America so much they should 'go back' to where they come from. Critics note that three of the four were born in the very same nation as Trump, not to mention the fact that the 'go back' thing is an old racist taunt, leaving the president with no decent course of action but to issue an apology. So of course that is not what he does. What he does is tweet additional criticisms of The Squad, along with the assertion that 'I don't have a Racist bone in my body!' (The exclamation mark proves it's true!)
The president also finds time in his busy July schedule to issue tweets attacking "" among other targets "" Baltimore, the Federal Reserve, the mayor of San Juan, CNN, the mayor of London, Paul Ryan, Fox News (!) and Sweden, but if we're going to go into detail on every single one of the president's Twitter beefs we will never get through this year. Suffice it to say that the Resistance is so frantically busy refuting Trump tweets "" this being the activity that consumes 99.9 percent of the Resistance's time and mental energy "" that toward the end of the month prominent Democrats find themselves reflexively defending the integrity and moral righteousness of Al Sharpton.
In other political news, an exhausted-looking Robert Mueller makes his 237th appearance before the House Kabuki Theater Committee, and the entire nation tunes in, except for those parts of the nation located outside of Washington, D.C. Mueller says little that is new, generally limiting his answers to 'yes,' 'no' and, when an aide pokes him awake, 'ouch.' Under questioning, Mueller seems surprisingly unfamiliar with his own team's report, at one point stating, in response to a question, that he had never heard of any 'Vladimir Putin.'
Trump declares that the hearing proves the whole investigation was a WITCH HUNT! Congressional Democrats say it proves that it is IMPEACHMENT TIME, BABY. Bears continue to poop in the woods.
In the second round of Democratic debates, front-runner Joe Biden is still the main target of the other candidates, but he does a better job of defending himself, delivering several well-crafted retorts written in Sharpie on his forearms.
In federal action, White House and congressional negotiators set side their mutual loathing long enough to agree on a bipartisan budget deal that will enable the government to continue spending insane amounts of money that it does not have. Thus the pesky problem of uncontrolled federal spending is disposed of until after the 2020 election, freeing our leaders to focus on more pressing issues, and of course tweet about them.
Abroad, a person named 'Boris,' who apparently styles his hair with a commercial leaf blower, becomes prime minister of England, a development that very likely could have something to do with 'Brexit.'
On the escalating Middle East tension front, the United States says it shot down an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz. In response, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations claims he will produce documentation proving that 'Strait of Hormuz' can be rearranged to spell 'Him Fart Zoo Rust.'
In sports, the superb U.S. women's national soccer team, following years of hard work and sacrifice, wins its fourth World Cup and a first prize of $4 million, or about $200,000 per player. Later in the month, a 16-year-old high school student named Kyle Giersdorf wins a Fortnite video-game tournament. His prize "" really "" is $3 million. 'I'm so happy,' says Kyle. 'Everything I've done in the grind has all paid off and it's just insane.'
It is, Kyle. It really is.
The news turns grim in …
august

… when the nation is shocked by two horrific mass shootings, which spur a Serious National Conversation about gun violence, in which sincere and committed individuals on both sides "" at long last "" openly and honestly talk to people on their own side about how stupid and evil everybody on the other side is. This goes on for several days, after which the shootings drift out of the news until it's time for the next Serious National Conversation.
Conspiracy theories swirl in the wake of the death of millionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who allegedly committed suicide in a New York City federal prison cell despite supposedly being under the close supervision of an NFL officiating crew.
In financial news, the Dow Jones industrial average flits up and down like a butterfly on meth as investors try to figure out what President Trump's mood is at any given minute regarding the trade war with China, which is caused by China unfairly forcing U.S. consumers to buy low-cost Chinese-made electronics instead of traditional American brands such as Philco. The president's main strategy in fighting this war is to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, which means U.S. consumers have to pay more for them. Take THAT, China!
Another bee buzzing around in the presidential bonnet during August is Greenland, which Trump decides the United States should try to purchase, since it has a strategic location and is potentially the source of more than 70 percent of the world's supply of frostbite. It turns out, however, that Greenland belongs to Denmark, which for some reason wants to keep it. 'We're not for sale,' states Greenland's minister of education, culture, church and foreign affairs, whose name "" we are not making this up "" is Ane Lone Bagger.
It is not immediately clear where Ane Lone Bagger stands on 'Brexit.'
Meanwhile the American Midwest faces an unprecedented humanitarian crisis as Nebraska, Wisconsin and Minnesota struggle to absorb waves of Iowans fleeing the worsening disaster in their home state, which is overrun with Democratic presidential contenders demonstrating their likability by eating fried things on sticks. Joe Biden remains the front-runner in Iowa despite the fact that, to judge from his remarks at campaign events, he believes he is in Belgium.
In other August news, Popeyes introduces a chicken sandwich to compete with Chick-fil-A's chicken sandwich. Also there are massive pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and the Amazon rainforest is burning, but the Battle of the Chicken Sandwiches definitely generates more excitement.
Speaking of excitement …
september

… begins with President Trump facing a major crisis involving the crucial issue of whether Alabama was, or was not, ever actually threatened by Hurricane Dorian. The crisis erupts on Sept. 1, when, with Dorian moving toward the U.S. mainland, the president tweets that Alabama is among the states that will 'most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.' Minutes later the National Weather Service in Birmingham responds with a statement that 'Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian.'
At this point the president acknowledges that he made a minor mistake, thus laying the issue to rest and freeing everyone to focus on more important matters.

Ha-ha! That would never happen. Donald Trump did not get where he is by allowing himself to be corrected about the weather by any so-called 'National Weather Service.' The president mounts an intensive, multi-day, multi-tweet offensive on the Alabama issue, highlighted by an Oval Office meeting with reporters during which he displays a week-old National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration map proving conclusively that Alabama was in fact threatened by a black line that was obviously added to the map by an inept amateur with a Sharpie.
The crisis continues for several more days, with the president refusing to back down or drop the subject, very much the way Winston Churchill, in the darkest hours of World War II, stood firm when England, alone, faced the menacing forces of the National Weather Service.
Speaking of dire threats: CNN's special seven-hour 'town hall' broadcast on the global climate crisis attracts a nationwide audience estimated at nearly 30 viewers, counting household pets. Ten Democratic presidential candidates present their plans for saving the planet, which include strictly regulating or banning fossil fuels, nuclear power, red meat, plastic straws, fracking, white meat, cars, lightbulbs, barbecues, capitalism, farting, grayish meat, babies and airplane flights that are not transporting Democratic presidential candidates. The highlight of the night comes when Joe Biden develops a weird red eyeball as a result of being hit by a tranquilizer dart fired by his staff to prevent him from suddenly hugging a CNN moderator. This debate is followed by another debate later in the month. Or maybe it was the same debate, and we all fell asleep for a while in the middle. There is no way to tell.
Bill de Blasio drops out of the Democratic presidential race, bitterly disappointing the residents of New York when they learn that Bill plans to resume mayoring them.
In international news (we are counting Canada as a foreign country) Canadian Premier Justin Trudeau is embarrassed by the publication of yet another photograph "" this is the third time "" of him wearing blackface. The good news for Justin is that this moves him up to fourth in the line of succession for the governorship of Virginia.
Meanwhile in Great Britain, 'Brexit' continues to cause everybody over there to be quite agitated, for British people.

As September draws to a close, President Trump finds himself facing what could prove to be his biggest single crisis of the entire month when a whistleblower accuses him of improperly pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to investigate Joe Biden and Joe's son Hunter's connections with a Ukrainian energy company, which at one point was paying Hunter $50,000 a month, apparently for his expertise in the field of receiving large sums of money.
In a surprise move, Trump orders the release of a rough transcript of the call, which proves conclusively whatever you want it to prove depending on whether you are on Side A or Side B. Congressional Democrats declare that it is a Smoking Gun, which means that, at last, it is IMPEACHMENT TIME, BABY, AND THIS TIME WE REALLY MEAN IT. Trump declares that this is just another WITCH HUNT and emits an unusually high volume of tweets in which he sounds increasingly like a derelict arguing with himself in an alley next to a convenience store, but not as coherent.
While all this is happening the U.S. budget deficit approaches $1 trillion, but everybody in Washington is way too excited about the Impeachment Drama to even think about it.
The excitement continues in …
october

... when Washington whips itself into a frenzy the likes of which it experiences only once every two or three weeks as a consensus begins to develop among the courageous Resisters of the Resistance that it really is DEFINITELY ALMOST NEARLY IMPEACHMENT TIME AND WE ARE REALLY NOT FOOLING AROUND ANYMORE. The Democrats, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, a man who "" this is merely an observation, not a criticism "" would not look out of place popping up from a prairie-dog hole, accuse Trump of breaking the law in the Ukraine phone call, while Trump defenders insist that
technically 
there was no quid pro quo, in the same sense that, in 'The Godfather,' the severed horse's head in the movie producer's bed was
technically 
not a threat.

The president's defense strategy is to tweet several times per hour, sometimes with most of the words correctly spelled, that the call was PERFECT and everyone should READ THE TRANSCRIPT! Apparently he is unaware that everyone already did. Along the way the president reaches a historic milestone, sending out his 11,000th tweet as president, eclipsing the record held by Grover Cleveland.
For the Democrats, there is good news and bad news. The good news is that Trump's poll numbers are down. The bad news is that the Democrats are ... the Democrats. Their front-runner, Joe Biden, continues to struggle on the campaign trail, as exemplified by an appearance at a 7-Eleven store in Waterloo, Iowa, during which he addresses the Slurpee machine as 'your excellency.'
Poised to eclipse Biden is Elizabeth Warren (campaign slogan: 'She Is MUCH Smarter Than You') with her Medicare-for-all plan, which she says will cost $20.5 trillion, with the '.5' proving that she has this thing figured out right down to the penny. Warren says her plan will not raise taxes on the middle class because all the money will come from greedy corporations, greedy billionaires, greedy gold-pooping unicorns and various cost efficiencies, which of course is what the federal government is famous for.
In foreign affairs, Trump surprises everybody, possibly including himself, by suddenly pulling U.S. troops out of Syria, thus throwing the region into even more turmoil than usual, which is a lot of turmoil. During the confusion, U.S. forces conduct a daring raid that results in the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, thus removing him from the line of succession for the governorship of Virginia. And of course no discussion of foreign affairs would be complete without some mention of 'Brexit.'
Meanwhile California, plagued by out-of-control wildfires, widespread power blackouts, spiraling housing costs, decaying infrastructure and a worsening homelessness epidemic, becomes the first state to enact a law banning the sale of fur products.

… it is finally IMPEACHMENT TIME FOR REAL, ALMOST, as the House Committee on Endless Squabbling holds a classic congressional hearingpalooza featuring Bombshell Testimony, Gaveling, Points of Order, Yielding of Time, False Civility, Really Long Questions That Are Not Actually Questions and all the other elements that would make for riveting drama if everybody on the planet didn't already know the outcome, specifically that the Democrats would conclude that the president committed impeachable offenses, and the Republicans would conclude that he didn't. When it's all over, the public remains divided exactly as it was between the people who loathe Trump and the people who loathe the people who loathe Trump. Meanwhile bears continue to etc.
There is one positive impeachment-related development, which occurs when Rep. Eric Swalwell, appearing on MSNBC, makes the following statement: 'So far the evidence is uncontradicted that the president used taxpayer dollars to help him cheat [GIANT FART S
OUND] an election.' This results in several days of spirited debate on Twitter concerning the issue of whether Swalwell cut the cheese (he denies it) with people of all political persuasions weighing in on #fartgate in the closest thing we have had to a genuinely open-minded national conversation in years.

Conan, a Belgian Malinois who was injured in the Delta Force raid that resulted in the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is invited to the White House, where President Trump, in recognition of the heroic dog's service to the nation, appoints him secretary of the Navy.

... when House Democrats decide that IT REALLY, REALLY IS IMPEACHMENT TIME SERIOUSLY, PEOPLE, THIS IS NOT A DRILL. This sets the stage for a historic trial in the Senate, after which (spoiler alert!) the Democrats will vote to convict and the Republicans will vote to acquit and we will be back to exactly where we started with no minds changed and Sides A and B hating each other more than ever.

So this is a very exciting time in Washington, although to the rest of the nation, which is getting into holiday mode, the heated rhetoric emanating from the capital is an unwelcome annoyance, like the shouting of the couple in the next-door apartment who never seem to stop arguing ('WHAT ABOUT THE JULY 25TH PHONE CALL?' 'OH YEAH? WHAT ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN?' 'OH YEAH? WHAT ABOUT ...'). Each morning the nation wakes up, hears the angry noise coming through the walls, then plugs a pair of Apple AirPods into its national ears and cranks up Johnny Mathis singing 'Winter Wonderland.'
In other political news, Joe Biden, seeking to add some 'zing' to his presidential campaign, tours Iowa in a bus sporting, in big letters, his new slogan: 'No Malarkey!' ('Malarkey' is an ancient Gaelic word meaning 'clue.') This slogan was selected after being tested on a focus group of voters, half of whom were senior citizens and the other half of whom were dead. The runner-up slogans were 'You're Darned Tooting He Can Cut the Mustard!' and 'Stay Off His Lawn!'
Kamala Harris drops out of the race, reducing the number of leading Democratic contenders to 58, an estimated one-third of whom are billionaires. Meanwhile Hillary Clinton continues to hint that she may run again at the urging of many highly respected voices that only she can hear. In Iowa voter polling, the front-runner remains Pete 'Pete' Buttigieg, followed closely by a surging Baby Yoda.
In foreign affairs, President Trump attends a meeting of NATO leaders in London, where, using his unique diplomatic skills, he is able to unite America's crucial European allies in the belief that he is a buffoon.
And let's not forget about 'Brexit.'
In entertainment news, millions of Netflix users are watching Martin Scorsese's film 'The Irishman,' a sweeping epic that begins in the 1950s and ends at some point after you fall asleep on the sofa, because the running time is longer than veterinary school. Nobody, including Scorsese, has ever actually made it to the end of 'The Irishman,' which takes place in the distant future and is rumored to feature an intergalactic battle between alien space Teamsters.
In other TV-related news, people are outraged about a Peloton ad, because in this day and age people need things to be outraged about.
Finally, mercifully, this highly eventful year draws to a close. As New Year's Eve approaches, the nation pauses to look back on 2019 and throw up a little bit in its national mouth. But then the nation looks forward to 2020, and it feels faint stirrings of hope in its national heart. Because America has been bitterly divided before. There was the Civil War, for example, and that time we could not agree on the color of that dress on the Internet. If we got through those troubles, we can get through the current ones. Because in the end, despite our political differences, we're all Americans, and we care about each other and want the best possible future for everyone. Right?
Nah.
But happy new year anyway.

Senators resist House members' push to be part of Trump's defense
A turf war over who should defend President Trump in a Senate impeachment trial is raging behind the scenes in Congress, as House Republicans push to join Trump's legal team "" an idea that piques the president's interest "" over the objections of Senate Republicans. 
House GOP leaders in recent weeks have advocated for Trump's most aggressive defenders "" Republican Reps. Jim Jordan (Ohio), John Ratcliffe (Tex.) and Douglas A. Collins (Ga.) "" to cross the Rotunda and help White House counsel Pat A. Cipollone rebut the two charges that the president abused his power and obstructed Congress. 
Trump, partial to bare-knuckles tactics and top-rated TV performances, loves the idea, according to four administration and congressional officials familiar with his thinking who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly. 
Jordan, for example, is a mainstay champion of Trump's on Fox News, where the president once mused that 'he's a warrior for me!'
But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and his fellow GOP senators have expressed concerns to Trump that a House-led defense could offend moderates, including Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). Trump, they argue, has already won the backing of the GOP base, so he and his team need to focus on ensuring Republican unity on an acquittal. 
McConnell, who discussed the trial with the president at the White House on Wednesday, has been advising Trump and his legal team not to think of the trial as a 'made-for-TV-type House setting,' said one individual familiar with the leader's thinking, 'but rather one where ultimately your audience is senators in the middle on both sides, who are actually listening to the arguments here.' 
The individual, like others, was not authorized to speak publicly.
Others in the GOP have publicly suggested House Republicans may lack the right temperament to be persuasive for a Senate constituency that expects a no-nonsense trial.
'One thing I'm not eager to do is re-create the circuslike atmosphere of the House "" that's not what we're going to do here, if we can avoid it,' said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), a McConnell ally. 'So I think it seems obvious to me that if the president picks a team that does not include House members, that we'd be more likely to have the dignified process that the Constitution calls for.'
Senior administration and House GOP officials indicated Wednesday that no final decision had been made on whether House Republicans would be part of the defense team. 
'There are a lot of rabbits running around claiming to be the very best bunny, but the president hasn't yet decided which set of fuzzy tails he'll use,' said one official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
The debate highlights the inherent divide between Trump and his instinctive scorched-earth approach and McConnell's insistence on a strategy geared toward holding his GOP conference together as well as keeping his majority in November's elections. 
While Trump's gut reaction has been to push for the most aggressive defense possible, playing to his base, McConnell is operating with a narrow margin of 53 Republicans, several up for reelection in 2020 in swing or Democratic-leaning states.
In recent weeks, the president has floated several ideas for his impeachment trial only to see them rebuffed by McConnell, whom the president has repeatedly deferred to on impeachment. 
When Trump wanted Senate Republicans to dismiss the charges against him immediately without a trial, McConnell explained to him that was not possible. When Trump then proposed using the trial to ensure that his 2020 rival Joe Biden and the former vice president's son, Hunter, were called as witnesses, it was McConnell who persuaded him to back a no-witnesses plan. 
More recently, McConnell and several Senate Republicans have pushed back on the idea of House Republicans on the defense team. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) told Trump that senators "" who typically abhor being dictated to by House members "" will not take kindly to congressmen arguing the president's case. 
'It hasn't been decided, but he's listening to senators,' said one person familiar with Graham's conversations with Trump.
All parties agree that Cipollone will take the lead defending the president, alongside his deputies, Pat Philbin and Mike Purpura. Jay Sekulow, Trump's personal attorney who represented him during the special counsel's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, will also weigh in.
But some House Republicans, such as Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) and top Trump ally Rep. Mark Meadows (N.C.), have argued that Cipollone needs assistance from House members who are deeply familiar with the Democrats' case against Trump. Jordan and Ratcliffe, for example, both sat through hours of closed-door depositions with witnesses testifying about Ukraine; Collins led the GOP effort in the House Judiciary Committee opposing the articles of impeachment.
All three men also have legal backgrounds and reputations for being aggressive questioners. Jordan, the ranking Republican on the House Oversight and Reform Committee, offered many of the key talking points rebutting Democratic accusations, some which Trump himself touted on Twitter. Ratcliffe, whom Trump briefly nominated to become director of national intelligence last year, was a former U.S. attorney in Texas. 
He withdrew from consideration amid questions about his qualifications and whether he had embellished his résumé.
'Regardless of what other team he has, they should be in there helping because they have so much information,' McCarthy said. Added Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), a close ally of Jordan: 'He has probably the most in-depth knowledge of any member of the entire proceedings.'
Perhaps most important to Trump is the three House members' flair for the dramatic, which the president often says makes for good TV. The Senate trial will be broadcast on national television, and some House Republicans have privately suggested that Cipollone's approach may be too bookish.
Indeed, those who know Cipollone say he is quiet and careful, often shunning the spotlight. A former U.S. Appeals Court clerk who went on to be an assistant to the attorney general before joining private practice, he is not an ebullient showman and, while approachable, can seem rigid at times. 
Senate Republicans argue that doesn't matter "" and in fact, it may be preferred. In interviews with half-dozen senators Tuesday, all praised Cipollone and said he will be a solid defender of Trump "" and may even help convince Democrats like Sen. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) to vote to acquit. 
'It's a different calculus than it would be for a public hearing that is ultimately more about public consumption than it is about the members themselves,' said the individual familiar with McConnell's thinking. 'The concern you would have in venturing down some of those more aggressive roads is that you lose the people who ultimately you're going to need most.'
Other Republicans expressed reservations about House members joining the team, even one who was a congressman for six years. 
Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) said his former colleagues 'are obviously some talented guys,' but Trump needs 'the best defense team he can put together "" and not so much a PR team.'
'I just think the House process is very different than the Senate process "" the responsibilities and authorities are very different,' he said. 'In the House, the audience was the country and the political base of the parties. In the Senate . . . the responsibility of the 100 senators is pretty sobering, and I think the defense would do well to make their case to the 100 jurors.'

GOP hurls corruption claims at Democrat seen as top threat to reelection

DES MOINES "" With President Trump holding a campaign rally here Thursday ahead of the Iowa caucuses, his allies had coalesced around an effort to damage former vice president Joe Biden's prospects in the state that begins the 2020 presidential nominating contests. 
Republican lawmakers have used the spotlight of Trump's impeachment trial to accuse Biden of corruption, a U.S. senator from Florida is running television ads against Biden in Iowa, and several Trump campaign surrogates have ramped up their attacks against the former vice president as they prepare to fan out across the state in support of Trump's reelection bid. 
'There is a mountain of evidence to suggest the Bidens' behavior was harmful to the United States,' Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said Wednesday from the U.S. Capitol, where several GOP lawmakers used the impeachment trial's question-and-answer session to insinuate wrongdoing by Biden.
Trump's campaign is dispatching Vice President Pence and more than 80 other surrogates to Iowa ahead of Monday's caucus votes. The group includes several Republicans who have launched the most pointed attacks against Biden and his son Hunter during the impeachment process.
Trump's rally in Des Moines came on the eve of a critical Senate vote over whether his impeachment trial would include witnesses. The president has used his recent rallies to criticize several of his Democratic rivals, with Biden receiving the lion's share of the attacks.
Biden responded Thursday by drawing a sharp contrast with Trump in a speech and with a new television ad, both aimed at highlighting differences in character between the two men and previewing a potential general-election matchup.
'In Joe Biden's America, the president's tax returns will not be a secret,' Biden told a standing-room-only crowd at an elementary school in Waukee, Iowa, his first of three stops for the day. 'Political self-interest will not be confused with national interest. And no one, not even the president of the United States, will be above the law.' 
'Character is on the ballot. America's character,' Biden's prepared remarks said. 'I do not believe we're the dark, angry nation we see in Donald Trump's tweets.'
On Thursday, Trump mocked several of his Democratic rivals during a speech that stretched longer than an hour, declaring Biden's campaign 'over.'
'Joe had a crowd so small the other day that they set up a round table,' Trump said.
Earlier in the rally, he decried the impeachment process as a 'deranged, witch-hunt hoax' driven by partisan 'rage.'
After former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, a member of Trump's impeachment defense team, spent 30 minutes Monday echoing the president's attacks on Biden from the Senate floor, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) bluntly assessed the political impact the broadside could have on the first-in-the-nation caucuses.
'Iowa caucuses, folks, Iowa caucuses are this next Monday evening,' Ernst told reporters on Monday. 'And I'm really interested to see how this discussion today informs and influences the Iowa caucus voters, those Democratic caucus-goers. Will they be supporting Vice President Biden at this point? Not certain about that.'
Biden, who has denied any wrongdoing, has responded by arguing that Republicans' focus on him signals their fear that he is the strongest candidate to defeat Trump in November.
'Joni Ernst just spilled the beans,' Biden wrote on Twitter. 'She and Donald Trump are scared to death I'll be the nominee. On February 3rd, let's make their day.'
Biden's campaign has also pushed back against the onslaught, criticizing Republican threats to call Biden and his son as witnesses in Trump's impeachment trial as partisan attempts to interfere in the 2020 race.
Trump stands accused of withholding military aid and a critical White House meeting from Ukraine to pressure the Eastern European nation to announce investigations into the Bidens. In her presentation at Trump's trial, Bondi accused Biden of corruptly pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor in 2015 while his son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company.
'Trump desperately wants to impact the outcome of the Democratic primary, dropping into Iowa a few days before the caucus to spread a message of division, discord, and hate,' Biden's campaign said in a statement previewing Thursday's speech. 'Trump has been trying to prevent Biden from getting the nomination since the moment the VP got into the race, getting himself impeached by the House and tried in the Senate in the process.'
Biden's campaign also released the new ad, which runs for one minute and is titled 'Character.' It criticizes Trump's behavior in the White House while describing Biden as a steady leader. 'It's said, 'In here is where your character is revealed,' ' the ad says, flashing an image of the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. 'But it's in life where your character is formed.'
The ad ran Thursday in Iowa's top five media markets, Biden's campaign said.
Although Biden events can resemble classroom lectures on electoral math, the former vice president is wrapping up his Iowa bid by talking less about policy and more about character. Trump, he said Thursday, has led a 'culture of cruelty' from the White House. 
'This is a president who laughs at, insults and demeans other people. He pits us against one another. He traffics in the ugliest lies,' Biden said in Waukee.
Several polls have shown Biden leading Trump nationally and in key swing states in a hypothetical general-election matchup.
Polling in Iowa shows a close race in the Democratic caucuses, with Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg all vying for a victory on Monday.
Trump does not face serious competition in the Republican caucuses, which also take place Monday. 
His campaign's decision to send more than 80 surrogates into the state is aimed at engaging Trump supporters rather than affecting the outcome of the close Democratic race, said Kayleigh McEnany, a Trump campaign spokeswoman. 
'We're not there to shape the Democrat outcome,' she said. 'We're there to showcase the support for the president.'
Still, many of the surrogates will inevitably highlight the 'contrast' between Trump and some of the leading Democrats, she said. 
During a 'Women for Trump' event this month in Des Moines, McEnany and Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law, criticized Biden and Sanders as too liberal for the country.
Lara Trump is listed as one of the dozens of surrogates the Trump campaign plans to send to various caucus sites to meet with supporters and engage with local media in Iowa. Others include Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R), acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and several Cabinet secretaries.
Several Republican members of Congress who have been leading defenders of Trump against impeachment will also participate. Among them will be Reps. Jim Jordan (Ohio), Mark Meadows (N.C.), Matt Gaetz (Fla.) and Elise Stefanik (N.Y.)
'Our Caucus Day operation is just a preview of what is to come,' Brad Parscale, Trump's campaign manager, said in a statement this week. 'This will be the strongest, best funded, and most organized presidential campaign in history. We are putting the Democrats on notice "" good luck trying to keep up with this formidable reelection machine.'
Some non-surrogates are also seeking to influence the Iowa race. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) began running television ads this week in Iowa accusing Biden of 'corruption.'
The concerted attacks on Biden could end up 'rebounding against' Trump and his allies, said Jim Messina, who was campaign manager for President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection bid.
'Donald Trump's focusing on Joe Biden has helped Joe Biden during this primary process,' he said. 'Democrats understand that Trump is worried about Biden. And it helps Biden's electability argument.'

DES MOINES "" Four candidates were stuck in Washington, embroiled in the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump. Another, Joe Biden, delivered a speech that mentioned Trump an average of once every 17 seconds. Pete Buttigieg traveled to counties Trump won in 2016, trying to showcase his ability to win over the president's supporters.
And then, in the early evening, Trump himself arrived for a rally on the campus of Drake University here.
At a pivotal, potentially energizing moment for Democrats, preparing for the first votes of their long-awaited effort to unseat Trump, the presidential candidates found themselves Thursday reacting to his massive shadow rather than setting their own course. The scrambling reflected a deeper truth just four days before the Iowa caucuses: After four years of turmoil and anger, Democrats have yet to settle on the best path for defeating a president most of them consider the most damaging in memory.
To make matters worse, the contenders faced the prospect that the Senate vote on removing Trump could unfold at roughly the same time Monday night as Iowa caucus-goers begin assembling at their local precincts. And Trump will take center stage again Tuesday as he delivers the State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress, while Democrats absorb the caucus results and head to New Hampshire.
That's making this a highly unusual lead-up to the Iowa caucuses. With four candidates detained by the trial, several are relying heavily on allies or surrogates "" and in the case of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), also her dog "" to fill in on the campaign trail. Downtown Des Moines, normally a hive of activity in the days before the caucuses, was notably quiet Thursday.
With Trump on everyone's mind, Biden's speech, delivered at an elementary school in Waukee, was a blunt attempt to convey the contrast between Trump's tenure and the dignified presidency Biden hopes to embody. It marked a return to an earlier strategy of looking beyond the primary fight to the general election.
During his talk, lasting just under 19 minutes, Biden referred to Trump 64 times while ignoring his Democratic rivals. He criticized the president for withholding his tax returns, dismissing climate change, trying to abolish President Barack Obama's health-care law and failing to address gun violence. 
'I do not believe we're the dark, angry nation that Donald Trump sees in his tweets in the middle of the night,' Biden said. 'I look at Donald Trump and what he stands for, how he behaves, and what he's done. My response is always the same. America is so much better than this. So much better.'
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), after weeks of attacking Biden as insufficiently supportive of Social Security, turned his own fire on the president with a new television ad: 'Donald Trump wants to cut Social Security. We're not going to let that happen.' 
Warren, like Sanders, argues that the best way to take on Trump is to promote a far-reaching liberal agenda, making a case in the final days before Iowa that voters should not be 'afraid' to embrace big change. 
But from Washington, Warren taped an appearance with WHO-TV in Des Moines that focused more on the impeachment trial than that campaign message. 'We need to have a fair trial, and that means witnesses and documents,' Warren said, homing in on a topic that few Iowans have shown interest in discussing. 
She tried to contrast her plans to wrest power from special interests with Trump's governing style and willingness to reward supporters with influential positions.
'The way we're going to beat Donald Trump is to draw that distinction,' Warren said in the interview. 'I have the biggest corruption plan since Watergate and have been talking about this since the first day I got in the campaign.'
Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., stressed his role as a Washington outsider "" his own effort to distance himself from Trump as well as his Democratic rivals. In a significant shift Thursday, Buttigieg attacked Biden and Sanders by name, saying they represent political brands that Democrats must leave behind. 
'I hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new,' Buttigieg said during a morning stop in Decorah, Iowa. 'But history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump, who is new in kind.'
Then he rebutted Sanders, whose name his campaign has used repeatedly in fundraising emails even as the candidate himself had avoided criticizing him by name until Thursday.
'I hear Senator Sanders calling for a kind of politics that says you got to go all the way here and nothing else counts. . . . We've got to galvanize, not polarize, that American majority so that we can win.'
Throughout the campaign, and more noticeably during his Iowa push in the past month, Buttigieg has avoided criticizing his opponents by name, even as they sometimes slid into high-profile squabbles around him. But Thursday, wearing a full suit instead of a shirt and tie, he made explicit references to his opponents instead of implications, and he acknowledged that time was running out to make his case.
Biden shot back later in the day, poking at the low vote totals required for Buttigieg to win a mayor's race in South Bend. 'Some things are self-evident when it comes to this,' Biden said, when asked at a Dairy Queen about his ability to do well in the caucuses. 'I've got more than 8,600 votes in my life.'
But the day also presented a jarring visual representation of the Democrats' challenge. Trump drew a passionate, raucous crowd of supporters that none of the candidates running against him has been able to match. It also yielded a foretaste of the months to come, when Democrats will have to vie for attention with a president who has proved uniquely adept at making himself the center of public attention and drama.

If Sanders and Warren stress the need for a powerful contrasting agenda, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), like Biden and Buttigieg, touts her ability to win over Trump voters.
'We really leaned into the electability argument because Amy's been so effective in doing well in blue, purple and red counties in Minnesota,' her campaign manager, Justin Buoen, said at a breakfast hosted by Bloomberg News. 
'That's why we've begun to pick up at the end, because that is what is on their mind: Who can actually deliver in November?' Buoen said. 
He stressed that Klobuchar has focused more than her rivals on the 31 Iowa counties that voted for Obama in 2012 and switched to Trump in the last election. 'Amy is willing to go in and face the questions in their community and learn about their community and talk to these voters where they are,' he said. 
Biden and his surrogates have been even more explicit, encouraging Iowans to become poll-readers and pundits and consider how battleground-state voters might act in the fall. In many of those states, Biden leads Trump in head-to-head polling. 
Biden said in his speech Thursday that he successfully campaigned on behalf of other Democrats across the nation in the last midterm elections.
'In 2018, I went to 24 states for 65 candidates,' he said. 'I took on Trump all over the country and beat him. In fact, we beat him like a drum "" and in the process took back the majority in the House. We should remember that this year.'
His own campaign has taken on a new sense of urgency in the closing days before Iowa, where Sanders leads with 23.8-percent support, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls. Biden is in second place with 20.2-percent, but time is running out to reach voters. 
Before Biden spoke at an event Wednesday night, a staffer warned his supporters that there were only about 100 hours before the first presidential votes are cast since 2016.

First, the smirk. 
Mitch McConnell's smirk is a frown by another name. The corners of his mouth either remain flat enough to level a picture frame, or plunge downward, as if unwilling to do battle with the laws of gravity. All signs of satisfaction lie within his squinting, glinting eyes.
Though its exact meaning is open for interpretation "" a sign of self-assurance? a mask of self-doubt? an attempt to trigger his detractors? "" the Senate majority leader, famously a man of few words, lets his smirk do much of his talking. Deciding not to confirm President Barack Obama's Supreme Court pick in an election year, but saying he'd do so for President Trump? Smirk. Trying to hold an impeachment trial in the dead of night? Smirk.
It's a subtle look, and one difficult to capture. In the many political cartoons drawn over the years, artists tend to focus on the jowls, the sunken eyes, or the thinness "" rather than the trajectory "" of his lips. There have been more than 650 of these comics, a fact known to McConnell and his staff because he keeps them all. 
Every illustration of him bathing in a tub full of money, or making it rain dollar bills on a Senate candidate who's gyrating in a G-string; of him as an out-of-breath tortoise who 'won the race' to become President Trump's 'greatest enabler,' or sitting at a Senate desk behind the nameplate 'Moscow Mitch.' 
Some he hangs gleefully from the walls of his Senate office for gawking visitors. The rest, which have been flowing in at a record pace in recent years, he keeps in an archive in Louisville. McConnell, who declined an interview request for this article, has discussed turning them into a coffee-table book and scoffed when one of his staffers suggested they might have to be censored.
'There were a ton during the Obama administration, and as you can imagine, in the age of Trump there have been a lot of insane ones,' McConnell's spokeswoman Stephanie Penn said on a tour of his office, just hours before the Senate's impeachment trial of Trump. 'But he has a good sense of humor about it. Better to have people talking about you and making fun of you than not talking about you at all.' 
Such is the McConnell mantra: do what it takes to rise to power, and enjoy the criticism.
Being a man unbothered has served the 77-year-old McConnell well over the years. Immune to cries of hypocrisy, McConnell has changed stances on any number of issues since reaching public office, including his thoughts about Trump. 
'I don't think it's any secret that he wasn't early on the Trump bandwagon,' said Janet Mullins Grissom, McConnell's former chief of staff and campaign manager. 
But on that and much else, he is, as Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), one of McConnell's confidants in the Senate, puts it: 'the ultimate pragmatist.'
It's become a common theme in Washington to discuss what an odd partnership McConnell has forged with Trump. They do have their differences: McConnell likes to fade into the background of a room while the president demands to be the center of attention; McConnell is the consummate lever-puller, while Trump is more of a button-pusher. McConnell worked with his staff in secret to outline rules for an impeachment trial that would favor Trump, while the president sent out a record number of tweets calling the process a 'sham.'
And yet, McConnell has done more for Trump than perhaps any other Republican. He helped him in 2016 by blocking the nomination of Merrick Garland and allowing Trump to dangle the Supreme Court as bait to wary Republicans. His Senate has given Trump a win to run on in 2020 by confirming, by his office's count, 187 judges to the federal bench. This week, he willfully took on the role as the president's most important defender against impeachment-hungry Democrats "" working hand-in-glove with the White House to create a trial with no guarantee of witnesses, after having already admitted to having no intention of being a 'impartial juror.' 
Perhaps the answer for why is simple. In at least one way, Trump and McConnell, two politicians with shifting ideological cores, really aren't all that different: their unyielding desire to win.
'Mitch has been as focused as anyone I've ever known on . . . his political power,' said Rep. John Yarmuth, his fellow Kentuckian, who, before becoming a Democrat got to know McConnell working alongside him on a Republican Senate campaign in 1968. 'He gets up every day since [he was] 5 years old, and the first thing he thinks about is 'What can I do to enhance my political power?' '




The first time he dealt with a president barreling toward impeachment, McConnell felt the need to say something about it. 
It was the spring of 1973, and McConnell was the young and "" don't cancel your subscription "" almost-handsome new chairman of the city-county Republican executive committee in Louisville, his hometown. From the time he was a boy, McConnell had designs on rising up in the party, perhaps one of the only teenagers in Kentucky who daydreamed about becoming majority leader in the U.S. Senate. (He willed his way into student council politics in high school despite, as he told his mother at the time, not 'having even one friend.')
As a 31-year-old, McConnell was a moderate: in favor of civil rights bills since the '60s, a believer that money in politics was a 'cancer,' and a seeker of union support. He and his young wife at the time had named their cat Rocky, after the centrist New York governor Nelson Rockefeller. None of this was particularly unusual for Republicans at the time, especially for an up-and-comer looking to put a fresh face on the party.
But McConnell's news conference in the wake of Richard Nixon's Watergate scandal still came as a surprise to many.
'Clearly a crisis of confidence confronts both the national administration and the Republican Party at all levels,' McConnell said at the local GOP headquarters, just one week after his election as chairman. He called the break-in at the Watergate 'totally repugnant,' denounced it as an 'unconscionable,' and called on Nixon to 'rid the administration and the party of the 'stench of Watergate' by cleaning house from top to bottom.' 
The party was suffering from what McConnell called a 'moral crisis,' the Louisville Courier Journal reported, and he was there to help make sure Republicans began operating 'within the guidelines of principle and decency.' Even if that meant calling out the behavior of the conservative administration in the White House. 
A casual observer might wonder what happened over the course of the last four decades. How McConnell could go from that teller of hard truths to become President Trump's Mitch. In almost every way he seems to have changed: The boyish Republican moderate has become the taciturn grim reaper of the Senate.
But is McConnell really that different than he was 37 years ago? His maverick demands about housecleaning in the Nixon administration were the scolds of a man on the hunt for his own real estate in Washington; now that he owns the land, he's just looking to keep everyone off his lawn. 
'Mitch has never really been a philosopher so much as an engineer,' said V. Lance Tarrance Jr., who worked as the pollster for McConnell's first Senate run in 1984. 'He's reflecting the changes in the world. What kind of technician wouldn't honor data?' 
In this way, none of McConnell's changes over the years feel particularly surprising. Take his view on money in politics. When the idea of trying to keep up in the fundraising game seemed daunting, the obstacle that could keep a little guy like him from gaining traction, it was a 'cancer.' But when he realized his ability to raise money was an asset, well, maybe it was benign after all. 
'On a more personal level, my first run for the Senate brought these issues to light in a concrete way,' McConnell once wrote. 'I never would have been able to win my race if there had been a limit on the amount of money I could raise and spend.'
And as for being willing to team up with a brash, win-at-all-costs type? Tarrance had McConnell do that before, too, enlisting Roger Ailes "" the future Fox News chairman who cut his teeth as Richard Nixon's media consultant during the 1968 presidential run "" to help out on his Senate campaign.
Without Ailes there might not even be a Senator McConnell. In the summer of '84, McConnell's campaign team was so hard up for cash that they'd taken to collect-call gimmicks to save themselves a dime when calling into the office. Knowing his campaign was in trouble, McConnell suggested to Ailes that maybe they should film some kind of ad highlighting his biography. Ailes suggested that if he wanted to win it'd be best to go hard on his opponent, incumbent Democratic Sen. Dee Huddleston. 
And that he did. Ailes filmed a now-infamous spot in which a pack of baying bloodhounds were set loose to find the 'absentee' senator, highlighting the fact that he'd missed some votes to give paid speeches. 
The ad put McConnell back on the map, helping him raise enough money to stay afloat and ride into Congress on Ronald Reagan's wave of support in Kentucky. 
McConnell was grateful to Ailes, despite a partnership that could be difficult at times. McConnell was, as Tarrance put it, the 'librarian' to the admaker's 'hard-charging general.' And while Ailes may have seen McConnell as 'weak,' he did respect one thing.
'He found someone who wanted to win as much as he did,' said Tarrance.
 



In the summer of 2016, as Trump was wrapping up the Republican nomination, McConnell released his memoir: 'The Long Game.' The book tells the story of an ambitious politician, one who beat polio as a child, realized he could never be a professional baseball player so he entered the contact sport of politics, wanted to have his name in the history books alongside greats like Henry Clay, and has always had a true love for the Republican Party and for the machinations of Congress's upper Chamber.
Trump is not mentioned in its pages, but his name became a regular presence on the book tour. 
'Does the Republican Party have an identity crisis?' the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt asked McConnell at the time. 'Because Donald Trump said he is going to change the nature of the party.' 
'I think he'll be just fine,' McConnell responded. 
It wasn't exactly a ringing endorsement from a top Republican, but it wasn't a denunciation either. There was no 'moral crisis,' no 'stench' to be dealt with. And, if you ask his Democratic critics, such normalizing from someone like McConnell may have made all the difference. 
'He was the first to become really afraid of Trump, and his party stepped in right behind him,' said former Senate majority leader and McConnell's old sparring partner Harry M. Reid of Nevada. Reid has said that no one 'enabled' Trump more than McConnell and that he seemed to fear what getting on the wrong side of the candidate could do to his chances of keeping the Senate in Republican control. Now, in his role as keeper of the Senate trial, he has been at the forefront of protecting him. 
'It's clear Senator McConnell is hellbent on making it much more difficult to get witnesses and documents and intent on rushing the trial through,' Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in response to Mc Connell's proposed rules for the proceedings. 'On something as important as impeachment, Senator McConnell's resolution is nothing short of a national disgrace.'
McConnell's job has never been to do public relations for the president; his help is much more behind the scenes, much quieter. In the weeks leading up to the Senate trial he kept his proposal for the process a secret, even from many of his own members.
'He's a man of few words, and I think that creates a mystery that works to his advantage,' said Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. 'He doesn't speak any more than he has to, which means he doesn't tip his hand more than he needs to. Knowledge is power in war and politics.'
As to whether he's simply doing President Trump's bidding, McConnell would almost certainly smirk at the suggestion. But he is not a man immune to thoughts about his legacy. He does, after all, keep all those comics in an archive, alongside his many papers and an oral history (hidden from public view) that he has been compiling over the years.
'The idea that he's Trump's handmaiden is just ridiculous on its face,' said Mullins Grissom, McConnell's former campaign manager. An honest view of his place in history, she said, must capture it all: his ability to transform the judiciary into something vastly more conservative, the times he's worked behind the scenes to keep the Trump administration on track.
'His legacy will not be defined by the president,' she said. 'He was here long before Trump and he'll be here long after.'
Indeed he has a whole memoir's worth of accomplishments. In fact, a new edition just came out last month. 
This time Donald Trump makes an appearance. He wrote the foreword.

President Trump escalated his campaign of retribution against his perceived impeachment enemies Tuesday, railing in the Oval Office about a decorated combat veteran who testified about the president's conduct with Ukraine and suggesting the Defense Department should consider disciplining him.
'The military can handle him any way they want,' Trump said of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who was ousted from his position on the National Security Council last Friday and reassigned to the Pentagon.
Asked whether he was recommending the military take disciplinary action against Vindman for his House testimony in the impeachment proceedings, Trump replied, 'They're going to certainly, I would imagine, take a look at that.'
Trump also leaped to the defense Tuesday of Roger Stone, his longtime former adviser and friend who faces a prison sentence after being convicted by a-jury of obstructing Congress and witness tampering in connection with the Russia investigation.
Stoking new worries about improperly politicizing the Justice Department, Trump admonished federal prosecutors for recommending a seven- to nine-year sentence for Stone, which the president felt was too long.
'That was a horrible aberration,' Trump told reporters gathered in the Oval Office. 'They ought to be ashamed of themselves,' he said, adding that the prosecutors were 'an insult to our country.'
Trump provided fresh evidence that he feels emboldened and will say and do as he pleases after the Republican-controlled Senate voted last week to acquit him in the impeachment trial.
Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said Trump's actions in recent days have seemed 'almost delightedly vengeful' and are cause for 'very deep and profound concern and alarm.'
'It completely explodes this delusion that he's learned his lesson and he will turn over a new leaf, which was magical thinking from the start and a fig leaf for a number of my Republican colleagues,' Blumenthal said. 'We ought to be very, very afraid of this kind of dictatorial personal vengeance against dedicated public servants who stepped forward to tell the truth.'

Republicans who control the Senate resigned themselves this week to the reality that they are unable to check or even influence Trump, even as some GOP strategists are warning that the president's actions threaten the party's Senate majority by complicating the home-state politics for a quintet of endangered incumbents.
One of them, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), said last week that she believed Trump had learned 'a pretty big lesson' by being impeached. But this week she said she had been so 'concerned' about Trump's desire to punish two impeachment witnesses, U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland and Vindman, that she contacted the White House.
'My general position is that anyone who answers a congressional subpoena and comes forward and testifies should not face retaliation,' Collins said.
Asked what senators could do to rein in Trump, she replied, 'I called to try to prevent the action.'
Yet the senator's call did little to persuade the president. Trump last Friday fired Sondland and reassigned Vindman, as well as his twin brother, Yevgeny, also a lieutenant colonel, to the Defense Department. The Vindman brothers were escorted off the White House grounds, according to their lawyer.
Trump later took to Twitter to attack Alexander Vindman, who testified before the House last November that he was concerned about Trump's conduct with Ukraine.
Some Senate Republicans said they were more concerned about Sondland's fate. Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said that they tried to save Sondland, a major GOP donor, from the embarrassment of being fired on the same day as Vindman. Both senators said they talked to senior White House officials when they learned that Sondland's job was in jeopardy.
'I just wanted him to be able to leave with dignity,' Johnson said Monday evening. Sondland was said to have been willing to resign his E.U. post within a few weeks had he been given the time.

Neither Johnson nor Tillis raised any objection to the ouster of Vindman, a nonpartisan official who was awarded a Purple Heart for his service in the Iraq War.
Tillis said his motivation for contacting the White House was simply to create some separation between Vindman and Sondland's dismissals as a way of helping to preserve the public image of Sondland, a Portland-based hotelier whose $1-million in donations to Trump's 2017 inaugural committee paved his way into the president's inner circle.
'I agreed with the decision on Vindman,' Tillis said. 'I just felt like having the two have some distance would have been appropriate.'
Some Republican strategists are privately warning that Trump's acts of retribution, should they continue, could endanger the reelection chances of five senators in competitive races: Joni Ernst of Iowa, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Martha McSally of Arizona, as well as Collins and Tillis.
'The White House and the [Trump] campaign need to look at this election through the lens of the vulnerable Republican senators,' said one top GOP strategist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retribution from Trump or his aides. 'It's not that hard. You say to yourself before you make a move, 'What's this going to do to Cory or Joni or Martha or Thom or Susan?' That's what's lacking here.'
Trump, the strategist continued, 'is always going to do a little crazy every week because a little crazy is what motivates his base. But this is a team sport, and he does not want to lose the Senate. You saw what happened when he misjudged 2018 and lost the House. He got himself impeached. The Senate is the backstop.'

Democrats have zeroed in on Collins's claim that Trump had learned a lesson from being impeached, an assessment she later clarified as a 'hope' that he would not ask foreign leaders to conduct investigations against his rivals.
'She said that the president has learned his lesson. Those were her words, and then the next morning President Trump went out and disgraced himself before people of faith at the National Prayer Breakfast, and then President Trump turned around and held [a] make America hate again rally in the White House,' Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), one of the House impeachment managers, told reporters Tuesday.
Trump also has been seeking to retaliate against Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the lone Republican to vote to convict the president. In Tuesday's Oval Office appearance, Trump slammed his longtime foil, telling reporters, 'Romney's a disgrace.'
Romney said Tuesday that he has received a fine reception from his Senate colleagues and in meetings with Utah GOP leaders following his conviction vote. Romney flew home to Salt Lake City last Thursday for meetings and then, signaling he wants to be seen as a team player, jetted to Palm Beach, Fla., to attend a big fundraising retreat for the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
Romney said in a brief interview following the weekly Republican senators' luncheon, which was attended by Vice President Pence, that there was no awkwardness at the fundraiser or at Tuesday's lunch over his rebellious vote.
'I'm sure people have different points of view; that's what we're entitled to do in a democracy,' Romney said.
Utah House Speaker Brad Wilson (R) described his visit with Romney as a 'very frank' conversation, but one that GOP leaders appreciated. 'It actually took a lot of courage to do that in the wake of what happened, primarily because many of us here are disappointed with what happened yesterday,' Wilson said Thursday.
Even as Trump has mocked him and his citation of his Mormon faith in guiding his vote, Romney said Tuesday that his Senate colleagues have been fully supportive.
'I certainly respect each of them for the conclusions they reached and believe that when people of character vote their conscience, that is a good thing,' he said.

At the start of President Trump's impeachment trial, Democrats pinned their hopes on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), whose reputation as an institutionalist might lead him to back a call for witnesses.
Democrats were sorely disappointed late Thursday night as Alexander, who is retiring at the end of his third term, announced his opposition to such a move "" and offered an explanation they found lacking.
Alexander said the president did use military aid as leverage to pressure Ukraine's leader to investigate a Trump political rival, but he wouldn't join Democrats on calling witnesses.
'I think there's a big gap between this conduct and impeachable conduct; I don't think this is close. I think it's inappropriate,' Alexander said in an interview Friday morning.
Democrats had hoped that Alexander, 79, could build a coalition of Republicans who would at least support calling witnesses such as John Bolton, the former national security adviser whose forthcoming book alleges that Trump's goal in delaying $391 million in security aid to Ukraine was to force that nation to launch damaging political investigations of former vice president and 2020 candidate Joe Biden.
As Friday's debate over witnesses began, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) issued a statement opposing witnesses, eliminating the chance of a 50-50 vote that would have compelled Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. to decide whether to break the tie or let the motion for witnesses die.
Unlike Alexander, Murkowski called the case against Trump 'rushed and flawed' but said that the Senate was incapable of curing 'the shortcomings' and that she would oppose additional witnesses.
'I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate. I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything. It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed,' said Murkowski, who also cited attacks on Roberts as a factor in her decision.
That left Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Mitt Romney (Utah) as the only two Republicans poised to join all 47 members of the Democratic caucus in asking for more witnesses in a vote destined to fail.
Democrats had hoped that Alexander's background as a protector of the Senate's institutional prerogatives would make him a supporter of expanding the trial, especially given his early years as a top aide to then-Sen. Howard Baker (Tenn.), who served as the top Republican on the Senate Watergate Committee, which helped lead to Richard Nixon's resignation in the face of likely impeachment and removal in 1974.
'I was certainly hoping he would have a Howard Baker moment, you know, but it appears he will not,' Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said Friday morning.
Durbin said he was 'disappointed but not really surprised' by Alexander's decision, particularly because the Tennessean has been a close ally of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) since their shared days as Senate staffers.
While even-tempered and pragmatic in working with Democrats on legislation, Alexander has built a solid conservative record far different from those of the few remaining moderate GOP senators, who were closely watched for their votes.
In his own telling, Alexander said that he was never that close to voting for witnesses and that he delayed in stating a position in order to act as a prudent jurist in the trial while leaving open the possibility of wanting to hear more evidence.
To prepare for the trial, he said, he read two books: one by Edmund Ross, the senator from Kansas who cast the decisive vote in 1868 against removing President Andrew Johnson from office, and the other, 'Impeachment: An American History,' a collaborative book published in 2018 about all the cases against presidents.
Alexander read the newer book at his desk during Thursday's question-and-answer session, focusing on the chapter by Jon Meacham on Johnson's trial.
The senator said that 'many presidents have probably done similar things,' citing a talk he had with Jimmy Carter's attorney general, Griffin Bell, in which Bell said Carter had ordered him to indict on civil rights charges a Texas police officer who had received a short sentence in a brutal murder. Bell refused.
Alexander said a similar scenario should have happened when Trump wanted a probe of the Ukrainian energy firm that had Joe Biden's son Hunter on its board. 'If he wants to investigate the Bidens, he should give that information to the attorney general and let him handle it,' said Alexander, who continues to support Trump's reelection as honorary chairman of his Tennessee campaign.
He said that he has not spoken to Trump since a bill-signing ceremony at the White House in mid-December but that he came under fierce pressure from a collection of colleagues, close friends and others who had access to the president.
'I got some very impassioned emails from people who canonize President Trump or people who hate him,' Alexander said.
Three key elements convinced him that it was time to move.
First, with the election already underway and ballots printed in many early primary states, prolonging the trial could blow up that campaign. 'So we're tearing up the ballots and telling people basically, as an election is starting, you can't vote for or against President Trump,' he said.
Second, he said that the Founding Fathers disapproved of party-line impeachments in the House and that the Senate should dismiss those. 'I did not want to create a weapon of perpetual impeachment that the House could use to immobilize the Senate and immobilize the executive,' he said.
Finally, he believes that the House managers documented their case but did not show that it rose to an impeachable offense.
'Did he, at least in part, withhold aid in order to encourage that investigation? I thought the evidence was conclusive that he did,' Alexander said. 'The president might very well say, 'I did it because I cared about corruption,' but I was convinced that at least in part, he did it to encourage the investigation of the Bidens.'
Alexander said he is not sure what defines a 'high crime or misdemeanor' "" which the Constitution sets as the basis for removing a president "" but added that one key requirement is bipartisan support.
'I think you step back and say, is it something about which there is such a consensus that both Republicans and Democrats think the president ought to be removed? I guess the only example we really have of that is President Nixon,' he said.

Receipts show up to $650 per night for rooms


President Trump's company charges the Secret Service for the rooms agents use while protecting him at his luxury properties "" billing U.S. taxpayers at rates as high as $650 per night, according to federal records and people who have seen receipts.
Those charges, compiled here for the first time, show that Trump has an unprecedented "" and largely hidden "" business relationship with his own government. When Trump visits his clubs in Palm Beach, Fla., and Bedminster, N.J., the service needs space to post guards and store equipment.
Trump's company says it charges only minimal fees. But Secret Service records do not show that.
At Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club, the Secret Service was charged the $650 rate dozens of times in 2017, and a different rate, $396.15, dozens more times in 2018, according to documents from Trump's visits. 

And at the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster, the Secret Service was charged $17,000 a month to use a three-bedroom cottage on the property, an unusually high rent for homes in that area, according to receipts from 2017. Trump's company billed the government even for days when Trump wasn't there.
These payments appear to contradict the Trump Organization's own statements about what it charges members of his government entourage. 'If my father travels, they stay at our properties for free "" meaning, like, cost for housekeeping,' Trump's son Eric said in a Yahoo Finance interview last year.

The full extent of the Secret Service's payments to Trump's company is not known. The Secret Service has not listed them in public databases of federal spending, as is usually required for payments over $10,000. 
Instead, documents have come out piecemeal, through public records requests from news organizations and watchdog groups. The Washington Post compiled available records and found 103 payments from the Secret Service to Trump's company dated between January 2017 and April 2018. 
The records show more than $471,000 in payments from taxpayers to Trump's companies. But "" because these records cover only a fraction of Trump's travel during a fraction of his term "" the actual total is likely to be higher.
'It is more than a little disconcerting, knowing this is going on, and not knowing what the actual numbers are,' said Jordan Libowitz, of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. 'That's kind of crazy that we know the president is benefiting from the presidency, and we do not know how. We do not know how many taxpayer dollars are in his pocket.'
The White House did not respond to questions about Trump's knowledge of these payments. 
In a statement, the Secret Service said that its spending 'balances operational security with judicious allocation of resources.' By law, Secret Service agents are exempt from the government's usual per diem spending limits while they are protecting the president. The Secret Service did not respond to a question about why the purchases weren't listed in public databases.
Trump still owns his company. In response to questions from The Post, a company spokesperson said Mar-a-Lago does not charge the Secret Service $650 per room but did not address whether it had charged that rate in the past. The company also noted that the rental cottage at Bedminster contains 'multiple rooms and [includes] numerous common spaces.'
The company did not answer questions about the rates it charges the Secret Service now. 
'We provide the rooms at cost and could make far more money renting them to members or guests,' Trump Organization Executive Vice President Eric Trump said in a statement. He gave no details about how the company calculates the 'at-cost' price.




During the 2016 campaign, Trump told voters that "" if he was elected "" he would not have time for travel. 
'I would rarely leave the White House because there's so much work to be done,' Trump told the Hill in a June 2015 interview. 'I would not be a president who took vacations. I would not be a president that takes time off.' 
But since taking office, Trump has spent more than 342 days "" a third of his entire presidency "" at his private clubs and hotels, according to a tally by The Post. Trump has said he works during these trips.
The Secret Service always comes with him, as it does with all presidents. But the Trump Organization has assured the public that it is giving the government a great deal. Last year, Eric Trump told Yahoo Finance that when his father does visit his properties, he is legally required to charge something.
 Eric Trump did not say what law required Trump to charge his own government, and the Secret Service did not respond to questions asking what law he was referring to. The Secret Service is part of the Department of Homeland Security, whose internal directives state, 'DHS may accept gifts to carry out program functions.'
'If he stays at one of his places, the government actually . . . saves a fortune because, if they were to go to a hotel across the street, they'd be charging them $500 a night, whereas, you know we charge them, like 50 bucks,' Eric Trump said. 
That appears to be wrong. 
The Secret Service is required to tell Congress twice a year about what it spends to protect Trump at his properties. 
But since 2016, it has only filed two of the required six reports, according to congressional offices. The reasons, according to Secret Service officials: key personnel left and nobody picked up the job. 
Even in those two reports, the lines for Bedminster and Mar-a-Lago were blank. 
The Secret Service officials said only that they abide by the law, but they did not elaborate. They are probably referring to a provision that requires them to tell Congress about 'permanent' costs. They may not consider anything they've done at either club permanent.
Senate Democrats have asked the Trump administration to provide more details on the costs of Trump's travel as part of negotiations over a bill governing the Secret Service. But Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has told the Senate committee that he opposes a requirement to deliver those details until December 2020 at the earliest, which falls after the election.
'They've really stonewalled us,' said Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.). 'He's trying to hide the details from the public, because he knows how bad it looks. That's the truth of it. He's a billionaire, but we're spending millions of dollars to support his for-profit clubs and for-profit businesses.'

The Post sought to quantify one part of that spending "" the money that goes directly to Trump's own businesses.
Most of the 103 payments discovered by The Post went to just three Trump properties: the Trump International Hotel in Washington and the president's clubs at Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster. 
They showed that Trump had quickly shattered past precedent. Other recent presidents have allowed the Secret Service to use their properties "" George H.W. Bush's compound in Maine, Bill Clinton's home in suburban New York, George W. Bush's ranch in Texas "" free, according to the Secret Service and spokespeople for those former presidents.
The Post could find only one other recent example of a president or vice president charging his own Secret Service rent. Former vice president Joe Biden charged $2,200 a month for a cottage on his property in Delaware. Unlike the payments to Trump, Biden's payments were listed in public spending databases. Biden was paid a total of $171,600 over six years.
Trump exceeded that total within three months, records show.
In February 2017, for instance, Trump made his first presidential trip to Mar-a-Lago "" a for-profit club with guest rooms and suites available to members. The Secret Service sent dozens of people. Most of them stayed at other hotels nearby.
But they also rented at least three rooms at Mar-a-Lago, records show.
The rate: $650 per night, according to two people who saw receipts. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter.
That was more than triple the normal limit on federal spending for a hotel room in that area, which was $182. It was even more than what the State Department paid for rooms at Mar-a-Lago around the same time, which was $520 to $546. 
'The operational needs of the Secret Service can differ from those in the Department of State,' a Secret Service spokeswoman said, to explain why their rooms had cost more than the State Department's.
Presidents are exempt from federal conflict-of-interest rules. And the Secret Service is exempt from hotel-room spending limits.
So Trump's company was free to charge what it wanted.

And, according to one former senior administration official with direct knowledge of the operation, his club often treated the Secret Service like any other customer. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve relationships with the Trump administration.
'The club wanted to charge the rack rate,' the former official said, saying that sometimes officials had to call Eric Trump to lobby for a lower rate. 'The club managers were not always that accommodating.' 
In 2018, the room rate charged to the Secret Service was lower: $396.15 per night, according to public records obtained by the watchdog group Judicial Watch. One possible reason for the drop in price: The 2018 receipts list the Secret Service as an 'honorary member' of the club, which could have made it eligible for a member discount.
But in 2018, receipts show, the Secret Service tended to book more rooms and stay longer than they had in 2017 "" in one case, when Trump came for two weekends in a row, the Secret Service rented four rooms for nine nights apiece. They stayed all week, even while Trump was gone.
In Bedminster, records show, the Secret Service went further: It paid not by the day "" but for a whole month at a time. The Secret Service rented the club's 'Sarazen Cottage,' a three-bedroom building near Trump's own villa, from July 1 to Oct. 1, 2017.
The former senior administration official said the cottage was needed to store equipment and provided living space for five or six agents. So "" even though Trump was only there about a third of the time "" the equipment was there every day. So they paid every day.
'You can't rent the villa part of the year to someone else because it has to stay a Secret Service space,' said the official.

The Trump club does not publish data on the normal rates for these cottages "" even to its own members. They are told to contact management for a quote, according to member brochures obtained by The Post.
But the rate of $17,000 per month seems unusually high for a monthly rental. Since fall 2017, there have been 100 rental listings for homes with three or more bedrooms in Bedminster, according to the website Zillow.com. None were anywhere near Trump's rate; the average rental rate was $3,400, and the highest rent listed on Zillow was $8,500. Trump charged twice that.
It is unclear whether the monthly payments to Trump's company began earlier or continued after the date of the last record. Documents obtained by Property of the People "" a watchdog group set up to seek documents on Trump's administration "" also appear to show the $17,000 per month rate being paid in May 2017. 
And former housekeepers from the Bedminster club have said that the Secret Service continued to use the cottage long after these records end, through 2018. 
Another visitor to the club "" who spoke on the condition of anonymity to preserve access to the club "" reported seeing Secret Service agents in the cottage as recently as December. 
The Secret Service did not answer questions about whether it was still paying. 
The many gaps in the Secret Service data leave many unanswered questions.
Among them: Why were these payments to Trump's clubs not listed in public databases of federal spending, such as usaspending.gov? The Secret Service has publicly listed many other transactions related to Trump's stays at his clubs "" rentals of golf carts, tents and portable toilets. 
But it has not listed any of these payments to Trump's own businesses. 
'It is a surprise' that these payments are not listed, said Sean Moulton of the watchdog group Project on Government Oversight. Without public data about payments to Trump, he said, 'the public doesn't even know the questions they should be asking.'
Also: Why did the Secret Service spend so much at Trump's D.C. hotel, a place where "" unlike Bedminster and Mar-a-Lago "" Trump has not stayed overnight since taking office? In response to records request from NBC News, the Department of Homeland Security released a listing of 39 payments there during Trump's first year, totaling $159,000. 
The documents do not give the reasons for those payments "" or give the rate that Trump's company charged.

PRESIDENT WANTED EX-FBI FOE CHARGED
Turmoil as other cases shift to outside offices
The Justice Department on Friday revealed that it would not charge former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe, a longtime target of President Trump's wrath, exacerbating the angry divide between Trump, his attorney general and federal law enforcement officials. 
The development came just a day after Attorney General William P. Barr made a televised entreaty to Trump to stop tweeting about criminal cases "" and just hours after Trump defied that request. 
While three White House officials said Barr, one of Trump's most loyal and effective Cabinet secretaries, was in no immediate danger of being fired, the attorney general's relationship with the president is facing its gravest threat yet. Inside and outside the Justice Department, officials watched warily "" some questioning whether Barr was truly at odds with Trump, others heartened by what seemed to be Barr defending the institution's historical independence and all wondering what comes next. 
The eventful day began "" as many in Washington do now "" with a defiant Trump reacting on Twitter to something he saw on television. The president quoted from Barr's interview Thursday with ABC News, during which the attorney general asserted that Trump had never asked him to do anything related to a criminal case.
'This doesn't mean that I do not have, as President, the legal right to do so, I do, but I have so far chosen not to!' Trump added in his own voice.
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on Trump's tweet. 

Hours later, the department made a move that might be seen as exerting its independence, revealing that it would not charge McCabe with lying to investigators about a media disclosure years ago. 
Officials familiar with the matter, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss Trump's interactions, said the president was not told about the McCabe decision in advance and was upset. White House lawyers, including White House counsel Pat Cipollone, moved to calm the president, these people said. One official said Trump 'believes very strongly that action should be taken.'
Trump, who is spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago Club in South Florida, did not address Barr's TV interview or the McCabe case in a speech before departing the White House. He and Barr spoke Friday afternoon, but the substance of their discussion was not immediately clear, a person familiar with the matter said. White House aides are counseling Trump not to discuss McCabe at all, according to those familiar with the matter. 
Democratic lawmakers and legal analysts, meanwhile, remained wary of what Barr was up to, and another development Friday indicated he was far from a complete break with the president. 
According to people familiar with the matter, Barr has tasked outside prosecutors "" in the deputy attorney general's office and from the U.S. attorney's office in St. Louis "" to review the handling of the criminal case against former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn and other sensitive national security and public corruption prosecutions in the U.S. attorney's office in Washington. Among the other cases are the investigation into Blackwater founder Erik Prince for potentially lying to Congress, along with other matters that have not yet been made public, a person familiar with the matter said. 
The prosecutors began their work in recent weeks, coinciding with the transition of office leadership from former U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu to interim U.S. attorney Timothy J. Shea, a former Barr counselor. One Justice Department official said a prosecutor with the St. Louis U.S. attorney's office is working with Flynn prosecutor Brandon Van Grack, characterizing his work as 'assisting' Van Grack in a review of the case.
That has fueled concerns among career prosecutors and others that the department's political leadership is making a push to exert more control at a key point in sensitive, high-profile cases. Flynn was one of the early people to plead guilty in connection with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe, admitting he lied to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States, though he has since tried to withdraw his plea and allege misconduct on behalf of prosecutors. 
The review was first reported by the New York Times. 
Trump has consistently sought to undermine Mueller's probe and those involved in it "" either by asking for investigations of the investigators or, in more extreme cases, that criminal charges be filed against them. That has been particularly true for McCabe and his former boss, James B. Comey. 
'Of all of them, it's Comey and McCabe that seem to really rile him up,' one person close to Trump and Barr said of the president. 
Behind the scenes, Trump has raged over the lack of legal action against the pair, including last August "" when officials announced that Comey would not face charges for his handling of memos he wrote while FBI director "" and in January, when The Washington Post reported that a re-examination of corruption allegations related to Hillary Clinton had come up empty, according to people familiar with the discussions.
As a top law enforcement official, McCabe authorized the FBI to begin investigating Trump personally for possible obstruction of justice in connection with the probe into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 election.
McCabe became the focus of a grand jury probe over allegations from the Justice Department inspector general that he lied to investigators exploring a media disclosure. Department officials authorized prosecutors to seek an indictment of him last year, and in September a grand jury that had been hearing evidence was summoned back to consider the case after a months-long hiatus. 
But the day came and went with no public charges being filed. McCabe's legal team was told nothing. A spokeswoman for the D.C. U.S. attorney's office, which led the investigation, declined to comment. 
McCabe, a CNN contributor, said on the network Friday that the investigation was a 'horrific black cloud that's been hanging over me and my family for almost the last two years' and that the formal end of it was a 'relief' he could not put into words. 
'It's just a very emotional moment for my whole family,' he said. 
Trump's attacks made a prosecution of McCabe especially complicated. According to materials made public Friday in a Freedom of Information Act case related to the investigation, a federal judge in D.C. warned prosecutors in the case that the public was watching and that comments from the White House were detrimental.
'I just think it's a banana republic when we go down that road and we have those type of statements being made that are conceivably, even if not, influencing the ultimate decision,' Judge Reggie B. Walton said. 'I think there are a lot of people on the outside who perceive that there is undue,inappropriate pressure being brought to bear.'
He added later, 'I think as a government and as a society we're going to pay a price at some point for this.'

Barr, too, had for weeks been concerned with Trump's tweets about criminal cases, and on Thursday he decided to make his feelings known publicly. 
'I think it's time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases,' he told ABC News, adding that such statements 'about the department, about people in the department, our men and women here, about cases pending here, and about judges before whom we have cases, make it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors and the department that we're doing our work with integrity.'
Justice Department staff informed the White House about Barr's ABC interview after it was recorded, but before it aired, a person familiar with the matter said. They did not provide specifics, the person said. In recent weeks, Barr had told Trump privately more than once that the president's tweets and public statements were creating difficulties for the Justice Department, but when those private talks seemed not to have the desired effect, the attorney general decided to raise the issue publicly, according to people familiar with the matter.
Barr also said in the interview Thursday that Trump would be within his rights to ask for a criminal investigation in an area that didn't affect his personal interest "" such as in a terrorism case or fraud by a bank. But he said an attorney general would not listen to an order to investigate a political opponent.
'If he were to say go investigate somebody, and you sense it's because they're a political opponent, then an attorney general shouldn't carry that out, wouldn't carry that out,' Barr said.
The public rebuke of the president by a sitting member of his Cabinet arose from a crisis of confidence at the Justice Department, which had been accused this week of buckling to an angry tweet the president issued after he learned of prosecutors' initial prison recommendation for his longtime friend Roger Stone. 
A federal jury convicted Stone in November on charges of witness tampering and lying to Congress about his efforts to gather damaging information about Clinton, Trump's 2016 presidential election opponent.
On Tuesday, Trump criticized as unduly harsh the initial sentencing recommendation of seven to nine years made by front-line prosecutors. Shortly thereafter, the Justice Department signaled that it would seek a more lenient sentence for Stone, a move that prompted the four career prosecutors to withdraw from the case "" and one to resign from the government.
Barr has said the decision was made before Trump's tweet on the matter. His assertions, though, have not fully placated legal analysts and Democrats on Capitol Hill concerned that he is not adequately protecting the Justice Department's independence. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) asserted Friday on Twitter that Barr had admitted intervening in a case 'to cover up for the President.'
'He's only upset that Trump's tweets made the political nature of his intervention obvious,' Schiff wrote. 'Barr fools no one. He's a witting accomplice to Trump's attack on the rule of law.'
Stone is scheduled to be sentenced next Thursday, though on Friday his defense attorneys demanded a new trial. The request came one day after Trump said on Twitter that the forewoman of the jury that convicted him was 'seriously biased.'

Alleges Trump directly
tied withholding Ukraine aid to probe of Bidens
Congressional Democrats called for former national security adviser John Bolton to testify in President Trump's impeachment trial following a new report that the president told Bolton last August that he wanted to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless it aided investigations into the Bidens. 
The New York Times reported Sunday evening that in last summer's conversation, Trump directly tied the holdup of nearly $400 million in military assistance to the investigations of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. That is according to an unpublished manuscript of Bolton's forthcoming book, the Times said. 
The book, 'The Room Where It Happened,' is scheduled for publication March 17, but a White House review could attempt to delay its publication or block some of its contents.
Two people familiar with the book, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the project, confirmed that it details Trump tying aid to the desire for Biden probes and details a number of conversations about Ukraine that he had with Trump and key advisers, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. They said Bolton is ready to testify in the Senate impeachment trial. 
In a joint statement, the seven House impeachment managers called the report 'explosive' and urged the Senate, controlled by Republicans, to agree to call Bolton as a witness in Trump's trial, which kicks off its second full week on Monday. Bolton has said that he would testify before the Senate if subpoenaed. 
'The Senate trial must seek the full truth and Mr. Bolton has vital information to provide,' the managers said in a statement Sunday. 'There is no defensible reason to wait until his book is published, when the information he has to offer is critical to the most important decision senators must now make "" whether to convict the president of impeachable offenses.' 
Trump is on trial, facing two charges "" abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
The assertion from Bolton could undermine one core defense that has repeatedly been laid out by Trump, his defenders and his legal team: that there was no explicit quid pro quo involved when the administration withheld the military assistance, as well as a White House visit coveted by Ukraine. 
The White House has said that Trump's request for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, as well as a discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 elections, was because he was interested in rooting out corruption and that he did nothing improper. 
The president's legal defense team is expected to mount a vigorous defense on Monday when they deliver a full day of arguments against the impeachment charges. 
The revelation from the Bolton book was certain to roil the dynamics of the trial this week, when the Senate was expected to face a critical vote on whether to allow witnesses at all.
Charles Cooper, a lawyer for Bolton, said he submitted the manuscript to the National Security Council's records management division on Dec. 30 for a standard review process to examine potentially classified information. Cooper said they believed that the book manuscript did not include any classified material and that its contents would not be shared with officials outside that review process. 
'It is clear, regrettably, from The New York Times article published today that the prepublication review process has been corrupted and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those properly involved in reviewing the manuscript,' Cooper said in the statement. 
Sarah Tinsley, a spokeswoman for Bolton, added: 'The ambassador has not passed the draft manuscript to anyone else. Period.'
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and many Senate Republicans would prefer the Senate avoid witnesses, but at least four GOP senators are seen as potential votes for favoring more testimony: Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Mitt Romney (Utah) and Lamar Alexander (Tenn.). 
Romney and Collins have already indicated that they are likely to support hearing from witnesses and getting more evidence, and Romney has also said that he would like to hear from Bolton. 
'The odds of deposition for new witnesses is certainly rising dramatically,' one senior Republican official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly assess party dynamics, said Sunday evening after the publication of the Times report. 
 'John Bolton has the evidence. It's up to four Senate Republicans to ensure that John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney, and the others with direct knowledge of President Trump's actions testify in the Senate trial,' Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a tweet.
Earlier Sunday, Trump escalated his attacks on Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), issuing what appears to be a veiled threat against the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
'Shifty Adam Schiff is a CORRUPT POLITICIAN, and probably a very sick man,' Trump tweeted Sunday morning. 'He has not paid the price, yet, for what he has done to our Country!'
Schiff is the lead impeachment manager in the Senate trial.
Schiff responded in an interview on NBC News's 'Meet the Press,' saying he believes that Trump's remarks were intended as a threat.
'This is a wrathful and vindictive president; I don't think there's any doubt about it,' Schiff said in the interview. 'And if you think there is, look at the president's tweets about me today, saying that I should 'pay a price.' '
'Do you take that as a threat?' host Chuck Todd asked.
'I think it's intended to be,' Schiff replied.
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said it was 'ridiculous' for Schiff to claim that Trump was threatening him. In an appearance on Fox News Channel's 'Media Buzz,' she accused the California Democrat of 'grandstanding,' although she acknowledged that she had not had an opportunity to ask Trump what he meant by the tweet.
'I think he means . . . [Schiff] hasn't yet paid the price with the voters,' Grisham said.
She also echoed Trump's attack earlier Sunday on Schiff, saying: 'I mean, it seems he's having a little bit of a mental issue when you sit on the floor for hours and hours and hours. He's obsessed with this president and trying to take him down.'
Democrats contend that Trump has continued to publicly solicit foreign interference in U.S. elections and that the integrity of the 2020 race is at risk. The president fired back Sunday by leveling the same accusation at his political opponents.
'The Impeachment Hoax is a massive election interference the likes of which has never been seen before,' he said in a tweet.
Some Republicans on Sunday defended Trump's remarks about Schiff. In an interview on CNN's 'State of the Union,' Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) said he was not troubled by Trump's declaration that Schiff 'has not paid the price.' 
'I don't think it's a death threat. I don't think he's encouraging a death threat,' Lankford said.
Host Jake Tapper responded by saying that 'people who are supporters of the president have heard his rhetoric and then actually tried to bomb and kill politicians and the media.'
This prompted Lankford to refer to the 2017 congressional baseball shooting that targeted Republicans and injured several people, including House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.).
'So to be able to say the president's trying to be able to spur this on would be able to say Democrats were trying to spur on the killing' of Republicans, Lankford said.
Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), who is also an impeachment manager, called Trump's tweet about Schiff 'really unfortunate' and said the president has said things before 'that seem threatening to people.' 
'He really ought to get a grip and be a little more presidential,' she said on 'State of the Union.'
In a tweet later Sunday morning, Trump also took aim at Todd, accusing the 'Meet the Press' host of holding a 'softball interview' with Schiff and 'never even calling Shifty out on his fraudulent statement to Congress, where he made up ALL of the words of my conversation with the Ukrainian President!'
Both sides continue to spar over the question of whether the Senate trial will include witnesses. Some key Senate Republicans, already hesitant on the issue, became even more so over the weekend after Schiff referred to a CBS News report in which an anonymous Trump ally was quoted as having warned lawmakers, 'Vote against the president and your head will be on a pike.'

Impeachment trial could test opposites' unlikely bond 
President Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell huddled privately in the Oval Office this month to discuss a judicial nominee. But the president, seething over the stain of impeachment, had something else on his mind: He wanted to know how the GOP could short-circuit his trial. 
 During the Jan.-8 session, Trump rejected the House charges against him, abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, calling it a shoddy case that would never hold up in court. He urged McCon nell (R-Ky.) to use his power to end the trial before it began.
McConnell cautioned Trump, as he had many times before: Such a vote to dismiss the charges would fail in the Senate and generate embarrassing headlines, he flatly told the president. In addition, it would split Senate Republicans at the outset of Trump's impeachment trial "" which will probably be among the most challenging times of his presidency. 
'Better to be unified than divided,' McConnell said, according to two people with knowledge of the exchange who spoke on the condition of anonymity to be frank.
The warning underscores the advisory role McConnell has been playing to Trump as he seeks to protect his fragile Senate majority and his own reelection this year while ensuring a smooth acquittal of the president. Although the men are polar opposites "" and initially had a rocky and somewhat awkward relationship "" the president has come to view McCon nell as an asset and reliable counselor, deferring to him on impeachment strategy, even at times against his own no-holds-barred instincts. 
 When the president last fall criticized Senate Republicans who chided his behavior toward Ukraine, it was McConnell who encouraged Trump to engage with those members to win their confidence, rather than striking back. When the president pushed to use his impeachment trial to target potential presidential rival Joe Biden, it was McConnell who persuaded him to embrace a no-witness strategy preferred by the majority leader and many rank-and-file senators.
'I think the president's learned over time to trust his advice,' said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), a McConnell ally.
The next few weeks will test that relationship, particularly because the men have opposing views of what the trial should be. McConnell and his more moderate GOP senators facing difficult reelection bids want the trial to be serious "" a markedly different tone than the reality-TV-star-turned-president who prefers a brawl. It remains to be seen whether Trump goes with his gut, as he likes to do, or listens to the advice of the longtime Republican leader. 
The account of the interactions between Trump and McConnell is based on interviews with a dozen senators, Senate aides and White House officials close to McConnell or the president, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
The first test may come soon after the trial begins in earnest Tuesday, when one of Trump's allies could push for a motion to dismiss the case despite McConnell's advice. Just five days after meeting with the majority leader, Trump took to Twitter to continue advocating for such a move, writing that 'many believe that by the Senate giving credence to a trial . . . rather than an outright dismissal, it gives the partisan Democrat Witch Hunt credibility that it otherwise does not have.' 
Officials familiar with the White House strategy say no final decision has been made, warning that it will probably be a last-minute call. 
Continued consideration of the move comes as McConnell warned last week that there is 'little or no sentiment' in the GOP caucus to dismiss the charges, and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said Sunday that such a motion is 'dead for practical purposes.' But Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) said he 'very well might' move to hold a vote to dismiss the charges, even at the outset, and even if it fails.
'That sends a message,' Perdue said. 'One . . . that this is an illegitimate process that's being handed to us, and if we accept it the way we're accepting it now, it's a bad historic precedent.'
The political odd couple of Trump and McConnell has proved intriguing since the New Yorker captured the GOP presidential nomination in 2016. While the malleable Trump, a former Democrat, shoots from the hip and often overshares on social media, the lifelong conservative and guarded McConnell says little, calculating his moves and keeping his own leadership team guessing. 
Trump is immensely popular with the GOP base, wielding his Twitter account like a megaphone that fires up Republican voters across the country. McConnell, by contrast, was booed at the 2016 Republican National Convention because of his longtime inside-the-Beltway status "" though that was well before he helped Trump fulfill some of his campaign promises, endearing him to the president's allies. 
McConnell's staff isn't sure whether the majority leader has ever tweeted, but people close to the president and the senator say their mutual respect was borne out of three years of success in remaking the federal courts and securing a tax overhaul in December 2017 "" after Trump blamed McConnell for the failure of the GOP to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act. 
McConnell, who blocked former president Barack Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court in 2016, has changed Senate rules to speed confirmation of 187 of Trump's judicial nominees, including two conservatives to the Supreme Court. In a November ceremony on judicial appointments, Trump praised McConnell: 'Generations from now, Americans will know that Mitch McConnell helped save the constitutional rule of law in America. It's true. It's for a long time.'
McConnell's stature in Trump's eyes only grew when McConnell refused to give up on one of those high court nominees, Brett M. Kavanaugh. During the confirmation process, California professor Christine Blasey Ford accused Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when the two were teenagers. 
 During the Senate hearing with Ford, the president phoned McConnell and asked whether he needed to withdraw the Kavanaugh nomination. McConnell encouraged him not to do it.
The Senate narrowly confirmed Kavanaugh to a lifetime seat on the Supreme Court.


Those close with the president say he heeds McConnell's advice in part because he has learned lessons from ignoring him "" at least twice. In the fall of 2017, McConnell told the president that the GOP needed him to ensure then-Sen. Luther Strange (R-Ala.) defeated primary challenger Roy Moore in the special election to fill then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions's seat. But while Trump stumped for Strange, he tacitly allowed his former strategist Stephen K. Bannon to work on Moore's behalf, undercutting McConnell's work "" according to two people familiar with what occurred. 
Moore won the Republican nomination but faced allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls in the 1970s. While McConnell and the Senate GOP apparatus immediately shunned Moore, Trump ended up supporting him by arguing that the Senate seat needed to stay in GOP hands "" although Republicans ultimately lost to Democrat Doug Jones. 
The lessons continued into 2018, when Trump threatened to shut down the government to secure money for his U.S.-Mexico border wall. McConnell warned the president that he would not be successful and would take a hit in the polls, but Trump sided with conservatives and shuttered the government before the holidays.
The president relented 35 days later without money for the wall he demanded "" as McConnell predicted "" and ultimately resorted to an emergency declaration to reroute federal funds for the border barrier that he had repeatedly promised Mexico would finance. 
As the impeachment trial has neared, the men have been in more frequent contact, sometimes talking several times a day. And often times, Trump has listened to McConnell's counsel "" at least so far. 
McConnell, for example, was the one who told the White House in September that the president should release the transcript of his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, a conversation at the heart of the impeachment case. 
And while Trump considered adding a slate of ardent House GOP defenders to his legal team for the Senate trial "" including Reps. Jim Jordan (Ohio) and John Ratcliffe (Tex.) "" McConnell counseled against it. Trump's legal team announced Friday did not include the GOP lawmakers, although they may play a broader role in defending him publicly, away from the Senate chamber. 
McConnell said last month that he was working in 'total coordination' with the White House on impeachment, drawing criticism from Democrats.

'I think it would be unrealistic to expect that there's not going to be communication between the president's party's representatives in the Senate and his White House,' said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). But 'I think McConnell's level of coordination and his unapologetic advertising of it has been extraordinary and problematic.' 
But McConnell, who has given repeated floor speeches slamming the House impeachment process, remains unaffected by such criticism "" and is intent on leading an impeachment trial that is as politically painless as possible for Trump and the Republicans. 
'I think President Trump, who came with a great skepticism about anybody who had been here, has developed a real appreciation for Senator McConnell's political skills and inside-player skills in terms of what it takes to make the legislative process work,' said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.). 'It's turned into a pretty good partnership.'

Pro-Trump super PAC
defends message aimed
at African Americans
Former president Barack Obama on Wednesday called on South Carolina television stations to stop running an ad from a super PAC supporting President Trump that uses Obama's words out of context in a misleading attack on former vice president Joe Biden.
The Committee to Defend the President, a pro-Trump group, circulated an ad that falsely suggests that words Obama spoke in the narration of his own 1995 book were meant to describe Biden.
The group, which placed a similar amount of anti-Biden advertising in Nevada earlier this month, reported to the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday spending more than $250,000 in South Carolina to oppose Biden.
'This despicable ad is straight out of the Republican disinformation playbook, and it's clearly designed to suppress turnout among minority voters in South Carolina by taking President Obama's voice out of context and twisting his words to mislead viewers,' Katie Hill, Obama's communications director, said in a statement. 'In the interest of truth in advertising, we are calling on TV stations to take this ad down and stop playing into the hands of bad actors who seek to sow division and confusion among the electorate.'
Hill said Obama has 'several friends' in the Democratic presidential primary, 'including, of course, his own esteemed Vice President.' She also said Obama has 'no plans to endorse in the primary.'
Late Wednesday, Patchen M. Haggerty, an attorney representing Obama, wrote the pro-Trump group's executive director, Chad Banghart, to say the ad's unauthorized use of Obama's 'name, image, likeness, voice and book passage is clearly intended to mislead the target audience of the ad into believing that the passage from the audiobook is a statement that was made by President Obama during his presidency.' 
The letter demanded that the group 'immediately remove' the ad from public view.
An attempt to sway black voters in the state, the ad begins with a narrator saying 'Joe Biden promised to help our community. It was a lie. Here's President Obama.'
The ad then runs audio of Obama reading an unrelated passage from his book, 'Dreams from My Father,' about a conversation he had with a barber in Chicago when he was a community organizer.
The Obama passage, which describes the mistreatment of black voters by politicians, refers to complaints about 'plantation politics' and the history in Chicago of Democratic politicians expecting black votes despite poor housing, poor job opportunities and police brutality.
The ad repurposes a similar attack the Committee to Defend the President ran last year in several states with many black politicians, including Georgia, Michigan and Louisiana, according to PolitiFact. Similar tactics, aimed at decreasing black turnout for Democrats, were used in a radio ad by another pro-Trump super PAC, Great America Alliance, in the 2017 special House election in Georgia.
'Donald Trump and his allies are absolutely terrified that Joe Biden will defeat him in November. Trump even got himself impeached by trying to force another country to lie about the vice president,' said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign. 'This latest intervention in the Democratic primary is one of the most desperate yet, a despicable torrent of misinformation by the president's lackeys.'
Separately, Republican activists in South Carolina have boasted about a plan called Operation Chaos to encourage Trump backers to vote for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in Saturday's primary. The South Carolina GOP has canceled the state's Republican primary this year.
The Committee to Defend the President, which grew out of a group called Stop Hillary PAC, traditionally raises its money in increments of $5,000 or less, according to FEC records. The group has reported spending $655,285 on television advertising, $279,800 on voter phone contact, and $144,657 on online voter contact since the beginning of this year.
The group spent about $250,000 on a Spanish-language ad before the Nevada caucuses attacking Obama and Biden on immigration reform.
'They separated families and put children in cages,' the narrator says in that spot, appropriating a Democratic critique of Trump's immigration actions.
Ted Harvey, chairman of the Committee to Defend the President, defended the group's advertising in a statement on Wednesday. 
'It took President Trump to lower black unemployment and create jobs for the African-American community, in addition to passing criminal justice reform,' Harvey said in the statement. 'Joe Biden, on the other hand, is simply giving lip-service for votes. That's the point President Obama made in his book, and we have every right to use his own words "" in his own voice "" in the political forum.'

A SURGE IN OFF-YEAR ELECTIONS SINCE '17
Races are referendums on president, experts say

RICHMOND "" Since President Trump took office, voter turnout has surged in Virginia, the state that holds elections every year, leading analysts to conclude that even local races have turned into referendums on the president. 
'We've seen, across the Trump presidency so far, huge spikes in turnout in Virginia,' said Stephen Farnsworth, a University of Mary Washington political scientist. 'And it's very clear that President Donald Trump brings a lot of people to the voting booth. Some vote in support, but, as we saw in Virginia, more vote in opposition.'
Trump lost Virginia by six points in 2016, making it the only Southern state carried by Hillary Clinton. Since that presidential election, off-year turnout in the state has spiked, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. 
Voters in Virginia, where Western democracy began 400 years ago, have always been pretty good about going to the polls every four years, when there's a presidential contest on the ballot. About 70-percent of the state's voters show up for that. 
But turnout has tended to plummet "" to 30 or 40 percent "" in the off years, when it's time to pick a governor and other statewide officials, members of Congress, or state legislators. 
Trump seems to have disrupted that pattern. Voters who love or loathe the president have gone to the polls in record numbers to register their support or opposition. 






 The year after Barack Obama won the White House, 40 percent of Virginia voters cast ballots in the 2009 governor's race, won by Republican Robert F. McDonnell. In 2013, a year after Obama won a second term, 43 percent of voters participated in elections that put Democrat Terry McAuliffe in the Executive Mansion.
Yet turnout was 48 percent in 2017, a year after Trump's election, when Democrat Ralph Northam won the governorship over Republican Ed Gillespie.
Forty-four percent of voters cast ballots in congressional elections in 2010. And 42 percent did so in 2014, for congressional contests and a nail-biter between Sen. Mark R. Warner (D) and Gillespie. But turnout spiked to 60-percent for congressional races in 2018. 
Turnout traditionally hits its nadir the year before presidential elections, when every seat in the Virginia House of Delegates and Senate is on the ballot, without any statewide or federal contests. Those 'off-off year' elections drew about 29 percent of voters in 2011 and 2015.
 But last year, turnout hit a record 43 percent in contests that gave Democrats control of the state House and Senate for the first time in a generation. 
'Two words: Donald Trump,' said Grant Fox, spokesman for the Democratic Party of Virginia. 'Virginians are taking any chance they can get to stick it to Donald Trump and his party at the polls, which is why the surge in off-year turnout has brought historic Democratic victories.' 
Jack Wilson, chairman of the Republican Party of Virginia, said Trump's election has stirred Democrats and Republicans alike, noting that GOP turnout has spiked "" just not as much as on the Democratic side. 
'Clearly there was an energized Republican base, and you really saw it in the more rural areas,' he said. 
In 2017, Gillespie got 1.18-million votes for governor, the second-highest total for any gubernatorial candidate "" behind Northam, of course, who got 1.4-million votes and a nine-point win. 
Even Corey Stewart, a Trump acolyte who received a 16-point trouncing from Sen. Tim Kaine (D) in 2018, got more votes than Gillespie or Warner in their 2014 Senate battle. While Stewart's 1.37-million votes fell far behind Kaine's 1.9 million, he was ahead of Warner's 1.07 million and Gillespie's 1.06 million.
Farnsworth said Trump has not been the only factor, particularly in November's elections, when it was clear that the state House and Senate were both up for grabs. Republicans had an overwhelming majority in the House until 2017, when Democrats "" surprising even themselves "" picked up 15 seats.
Heading into Nov. 5, Republicans were defending narrow majorities of 20 to 19 in the Senate and 51 to 48 in the House, with one vacancy in each chamber. As it turned out, Democrats picked up six seats in the House, which as of Jan. 8 they will control 55 to 45, and two in the Senate, which they will lead 21 to 19.
'Virginia faced a pivotal election in 2019 with control of both the House of Delegates and the Senate of Virginia at risk,' Farnsworth said. 'And as a result of this, Democrats and Republicans engaged in a particularly intense election cycle. Extraordinary amounts of money were delivered to both parties, and top-quality candidates decided to run. 
'And so, to me, there are really two factors here. One is President Trump, but the other is the key nature of this election for the future of Virginia. It was clear to anyone even thinking about voting that 2019 was an election not to miss.'

An insurgent candidate at odds with party elites attempts to seize the nomination from establishment rivals: That infighting roiling the Democratic presidential race is playing out in this week's Super Tuesday congressional primaries.
Just as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is rankling moderate Democrats in his quest for the presidency, two Texas House candidates - one a Democrat, the other a Republican - have crossed swords with party regulars in their bid to unseat veteran incumbents. The same dynamic exists in a pair of Democratic Senate primaries, in North Carolina and Texas.
All told, while Sanders's performance might headline Super Tuesday's results, the down-ballot races could say just as much about the present willingness of each party's voters to eschew pragmatists and dealmakers for more ideologically driven candidates.
No race is being more closely watched on Capitol Hill than the Democratic primary in Texas's 28th Congressional District, where Rep. Henry Cuellar is seeking nomination to a ninth term representing a heavily Latino swath stretching from the Rio Grande to the San Antonio suburbs.
Cuellar is one of the most conservative members of the House Democratic Caucus; he once backed Republican George W. Bush's presidential bid and has more recently stumped for GOP House colleagues while voting against some of his party's signature legislative efforts.
But party leaders, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), have rallied around him - fearful that a win by challenger Jessica Cisneros could boost the threats to other incumbents, including a trio of powerful committee chairmen who are facing challenges from younger, more liberal candidates this year - Reps. Eliot L. Engel (N.Y.) of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.) of the Judiciary Committee, and Richard E. Neal (Mass.) of the Ways and Means Committee.
Cisneros, a 26-year-old human rights attorney, has cast Cuellar as too conservative for an overwhelmingly Democratic district - one that voted for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump by 20 points in the 2016 presidential race. She has won endorsements from Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and other leading lights of the left.
In a call with reporters Friday arranged by Emily's List, the influential Democratic women's group that has endorsed her, Cisneros played down the ideological dimensions of the primary clash and said her campaign was ""about true representation for border communities.""
""We're still left out of so many decisions and policies that are coming from Washington,"" she said.
Also in the crosshairs Tuesday is Rep. Kay Granger (R-Tex.), a former Fort Worth mayor who has risen up the ranks of the House Appropriations Committee since her initial 1996 election to become the top Republican on the powerful panel - and by extension, one of the most powerful GOP women in the House.
But her role as a senior appropriator - one who has had to cut deals with Democrats to pass jam-packed spending bills - has earned her the enmity of her party's fiscal purists and an aggressive primary challenge in the North Texas-based 12th District from businessman Chris Putnam, who has also highlighted her past position as a supporter of abortion rights.
Putnam's challenge has been amplified by national conservative groups that see a chance to harden the GOP against government spending by ousting a top appropriator. The anti-tax Club for Growth calls the race a ""Republican Upgrade Opportunity"" and has funneled more than $1 million into the race.
Endorsing Putnam earlier this year, club president David M. McIntosh noted derisively that Granger was a 12-term incumbent and had ""recklessly voted for out-of-control deficit-spending, backroom bloated budget deals, and debt limit increases.""
Voters, he added, ""deserve a fiscal conservative with a voting record to match.""
Granger said in an interview that she has tried to sell voters on the importance of her position as a senior appropriator - as well as her December endorsement from President Trump, which has done little to stop Putnam's claims that he would be the more reliable vote for Trump's agenda.
""I didn't expect a primary challenge to try to take out someone in my position, Republican by another Republican,"" Granger said. ""It does take me by surprise. We should be trying to get the majority back instead of taking out the people who are here.""

Karin Dyer, a Putnam campaign spokeswoman, blasted Granger's ""long record of betraying Republican values during her 24 years in office"" and promoted Putnam's status as ""a business outsider that is being attacked by the political establishment, just like President Trump.""

""President Trump needs real allies in Washington, not just ones that show up during campaign season,"" she said.
Granger has outraised Putnam by nearly $1.5 million, according to campaign finance reports filed in mid-February, but the spending gap narrowed thanks to the Club for Growth's spending as well as another $1.1 million spent against Granger from the conservative Protect Freedom PAC.
 The Congressional Leadership Fund, the biggest Republican super PAC focused exclusively on House races, made a rare detour into a primary race, spending $1.3 million to help Granger fend off the Club for Growth's attacks.
Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), a veteran appropriator and a former national campaign chairman for the House GOP, said the race is being closely watched by House leaders and senior lawmakers who fear that governance could suffer if Granger is ousted.
""If all of sudden somebody who supported the president is vulnerable in a primary because they cast tough spending votes, then there won't be nearly as many people supporting the president when he has to cut a deal, and that's when Kay's been there,"" he said. ""You're not helping build a Republican majority and you're not helping the president by beating people like Kay Granger.""
Intraparty tensions are also at play in a pair of Senate primaries in North Carolina and Texas. Democratic Party leaders in Washington are bracing for a close race in the Tar Heel State between their favored candidate, former state senator Cal Cunningham, and a more liberal candidate, state Sen. Erica Smith.
Adding to the intrigue: A super PAC with ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) admitted last week to spending $3 million on a covert effort to boost Smith - a bid to force Cunningham and his Democratic allies to spend down their campaign accounts, if not eliminate him from the general election entirely.
And in Texas, military veteran M.J. Hegar won plaudits for a strong 2018 House campaign and has, like Cunningham, won the endorsement of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. But she has struggled to break out amid challenges from labor organizer Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez, state Sen. Royce West, former congressman Chris Bell and Houston City Council member Amanda Edwards, among others. 
While Cisneros's run has invited comparisons to Ocasio-Cortez's 2018 upset of Rep. Joseph Crowley (N.Y.), then the Democratic Caucus chairman, the comparisons may be superficial. Cuellar, 64, has taken a much more aggressive approach to his campaign than Crowley did, engaging in a ground effort that his allies say is in much closer touch with a politically liberal but culturally conservative district than Cisneros is.
That includes a major fundraising push, drawing heavily on allies in the business world. As of mid-February, the most recent filing deadline, Cuellar had already spent $2.2 million, with another $2 million left in his campaign coffers, while Cisneros spent more than $1 million. Texas Forward, a super PAC supporting Cisneros, has spent another $1.3 million, while unions have added another $200,000 in spending on her behalf.
Supporting Cuellar have been a pair of typically Republican groups: the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and American for Prosperity Action, the campaign arm of the conservative network overseen by industrialist Charles Koch.
Cuellar campaign spokesman Colin Strother said a victory would send a message that ""we are a big-tent party.""
""No faction of four or five people and a couple of PACs are going to perform purification rituals on this caucus,"" Strother said. ""When we have the gavel and we have the speaker, it's because we have a diverse caucus filled with moderates and conservatives.""
For Pelosi, who visited Cuellar's hometown of Laredo last month for a high-profile fundraiser, the imperative is simple: Stop an insurrection before it spreads, thus insulating other incumbents from costly challenges. 
""My role is to win the House for the Democrats and to do so by winning for our incumbents,"" she said Friday. ""I would like them to get a nice win so that there's a message for the future, for the next election and the rest - that would be that members who come here, who help us win the majority, will have the support of the leadership of the House.""
Rep. Vicente Gonzalez (D), who represents a neighboring South Texas district, was even more pointed, saying he hoped a Cuellar win would send the message ""that New York and Massachusetts and California don't dictate politics in South Texas"" - referring to Cisneros's high-profile endorsers.

""We're Democrats, strong Democrats, but we're just a little more moderate than other parts of the country,"" he said before echoing a point made by allies of both Cuellar and Granger: ""I think it's very foolish that we're wasting monumental amounts of resources that we should be using for November.""

President ramps uptrade tensions, waves off focus on climate change

DAVOS, Switzerland "" President Trump renewed his threat to put hefty tariffs on European cars Tuesday at the World Economic Forum, promising hardball tactics if trade negotiations do not go his way.
Just days after Trump scored wins with China, Mexico and Canada, the move highlighted how the president is quickly pivoting to make Europe the next front in his protectionist trade war.
As part of this push Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned that Italy and Britain could face U.S. tariffs if they pursue taxes on large technology companies such as Facebook and Alphabet's Google. French President Emmanuel Macron agreed in recent days to delay a similar tax to avoid Trump's tariffs.
The threatened tariffs were evidence of the growing rift between the United States and Europe, on clear display as leaders from the two continents appeared to be talking from different scripts. Trump insisted on discussing a new trade deal, while European leaders kept emphasizing action on climate change and cooperation.
'We're going to talk about a big trade deal,' Trump said at the start of a one-on-one meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. 'We've been talking about it for a while, and hopefully we can get something done.' 
After 70 years of being largely hand in hand in promoting democracy and capitalism around the world, the United States and Europe are now at odds over trade, climate change, taxation, privacy, Iran and defense funding.
And Trump continues to try to use tariffs to pressure European leaders to meet his demands.
'Europe and America are moving slightly apart from each other,' said Rachel Kyte, dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University and the former World Bank special envoy for climate change. 'It's not just the trade war but a fundamentally different approach to privacy and the role of business and society.' 
Leaning on the same tactics he used against China, Trump threatened a 25 percent tax on European cars if Germany, France and Britain did not formally announce that Iran had broken a 2015 nuclear deal. The longtime U.S. allies ultimately did just that last week.
The U.S. president used the same threat to get France to back down on its proposed digital tax. Trump said he would impose tariffs of up to 100 percent on roughly $2.4 billion worth of imported French wine and other goods unless France stopped its plans to put a 3 percent tax on large tech companies such as Google and Facebook with global revenue topping 750 million euros, or around $830 million. Most of the companies subject to that tax are American.
'If anybody is going to tax these companies, it's going to be U.S.,' Trump said Tuesday shortly after confirming that Macron had agreed to delay the digital tax this year in exchange for Trump holding off on the tariffs.
In Europe, world financial leaders expressed hope that Trump had come to Davos to announce a reduction in trade tensions not just with China but with Europe as well. Macron tweeted Tuesday morning that he and Trump had a 'great discussion' in which they agreed to work together 'to avoid tariff escalation.' 
But Trump made it clear that his new focus is a wide-ranging trade deal with Europe and that he had not taken tariffs entirely off the table.
'They know that I'm going to put tariffs on them if they don't make a deal that's a fair deal,' Trump told the Wall Street Journal shortly before his meeting with von der Leyen.
Many business and political leaders in Europe are unsure whether the tensions are just a result of Trump's 'America First' rhetoric or whether there is truly a deeper divide forming.
'It's difficult to say if this is a new norm or just a political period,' said André Calantzopoulos, a Greek businessman who is chief executive of Philip Morris International.

While there is widespread hope among the elite gathered in Davos that the United States and Europe will keep a close relationship, business leaders say they are increasingly having to develop different strategies for the two regions, something that would have been unthinkable only a few years ago.
'It's almost as though there are three different models: There's the Asia model, the Europe model and the Americas model,' said Kelly Grier, U.S. chair at Ernst - Young, a global consulting firm. 'That is without a doubt adding complexity to business in general.' 
Grier pointed to diverging regulations on data privacy in Europe, China, the United States and now California as an example of a costly and cumbersome legal environment that businesses now have to navigate.
For months, European officials have tried to stay under Trump's radar, hoping he was distracted with the China talks. Several European leaders, including Macron, have invited Trump to high-profile ceremonies, in part to keep trade discussions going and avoid tariffs.
'Up until now, Europe has managed to keep its head low when it comes to Trump's trade ire,' said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. 'But with Trump calling a truce with China, he may be looking to pick one last trade fight before the November election "" and Europe is in his sights.' 
Still, among many European business leaders in Davos, there is disbelief that Trump would go forward with extensive tariffs on Europe.
'Often the bark seems to be worse than the bite,' said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS bank. 'President Trump, as he gets closer to the election, may have an 'America First' policy in name, but he's very focused on the overall economic success of the United States.' 
They point out that the United States and Europe have a lot more in common than the United States and China. Wages in much of Western Europe are the same, or even higher, than they are in the United States, making the economies more of an even playing field.
Still, the Trump administration's warnings of new European Union tariffs are following a familiar pattern. Much to European leaders' chagrin, Trump has backed out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris climate accord as key parts of his 'America First' strategy. In Davos, Trump never directly mentioned climate change, the issue at the top of most European leaders' agendas.
'The world is in a state of emergency, and the window to act is closing fast,' Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum, said in remarks shortly before Trump took the stage.
The European Union has its own 'Green Deal' in the works to become carbon-neutral by 2050, including new regulations and massive government investment.
In his formal address at Davos, Trump dismissed such concerns as overly alarmist. He stressed that countries should be free to make their own decisions.
'We must reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse,' Trump said. 'These alarmists always demand the same thing "" absolute power to dominate, transform and control every aspect of our lives.' 
The divergence in U.S. and European priorities was evident again when Trump met one-on-one for the first time with the new European Commission president.
Von der Leyen told Trump of the long history of good relations between the two continents. She said there were 'issues' to discuss but never used the word 'trade.' 
'We never should forget that we have a long history of a common foundation,' she said, adding, 'The American people and the European people are good friends, and this is what we're going to build on.' 
Even while concern is high about what Trump will do in this next phase of his trade war, there was relief that he at least came to Europe and was willing to talk.
In addition to his speech, he met and dined with several European officials and business leaders.
'We are all here. Everybody is here,' said Kristalina Georgieva, who is the new head of the International Monetary Fund and grew up in Bulgaria during the Cold War. 'We may be shouting with each other, but we are talking with each other.'

In August 2016, the conservative pundit Laura Ingraham brought an unassuming, 50-year-old corporate attorney to a presidential debate-prep session for then-candidate Donald Trump.
Long before that day, In graham had grown close to Pat Cipollone. He'd been her spiritual mentor as she converted to Catholicism and had become her godfather, a special honor in the church meant to forge a lifelong bond. But in her professional world "" the realm of high-octane, highly public political combat "" Cipollone had made no footprints.
'No one knew who he was,' said a person close to Cipollone, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe a closed-door campaign gathering.
Here was a Washington Everyman, one of the faceless masters of the universe in the capital city who quietly turn the wheels of power, influence, the law and business "" pointedly, and by design, without ever generating a headline. 
That brief encounter would set in motion one of the more curious pairings in modern American politics, something approaching the knitting of a sinner and a saint. A twice-divorced president with a penchant for extramarital dalliances, name-calling and celebrity magazine spreads aligned with a preternaturally private father of 10 whose great passions trend more to devotional trips to the Vatican and Catholic charitable endeavors.
The impression Cipollone made on the day of Trump's debate prep "" the future president and his team viewed this unknown quantity as a man of discretion, of 'judgment, intellect and modesty, not a leaker,' as one attendee put it "" would linger. Nearly 2
1/2
years later, Trump would select Cipollone as his White House counsel and more recently as the lead attorney in the impeachment trial that has played out for the past two weeks in the Senate chamber.
Cipollone's central role in the defense has placed him on televisions screens across America, though he would have preferred it was not so. He'd argued before the trial that cameras should be banned from the chamber. He believed that Trump's case could be damaged by the re-airing of comments made by the president and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who'd said at a news conference that the media should 'get over it' because quid pro quos 'happen all the time' in U.S. foreign policy, according to people familiar with Cipollone's thinking who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential strategy sessions. But keeping cameras out also would have had the effect of maintaining his carefully nurtured below-the-radar profile. 
Until Jan. 21 at 1:27 p.m., when Cipollone stepped onto the podium on the second day of Trump's trial and said, 'Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,' he had never uttered a word recorded by C-SPAN's ubiquitous cameras. As if to underscore his near-anonymity in Washington, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. initially mispronounced Cipollone's name "" as, at various times, would House impeachment managers Adam B. Schiff, (D-Calif.), Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) and Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.). (It's SIP-uh-loan-ee.) Prior to Cipollone's name emerging as a contender for Trump's White House counsel job, he'd never even appeared in the news pages of his 
hometown newspaper "" The Washington Post.
Yet, he was now America's most visible attorney.
'Pat Cipollone is doing a fantastic job, made easier by the fact that the other side has no case "" and it is a Total Hoax,' Trump said Thursday in a email to The Post. 'He has been a Great White House counsel.'
'Biblical perspectives'
Cipollone, who did not respond to interview requests, and Trump came from different universes. The president was born into privilege, the scion of a real-estate empire. Cipollone, whose given name is Pasquale, is the son of Italian immigrants of modest means. While Trump was the product of an exclusive Eastern boarding school, Cipollone had attended a conservative institution far from the power centers on the East Coast, Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky. His family had moved to the state from the Bronx when his father transferred to Kentucky for his factory job. (A Covington student is now embroiled in a lawsuit against The Post based on the newspaper's coverage of his role in a confrontation during last year's March for Life.)
In temperament and style, Cipollone seemed to be the president's opposite. At the University of Chicago law school, he'd been known as the quiet one, 'not the kind to engage in a lot of huge Socratic debate. Not a particularly outspoken person,' said Melanie Sloan, a classmate.
Early on, he worked at the large firm Kirkland - Ellis, but he took a detour to become a top lawyer at the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal organization, where he held the title supreme advocate. While there, he filed a brief in a Supreme Court abortion case in support of a Nebraska law that outlawed a procedure dubbed by critics 'partial birth' abortion.
The practice, he wrote, amounts to 'the killing of a human child during an already occurring live birth.' The high court ultimately struck down the law.
Later, he became a name partner in the D.C. firm Stein, Mitchell, Cipollone, Beato - Missner "" which made him a wealthy man. Cipollone earned more than $6.7-million in 2017 and 2018, according to a financial disclosure form filed when he took the White House job. 
His recent client list has included the construction giant Bechtel, Sony Entertainment Group and the Recording Industry of America. He also once served on a legal team for Johnny Depp in a lawsuit against one of the actor's previous attorneys.
Over the years, Cipollone naturally fell in with the city's circle of well-connected Catholics, like-minded influencers with firm positions on issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage. 
'Pat puts biblical perspectives on everything,' said former senator Rick Santorum (R-Pa.). Both men have children who attended the Heights School in Potomac, Md., which is affiliated with Opus Dei, an ultraconservative Catholic institution. 
He also forged a deep bond with Leonard Leo, then the vice president of the Federalist Society, the influential conservative legal group that has played a major role in shaping the judiciary. Along with Leo, Cipollone was one of the founders of the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast, formed in 2004 'in response to Saint John Paul II's call for a New Evangelization,' according to its website. 
The friends traveled to Rome together two summers ago and visited the Vatican with a priest from the Catholic Information Center, a D.C.-based educational organization on whose board Leo and Cipollone have both served. Cipollone has also served on the board of the Solidarity Association, an organization that supports Catholic evangelization and education. 

Cipollone cares about 'religious freedom, the culture of life,' Leo said in an interview. 
Leo and Cipollone are close with William P. Barr, who served as President George H.W. Bush's attorney general and now holds the same post in the Trump administration. Cipollone worked for a time as a speechwriter under Barr in Bush's Justice Department.
'Pat and Bill come from the school that believes executive power is actually very important to the preservation of individual freedom, because the branch that is most susceptible to abusing the public is the legislative branch,' Leo said. 'Since the legislative branch by far is the most powerful of the three branches, there has to be a check from both other branches.' 
Cipollone has generally avoided electoral politics, but in 2012 he jumped in to help Santorum's presidential campaign, flying on small planes with the candidate and one other volunteer. The operation was so stripped down that the high-powered lawyer ended up doing tasks normally handled by pimply interns "" grabbing coffee or lunches for Santorum or doing advance work.
'Nothing was beneath him,' said David Urban, a consultant and Republican campaign operative who was the third member of the small campaign team.
In an interview, Santorum said he and Cipollone meshed on most issues but 'didn't always see eye to eye on immigration.' Cipollone urged him to moderate his hard-line tone, hewing to Catholic tenets about helping the poor. 
On policy, 'Pat's just not a heavy hand,' said Santorum, who has been a client of Cipollone's to handle contracts in the years since the campaign. 'When it comes to legal [strategizing], he can be a very heavy hand.' 
'Strong, silent type'
When Trump was elected, Cipollone again took a step toward politics, angling to become deputy attorney general in the Justice Department headed by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Barr "" then in private practice "" was among those who recommended Cipollone, according to a person who is close to both men. Santorum and Leo also recommended him. 
Cipollone didn't get the job, a turn of events that irked Barr and other supporters. But he remained on the president's radar, and in 2018 his name surfaced as possible White House counsel. He wasn't the only finalist, according to an outside adviser who was consulted on a competition that he described as a photo finish. 
'There was a tremendous amount of confidence in both his ability as an attorney and that he brought a lot to the table as somebody who understood the larger conservative project,' the outside adviser said.

Having secured the job, he sought input from Melanie Sloan, his University of Chicago classmate. 
'I expressed my surprise that he would want to work in this White House. He just doesn't see the president as I do,' said Sloan, who is a senior adviser to American Oversight, a nonpartisan ethics watchdog that has been critical of Trump. 'I think of Pat as a very moral and ethical guy and a devoted family man. All of these values seem at odds with the president.'
At a White House event the month after Cipollone took the job, Trump told the audience that his new top attorney was the 'strong, silent type.'

Yet last autumn, Cipollone "" the man who doesn't make headlines "" spoke loudly, blasting out an almost Trumpian bolt that dominated the news cycle. In a brusquely worded, eight-page letter to House leaders, he declared that the White House would not cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry. The inquiry was prompted by allegations of a quid pro quo in which Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless it announced an investigation of a leading political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, and his son Hunter, who held a lucrative seat on the board of a Ukrainian oil and gas company.
'Never before in our history has the House of Representatives "" under the control of either political party "" taken the American people down the dangerous path you seem determined to pursue,' Cipollone wrote. 'Put simply, you seek to overturn the results of the 2016 election and deprive the American people of the President they have freely chosen.'
The defiant approach was cheered by conservative tastemakers.
'Cipollone's letter lays it straight out: You're invalid. Illegitimate. The hell with you,' Lou Dobbs said on his Fox Business Network program.

Two days later, 21 of Cipollone's former law school classmates, who said they represented a wide range of political views, asked him to withdraw the letter, arguing that it 'flouts the traditions of rigor and intellectual honesty that we learned together' and that it 'distorts the law and the Constitution for other purposes, including cable news consumption.' 
But those who are close to Cipollone were not surprised at the content or tenor. Cipollone has a visceral disdain for this House and how it works, according to people who know him well but spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.
Internally, Cipollone's arrival in the White House has, at times, caused friction. He has complained frequently about Mulvaney and questioned his performance as chief of staff, according to multiple officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

Political instincts questioned
Even some of his allies say he does not share enough information with anyone except the president, because he is too fearful of leaks to the media. During meetings, he often has said he wants to speak with Trump one-on-one after the group leaves, a habit that some White House advisers say has left them out of the loop on what he believes is the correct course of action. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham has complained repeatedly that he doesn't keep the communications staff informed.
But publicly the White House has only good things to say about the counsel. 'Pat Cipollone has done a masterful job leading the president's defense team on impeachment and he has widespread support throughout the White House,' Grisham said in a statement emailed to The Post. 'The president trusts his counsel on a wide range of issues and counts him as one of his closest advisers.'
Cipollone has proved to be a deft infighter. His powers of persuasion were tested during a fierce debate about whether Trump should release the rough transcript of the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Communications aides told him it would make things worse for Trump, according to officials involved in the discussions. But Cipollone prevailed.
Even then, it wasn't an easy path. Cipollone tried to manage the media strategy for the transcript release without involving the communications office, arguing that he would provide the best briefings for reporters and lawmakers. He ended up doing the briefings.
The internecine squabbles did not subside. Some inside the White House viewed him as lacking political instincts and repeatedly giving Trump rosier predictions than other advisers. Several days before the impeachment vote, Cipollone was still telling the president that the House might not vote to impeach him, according to advisers who listened in on the discussions. Others told Trump, 'Listen, you're going to get impeached.' They urged the president not to put stock in Cipollone's analysis.
The others were right. On Dec.-18, a House vote made Trump just the third president in American history to be impeached.
Cipollone was in line to take the lead at the Senate impeachment trial that everyone knew was coming. But with a client as mercurial as the president, he wasn't going to get to make all the decisions about who else would be at the defense table. 
On Christmas Eve, Trump approached Alan Dershowitz, the famed O.J. Simpson defense attorney and emeritus Harvard law professor, in the buffet line at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla. Trump told Dershowitz that he wanted him to join the impeachment defense team, Dershowitz said in a recent interview.
Dershowitz demurred, telling the president that his wife, Carolyn Cohen, would not be pleased. That sent Trump off to find Dershowitz's wife elsewhere in the room. The president convinced her, and just like that, Trump had added some star power to his defense team.

The heat of the spotlight
Going into the trial, Cipollone also told officials at the White House that he did not want to appear on television news programs and talk shows during impeachment. Instead, he said, he preferred to defer that task to others, including Pam Bondi, a staunch Trump supporter who recently left office as Florida's attorney general.
'I always hoped that he would do press,' said Ingraham, who has hosted a Fox News Channel program since 2017. 'Many times along the way it was clear to me he had no desire to be a television lawyer. He likes to get his job done behind closed doors.'
But there was no avoiding television last week when Cipollone was the first attorney to take the podium to debate the proposed rules for the trial. He adjusted the microphone. A slender man with graying, exquisitely parted hair, he wore a dark suit and a simple red, striped tie. The Washington Everyman in uniform.
His voice dripping with disdain, Cipollone flung many of his remarks at the president's main antagonist, Schiff, the California Democrat and lead House manager who had just finished his presentation.
'It's too much to listen to almost,' Cipollone said, 'the hypocrisy of the whole thing.'
He invoked the nation's founders, saying the trial was 'their worst nightmare.'
'It's a partisan impeachment that they delivered to your doorstep,' he said.
'They're not here to steal one election,' he said. 'They're here to steal two elections.'
He closed by urging senators to 'end this ridiculous charade' so 'we can go have an election.' With that he clapped his folder shut, punctuating the moment, and walked back to his seat.
Cipollone's client was an ocean away, communing with some of the world's richest people at the World Economic Summit in Davos, Switzerland. But Trump was paying attention and wanted a fiery performance, people familiar with the president's thinking said. Trump had hoped for even more of a flamethrower "" someone more like himself.
In the past year, the unassuming lawyer now arguing to keep Trump in office had ensconced himself deep into the volatile president's inner sanctum. 
One of Cipollone's two predecessors, Donald McGahn, was known for staying in his lane, steering clear of the staffer danger zone that surrounds Trump and that has been a factor in so many White House departures.
'Don was very much focused on the judicial enterprise and deregulation,' said Leo, Cipollone's friend. 'Pat has focused some time on that, but he has broadened his interest areas. He gets himself involved in other things in the building with greater intensity than Don might have.'
Inserting himself in policy matters and palace intrigue carries risk. But Cipollone, who has traveled with Trump more than his predecessors, had staked ground as near as possible to the president.
His friends worry he is playing a little too close to the fire.

Democrats also defend Biden on Ukraine
Nadler says Trump's actions were founders' fear
House impeachment managers laid out the heart of their abuse-of-power case against President Trump on Thursday "" charging that his efforts to pressure Ukraine into political investigations were precisely what the nation's founders wanted to guard against when they empowered Congress to remove a president from office.
The Democrats also detailed their defense of former vice president Joe Biden's actions regarding Ukraine in anticipation that it will be a major portion of the White House's defense later this week, saying Biden's actions were in line with official U.S. policy at the time and not done to benefit an energy company connected to his son.
But a significant number of Senate Republicans remained unmoved and played down the case from House managers, dismissing it as repetitive and unpersuasive as they sought to counter Democrats' narrative at a time when Trump's lawyers must stay silent in the Senate Chamber.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who led the case for Democrats on Thursday, cited 'abuse, betrayal and corruption' as not only the offenses that the nation feared the most when they wrote the Constitution, but also those alleged abuses at the core of Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
'The president's abuse of power, his betrayal of the national interest, and his corruption of our elections plainly qualify as great and dangerous offenses,' Nadler said. 'President Trump has made clear in word and deed that he will persist in such conduct if he is not removed from power.'
During his arguments, Nadler also drew liberally from past comments made by key Trump allies, including Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), Attorney General William P. Barr and lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who all argued there doesn't have to be a statutory crime committed to impeach a president.

In one of many video clips played on the Senate floor during the trial, Graham "" then serving as a House manager in former president Bill Clinton's 1999 impeachment trial "" defined 'high crimes' more loosely than he does now as one of Trump's staunchest defenders.

'It's just when you start using your office, and you're acting in a way that hurts people, you've committed a high crime,' Graham said on the Senate floor in the clip from 1999. He was not in the chamber Thursday when his quote was played, but later told reporters that the use of his previous comments was 'fair game' and recommended that the White House do the same with Democrats when Trump's lawyers begin their defense of the president. 
Nadler made a case to the Senate that it would be unreasonable to expect Congress to envision all types of potential presidential corruption and pass laws explicitly forbidding it.
'The Constitution is not a suicide pact,' Nadler said. 'It does not leave us stuck with presidents who abuse their power in unforeseen ways that threaten our security and democracy. Until recently, it did not occur to me that our president would call a foreign leader and demand a sham investigation meant to kneecap his political opponents, all in exchange for releasing vital military aid that the president was already required by law to provide.'
Trump was impeached Dec. 18, with Democrats accusing him of withholding nearly $400 million in military aid and a White House visit coveted by Ukraine in exchange for launching investigations into Biden and his son Hunter, as well as a discredited theory that the eastern European nation interfered in the 2016 election. Trump and his counsel have maintained he did nothing improper when he asked Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 call to probe the two matters. 
In addition to the abuse-of-power charge, Democrats also impeached Trump on a second article of impeachment: that he obstructed congressional attempts to investigate the Ukraine matter.
But the second official day of the House impeachment managers' arguments centered on the Democrats' abuse-of-power claims. They will wrap up their case Friday. Trump's team will launch its defense of the president on Saturday, with the key question of whether the Senate will subpoena new witnesses or documents set to be decided around the middle of next week.
The Senate may only come in for a few hours Saturday morning rather then spending a full day on the trial, in part because Trump did not want much of his defense to be aired on Saturday, when the public may be focused on weekend plans rather than the news, according to a GOP official who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversations.
Outside the Senate chamber on Thursday, GOP senators and the president's legal team fanned out across the airwaves to push back against the Democrats' case.
Echoing a comment from several Senate Republicans, Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said 'we're hearing the same things over and over' from the House Democrats. 
Meanwhile, even if some Republicans didn't outright reject the Democrats' case that there did not need to be an underlying crime for a president to be impeached, most continued to dismiss the overall argument made by the impeachment managers. 
'I don't think that anything they've actually alleged "" any of the 'abuses' "" they have actual evidence for,' Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said during a break in the trial.
White House officials said Thursday that West Wing aides and Trump's lawyers will continue to be a frequent presence at the Capitol in the coming days as the president's team works to defend him. Aggressive public relations and press availabilities are a key part of that strategy, one Republican strategist familiar with the planning said. 
'This is going to be more than the president tweeting,' the strategist said, adding that the strategy would include Sekulow addressing the media at microphones set up in the Capitol and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) 'huddling with 100 reporters' in the hallways. 
Trump did tweet Thursday, insisting that Democrats are opposed to a witness deal because they are afraid of what the people called to testify by the GOP would reveal. Democrats have repeatedly said they oppose a witness trade because they believe the witnesses Republicans want are irrelevant to the case. 
'The Democrats don't want a Witness Trade because Shifty Schiff, the Biden's, the fake Whistleblower (- his lawyer), the second Whistleblower (who vanished after I released the Transcripts), the so-called 'informer', - many other Democrat disasters, would be a BIG problem for them!' Trump tweeted.
Though the Republicans' top desired witness remains Hunter Biden, Graham told reporters Thursday that scrutinizing the former vice president's son's service on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, would be better handled through the 'oversight' process than by calling him as a witness during the impeachment trial.
The Bidens played a prominent role in the House Democrats' arguments Thursday, as Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.), another impeachment manager, sought to debunk the allegations that Joe Biden did anything nefarious in his dealings with Ukraine during his time as vice president.
'The allegations against Biden are completely groundless,' Garcia said, detailing how the former vice president's efforts to oust the Ukrainian prosecutor general were in line with official U.S. policy and supported by international allies.
But Republican senators said the focus on the Bidens by Democrats made the former vice president and his son fair game for Trump's defense team. 
'It means when President Trump's lawyers stand up and present their defense, that they are going to have the opportunity to present the very significant evidence that's supported and still supports a serious investigation into corruption at Burisma and ultimately whether Joe Biden participated in that corruption,' Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) told reporters Thursday evening.
In 2016, Biden was the Obama administration's point person on Ukraine policy and led a pressure campaign on the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, whom the administration believed was not doing enough to root out corruption among Ukraine's politicians. Shokin had previously investigated Burisma, but Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing. 
Garcia noted that Trump and Republicans didn't focus on Biden's actions toward Ukraine until 2019, when 'Biden became the front-runner for the Democratic nomination and polls showed that he had the largest head-to-head lead against President Trump. That became a problem.'
She also referred to a letter from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and other senators in the Ukraine Caucus to argue that Biden's desire to see Shokin removed reflected official U.S. policy and was not a sign of personal corruption.
As Garcia spoke, a visibly upset and red-faced Johnson rose from his seat, approached Portman and whispered in his ear. Portman reacted impassively, but his comments did not appear to calm Johnson, who departed the floor for the Republican cloakroom moments later. Johnson, a fierce ally of Trump, said in October that he did not recall signing the letter.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the lead impeachment manager, addressed the other investigation that Trump wanted Zelensky to launch, saying the president floated a 'very specific conspiracy theory' that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that hacked the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016 despite there being no evidence to support the claim.
'This theory was brought to you by the Kremlin,' Schiff said. 'So we're not talking about generic interference . . . what Donald Trump wanted investigated or announced, this completely bogus, Kremlin-pushed conspiracy theory.'

Lawyer argued actions that are lawful cannot be impeachable offenses
President Trump's lawyer Alan Dershowitz pushed back Thursday against a swell of criticism as he scrambled to explain his controversial assertion that a president's action, even if taken for personal, political gain, does not warrant removal from office so long as it is done in the public interest.
In a flurry of tweets, Dershowitz said his broad defense of the president one day earlier was mischaracterized and 'willfully distorted' by the media, politicians and his academic colleagues.
'They characterized my argument as if I had said that if a president believes that his re-election was in the national interest, he can do anything. I said nothing like that,' the emeritus Harvard Law School professor tweeted before Trump's impeachment trial resumed without Dershowitz's presence at the defense table.
'Let me be clear once again (as I was in the senate): a president seeking re-election cannot do anything he wants. He is not above the law. He cannot commit crimes. He cannot commit impeachable conduct.'
But that is exactly how Dershowitz's remarks were interpreted.
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) called Dershowitz's argument a 'load of nonsense.' By Dershowitz's logic, Schumer told reporters, President Richard M. Nixon did nothing wrong in Watergate, Schumer said of the 37th president who resigned before facing impeachment.
'The Dershowitz argument frankly would unleash a monster "" more aptly it would unleash a monarch,' Schumer added.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Dershowitz's reasoning would undermine U.S. elections by essentially inviting foreign interference.
'In this case, 'The Russians are coming, the Russians are coming,' ' she told reporters. 
Hillary Clinton quote-tweeted a video clip of Dershowitz on the Senate floor Wednesday with the message: 'In America, no one is above the law.' 
The House voted in December to impeach the president on charges of abuse of power, for allegedly withholding military aid from Ukraine until its government announced investigations into Trump's political rivals, and obstruction of Congress.
Dershowitz's controversial statement came in response to a question from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) about quid pro quos. 
'If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment,' Dershowitz said.
As the Senate question-and-answer session continued Thursday, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif), one of the House impeachment managers, invoked Dershowitz's argument, calling it a 'descent into constitutional madness' and said there is 'no limitation' to such an argument 'no matter how corrupt the quid pro quo is.'
Dershowitz was watching from his home in Miami "" not sidelined from the trial, he said, but because of a prior commitment. Trump's other lawyers, he added, 'begged me to stay.'
Dershowitz insisted in an interview that if a president commits a crime, then he can be impeached. If a president's action is lawful, however, he said it cannot be turned into an impeachable offense just because the decision was motivated in part to help his reelection.
He was responding, he said, to an assertion from House managers that any action by a politician motivated in part by a desire to be reelected was corrupt.
'This was not an accidental misreading,' Dershowitz said soon after writing a column to rebut the criticism. 'Politicians, pundits and academics all ganged up on me basically to deliberately and willfully distort what I said.'
Dershowitz's argument this week was an extension of the case Trump's legal team has made in recent days. Even if the president did use his office to press for an investigation of a political rival, they say, his actions do not add up to an impeachable offense because no crime was committed. 
That view is at odds with the position of mainstream constitutional scholars, who note that a statutory crime has never been required for impeachment. Dershowitz's colleagues and former students were similarly troubled by his most recent assertion. 
'It's really alarming because its part of the notion that the president can do whatever he wants. What if, for instance, the president ordered the criminal prosecution of his opponent in an election?' said Harvard law professor Charles Fried, a longtime colleague of Dershowitz's who served as solicitor general under President Ronald Reagan. 'I don't understand the Dershowitz argument.'
Orin Kerr, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley School of Law, said if there's no difference between a politician's personal interest and the public interest, then presidents can abuse their powers, for instance, by arresting their opponents.
'The sky's the limit in terms of what horrible abuses a president can do that would be entirely unimpeachable. That's an astonishing position,' said Kerr.
Throughout the Senate trial, Dershowitz has been repeatedly referred to as 'professor' by lawmakers, the president's attorneys and even Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is presiding over the proceedings. 
Kerr noted that Dershowitz is not participating as a scholar, but as a vigorous advocate for his client, President Trump. 
'His ethical responsibility is to say whatever helps Trump,' said Kerr, who was a student in Dershowitz's legal ethics class in 1997.
The key lesson of the class: 'When you are a defense attorney, your loyalty is to your client, and you should do anything you can to help your client, right up to the line of violating the ethics rules.'
The particular argument Dershowitz is making, Kerr said, may be 'unpersuasive legally, but lawyers make unpersuasive arguments all the time.'

In September 2016, presidential candidate Donald Trump gathered evangelical pastors, whose support he had courted assiduously, to discuss the political beliefs that they shared.
The Rev. Robert Jeffress, who leads the megachurch First Baptist Dallas and would preach at the church service Trump attended on the morning of his inauguration, recalls looking at the agenda and starting to discuss the first item. Trump interrupted him.
'Pastor, don't you think we ought to pray first?' Trump said, according to Jeffress.
As president, Trump has surrounded himself with a tightknit group of pastors like Jeffress, evangelical leaders who heap praise upon him for his socially conservative stances, his judicial appointments and his support for Israel's government. Trump often invites these pastors to pray and seems to enjoy hearing their professions of faith. Many insist that Trump is a Christian believer.
But Trump "" who recently mocked the expressions of faith of two politicians, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), a Catholic, and Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints "" very rarely puts his own religious beliefs on display.
He does not belong to a church in Washington, although he refers to himself as a Presbyterian. He only occasionally attends a service, including multiple visits to St. John's Episcopal across from the White House, which past presidents historically have attended, and Christmas and Easter worship at the Florida Episcopal church where he was married or at Washington National Cathedral, another Episcopal church.
The president says the Bible is his favorite book but has declined to name a verse that is particularly meaningful to him. And he has said multiple times that he does not like to ask God for forgiveness, which is traditionally seen as a core part of the Christian faith.
Christians preach of the importance of evidence, or 'fruit,' that shows that a person has had some kind of conversion moment. 'If you confess with your mouth, 'Jesus is Lord,' and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved,' reads a crucial text from the book of Romans. Once they have converted, Christians tend to take up certain spiritual disciplines, such as prayer, church attendance, tithing and reading the Bible. In interviews with several religious leaders and observers, there is no indication that Trump engages in any of those practices regularly.
'Anybody who says, 'I've never asked for forgiveness' is not in the born-again camp,' said Stephen Mansfield, an evangelical author who wrote books on the faiths of former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. Of Trump, he said: 'Submit your life to Jesus, born again, conversion: That heart of Christianity is not something he has absorbed.'
Still, a host of evangelical pastors whom Trump frequently invites to the White House tell their followers that the president is a Christian.
'I think there's no question he believes,' said the Rev. Franklin Graham, who has followed in the footsteps of his father, Billy Graham, as a faith adviser in the White House. Graham said he believes Trump has had a conversion moment, but he doesn't know when it might have happened.
Instead of an ecumenical faith advisory council, Trump chose to create an evangelical advisory board, with no members from Catholic, mainline Protestant, Jewish, Muslim or other traditions. Johnnie Moore, an unofficial leader of that advisory board, said Trump speaks 'multiple times a week' with spiritual advisers including Graham, Paula White, Georgia pastor Jentezen Franklin and Texas pastor Jack Graham.
'I absolutely believe he's a born-again Christian,' Moore said. 'I see it in things he's said publicly and privately. I've seen it in his desire to stand up for what he believes is right.'
Many of Trump's faith advisers, including White, who is now a part of his White House staff, declined to comment.
Trump does not regularly talk about religion with many of his advisers, who said they knew little about how the president views God. Aides and supporters "" including the vice president "" have urged him to stop saying 'goddamn,' a word particularly offensive to some Christians, and some have been perturbed by his use of profanity in the Oval Office.
Some chafed at the questioning, saying it was a private matter.
'President Trump is a man of God, and faith plays an important role in his life. The President values the close counsel of many in the faith-based community, as well as the daily prayers of the many Americans who pray for him, his family, our country, and our military. I have personally witnessed the President in worship many times and have also seen him use his faith and prayer to privately comfort and console Americans after a tragedy,' Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said in a statement to The Washington Post.
Evangelical leader James Dobson has credited White with bringing about Trump's Christian conversion. In the months before the 2016 election, Dobson told voters that Trump was a 'baby Christian,' who might not have behaved as a religious man ought to earlier in his life but has since changed.
Even though Obama regularly spoke of his faith and described how he converted to Christianity as a young man, many evangelical Trump supporters say they believe that Trump prays in the White House and that Obama did not.
Last month, Trump became the first president to speak in person at the annual March for Life, an antiabortion event with religious overtones. Michael Capps, who brought his three children to the rally, said Trump had 'put God back in the spotlight, which is amazing for the country' and was 'the most religious' president ever.
Trump, who was raised in the mainline Presbyterian tradition, does not have an evangelical background. He has cited a pastor he knew early in this life, the late Rev. Norman Vincent Peale, author of 'The Power of Positive Thinking,' as influential in his worldview. He says the book helped him overcome bankruptcy.
'His idea of religion was Norman Vincent Peale and making a lot of money,' said Tony Schwartz, who co-wrote Trump's bestseller 'The Art of the Deal,' spent time with him in the 1980s and is now a vocal Trump critic. 'I never heard him use the word 'God.' He never cited any religious beliefs.'
Peale officiated at Trump's first wedding. The next two were also officiated by mainline Protestant ministers, one Presbyterian and one Episcopalian. First lady Melania Trump said in 2017 that she is Catholic.
Most of Trump's relationships with evangelical pastors, particularly with believers in Pentecostal, charismatic and prosperity gospel strains of Christianity, appear to have developed only as he considered running for president. Trump also changed some of his beliefs in recent years, including his shift to oppose abortion.
Several pastors, as well as two former White House officials, said they have never seen Trump pray in front of others. Instead, he regularly asks Vice President Pence or one of his many evangelical Cabinet members to pray. He does not regularly refer to God in making his decisions, these aides say, and they have never seen him open a Bible. But he has long coveted the visual of having pastors pray for him, including the image of the laying on of hands.
Sean Feucht, a Christian musician running for Congress in California, attended a meeting in December organized by White, which brought about 50 Christian leaders, most of them Pentecostal, to the Oval Office. Trump asked the guests to pray for him.
'It was bold, loud prayer' in the charismatic, Pentecostal style, Feucht said. 'We were all praying at once, lifting our voices. It wasn't solemn and organized. It was lively and loud. I think that he's drawn to that.'
Trump was a silent appreciator, not joining in.
The president's first line to the pastors that day, before the prayer, was a jab at Pelosi for claiming to pray for him, Feucht said.
Last week, Trump returned to that theme at the National Prayer Breakfast, an annual event that is a prime opportunity for a president to talk about his faith.
Speaking about Romney, who said his religious beliefs guided him in casting his vote against Trump during the impeachment trial, and Pelosi, who has said she prays for the president, Trump said: 'I don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong. Nor do I like people who say, 'I pray for you,' when they know that that's not so.'
He rewrote his speech on his way to the prayer breakfast to include the barbs at Romney and Pelosi, White House aides said.

President and RNC raised $463 million combined in 2019
President Trump's political operation headed into 2020 with nearly $200 million on hand, according to party officials, giving him a financial war chest that vastly outstrips the resources of his Democratic opponents weeks before primary voting begins.
Trump's reelection campaign, the Republican Party and two joint fundraising committees together raised a record $154 million in the final three months of the year, party officials told The Washington Post, a massive haul they said was fueled by backlash to the House impeachment of the president.
Of that, more than $72 million was collected by the Republican National Committee, driven in part by big checks from wealthy donors "" a sign that much of the moneyed class that shunned Trump in 2016 is now embracing him.
Small donors also continued to give to the party and to Trump's reelection campaign, which pulled in $46 million, far outpacing leading Democrats vying for their party's nomination. Among them, the biggest fundraiser last quarter was Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who raised $34.5 million.
Since the impeachment inquiry began in September, the president's campaign and the RNC gained 600,000 new donors, officials said.
In all, Trump and the RNC together scooped up a staggering $463 million in 2019, party officials said. In comparison, then-President Barack Obama and the Democratic Party raised roughly $220 million in 2011, the year before his reelection.
'President Trump's unwavering commitment to keeping his promises to the American people has propelled us to break fundraising records again this quarter,' RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. 'Democrats' baseless impeachment charade has only made support for President Trump stronger.'
Meanwhile, the Democratic National Committee has trailed far behind the RNC in fundraising.
As of the end of November, the DNC had raised $83.6 million for the year and had $6.5 million in debt, according to campaign finance filings. The RNC raised $241 million for the entire year, GOP party officials said.
DNC officials have said they are not seeking to outraise the RNC, but rather build up the party to support the eventual nominee after the nominating convention this summer.
'We're seeing unprecedented enthusiasm for the Democratic Party, with half the Democratic field alone having already outraised the sitting incumbent president by tens of millions of dollars. The DNC made smart investments that led us to victories in 2017, 2018 and 2019, and is hard at work building the infrastructure necessary to do the same in 2020,' said Daniel Wessel, DNC spokesman.
The fourth-quarter figures notch a record for Trump's reelection machine, which has already raised and spent historic amounts toward securing a second term. It is unclear whether the money can overcome some of the president's challenges, including an approval rating that has hovered around 40-percent for his three years in office.
The money raised directly by the Trump campaign has been largely driven by online giving, coming in response to email, text and other appeals for $25 or $50 at a time.
As the incumbent president, Trump also benefits from big-money contributions through the joint fundraising committees with the national party. The cap for individual donors' contributions to national parties is $710,000 in the two-year period of an election cycle, far more than the $5,600 per-cycle limit for donations to a given candidate.
During his 2016 campaign, Trump attacked his rivals as beholden to large donors. But in the last year, the president increasingly participated in high-dollar fundraisers in locales such as New York and Los Angeles, with minimum ticket prices of $35,000.
He has also regularly raised money at his own hotel, raising ethical questions about driving business to his properties.
Trump's joint fundraising with the party has allowed him to use big-money contributions to finance some costly pieces of the reelection effort, including hosting big-dollar fundraisers and holding rallies for his supporters.
RNC officials say they have put $11 million into TV and digital ads against vulnerable Democrats who supported impeachment, and have built up the biggest staff in party history, with 400 people in 18 targeted states.

At the start of President Trump's impeachment trial, Democrats pinned their hopes on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), whose reputation as an institutionalist might lead him to back a call for witnesses.
Democrats were sorely disappointed late Thursday night as Alexander, who is retiring at the end of his third term, announced his opposition to such a move "" and offered an explanation they found lacking.
Alexander said the president did use military aid as leverage to pressure Ukraine's leader to investigate a Trump political rival, but he wouldn't join Democrats on calling witnesses.
'I think there's a big gap between this conduct and impeachable conduct; I don't think this is close. I think it's inappropriate,' Alexander said in an interview Friday morning.
Democrats had hoped that Alexander, 79, could build a coalition of Republicans who would at least support calling witnesses such as John Bolton, the former national security adviser whose forthcoming book alleges that Trump's goal in delaying $391 million in security aid to Ukraine was to force that nation to launch damaging political investigations of former vice president and 2020 candidate Joe Biden.
As Friday's debate over witnesses began, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) issued a statement opposing witnesses, eliminating the chance of a 50-50 vote that would have compelled Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. to decide whether to break the tie or let the motion for witnesses die.
Unlike Alexander, Murkowski called the case against Trump 'rushed and flawed' but said that the Senate was incapable of curing 'the shortcomings' and that she would oppose additional witnesses.
'I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate. I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything. It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed,' said Murkowski, who also cited attacks on Roberts as a factor in her decision.
That left Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Mitt Romney (Utah) as the only two Republicans poised to join all 47 members of the Democratic caucus in asking for more witnesses in a vote destined to fail.
Democrats had hoped that Alexander's background as a protector of the Senate's institutional prerogatives would make him a supporter of expanding the trial, especially given his early years as a top aide to then-Sen. Howard Baker (Tenn.), who served as the top Republican on the Senate Watergate Committee, which helped lead to Richard Nixon's resignation in the face of likely impeachment and removal in 1974.
'I was certainly hoping he would have a Howard Baker moment, you know, but it appears he will not,' Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said Friday morning.
Durbin said he was 'disappointed but not really surprised' by Alexander's decision, particularly because the Tennessean has been a close ally of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) since their shared days as Senate staffers.
While even-tempered and pragmatic in working with Democrats on legislation, Alexander has built a solid conservative record far different from those of the few remaining moderate GOP senators, who were closely watched for their votes.
In his own telling, Alexander said that he was never that close to voting for witnesses and that he delayed in stating a position in order to act as a prudent jurist in the trial while leaving open the possibility of wanting to hear more evidence.
To prepare for the trial, he said, he read two books: one by Edmund Ross, the senator from Kansas who cast the decisive vote in 1868 against removing President Andrew Johnson from office, and the other, 'Impeachment: An American History,' a collaborative book published in 2018 about all the cases against presidents.
Alexander read the newer book at his desk during Thursday's question-and-answer session, focusing on the chapter by Jon Meacham on Johnson's trial.
The senator said that 'many presidents have probably done similar things,' citing a talk he had with Jimmy Carter's attorney general, Griffin Bell, in which Bell said Carter had ordered him to indict on civil rights charges a Texas police officer who had received a short sentence in a brutal murder. Bell refused.
Alexander said a similar scenario should have happened when Trump wanted a probe of the Ukrainian energy firm that had Joe Biden's son Hunter on its board. 'If he wants to investigate the Bidens, he should give that information to the attorney general and let him handle it,' said Alexander, who continues to support Trump's reelection as honorary chairman of his Tennessee campaign.
He said that he has not spoken to Trump since a bill-signing ceremony at the White House in mid-December but that he came under fierce pressure from a collection of colleagues, close friends and others who had access to the president.
'I got some very impassioned emails from people who canonize President Trump or people who hate him,' Alexander said.
Three key elements convinced him that it was time to move.
First, with the election already underway and ballots printed in many early primary states, prolonging the trial could blow up that campaign. 'So we're tearing up the ballots and telling people basically, as an election is starting, you can't vote for or against President Trump,' he said.
Second, he said that the Founding Fathers disapproved of party-line impeachments in the House and that the Senate should dismiss those. 'I did not want to create a weapon of perpetual impeachment that the House could use to immobilize the Senate and immobilize the executive,' he said.
Finally, he believes that the House managers documented their case but did not show that it rose to an impeachable offense.
'Did he, at least in part, withhold aid in order to encourage that investigation? I thought the evidence was conclusive that he did,' Alexander said. 'The president might very well say, 'I did it because I cared about corruption,' but I was convinced that at least in part, he did it to encourage the investigation of the Bidens.'
Alexander said he is not sure what defines a 'high crime or misdemeanor' "" which the Constitution sets as the basis for removing a president "" but added that one key requirement is bipartisan support.
'I think you step back and say, is it something about which there is such a consensus that both Republicans and Democrats think the president ought to be removed? I guess the only example we really have of that is President Nixon,' he said.

 TRUMP CAllS RIVALS 'VICIOUS,' 'HORRIBLE'
Pelosi says president dishonors White House 
President Trump set off a new phase of political warfare Thursday, taking to the East Room of the White House to lambaste his opponents and praise his defenders during a bizarre and caustic performance celebrating his Senate acquittal that followed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's declaration that he was 'impeached forever.'
Veering between vitriolic and triumphant in a meandering speech that stretched past an hour, Trump sounded off against 'vicious and mean' Democrats and 'dirty cops' at the FBI, and he individually acknowledged Republican lawmakers he described as 'great warriors' for his cause.
'This is a day of celebration because we went through hell,' Trump told the crowd of supporters, describing his impeachment as 'all bullshit' and attacking several of his opponents in highly personal terms. He reminded Republicans that their fortunes were inextricably linked to his own "" and to his personal views of them.
About an hour before Trump spoke, Pelosi (D-Calif.) chided him for his behavior and defended her decision to tear up a copy of his State of the Union address by asserting that 'he's shredding the Constitution.'
The fiery words from Trump and Pelosi showed that the partisan bitterness that defined the nearly five-month-long impeachment process was worsening and could lead to a nasty nine months ahead of the November elections. As the president made clear he had little interest in putting impeachment behind him, Pelosi was indignant, telling reporters that Trump had dishonored the 'dignity of the White House' and launching into an extended criticism of his presidency.
During a day that began with the National Prayer Breakfast, Trump questioned the religious sincerity of Pelosi and Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), who voted Wednesday to convict the president on a charge of abuse of power. Pelosi, a Catholic, responded by saying Trump was ignorant about religion.
'He's talking about things that he knows little about, faith and prayer,' she said. 
Despite the negativity, both Trump and Pelosi used their remarks to make brief nods to the idea of working on bipartisan issues like infrastructure and health care. But such olive branches were dwarfed by a forest of vindictiveness, and continued political battle appeared to be the more likely path forward.
'These people are vicious,' Trump said during his East Room remarks, where supporters regaled him with laughter and applause. 'Adam Schiff is a vicious, horrible person. Nancy Pelosi is a horrible person.'
The spectacle stood in stark contrast to the speech given by President Bill Clinton after his acquittal on impeachment charges in 1999. Clinton expressed contrition in his Rose Garden remarks, saying he was 'profoundly sorry' and regretful for acts that led to his impeachment.
 Trump, on the other hand, declared himself completely innocent, and set out to settle scores. 
'We went through hell, unfairly,' he said, after holding up a front-page Washington Post story about his acquittal. 'Did nothing wrong. Did nothing wrong.'
He attacked former FBI director James B. Comey, former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III and FBI officials Lisa Page and Peter Strzok "" describing the former top law enforcement officials as 'top scum.'
Aitan Goelman, a lawyer for Strzok, called Trump's attacks 'unhinged.'
While none of those figures were involved in the impeachment process over Trump's Ukraine dealings, the president sought to paint his trial as the culmination of a years-long effort by government bureaucrats to delegitimize his presidency "" a conspiracy theory with no basis in fact. 
Pelosi also spent part of Thursday looking backward, lacing into Trump for a State of the Union address Tuesday that she said offered 'a state of mind that had no contact with reality whatsoever.' She handed reporters a list of economic statistics aimed at refuting Trump's claims that the economy he inherited from President Barack Obama had been in decline. 
'It's appalling the things that he says. And then you say to me: 'Tearing up his falsehoods, isn't that the wrong message?' No, it isn't,' she said, adding: 'I feel very liberated. I feel that I've extended every possible courtesy. I've shown every level of respect.'
Trump's address in the East Room amounted to a planting of the flag at the end of an impeachment process that has consumed his presidency and served as a test of loyalty for Republicans. 
Trump praised the lawmakers who showed the most fealty in his acquittal on the two charges while launching into deeply personal criticism of Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee and the sole GOP lawmaker to vote guilty on the abuse of power article of impeachment. 
Trump accused Romney, who cited his own deep Mormon faith in deciding to convict Trump, of using 'religion as a crutch.'
'Never heard him use it before,' Trump said. 'But today, you know, it's one of those things. But it's a failed presidential candidate, so things can happen when you fail so badly, running for president.'
He then heaped praise on the other senator from Utah, Mike Lee (R), calling him 'incredible' during a session in which he extended individual accolades to dozens of GOP allies, from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to White House Counsel Pat Cipollone.
McConnell ensured that the three-week trial had no witnesses or new evidence, leading to a swift acquittal for Trump. 
Republican lawmakers in attendance clapped throughout Trump's off-the-cuff remarks, signaling to the president that he was in need of no absolution for the conduct that got him impeached.
Trump was accused of abusing his power by withholding congressionally approved military aid from Ukraine while pushing the Eastern European country to launch investigations targeting Democrats, and of obstructing Congress by blocking the investigation into his conduct.
Near the end of the event at the White House, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) stood up and told Trump that his support remained rock-solid.
'This reflection today is a small reflection of the kind of support you have all across the country,' he said. 'We've got your back.'

Trump in turn stressed that GOP election-year prospects of holding the Senate majority and claiming the House are closely tied to him while he reminisced about his endorsements of several Republican candidates, crediting himself with propelling them to victory in previous races.

'I endorsed him. His numbers went through the roof,' Trump said of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R).
Trump did not mention the candidates he endorsed who lost, including in reliably Republican places such as Alabama, Louisiana and Kentucky.
The president instead focused on the unified support he has been able to amass within the Republican Party, loyalty he has secured in part through a willingness to launch direct and relentless attacks on Republicans who challenge him.
'I don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong,' the president said during the National Prayer Breakfast, an implicit reference to 

Romney.
The White House sent around anti-Romney talking points Thursday, attacking the senator as a self-serving politician with no core principles. 
Pelosi defended Romney, praising him for 'courage' and describing Trump's attacks on him as 'without class.'
In one sign that the partisan standoff was likely to continue after the impeachment process ended, both sides drove home opposing messages about what they took away from the third presidential impeachment in American history.
'He's impeached forever, no matter what he says,' Pelosi said. 'You're never getting rid of that scar.'
She also did not rule out continuing House investigations into Trump's Ukraine dealings. 
Trump, who walked into the East Room to the musical strains of 'Hail to the Chief,' said that while he was bothered by having the 'very dark word' of impeachment attached to his name, he was focusing on different terminology.
'But now we have that gorgeous word "" I never thought a word would sound so good,' he said. 'It's called 'total acquittal.' Total acquittal.'

MORE MAY FOLLOW VINDMAN, SONDLAND 
Purge indicates president not inclined to move on
President Trump on Friday punished two witnesses who testified in the investigation that led to his impeachment, removing them from their posts in an apparent campaign to exact retribution on his perceived enemies in the wake of his acquittal in the Senate this week.
The White House ousted Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman from his post on the National Security Council and recalled U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, moves that were quickly condemned as vindictive and an attempt to intimidate government officials who speak out against Trump.
Vindman, a decorated combat veteran who testified in November that he was disturbed by Trump's call for Ukraine to investigate the president's political rivals, was escorted out of the White House on Friday, according to his lawyer, David Pressman. 
'There is no question in the mind of any American why this man's job is over, why this country now has one less soldier serving it at the White House,' Pressman said in a statement. 'LTC Vindman was asked to leave for telling the truth. His honor, his commitment to right, frightened the powerful.'
Sondland, who donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, fell out of favor with the president after his testimony in November alleging that the president pursued an improper 'quid pro quo' tying military aid for Ukraine to political investigations. Trump has long wanted to remove Sondland but was counseled against doing so during the impeachment process, according to officials who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration deliberations.
Trump's push to remove Sondland and Vindman "" and to exact punishment on other figures involved in the nearly five-month impeachment process "" underscored how his fixation with settling scores is outweighing any effort to move on to less divisive issues in the wake of his acquittal. 
Vindman's twin brother, Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, was also removed from his job at the National Security Council, where he worked as a lawyer, and was escorted off the grounds Friday afternoon.
The firings of Sondland and Alexander Vindman amounted to a post-impeachment bloodletting of key figures who complied with congressional subpoenas and testified in a process that Trump sought to delegitimize as a 'hoax' and a 'witch hunt.'

'I'm not happy with him,' Trump said earlier Friday when asked about Vindman's future. 'You think I'm supposed to be happy with him? I'm not.'
There was little resistance from within the Republican Party to the idea of punishing Vindman, a Purple Heart recipient and Ukraine expert, after The Washington Post reported Thursday night that he could soon be removed from his White House job. Some GOP lawmakers egged the president on "" a sign of how much Trump has asserted his influence on the party. 
Many lawmakers appeared to take it as a given that a president who fired an FBI director during a federal investigation into his campaign and who attacked the religious sincerity of his perceived enemies during a prayer breakfast this week would set out for revenge in the wake of an effort to end his presidency. 
'I think the president's entitled to have whoever he wants on the NSC,' said Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.). 'It's not like they're being put on the street, they'll go back to "" in Vindman's case, he goes back to the Pentagon.'
Both of the Vindmans were detailed to the NSC and will return to jobs in the Defense Department, with Alexander Vindman then planning to report to the Army War College in July. 
But underscoring the sense of retribution is that Alexander Vindman recently told senior officials at the NSC and the Army that he intended to leave his White House position by the end of February, months ahead of schedule. That appears not to have been soon enough for the president.
Several other officials who testified during the House impeachment inquiry have left the government, including former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch; William B. Taylor Jr., her replacement; vice presidential aide Jennifer Williams; State Department official Michael McKinley; special envoy for Ukraine negotiations Kurt Volker; and NSC official Tim Morrison.
More firings are possible.
The president and his advisers have also discussed removing Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community, though no final decision has been made, officials said. Trump has expressed frustration that Atkinson allowed a whistleblower report documenting Trump's alleged misconduct toward Ukraine to be transmitted to Congress.
Some advisers have also counseled the president to remove Victoria Coates, the deputy national security adviser, who has told others in the White House that she fears her job is in jeopardy. 
Trump has regularly asked aides to continue slashing the size of the NSC, and national security adviser Robert C. O'Brien has said he plans to do so, telling NPR in an interview last month that the policy staff, which he put at about 180 people when he took over in September, was bloated.
By the end of February, O'Brien said, he hoped to have cut it by a third. A senior administration official said there will be widespread departures at the NSC in the next week.
The crux of the impeachment case against Trump was the allegation that he withheld military aid and a White House meeting to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden "" who served on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma while the elder Biden was vice president "" as well as a widely discredited theory that Ukrainians interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Sondland had been an ally of the president before his explosive testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. He told lawmakers that he had come to believe that the Trump administration was tying almost $400 million of security assistance for Ukraine to Trump's push to have the country investigate his political rivals.
'Everyone was in the loop,' he said of Trump's administration.
Trump denied the damning allegations, but he could not easily dismiss his top donor and appointee as a 'deep state' bureaucrat or 'Never Trump' operative. 
Trump regularly mocked Vindman for his uniform and how he spoke during his testimony, according to people who heard his comments and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss them. Of all the witnesses, Trump had the most visceral disdain for Vindman, White House officials said.
Trump has told White House officials that he believes Vindman was responsible for providing information about Trump's conduct to the whistleblower. That allegation, while unsubstantiated, formed the root of Trump's anger with Vindman, two White House officials said. 
Democrats called Vindman's removal vindictive.
'As usual, the White House runs away from the truth,' Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. 'Lt. Col. Vindman lived up to his oath to protect and defend our Constitution. This action is not a sign of strength. It only shows President Trump's weakness.'
It was not clear what other forms of retribution the White House might pursue in the wake of Trump's acquittal. A White House statement released after the Senate trial concluded Wednesday ominously posed a rhetorical question: 'Will there be no retribution?'
The White House did not respond to a request for comment Friday.
The Vindman brothers were among several people Trump mocked and attacked during a 63-minute event Thursday at the White House that was billed as his official public response to his acquittal.
In his testimony before House investigators, Vindman said he did not think it was 'proper' for Trump to 'demand that a foreign government investigate' the Bidens.
The 20-year Army veteran, who testified in his uniform, also described his family's journey from the Soviet Union to the United States, casting his upbringing and military service as a storied version of the American Dream. 
His remarks about how 'here, right matters' were repeated by House impeachment managers as they sought to make a case in the Senate that convicting Trump was a matter of simple right and wrong. 
In his rebuttal Thursday, Trump declared himself completely innocent and zeroed in on his perceived enemies.
'We went through hell, unfairly,' he said in the East Room. 'Did nothing wrong. Did nothing wrong.'
Speaking Thursday on Fox News, the White House press secretary described the president's mind-set in stark terms, saying that Trump had been treated unfairly by the impeachment process and that 'maybe people should pay for that.' 
The vengeance effort being pushed by White House officials, Republican lawmakers, Trump family members and other allies has broadened and intensified this week as Trump made clear he was not interested in moving on. 
During his speech Thursday, Trump publicly singled out several of his perceived enemies, describing them as 'vicious,' 'horrible,' 'bad,' 'dirty' and 'corrupt.'
The pugilistic response to impeachment has been endorsed by some of Trump's closest allies, indicating that vengeance will likely be a key theme of the president's reelection effort. While Trump was impeached on allegations he abused his power to pressure a foreign government to attack his political rivals, his latest efforts indicate that he plans to continue his no-holds-barred brand of politics.
The White House has been disseminating talking points attacking Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), the lone Republican to vote to convict Trump of abuse of power. Trump has privately discussed with Republican lawmakers ways to exact revenge on House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) for his leading role in the president's impeachment, according to people familiar with the conversations. Trump has tried to block the release of a tell-all book by former national security adviser John Bolton, and some Republicans are calling for Bolton's security clearance to be stripped.
GOP Senate committee chairmen are ramping up their investigation into Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine.
Trump's allies have framed the impeachment as part of a broader effort by Democrats to delegitimize his presidency, making the case that retribution is warranted.
'I really hope that Republicans learn to fight like the Democrats,' Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. said Thursday on Fox News. 'My father does the things that he does because he realizes, unlike so many in our party, that there is no acceptance of an apology. . . . They will cancel you. They will do whatever it takes to ruin you.'

Facing reelection battle, majority leader plays to base


FLORENCE, Ky. "" It is not easy these days to lose as a Republican running in ruby-red Kentucky. But that is what happened here in November in the governor's race, when the caustic incumbent managed to alienate enough of his base to fall just short.

This year, another polarizing and unpopular Republican will be up for reelection in the Bluegrass State. But Mitch McConnell has at least one key advantage that former governor Matt Bevin did not: As perhaps the most powerful man on Capitol Hill, he is positioned to drive a stake through efforts to oust a Republican who remains indisputably admired among Kentucky voters: President Trump.
The Senate majority leader's insistence that he will coordinate Trump's impeachment trial with the White House "" and that he has no intention of being impartial "" has provoked howls of protest from Democrats. On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) accused McConnell of orchestrating a 'coverup' of Trump's actions.
It has also prompted speculation that he could jeopardize his slender majority by exposing Republicans in swing or Democratic-leaning states to accusations that they went along with a rigged process running counter to the Constitution.
But here in Kentucky, it just looks like savvy politics.
The 77-year-old is expected to face a vigorous challenge in November from a decorated Marine fighter pilot with a record of big-dollar fundraising. Yet McConnell has shown an unerring instinct for self-preservation across six Senate terms and a record stint as Republican leader.

Analysts say his impeachment strategy is just more evidence that he is playing to win.
'It's the safest move he could make,' said Ryan Salzman, a politics professor at Northern Kentucky University. 'Anything that even appears he's going against President Trump on impeachment, in any way, would be the worst thing he could do for his reelection.'
So far, there is no suggestion that he will. Over weeks of negotiation, McConnell has refused to bow to pressure from Senate and House Democrats "" or even from more moderate members of his own caucus "" over how he will manage the process. The majority leader has instead vowed 'total coordination' with the White House.
With the trial expected to begin as soon as this week, there is no assurance that the Senate will subpoena witnesses or documents related to the Trump administration's campaign to force Ukraine to open an inquiry into presidential rival Joe Biden.
As the process unfolds, the pressure on McConnell is expected to intensify. Several Republican senators "" including Mitt Romney (Utah), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Susan Collins (Maine), the latter of whom is expected to face a tough reelection fight "" have either expressed misgivings about their leader's intentions or said directly that they want key witnesses, including former national security adviser John Bolton, to testify.
'We have to take that step back from being hand-in-glove with the defense,' Murkowski told an Alaska radio station late last month, adding that she was 'disturbed' by McConnell's coziness with the administration on impeachment.
But for now, McConnell "" who can afford to lose up to three votes while retaining a working majority "" has the support he needs to call the shots. The political calculus on McConnell's home front offers him little room to compromise, even if he wanted to.
To Trump's backers here in northern Kentucky "" the small cities, affluent suburbs and rolling hill country that fans out just across the muddy Ohio River from Cincinnati "" that is just how they like it. Many have long been wary of McConnell, deeming him overly willing to cut a deal and insufficiently committed to the president's agenda. His management of the president's trial, they say, will be a test.

'How he handles this impeachment is going to be the big determinant of whether people get behind him,' said Kevin Gordon, a talk radio host and activist.
Impeachment, Gordon said, was tantamount to 'an active coup' and should be given as little credence as possible.
'They should dismiss the charges outright. It's a sham,' Gordon said. 'If McConnell runs the trial the way the Democrats want, people here are not going to be happy.'

So far, conservatives said they like what they have seen.
State Sen. John Schickel credited McConnell for his 'steady hand' and for staying, by and large, in the good graces of Trump voters who are 'very, very, very passionate' in their defense of the president. But he also said McConnell is 'walking a tightrope.'
'He definitely has to watch his right flank. He's always had to,' said Schickel, who recently penned an opinion piece describing 12-weeks of paid parental leave for federal workers, which was agreed to by McConnell's Senate, as 'another step toward socialism.'
'The party leadership in northern Kentucky is very conservative and doesn't always like what he does,' Schickel said.
Last year's gubernatorial race offers a cautionary tale of what happens when a Kentucky politician, even a Republican one, takes the state's conservative voters for granted.
Bevin was infamous for his insults and bullying "" especially of opponents, but even of Republican allies. That caught up to him as the governor sought a second term. Bevin won the primary, but in the general election, matched against a relatively moderate Democrat with a deep pedigree in Kentucky politics, many steadfast Republicans sat the contest out.
'Bevin treated his conservative supporters terribly,' said Phyllis Sparks, a 58-year-old Republican activist who declined to vote for either of the top contenders in the governor's race. 'He didn't represent me or my values.'
Because of voters like Sparks, Bevin's support collapsed statewide, but most notably in northern Kentucky.
In Boone County, the suburban area outside Cincinnati where Sparks lives, Bevin's margin was cut by 20-percentage points compared with his first run. In the adjacent counties of Kenton and Campbell "" places Bevin had won handily in 2015 and Trump had carried by 25-points a year later "" the Democrat, Andy Beshear, flipped them en route to a 5,000-vote squeaker of a statewide victory.
The result galvanized Democrats, especially the campaign of Amy McGrath, the Marine veteran who is the favorite to win the party's primary and to challenge McConnell in the fall.
'It gave us momentum,' McGrath said in an interview. 'Matt Bevin was incredibly unpopular, and Kentuckians got rid of him. Mitch McConnell is also very unpopular.'

According to one poll last year, the majority leader has less support in his home state than any other senator, with just 37 percent of Kentuckians backing him.
Yet most prognosticators say McConnell's chances of winning reelection are strong, and even Democrats acknowledge that the comparison to Bevin has serious limitations.
For one thing, 'McConnell doesn't insult everyone on a daily basis, which Bevin did,' said Linda Nesbitt, chair of the Campbell County Democrats.
For another, McConnell will be running on a ticket with Trump, a president who enjoys a plus-14 net favorability in Kentucky, at the top. Though the two got off to a rocky start "" Trump's early months in office featured a presidential tweetstorm against the senator for his failure to repeal and replace Obamacare "" they have since found an accommodation.
'They're a team,' said Josh Holmes, a former McConnell chief of staff whose political consulting firm handles the senator's digital advertising. 'The president's agenda requires somebody like Mitch McConnell to get it done.'
Tax reform and judicial appointments are central pillars of Trump's record that were enabled by McConnell. Now impeachment will offer the senator a fresh, high-profile chance to showcase his value to the president "" and to Trump's supporters.
'He's handling impeachment like a surgeon would "" with precision,' said Sparks, who said she will eagerly volunteer for both Trump's and McConnell's campaigns this fall. 'McConnell's been a good ally of the president, and Trump's coattails are very long.'
An October poll found that just 29-percent of Kentuckians favor impeaching and removing Trump. That has made the issue a tricky one for McGrath, who came up short in a 2018 House election.
After the House voted to impeach the president in December, McConnell's campaign knocked the Democrat for releasing a lengthy statement that did not say specifically whether she supported the House's move. (She later clarified that she did.)
McGrath said in the interview that impeachment is rarely what voters most want to discuss with her, and that her message to them is focused far more on 'kitchen table' issues such as health care and education. To the extent that voters do bring up impeachment, she said, 'you get this feeling of, 'Let's move on.'-'
Still, she said she would continue speaking out against McConnell's handling of the trial, which she described as 'going against your oath under the Constitution.'
'Most Kentuckians want a fair trial,' she said.
Many Kentuckians, of course, do not even think it is worthy of a trial. Around the bar at PeeWee's "" a dimly lit but highly spirited watering hole popular among local Republicans "" even mention of the 'i-word' elicits sputtering condemnations of Democrats for daring to try to take down 'the best president we've ever had.'
In quieter corners, some offer more nuanced views. Paul Fiser, a 60-year-old lawyer, faulted Pelosi for going ahead with impeachment despite saying she would not proceed without bipartisan support. But he also criticized McConnell for saying he could not be an impartial juror.
Fiser said he had backed Trump 'reluctantly' in 2016 and would probably do so again in 2020. But he drew a distinction between the president "" still an outsider, even after three years in Washington "" and the Kentuckian who has walked the halls of Congress for more than three decades.
'McConnell has become the ultimate insider. But people are tired of business as usual. They're looking for unconventional candidates,' said Fiser, who described himself as undecided in the Senate race. 'He's not a lock like he's been in the past.'

Lev Parnas said he arrived for his May meeting in Kyiv with a top aide to Ukraine's president-elect, Volodymyr Zelensky, with a clear directive from Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer: Unless Zelensky announced an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden, one of Trump's possible 2020 rivals, his country's relationship with the United States would sour. 
Among the consequences he threatened, Parnas said in interviews this week: that Vice President Pence's expected attendance at Zelensky's inauguration later that month "" a high-level recognition that the Ukrainians urgently sought "" would be canceled. 
When Ukrainians were unresponsive, Parnas said he relayed the bad news to Giuliani. 'Okay, they'll see,' the president's lawyer responded, Parnas told MSNBC. 
The very next day, Trump instructed Pence to cancel his trip to Ukraine for Zelensky's inauguration, according to a whistleblower complaint and congressional testimony from one of Pence's own aides. 
The rapid sequence of events in mid-May marks one of the earliest known moments when Guiliani's shadow campaign to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations that would benefit Trump inextricably merged with official U.S. foreign policy "" and, if Parnas's account is accurate, appeared to move the levers of the American government. In the process, the vice president was dangled as a bargaining chip "" perhaps unwittingly "" to exert leverage over a foreign government, according to Parnas, a Soviet-born businessman who functioned as Giuliani's fixer in Ukraine.
Trump's supporters have attacked Parnas's credibility, noting that he is under indictment in New York for campaign finance violations. In a statement, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham called Parnas 'a man who is currently out on bail for federal crimes and is desperate to reduce his exposure to prison.'
Giuliani, who denied to the New York Times last year that he directed Parnas to deliver a warning to the Ukrainians, did not respond to requests for comment Thursday. The aide to Zelensky who met with Parnas, Serhiy Shefir, and an attorney for Igor Fruman, another Giuliani associate in attendance, have also disputed aspects of Parnas's account.
However, text messages and other documents released by the House this week, as well as congressional testimony during the impeachment inquiry, corroborate the timeline that Parnas detailed in interviews with MSNBC and CNN about the episode "" and show how a rogue operation engineered by Giuliani began subsuming official U.S. policy. 
'A very harsh message'
The takeover did not happen immediately. Beginning in 2018, Giuliani and two associates "" Parnas and Fruman "" spent months pursuing material in Ukraine to benefit Trump and agitating for the ouster of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, whose removal was sought by a top Ukrainian prosecutor who promised to help Trump in exchange.
By the spring of 2019, Giuliani's campaign finally seemed to be paying dividends. Yovanovitch was abruptly recalled back to the United States in late April. And Ukrainian government officials appeared willing to cooperate with Trump's lawyer "" particularly Yuri Lutsenko, at the time Ukraine's top prosecutor and a close political ally of then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. 
But when Zelensky "" a comedian and political neophyte "" trounced Poroshenko in the final round of Ukraine's presidential election in late April, Giuliani's project was thrown into doubt. 
In early May, as Zelensky prepared for his inauguration later that month, Giuliani tried to make inroads with the new Ukrainian leadership and planned a trip to Kyiv with the hope of meeting the president-elect. The former mayor told the Times on May-9 he was planning to ask Zelensky, among other things, to investigate the involvement of Biden's son on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. 
Giuliani asserted that his mission to Ukraine was a personal one, being undertaken to assist the president's personal defense in the special counsel investigation "" even though that probe had concluded.
'This isn't foreign policy,' Giuliani told the Times. 
In a letter dated May-10, sent through Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, Giuliani asked Zelensky for that meeting so he could make a 'specific request' in his 'capacity as personal counsel to President Trump and with his knowledge and consent.' He didn't mention Biden by name.
After Giuliani's travel plans became public and prompted an outcry, he scrapped the trip. Giuliani went on Fox News the night of May-10 and said he wasn't going to Kyiv because Zelensky was surrounded by enemies of Trump and enemies of the United States. The comments irked Zelensky's team in Kyiv, which wanted to secure Trump's support but saw his personal lawyer calling them enemies on cable television.
At that point, Parnas told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow in an interview that aired Wednesday, he was tapped by Giuliani to convey 'a very harsh message' "" that the U.S.-Ukrainian relationship 'would be sour' unless the Zelensky administration announced the investigations Giuliani wanted.
'The most important was the announcement of the Biden investigation,' he said. Without that, 'Pence would not show up' at Zelensky's inauguration.
While Giuliani emphasized his Ukraine trip was intended for Trump's personal benefit, Parnas said he went to Ukraine empowered to invoke core powers of the U.S. government "" military aid, official travel, a White House visit "" to force the Ukrainians' hand.
Messages exchanged on Whats App between Parnas and Shefir, the top Zelensky aide, show that the Giuliani associate introduced himself to the Ukrainian hours later on May 11. 
'I am mayor rudy Giuliani's friend please call me,' he wrote in Russian.
As his calling card, Parnas sent a copy of the letter Giuliani had sent to Zelensky to prove his association.
Shefir responded and agreed to meet Parnas on May-12 at an upscale restaurant in Kyiv. 
Parnas told Maddow that the meeting was tense. He said Shefir told him he would have to get back to Parnas with an answer to his demand. But when Parnas tried to message the Ukrainian aide that night for an update, he said he got no response.
The text messages show that evening, Parnas messaged Shefir saying, 'Serhiy good evening is there any news!'
Shefir didn't respond to any of Parnas's text messages after that, according to the cache of messages released by House Democrats.
In a statement to the Times in November, Shefir did not directly address what was discussed at the meeting but said that the Zelensky team did not view Parnas and Fruman, who accompanied him, as official representatives who 'could speak on behalf of the U.S. government.'
On the night of May-12, Parnas said, he called Giuliani and told him things were a 'no-go.'



Pence's top Russia adviser, Jennifer Williams, said she was surprised the following morning to receive a call from an assistant to Pence's chief of staff informing her that preliminary plans for Pence to travel to Ukraine for the inauguration had been canceled, she later testified to Congress.


Williams said the news was curious, because preparations were already underway. She testified that when she asked about the sudden change, she was told that Trump had directed Pence to skip the event "" but not the reason why. 
'My understanding from my colleague "" and, again, I wasn't there for the conversation "" was that the president asked the vice president not to attend,' Williams testified.
Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv were also taken aback by the change in plans, according to congressional witnesses.
David Holmes, an official in the U.S. Embassy, testified that he, too, had been told that Pence would be leading the delegation for Zelensky's inauguration. Later, he said he was informed that the White House had 'whittled down an initial proposed list for the official delegation to the inauguration from over a dozen individuals to just five,' led by then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry.
Zelensky's team had expected Pence to come because Biden led the delegation at Poroshenko's inauguration five years earlier. The Ukrainians were hoping Pence would attend to show continuity in U.S. support for Ukraine.
Marc Short, Pence's chief of staff, said that Parnas's account is not credible and should not be believed. 
'This is very simple: Lev Parnas is under a multi-count indictment and will say anything to anybody who will listen in hopes of staying out of prison,' he said in a statement. 'It's no surprise that only the liberal media is listening to him.' 
 Asked about Parnas by reporters as he traveled through Florida on Thursday, Pence said, 'I don't know the guy.' The vice president also dismissed as 'completely false' the speculation by Parnas that Pence was aware of the goal to get Zelensky to announce an investigation into Biden. 
A senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal knowledge, said that Pence and his team had no awareness of the meeting between Parnas and Shefir, nor was the vice president's office aware of any conversation between Giuliani and Trump immediately before Trump's directive to Pence that he skip Zelensky's inauguration. 
The official would not share what reason Trump gave Pence for canceling his trip, citing the White House's long-standing policy to not comment on private conversations between the president and the vice president.
A sudden change in tone
The Ukrainians desperately needed Trump's support as they faced a continuing war with Russian-backed proxies in the east, which since 2014 has left some 13,000 people dead. They were particularly eager to ensure a White House visit for Zelensky "" as a potent symbol of the United States' support for Ukraine and its untested new president in its ongoing struggle with powerful Russia. 
Weeks earlier, Zelensky had appeared to be on good footing with the Americans. In an April 21 phone call, Trump congratulated him on winning Ukraine's presidency in a warm conversation. 
'I think you will do a great job,' Trump told Zelensky, according to a transcript of the call released by the White House. 'I have many friends from Ukraine who know you and like you.'
After that call, Williams, the Pence aide, said she received an email from Pence's chief of staff, informing her that Trump had asked Pence to attend the Ukrainian president's inauguration. And on April 23, Pence congratulated Zelensky in a phone call of his own. According to Williams, who was listening to the call, Zelensky invited Pence to attend his inauguration and Pence accepted, provided the dates worked out.
The Ukrainians appeared startled by the sudden rebuff, Parnas said.
'Now they get word, because obviously, when Pence cancels, they get word that Pence is not coming,' he told MSNBC. 'So, now, they realize that what I "" what I was telling them was true.'
By the end of May, Trump's attitude toward Ukraine and Zelensky was hostile. 
During a meeting in the Oval Office, he told Perry, then-special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and then-U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland "" three top government officials he had tasked with leading U.S. policy toward Ukraine "" that he was skeptical that Ukraine was committed to anti-corruption efforts, according to congressional testimony.
Sondland testified that Trump also griped that Ukrainians had 'tried to take him down' in the 2016 election.
As the group pushed Trump to invite Zelensky to the White House, Sondland said, the president made it clear who was driving the U.S. posture toward Ukraine: 'He just kept saying: Talk to Rudy, talk to Rudy.'

Arguments for and against President Trump's ouster ended Monday in the Senate impeachment trial, with the House managers calling the president a danger to democracy because of his actions toward Ukraine and Trump's legal team arguing that impeachment, not Trump's conduct, is the real threat. 
Two days before Trump's expected acquittal, the two sides summarized their arguments and pleaded for agreement before a chamber that had largely made up its mind. Democrats have nowhere near the two-thirds of the Senate needed to remove Trump from office, and the only remaining drama centered on a few possible swing votes from each party, particularly the handful of Democrats who would hand Trump a messaging victory if they join Republicans on the final votes. 
In a floor speech, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) declined to announce his decision, but asked his colleagues to consider censuring Trump, a less severe rebuke than removal from office that few senators were willing to pursue. Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) said that he remains undecided about how he will vote.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) condemned the House's probe while also calling Trump's behavior 'shameful and wrong.' But she said she could not vote to convict.
Meanwhile, House manager Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) argued that senators who believe Trump will change in his approach to the presidency are mistaken. 
'He has betrayed our national security, and he will do so again. He has compromised our elections, and he will do so again. You will not change him. You cannot constrain him. He is who he is. Truth matters little to him. What's right matters even less and decency matters not at all,' Schiff said. 
White House Counsel Pat Cipollone argued that Trump has done 'nothing wrong.' 
'These types of impeachments must end,' he told the senators. 'You will vindicate the right to vote. You'll vindicate the Constitution. You'll vindicate the rule of law by rejecting these articles. And I ask you to do that on a bipartisan basis.' 
Closing statements from House managers and Trump's legal team consumed just over four hours on the Senate floor, a leisurely day reflecting the sense on Capitol Hill that the trial's outcome was a foregone conclusion. The Senate voted Friday to block witnesses and evidence related to Trump's conduct, barring additional information that could sway moderate Republicans and setting up a final vote for Wednesday, after Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday night. 
The feeling of anticlimax was heightened by a shift in the political spotlight toward Iowa, with the first nominating contest of the 2020 election Monday night. The four Democratic senators who are running for president were prevented from traveling to the early voting states until after the arguments concluded in the early afternoon. 
Both the House managers and Trump's legal team crafted their remarks with a view toward the campaign trail, as voters will decide the future of his presidency. 
'We're sitting here on the day that election season begins in Iowa. It is wrong. There is only one answer to that, and the answer is to reject those articles of impeachment, to have confidence in the American people, to have confidence in the result of the upcoming election, to have confidence and respect for the last election and not throw it out,' Cipollone said in his closing remarks. 
Trump is accused of withholding military aid and an Oval Office meeting to push Ukraine's leaders into announcing probes of Democrats, including former vice president Joe Biden, now a presidential candidate, and his son Hunter. The House impeached the president in December on two charges "" abuse of power and obstruction of Congress "" related to these allegations and his response to the investigation. 
Schiff argued that Trump lacks the character to comport himself properly as president, describing his behavior as 'far more destructive' than the actions of Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton that triggered their impeachment proceedings. 
'If you find that the House has proved his case and still vote to acquit, your name will be tied to his with a cord of steel and for all of history,' Schiff told Republicans who have called Trump's behavior inappropriate. 'But if you find the courage to stand up to him, to speak the awful truth to his rank falsehood, your place will be among the Davids who took on Goliath, if only you will say enough.'
Lawyers for Trump said his conduct was not improper and not impeachable. 
'However you are to define high crimes and misdemeanors, there is no definition that includes disagreeing with a policy decision as an acceptable ground to removal of a president of the United States,' said Trump attorney Jay Sekulow. 
More Senate Republicans have acknowledged since Friday that the president's behavior was problematic, though none is expected to cross party lines and vote to eject him from office. 
'I think it's not something that should have been done, and I think that [is] needlessly inviting a lot of controversy when you're going after a person that might not even be your opponent,' Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the chamber's president pro tempore, told NBC News. 

After Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) called Trump's conduct 'inappropriate' on Friday, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) told reporters, 'Let me be clear: Lamar speaks for lots and lots of us.' He declined to elaborate. 
At least 10 Senate Republicans have made similar comments, including Richard Burr (N.C.), Susan Collins (Maine), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Rob Portman (Ohio), Mitt Romney (Utah), Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.). But only Collins and Romney joined Democrats to vote in favor of witness testimony on Friday. 
These comments have contributed to speculation that Congress could pursue censure, as Manchin proposed. 'What the president did was wrong,' Manchin said in his floor speech.
But multiple senators of both parties dismissed the idea as they arrived at the Capitol on Monday.
Asked to gauge the appetite for censure among Republicans, Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) said, '. . . zero.'
The vast majority of Republicans, he said, believe that Trump committed no wrongdoing and that he has been subjected to a partisan, politically motivated investigation.
Several Democrats said they were also uninterested in the idea, calling it a punishment well short of what Trump's alleged conduct deserves.
'What he did was an impeachable offense. I think it's absolutely obvious, and giving a slap on the wrist doesn't do any good,' said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.).

'Namaste Trump.'
No, the president has not suddenly discovered the meditative glow of a good yoga session. He has, however, discovered the energizing power of a good political rally, Indian-style. 
President Trump will almost certainly not complete a new U.S.-India trade deal during his two-day visit this week to the world's most populous democracy. The trophy agreement has been repeatedly postponed amid trade tensions. 
Instead, the centerpiece of the brief trip is a massive rally in Trump's honor that his host, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has billed as 'Namaste Trump.' The greeting loosely translates from Sanskrit as, 'I bow to you,' which may appeal to Trump as much as the idea that the gathering Monday in Ahmedabad is expected to fill, or nearly fill, the world's largest cricket stadium.
Never mind that the projected stadium capacity is perhaps 120,000, not 'millions,' as Trump has exclaimed, and that it seems a stretch to estimate that a crowd approaching the population of New York City will line the streets for his arrival. 
'We're not treated very well by India, but I happen to like Prime Minister Modi a lot,' Trump said Tuesday, when asked about the dwindling likelihood that the trade pact would be ready. 'And he told me we'll have seven million people between the airport and the event. And the stadium, I understand, is sort of semi under construction, but it's going to be the largest stadium in the world. So it's going to be very exciting.'
By the time Trump spoke at a 'Keep America Great' rally in Colorado on Thursday, the promised crowd had grown.
'I hear they are going to have 10-million people,' he said.
The population of Ahmedabad, the largest city in Modi's home state of Gujarat, is roughly 5.5-million. In Trump's defense, the scale of a country with 1.3-billion people can be hard to fathom.
Whatever the numbers, Trump will draw a crowd that may be his largest ever. In addition to bragging rights, he hopes that popularity abroad can translate to votes back home. Although the Indian American diaspora of roughly 4.5-million people tends to vote Democratic, Trump has argued that his pro-business agenda and entrepreneurial background should be a draw.
Karthick Ramakrishnan, a professor of public policy and political science at the University of California at Riverside, directs the National Asian American Survey. He said that Indian Americans have been among the most liberal subset of Asian American voters.
'The Democratic Party had a lot more credibility as being seen as the party of anti-discrimination, more welcoming to immigrants, to Indian Americans,' Ramakrishnan said. 'That's made it very challenging, even before Trump, in terms of making inroads with the Indian American community.'
Ramakrishnan said he does not discount the value of events such as Trump's participation in a huge rally in Houston for the visiting Modi last fall, or the larger lovefest Modi has promised to Trump in India. But he said the effect on voters is likely to be slight.
'Whatever charm offensive that Trump engages in, it's going to have limited impact, just given the accumulated weight of other factors that have played out over time,' he said.
Against the appeal of Trump's naming of Indian Americans to prominent government positions "" such as Nikki Haley to the post of U.S. ambassador to the United Nations "" voters of Indian extraction will weigh 'statements that have ranged from racially insensitive to outright racist' as well as an end to a visa program that benefited some Indian families, Ramakrishnan said.
 Many Indian Americans live in the solidly blue states of California and New York, but there are also significant voting populations in Texas, Virginia, North Carolina and Georgia, all states Trump thinks he can win this year, as well as wealthy potential donors in states that won't go for Trump.
Richard Rossow, an India scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the outreach effort may be worthwhile 'if the Trump administration feels they can tap into that vein, as they did in the major engagement in Houston, as they're doing with the big rally and the bonhomie that they're trying to develop and rapport with Prime Minister Modi.'
Trump's affinity for Modi underlies the striking decision for a homebody president seeking reelection to travel halfway around the globe for a largely ceremonial social call. 
Modi is a Hindu nationalist with whom Trump shares a nativist governing philosophy and a flair for showmanship. It doesn't hurt that Modi has also shown a knack for pushing his own nation's agenda while stroking the U.S. leader's ego.
'His name is familiar to every person on the planet,' Modi said as he introduced Trump in Houston last year.
Trump appeared to have a delightful time in the unaccustomed role of second fiddle, marveling at the visiting Indian leader's popularity with Indian Americans, including many who had traveled long distances. He likened Modi to Elvis Presley, and the two leaders held hands.
Trump apparently took note when Modi flattered him with assurances that he is popular among Indians in India.
Trump is more popular in India than he is in many other nations, including traditional allies such as Germany and Britain. And whereas popular opinion of Trump has declined in many quarters overseas since he took office, he has roughly quadrupled his support in India since 2016, according to the Pew Research Center. About 56-percent of Indians have a positive view of Trump now, Pew's survey found. Supporters of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party were more likely to hold a favorable view of Trump.
British protesters flew a mocking 'Baby Trump' balloon in London, and crowds raised middle fingers to Trump's passing motorcade during the president's elaborate state visit to Britain last year.
The U.S.-India relationship has grown more important and more stable over the past decade, and the potential for widening trade, military and tourism ties appeals to Trump's business sensibilities. The Trump Organization has real estate holdings in the country, and Trump will hold an event in New Delhi aimed at drumming up business for U.S. firms. 
Friction over India's purchase of a Russian-made missile shield system hangs over Trump's visit, atop frustration on both sides that months of fitful talks failed to produce a trade pact. The two sides had hoped to have the pact completed for Modi's U.S. visit last September.
Trump told crowds last week that he wants to have a heart-to-heart with Modi over tariffs and a trade imbalance, and he hinted at a trade announcement, if not the full deal he had confidently predicted was at hand months ago. He suggested to reporters Tuesday that the full agreement might not come until after the election. 
'We got to talk a little business. They've been hitting us hard. They give us tariffs "" one of the highest in the world is India,' Trump said in Colorado.
The U.S. trade deficit with India reached $24.1-billion last year, according to statistics compiled by S-P Global. U.S. exports to India are rising, but the growth in Indian exports to the United States was nearly double the growth of U.S. exports to India last year.
Trump will be the fourth consecutive U.S. president to visit India, a major Asian economic power that is a regional counterweight to China. India is also a potent military power, and Trump is likely to try to close two major arms deals while he is in New Delhi, said Jeff Smith, a South Asia research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. He will also point to a growth in energy cooperation, Smith said.
'I actually think this administration has quite a bit to celebrate in terms of adding the building blocks' of the two countries' economic and strategic relationship, Smith said.
Trump administration officials who outlined the 36-hour trip for reporters Friday said Trump will address alleged human rights abuses in Kashmir and U.S. concerns that Modi is discriminating against non-Hindus. Analysts have predicted that any real criticism on those issues will be delivered in private.
'President Trump will talk about our shared tradition of democracy and freedom of religion in his public remarks and certainly in private,' one official said. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the record.
A light presidential touch on human rights has worried some on Capitol Hill.
Four senators, two Republicans and two Democrats, sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo this month requesting an assessment of the human rights situation in Kashmir and of the rights of religious minorities in India. 
'We write as longtime friends of India regarding some of the troubling actions taken by the current government,' wrote Sens. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Todd C. Young (R-Ind.), Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) 
'India has now imposed the longest-ever Internet shut down by a democracy, disrupting access to medical care, business, and education for seven million people. Hundreds of Kashmiris remain in 'preventive detention,' including key political figures,' the senators wrote.
In an interview, Van Hollen said the senators had not yet received a response. If Trump fails to take a firm stand against Modi's policies, the silence can be read as acquiescence, Van Hollen warned.
'When you look at the president's foreign policy generally, he's been AWOL on human rights issues. Obviously when you look at human rights issues more broadly, he's a very imperfect messenger, given that he's stoked religious and ethnic divisions here at home,' Van Hollen said.

IMPEACHMENT DEFENSE BEGINS
Democrats accused of bid to rig November election
Lawyers for President Trump argued Saturday that he had valid reasons for withholding military aid from Ukraine and that House prosecutors overlooked facts that are more favorable to his case, giving a short preview of the aggressive defense they are expected to mount this coming week in the Senate impeachment trial.
In a two-hour presentation that reserved their most provocative attacks for Monday, members of Trump's legal team echoed the president's justifications for his actions toward Ukraine and sought to plant doubts about both the prosecutors' case and its lead advocate, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).

Yet, in arguing that the case for Trump's removal was partisan and misleading, lawyers for the president omitted facts, presented claims that lacked context or minimized evidence gathered by House investigators. Their most sweeping arguments did not specifically defend Trump but instead framed impeachment as no more than a politically motivated effort to remove him from the ballot in November.
'They're here to perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in American history,' said White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, who asserted that Trump did 'absolutely nothing wrong.' 
'We can't allow that to happen. It would violate our Constitution. It would violate our history. It would violate our obligations to the future,' Cipollone told the Senate. 'And most importantly, it would violate the sacred trust that the American people have placed in you.'
After three days of arguments from House Democrats in favor of Trump's removal, most Senate Republicans rallied behind the president's defense, predicting acquittal. But a small group of closely watched Republicans largely reserved judgment or declined to comment, leaving open the question of whether the trial will include witnesses. Democrats need four Republicans to join them to secure further testimony or evidence.
Trump faces the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history amid accusations that he withheld military aid and an Oval Office meeting to pressure Ukraine's leaders into announcing investigations of his political rivals, including former vice president Joe Biden, now a presidential candidate. Trump was impeached by the House in December on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to these allegations and his directive that his administration not cooperate with the House's investigation. 
His team's opening argument came on a day when more evidence emerged outside the Senate: A video was released showing Trump ordering the firing of Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, at a 2018 donor dinner. His order came minutes after Ukrainian American business executive Lev Parnas criticized her as an impediment. 
Yovanovitch was removed more than a year later. Parnas is now under indictment on campaign-finance charges, and the video was released by Parnas's attorney.
At the end of a marathon week of presentations by Democrats before the Senate, Trump's lawyers began speaking at 10-a.m. and ended by noon, allowing senators to return home for a short period before the trial resumes at 1-p.m. Monday. The next session is expected to include full-throated attacks on Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma while his father was in office and has become a target for criticism by Republicans. The intent is to argue that Trump was justified in seeking investigations into the Bidens despite the Ukrainian government's never accusing them of any wrongdoing.
On Tuesday, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. chastised the House managers and the president's defense team for using overheated rhetoric as they debated ground rules for the trial. But when Trump's lawyers began rebutting the managers' case Saturday, their tone was largely subdued. 
'We are going to be very respectful of your time,' Cipollone said in his opening remarks. 'You heard the House managers speak for nearly 24 hours over three days. We don't anticipate using that much time.' 
The lawyers painted Trump as having sincere concerns about corruption in Ukraine, despite evidence to the contrary, and suggested he was justified in doubting the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia, not Ukraine, interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
In taking this approach, the lawyers landed repeatedly on themes that matter to Trump, including what he has described as his 'perfect' July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's report, and omissions and errors by the FBI in documents submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court during the 2016 investigation of the Trump campaign and Russian interference in the election. 
Because of that case, Trump attorney Jay Sekulow argued, the president had reason not to 'blindly trust some of the advice he was being given' by intelligence officials. 
Taken together, the lawyers' remarks laid the foundation for a defense of Trump's unconventional foreign policy toward Ukraine, led by his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani; and an attempt to shore up Trump's claim that by seeking investigations of the Bidens, he was working to fight corruption, not undermine a political opponent whom he might face in November. 
Focusing on the July 25 call, Deputy White House Counsel Michael Purpura suggested that witnesses who expressed concerns about it were politically motivated and said Trump's conversation with Zelensky reflected the administration's 'legitimate concerns about corruption' in Ukraine. 
A rough transcript released by the White House shows the president did not mention 'corruption' or a general concern about the issue "" only a theory about Ukrainian influence in the 2016 election that has been discredited and his request that Kyiv scrutinize the Bidens.
Purpura also spent considerable time claiming that Ukraine did not learn about the hold on military aid until late August.
'There can't be a threat without the person knowing he's being threatened,' he said.
While two Trump administration figures "" Pentagon official Laura Cooper and State Department official Catherine Croft "" testified that they believed that Ukrainians knew about the hold before that time, Purpura argued that others' testimony was more credible. 
The second part of the defense's presentation sought to raise doubts about the legal and constitutional validity of the impeachment inquiry. Deputy White House Counsel Patrick Philbin also mentioned the anonymous whistleblower whose report helped launch the impeachment probe, and the House's decision not to investigate the person's motives.
'Motivations, bias, reasons for wanting to bring this complaint could be relevant,' Philbin said. 'But there wasn't any inquiry into that.'
The details of the whistleblower's memo were confirmed by the rough transcript of the July 25 call released by the White House and by the evidence gathered during the House investigation. 
In several instances, Trump's lawyers attacked Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a leader of the impeachment inquiry. 
Philbin noted that Schiff had once mischaracterized his staff's dealings with the whistleblower. Purpura also showed a video clip of Schiff parodying dialogue from the July 25 call during a House hearing, a dramatic embellishment that Trump and his allies say obliterates Schiff's credibility. 
'We can shrug it off and say we were making light or a joke. But that was in a hearing in the United States House of Representatives discussing the removal of the president of the United States from office,' Purpura said. 'There are very few things, if any, that can be as grave and as serious.'
Senators already allied with Trump declared the presentation a slam-dunk. 

'In two hours, the White House counsel entirely shredded the case by the House managers,' Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) told reporters, echoing several other Republicans who used a form of the word shred to characterize the effect of the lawyers' arguments.
But moderate Republican senators "" whose votes will determine whether additional evidence is sought in the trial "" did not share detailed opinions on the presentation or the possible need for witnesses. 
'I think it's very likely I'll be in favor of witnesses, but I haven't made a decision finally yet and I won't until both side's opening arguments are done,' Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters on Capitol Hill. 
'I thought for the most part, the House managers were effective, and I thought the president's attorneys this morning were very effective,' Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) told CBS News. 
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) declined to comment when approached by The Washington Post. 
A handful of moderate Democratic senators "" who could prove pivotal if they choose to side with Republicans "" declared witnesses necessary to the process. 
'I thought they did a good job in presenting the defense for the president,' Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) said. '[But] the most important thing I took away from today was they made very clear that there's not one witness that we've heard from . . . that had direct contact with the president.' 
Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) said he was 'stunned' that Trump's lawyers argued at one point that cross-examination is essential to due process, even as the White House bars witnesses from testifying on Trump's dealings with Ukraine. 
'The American people deserve the truth. They deserve the whole truth,' Jones said. 'We're not getting it.'
The House managers were not permitted to speak during Saturday's session "" though they drew some attention around 9:50 a.m. as part of a procession transferring their 28,578-page trial record across the Capitol to the Senate.
'They don't contest the basic architecture of the scheme,' Schiff said at a news conference after the presentation by Trump's lawyers. 'They do not contest that the president solicited a foreign nation to interfere in our election, to help him cheat. I think they acknowledged by not even contesting this that the facts are overwhelming.'
In his closing, Cipollone shifted the charges facing the president onto Democrats "" a strategy often employed by Trump himself. 
'It would be a completely irresponsible abuse of power to do what they're asking you to do "" to stop an election, to interfere in an election, and to remove the president of the United States from the ballot,' he said. 'Let the people decide for themselves.'

President comes off as collegial even as he defends his rhetoric

SCRANTON, Pa. - President Trump jetted into Joe Biden's boyhood hometown days after the former vice president secured front-runner status in the race to challenge Trump in November.
During an hour-long Fox News-hosted town hall here, Trump twice defended his divisive rhetoric as a key to his political success, questioned Biden's mental acuity and predicted a coming together post-election.
Before a friendly audience, Trump faced some pointed, if gently phrased, questions from his own backers. One man who was identified as a Trump supporter asked the president if ""we can deliver your message without the controversial rhetoric.""
A notably subdued Trump twice said that he appreciated the question but defended how he communicates as his way of responding to criticism.
""When they hit us, we have to hit back,"" Trump said. ""I could turn my cheek, but I wouldn't be sitting up here if I turned my cheek.""
Trump later mocked Biden over a series of verbal gaffes, pausing for the audience's laughter, and said, ""there's something going on there."" The president also argued that the House impeachment over his asking a foreign leader to investigate Biden damaged the former vice president more than it did him.
""They aimed at Trump and they took Biden down,"" Trump said.
Trump chose Scranton, his chief rival's birthplace, to hold the event, according to Fox News, which said it has let other presidential candidates select the locations for their town halls.
The presidential motorcade sped by an electronic billboard that read ""Scranton is Joe Biden country,"" and Trump was greeted by dozens of protesters near the Scranton Cultural Center, the venue for the town hall.
But inside, Trump faced a much friendlier welcome, as the audience greeted him with warm applause and repeatedly chanted ""four more years!"" during a commercial break. Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, was similarly greeted with applause by supporters before the event began.
If Biden is the Democratic nominee, northeast Pennsylvania will be a hard-fought area. In 2016, Trump held a rally in Scranton the night before Election Day. He overperformed expectations in that region, leading to his surprise victory over Hillary Clinton in the state.
Trump said he'd been prepping for a run against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) but now was resetting his sights on Biden. He blamed Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who suspended her candidacy for the presidential nomination earlier Thursday, for siphoning votes from Sanders by staying in the race beyond Super Tuesday. 
He was echoing a criticism relayed by some liberals upset that their flank of the party did not unite behind a candidate like the moderates did behind Biden shortly before Tuesday's primaries.
""If she's a true progressive, which probably she is, she probably should've dropped out three days ago,"" Trump said. ""Bernie Sanders would've won five, six, seven states, would've won Minnesota. . . . So when you look at it, she did him no favors. That was not a good friendship.""
On the subject of friendship, Trump was asked in a lightning round to name his closest friend in Washington. He demurred, saying there were too many, but that he's close to Vice President Pence and members of Congress, even Democrats.
""We have great people in Washington and great Democrats, too. I speak to the Democrats, too, believe it or not,"" Trump said. ""We have great, great people in Washington. It's going to come together. And it's going to be sooner than you think.""
The president sounded a similar, uncharacteristically collegial note when a woman wearing a sparkling Trump pin told him people in her life don't speak to her because she's a supporter of his. She asked him how he would bring the country together.
Trump reiterated his answer from earlier about how he has to fight back but also said, ""I really believe we are going to win this next election, and when we do, the other side is going to say, 'Okay, that's it, let's get along.' ""
It's similar to a claim often made by Biden that his victory would soften the partisan polarization.
While the town hall touched on issues from health care to immigration to foreign policy, other questions forced the president to offer some personal introspection.
Trump said he missed being able to walk down the street or into a store where he'd be recognized, but he could still do it. 
""I miss that sort of free life, and this is not a free life,"" Trump said. ""But I love what we are doing, because we are accomplishing more than anybody has ever - I view it as we're saving this country, this country was going wrong.""

 President Trump and White House officials are looking for at least one Senate Democrat to vote against removing the president from office at the end of his impeachment trial, and they see Joe Manchin III (W.Va.) as the most likely candidate. 
Trump took particular pride that three House Democrats voted against his impeachment, White House officials said, and he would like to be able to get at least one Senate Democrat to vote for his acquittal so he can claim the decision was bipartisan.
Manchin has sided with Trump on tough votes before, such as the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh. But voting to acquit the president would be an even more politically charged decision, one that could help him maintain his reputation as a moderate back home but would probably make him a pariah within his own party.
He struck a conciliatory note toward the president Saturday, becoming the only Democrat to publicly praise Trump's defense team even as he called for more witnesses, such as former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.
'I thought they did a good job in presenting the defense for the president,' he said. 'The most important thing I took away from today was, they made very clear that there's not one witness that we've heard from . . . that had direct contact with the president. That reaffirms why I have said we should have witnesses.' 
Manchin, 72, isn't the only moderate Democrat who White House aides said they believe could vote to acquit the president. Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.) and Doug Jones (Ala.) are also considered possibilities because they represent states Trump won in 2016. 
But Manchin is the only one they consider able to be swayed not only by politics back home but also by his relationship with the president, according to aides who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss issues involving the impeachment trial.
Trump has interacted with Manchin "" a brawny, backslapping former governor "" more than any Democrat in the Senate. Manchin has come over for movie screenings, including 'Darkest Hour,' the 2017 historical drama about Winston Churchill, and the president has given him tours of the family residence and his private study.
'I'm not going to have the kind of relationship with him that Democrats have,' Manchin said in an interview last month.
A White House official noted that Trump has done several favors for Manchin "" including giving two basketball players, Jerry West and Bob Cousy, the Medal of Freedom "" at the senator's urging.
Trump agreed to take pictures with Manchin that were used in the senator's 2018 campaign, and the president has called him out of the blue just to talk politics while repeatedly asking him to become a Republican. People close to the president said he has more affection for Manchin than any other Senate Democrat, and that he understands the transactional nature of the relationship.
Trump recently made a show of his support for a bill he signed into law last year that was championed by Manchin concerning pension and health-care benefits for coal miners.
'We will get this done for our great Miners!' Trump wrote on Jan. 10 in a quote-tweet of Manchin's month-old tweet promoting the deal over the legislation.
Trump has not directly lobbied Manchin on impeachment since the trial started, counting on their past relationship and political pressure back home to weigh on the West Virginian. But people close to the senator and the president said they believe Trump may reach out before the trial is done.
The last time the two spoke was in December, when Trump signed the provisions for coal miners into law as part of a bigger legislative package. But Manchin met at the White House this month ahead of the Senate trial with senior aides, including legislative affairs director Eric Ueland, who is taking a central role in the impeachment fight. A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment.
Senate Democrats are warily eyeing Manchin, nervous about how he will vote. A senior Democratic aide said Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) was pleased that Manchin has pushed for new documents from the administration and for witnesses to appear before the Senate, even in local media, but they have received no assurances on how he will vote.
'Every member is making up their own mind,' Schumer said in a statement to The Washington Post. 'They know how I feel.'
People who have spoken with the senator said he believes the president behaved improperly but has not decided whether it is an impeachable defense "" and is concerned about what precedent it might set to remove Trump from office. 
In several ways, Manchin is distinct. He was reelected in 2018 after Trump went into his state several times, telling West Virginians that their senator was consistently voting against the president's agenda. An array of presidential surrogates also visited the state to campaign for Patrick Morrissey, Manchin's opponent. 
'He voted against everything,' Trump said at a West Virginia rally in 2018. Donald Trump Jr. called Manchin 'Schumer's little pet' in one of his visits to the state. But Manchin won despite the president's popularity in the state.
When the two men had lunch just after the 2018 midterm election at the White House, Trump turned to Ivanka Trump and Vice President Pence, smiled and said: 'I told you we couldn't beat him.'
'Well, hell, it wasn't for a lack of trying,' Manchin said he responded, mentioning that Trump visited West Virginia multiple times.
The president then laughed and said, 'Oh, Joe, you know I like you,' according to Manchin. The senator said he shrugged it off and they had lunch for almost two hours. 
'We understand what game we're in,' he said. 'It's a tough business.'
Manchin has voted with the president more than 53 percent of the time, according to the website FiveThirtyEight "" more than any other current Democratic senator. 
Still, he said he has been repeatedly disappointed with Trump on policy issues. He said he wanted the president to pass a different tax bill, one that didn't provide as big a tax break to corporations. On gun violence, he said he had several substantive conversations with the president, where Trump seemed like he was willing to pass some restrictions on firearms and buck the powerful National Rifle Association, but ultimately did not.
'Every time I have spoken to him, his instincts have always been very moderate, very common sense,' Manchin said. 'By the time the last person comes in and hits him with this and that and the polls, we lose him. I think if the political pundits didn't get in his face all the time and make him think he's going to lose this election if you lose one of your followers, we could get something done. He has a hardcore political staff. They say, 'It's all about the base. You might lose one voter.' And then he backs down.'
The senator has had less positive interactions with some of the president's staff, including senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and Mike Williams, a top aide to Mulvaney. 
'I don't see anything good there,' he said of Miller and Mulvaney. 
Manchin said Trump would be better off if he took on issues such as lowering prescription drug prices and pushing a bipartisan infrastructure package and said he wanted to work with the president.
'We have a good relationship because we connect,' he said.

Senate lowering bar for presidents' permissible conduct, historians say

The evidence of President Trump's actions to pressure Ukraine was never in serious dispute. After a systematic presentation of the facts of the case, even some Senate Republicans concluded that what he did was wrong.
But neither was the verdict of Trump's impeachment trial ever in doubt. The Senate's jurors are scheduled to etch an almost-certain acquittal into the historical record on Wednesday.
The impending judgment that the president's actions do not warrant his removal from office serves as a testament to Washington's extraordinary partisan divide and to Trump's uncontested hold on the Republican base. The expected acquittal also has profound and long-term ramifications for America's institutions and the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches, according to numerous historians and legal experts.
In effect, they say, the Senate is lowering the bar for permissible conduct for future presidents.

'It's a dispiriting moment for an American system that in many ways was founded on the insight that, because humankind is frail and fallen and fallible, no one branch of government can have too much power,' said Jon Meacham, an American historian and author. 'The president's party, instead of being a check on an individual's impulses and ambitions, has become an instrument of them.'
Since the moment House Democrats opened their impeachment inquiry in September, Trump has projected a sense of persecution and self-pity. He called the effort a coup to overthrow him and defraud the results of the 2016 election.
Again and again, Trump proclaimed on Twitter, 'READ THE TRANSCRIPT!' "" though the notes from his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not seem to exonerate him. Rather, the notes made plain Trump's scheme to get Ukraine to open an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.
With Trump commanding such exceptionally high approval ratings among Republican voters, however, even senators who acknowledged his actions were wrong voted Friday to block new evidence in the trial and pave the way for acquittal.

One of Democrats' great hopes to permit fresh testimony from firsthand witnesses, including former national security adviser John Bolton, had been Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), a self-described institutionalist who is retiring and would not have to face the wrath of the GOP's pro-Trump base.
But Alexander demurred. Although he said Trump's actions were 'inappropriate' and had 'already been proven' by House impeachment managers, the senator said that there was 'no need for more evidence' and that he believed Trump's conduct did not meet the Constitution's standard of 'treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors' for an impeachable offense.
'Let the people decide,' Alexander said in a lengthy statement Thursday explaining his position.
Another Republican seen as a possible supporter for permitting witness testimony, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, also came down against doing so. Although she did not comment specifically on Trump's actions with Ukraine, she faulted the overall impeachment process as too partisan and unfair.
'I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything,' Murkowski said in a statement. 'It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed.'
Only two Republicans "" Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine "" voted to allow additional testimony, two votes shy of the threshold required for the measure to pass. And with the final impeachment vote requiring a two-thirds majority to convict the president, the outcome seems preordained.
'This impeachment was a fait accompli at all times,' said Bill Whalen, a fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University. 'You talk to congressional Republicans and there's a feeling that the president is being persecuted, that impeachment was a conviction in search of a crime.'
William A. Galston, chair of the Brookings Institution's Governance Studies Program, said acquittal 'was not only perfectly predictable, but in my judgment, completely inevitable.'
'The United States political scene is as deeply polarized along partisan lines as it has been for at least a century,' Galston added. Noting Trump's high ratings among Republican voters, he said, 'It would take a very brave Republican indeed to break ranks with the president under these circumstances.'

This is not the first instance in which Trump has skirted penalties for wielding the powers of his office for personal or political gain. Former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III found that the president repeatedly worked to block or thwart the Russia investigation, acts that could potentially have prompted obstruction of justice charges were he not a sitting president.
But Trump sidestepped any serious penalties then, just as he appears to now with Ukraine.
One of the president's lawyers, Alan Dershowitz, proffered a sweeping argument on the floor of the Senate last week that Trump using the powers of his office to pressure Ukraine to open a corruption investigation into the Bidens was not impeachable or illegal because it was done in pursuit of his reelection.
'If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment,' Dershowitz said during the trial.
In the face of stinging criticism from constitutional scholars and legal experts, Dershowitz said later on Twitter that his comments were being mischaracterized. 'A president seeking re-election cannot do anything he wants,' Dershowitz wrote. 'He is not above the law.'

Still, Dershowitz's argument was persuasive for some Republican senators looking for arguments with which to defend Trump irrespective of what the evidence showed.
'Let's say it's true, okay? Dershowitz last night explained that if you're looking at it from a constitutional point of view, that that is not something that is impeachable,' Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) told reporters.
Timothy Naftali, a historian at New York University and former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, said the arguments advanced on Trump's behalf in the Senate trial could have lasting consequences for the future of presidential power.
'The Republicans have embraced a theory that permits future abuses of power,' Naftali said. 'The outcome of acquittal was predictable . . . but I'm afraid that this process in the Senate is more enabling of an abusive president than expected.'
The nation's founders gave Congress oversight responsibilities and powers of impeachment as a check on the executive. Yet, with this week's likely acquittal of Trump, Meacham argues, the Senate instead has become a tool in the president's perpetuation of his own power.
'It is not hyperbolic to say that the Republican Party treats Donald Trump more like a king than a president,' Meacham said. 'That was a central and consuming anxiety of the framers. It is a remarkable thing to watch the party of Lincoln and Eisenhower and Reagan and the Bushes become an instrument of Donald Trump's. That's a massive historical story.'

Congressional Republicans showed little sign Wednesday that they would move to check President Trump's brash public intervention in the federal prosecution of a former campaign confidant, leaving Democrats largely alone to fume about the evaporation of another norm of American governance.
Trump this week publicly decried a Justice Department sentencing recommendation for political operative Roger Stone, then congratulated Attorney General William P. Barr in a tweet Wednesday for 'taking charge' and overruling it "" creating at least the appearance that the long-standing taboo against overt political influence on prosecutorial matters had been obliterated.
But what ensued on Capitol Hill on Wednesday appeared to be less of a break-the-glass moment of crisis and more of a recurring episode in a three-year-old soap opera: While Democrats were aghast, members of the president's party either expressed mild dismay or excused Trump's tampering entirely. 
'It doesn't bother me at all, as long as the judge has the final decision,' said Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), a former Senate Judiciary Committee chairman who sharply criticized the administration of President Barack Obama for alleged politicization of the Justice Department.
He added about the president's tweet: 'I think a president's got freedom of speech just like everybody else has.'
Democrats cast the lack of pushback as further evidence that Trump feels emboldened, unchecked and unleashed after his Senate acquittal on two impeachment charges "" abuse of power and obstruction of Congress "" at his trial, which ended last week. 
Besides the president's public statements on the Stone case, Democrats pointed to his dismissal of subordinates who testified in the House impeachment probe and his decision to withdraw one executive nomination this week "" that of a former U.S. attorney who had overseen the Stone case at an earlier stage "" and the possible abandonment of a Defense Department nominee who had questioned a White House hold on military aid to Ukraine. 
 Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) seized on the demise of the nomination of Jessie K. Liu to serve as undersecretary of the Treasury Department for terrorism and financial crimes as proof that Trump is 'on a retribution tour.'
'I mean, it's just one thing after another,' said Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, where Liu was set to testify Thursday at her confirmation hearing. 'The president clearly feels he's unleashed. And [Republicans] all said he learned his lesson "" the lesson he learned is he can get away with whatever he wants.'
Asked what lessons he learned from impeachment, Trump said Wednesday, 'That the Democrats are crooked. They got a lot of crooked things going. That they're vicious.'
Tempering the Democratic outrage has been the reality of their tenuous political position: In the Senate minority, they have no direct power to call hearings or force action by the Republican majority. The Democratic House majority, meanwhile, has been chastened by the failed impeachment effort and a desire among party leaders to turn a page from Trump investigations and toward an economic policy message as Election Day draws closer. 
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said Wednesday that Barr would make his first appearance as Trump's attorney general before the panel on March-31. Nadler told Barr in a letter that the recent tumult has raised 'grave questions about your leadership of the Department of Justice.' 
Nadler indicated that the panel would inquire about the handling of the Stone case and other prosecutions related to Trump, as well as Barr's decision to evaluate material that Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump's personal attorney, had gathered from Ukrainian sources claiming to have damaging information about former vice president Joe Biden and his son.
The seven-week delay in getting answers vexed many Democrats, who cast Trump's intervention in Stone's sentencing as a matter of grave constitutional concern. 
'Seven weeks would not be an inordinate delay in normal times,' said Rep. Jamie B. Raskin (D-Md.), a Judiciary Committee member. 'This is Trump time we're dealing with, and so that is multiple felonies and high crimes and misdemeanors from now.'
Nadler declined to comment about the timing of the hearing.
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) on Wednesday chose stronger words, calling the overt intervention in the Stone case 'one of the most horrible things President Trump has done' and 'Third World behavior, not American behavior.'
The decision to overrule the initial sentencing recommendation led four career prosecutors to withdraw from the case Tuesday.
Schumer's call for emergency oversight hearings putting Barr and other Justice Department officials under oath was quickly dismissed by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), who said Wednesday that after a conversation with Barr, he was 'very confident' that the department has acted properly. Graham also gently rapped Trump for speaking publicly about the case.
'These people were way out of bounds in my view,' he said of the front-line prosecutors, who recommended a sentence as long as nine years for Stone after his conviction for lying to Congress and tampering with a witness. 'You're not gonna go to seven to nine years on a 70-year-old guy when the alleged victim said they didn't feel threatened. That's just revenge. That's sour grapes. But having said that, the president shouldn't have said anything.'
The GOP reaction this week was markedly different from when, in 2016, then-Attorney General Loretta E. Lynch met privately with former president Bill Clinton on a plane at the Phoenix airport while federal investigators moved to close the case on Hillary Clinton as she moved toward the Democratic presidential nomination.
Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) at the time called for a special prosecutor in the Clinton case. On Wednesday, he fully defended the decision to overrule the front-line prosecutors' sentencing decision.
'I think the world is sort of turned on its head where subordinates somehow dictate policy,' he said. 'In this case, the judge is going to make the decision, not anybody else.'
Top Republican leaders offered little pushback. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declined to comment on the Stone case at his weekly media availability Tuesday, while Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.) offered only faint criticism Wednesday: 'I'm not a lawyer, but strikes me at least that you want to let the legal process move forward the way it's intended to.'
Other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee also were reluctant to comment Wednesday on a matter squarely inside the panel's oversight portfolio. 
'I want to get the information on it before I give you a comment,' said Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.). 
'I don't know the facts of the case; I haven't been following it,' said Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.).
'I think the tweet was problematic and gave the appearance that the president was more involved than he actually was,' said Sen. John Neely Kennedy (R-La.).
Meanwhile, the Republican senators who have been more willing to criticize Trump did not go much further. 
'I don't think the president should be determining what the sentences are,' said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), while Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Trump 'should not have gotten involved,' and Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said, 'Politics should not play a part in law enforcement,' without directly criticizing the president.

After his decision to kill a general, allies were quick to blast his predecessor
As President Trump's allies rushed to defend his decision to authorize a drone strike that killed Iran's top military commander, many have focused less on Qasem Soleimani than another once-prominent actor in Middle East affairs: former president Barack Obama. 
'Obama drew red lines - ignored them,' Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) wrote in a tweet, adding that Trump 'never will.' 
'There is a NEW Sheriff in town,' proclaimed former Milwaukee sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., a vocal Trump surrogate. 'Maybe they thought Obama was still the Commander in Chief.' 
House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) recycled a misleading claim that Obama had been 'sending Iran pallets of cash as they killed Americans.' But with Trump in charge, he added, 'America fights back.'
For Trump, the true measure of the dramatic and risky military operation will become clear over time, as the United States braces for a potential retaliatory strike from Iran that could embroil his administration in the kind of complex and intractable Middle East conflict he had pledged to avoid. But amid the immediate fallout from Soleimani's death, the president and his defenders rushed to declare that Trump had bested his predecessor in standing up to a malign foreign power. 
To Trump's allies, the killing of Soleimani didn't just eliminate Iran's chief military strategist, it was a 'bigger deal than Osama bin Laden,' according to Ryan Fournier, co-chairman of Students for Trump. The al-Qaeda mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks was killed in a Navy SEAL raid in 2011 "" one of Obama's top national security accomplishments. 
The boastful tone aimed to grant Trump a measure of validation and credit at a time of enormous political vulnerability amid an ongoing impeachment proceeding. But it also served to rebut criticism over Trump's move in 2018 to abandon the Iran nuclear deal that the Obama administration negotiated three years earlier. The decision fulfilled a chief Trump campaign promise but exacerbated tensions between Washington and Tehran and, experts said, helped lead to the escalating crisis punctuated by the drone strike on Soleimani.
Trump, former aides said, has burned with a desire to erase Obama's foreign policy legacy and prove himself a superior commander in chief. 
'For whatever reason, President Trump has fixated on President Obama, and I think that he views President Obama as the metric he has to beat,' said Fernando Cutz, who served on the National Security Council under both presidents, including a stint as senior adviser to H.R. McMaster, Trump's second national security adviser. 
McMaster and other top aides, including former secretary of state Rex Tillerson, had strenuously lobbied Trump to stay in the deal that imposed limits on Iran's program to build a nuclear weapon in exchange for economic sanctions relief. But that effort ultimately failed and, Cutz said, and helped cost McMaster his White House job. 
 Trump moved to nullify the deal because it 'was a campaign promise and an Obama deal "" every time he extended an Obama deal, he was inherently admitting it was a good deal. His whole thing was that it was a horrible deal,' Cutz said. He added that in meetings with his national security advisers, Trump groused that he should be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize and complained that Obama received one for campaigning against nuclear weapons before taking office. 
After news of Soleimani's death emerged late Thursday, Trump allies took to social media to debate with Obama administration veterans, who pronounced the drone strike a reckless and ill-advised act of war that would almost certainly backfire. 
Ben Rhodes, Obama's former deputy national security adviser for strategic communications, questioned Trump's ability to handle a 'complex, enduring, international crisis,' prompting conservative pundit Ben Shapiro to mock Rhodes as 'a failed novelist who openly lied to the American people while pushing bribery of a terrorist regime to handle this.' It was a reference to a 2016 profile of Rhodes in the New York Times Magazine in which he boasted of using inexperienced reporters to shape a 'narrative' and create a favorable public impression around the Iran deal. 
The Trump campaign retweeted a post from Michael Joyce, a Republican National Committee spokesman, juxtaposing an image of Iranian officials mourning Soleimani's death with one of U.S. sailors aboard a Navy command boat captured by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps after entering Iranian waters in 2016. 
'US-Iran relations under Obama vs. US-Iran relations under @realDonaldTrump,' Joyce wrote.
'I don't think it's too much of a stretch to say the root of much of this is Obama envy,' said Ned Price, a former CIA officer who served as an NSC spokesman under Obama. 'It was Trump's determination, honed over a year on the campaign trail and the first 1
1/2
years of his administration, to rail against the Iran deal, Obama's deal, the 'worst deal ever.' He got raucous applause and cheers from his base when he associated it with Obama, and that was a decisive factor in Trump's decision to abandon it in 2018.'
It wasn't just the Iran deal that Trump jettisoned. His administration has begun withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate accord; scrapped Obama's agreement to enter a trans-Pacific trade pact; reversed efforts to warm relations with Cuba and dropped Obama's 'strategic patience' strategy to isolate North Korea, instead engaging directly with leader Kim Jong Un. 
Trump did not mention Obama in brief remarks about the Soleimani operation Friday. But days earlier "" as an Iraqi militia aligned with the Iranian general breached security at the heavily fortified U.S. Embassy in Baghdad in protest of an American strike on the group's facilities in Syria and Iraq "" Trump made a clear reference to his predecessor by threatening Iran over the incident and declaring the situation the 'Anti-Benghazi' on Twitter.

He was alluding to a siege on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya in 2012 in which two Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stephens, were killed "" a tragedy for which Republicans faulted Obama's administration for not securing the facility and for a muddied public accounting of what happened. 
Robert Spalding, a retired Air Force general who served on Trump's NSC, discounted the notion that the president's actions this week were motivated by a sense of grievance over Obama's legacy. Spalding called Soleimani a longtime threat to U.S. national security who should have been targeted by Obama and his predecessor, George W. Bush. 
'Those who want to tie it to a broader agenda over differences with Obama's policies I think is a stretch,' he said.
But Trump's intensive focus on Obama was apparent long before he launched his White House campaign in 2015. Trump was a leading proponent of the racist 'birther' conspiracy theory, which falsely accused Obama of being an illegitimate president who was born outside the United States. 
In April 2011, on the night Obama authorized the raid that killed bin Laden, Trump was the target of numerous jokes by Obama at the White House correspondents' dinner in Washington. 
Trump has also falsely accused Obama of ordering his administration to wiretap the phones at Trump Tower during his campaign and transition in an effort to tie him to a Russian interference operation in the 2016 election. 
Trump's fixation with Obama has grown more acute over his three years in office. The president mentioned Obama 537 times in the first 10 months of 2019 "" a 36 percent increase from the same period in 2018 and up 169 percent from that time frame in 2017, according to an analysis from Daniel Dale, a CNN analyst and fact-checker. 
Some past presidents have been disdainful of their predecessors, said Rice University historian Douglas Brinkley. He cited Franklin D. Roosevelt's temporary name change for the Herbert Hoover Dam in Nevada back to Boulder Dam and Ronald Reagan's removal of solar panels installed at the White House by Jimmy Carter. 
But there has been nothing comparable to Trump's relentless trashing of Obama, Brinkley said. 
'Trump likes the fact that attacking Obama, as an African American president, helped him with the right wing of the Republican Party that he needed,' he said.
After Trump's embrace of the birther conspiracy theory, Brink ley added, 'he needs to show Obama was a really bad president with socialist tendencies to kind of justify his attacks on him. The wiretapping "" he fabricates things Obama did to turn him into an all-purpose nemesis. There's been belittling of a predecessor before "" but not this sense of a mass destruction of a reputation.'

Attorney general frustrated by Trump's commentary on cases 
Attorney General William P. Barr has told people close to President Trump "" both inside and outside the White House "" that he is considering quitting over Trump's tweets about Justice Department investigations, three administration officials said, foreshadowing a possible confrontation between the president and his attorney general over the independence of the Justice Department.
So far, Trump has defied Barr's requests, both public and private, to keep quiet on matters of federal law enforcement. It was not immediately clear Tuesday whether Barr had made his posture known directly to Trump. The administration officials said Barr seemed to be sharing his position with advisers in hopes the president would get the message that he should stop weighing in publicly on the Justice Department's ongoing criminal investigations. 
'He has his limits,' said one person familiar with Barr's thinking, speaking on the condition of anonymity, like others, to discuss internal deliberations. 
Late last week, Barr publicly warned the president in a remarkable interview with ABC News that his tweets about Justice Department cases 'make it impossible for me to do my job.' Trump, White House officials said, is not entirely receptive to calls to change his behavior, and he has told those around him he is not going to stop tweeting about the Justice Department. They said Trump considers highlighting what he sees as misconduct at the FBI and Justice Department as a good political message. 
The standoff between Trump and Barr intensified Tuesday when Trump declared in a string of early morning tweets that he might sue those involved in the special counsel investigation into his 2016 campaign and suggested that Roger Stone, his friend convicted of lying to Congress in that probe, deserved a new trial. 
Hours later, a Justice Department official said prosecutors had filed a sealed motion in court arguing the opposite and that they had Barr's personal approval to do so. 
Barr had a previously scheduled lunch with the White House counsel Tuesday and was still the attorney general by day's end "" indicating that the president's moves that day were not enough to push him to resign. But he and his Justice Department seemed to remain mired in a political crisis, with an uncertain future.
A Justice Department spokeswoman initially declined to comment. After this article appeared online, Kerri Kupec, a spokeswoman for Barr, said on Twitter, 'Addressing Beltway rumors: The Attorney General has no plans to resign.' She did not address what Barr had told others.
White House spokespeople did not respond to questions for this report. Some people familiar with Barr's thinking cautioned that he would not make a hasty decision to leave, and it is unclear what precisely would trigger him to take such a dramatic step.



It was only a week ago that Trump's tweet about federal prosecutors' recommendation that Stone should be sentenced to seven to nine years in prison created a crisis at the Justice Department.
After that tweet, Barr moved to intervene and reduce the recommendation. The four career prosecutors assigned to the matter quit the case, with one leaving the government entirely. Barr has insisted that he made up his mind to get involved before Trump weighed in, but he faced significant skepticism inside and outside the Justice Department.
Over the weekend, more than 2,000 former department employees signed a public letter urging Barr to resign over his handling of the Stone case and exhorted current department employees to report any unethical conduct to the inspector general. Jan Miller, who was the U.S. attorney for central Illinois from 2002 until 2005 under President George W. Bush, said he signed in part to remind rank-and-file Justice Department employees that 'they're not alone.' 
'I'm sure it's a very difficult time to be a line prosecutor in the department right now,' Miller said.
 White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham played down the letter's significance, saying there were 'obstructionists all across this government who are working against the president.' Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) also came to Barr's defense in a joint statement. 
'The nation is fortunate that President Trump chose such a strong and selfless public servant to lead the Department of Justice,' they wrote. 'We expect that, as always, efforts to intimidate the Attorney General will fall woefully short.' 
People close to Barr say he is unlikely to be moved by the letter from the former Justice Department employees, which bears the signatures of many who have long been vocal opponents of his. But Barr, the people said, is deeply concerned about morale inside the department, and that is in part why he chastised the president publicly to ABC News. 
In the weeks before the interview, Barr had privately asked the president to stop speaking publicly on Justice Department matters, a person familiar with their discussions said. But his comments have apparently fallen on deaf ears. The day after Barr's ABC interview, Trump tweeted that he had the 'legal right' to ask Barr to intervene in a criminal case. 
Trump said Tuesday that he has 'total confidence' in Barr and conceded, 'I do make his job harder.' He also asserted, though, that he, rather than his attorney general, is 'the chief law enforcement officer of the country.' 
'The attorney general is a man with great integrity,' Trump said. 'I chose not to be involved. I'm allowed to be involved. I could be involved if I want to be.' 
Trump has raged privately for months about the Justice Department's not charging those he considers political foes, and people familiar with the matter say he is particularly upset by the decision revealed last week not to charge former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe with lying to investigators exploring a media disclosure. 
McCabe authorized the FBI to begin investigating Trump personally in 2017 for possible obstruction of justice in connection with the probe into whether his campaign coordinated with Russia, and Trump has suggested he might sue those involved. That case was ultimately taken over by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. 
Trump also has complained to associates that he has not been able to view the findings of U.S. Attorney John Durham, whom Barr tasked with examining the Russia probe's origins. Durham's probe is ongoing, and he has not yet prepared any report detailing his conclusions, a person familiar with the matter said. 
People familiar with the matter said Trump has no plans to remove Barr as attorney general, despite his frustrations. Apart from his ABC News interview, Barr has been a particularly loyal and effective Cabinet secretary for Trump, willing to take political heat for the commander in chief. 
Barr absorbed significant criticism for casting the findings of Mueller's investigation in a way that some saw as overly favorable to Trump, and for commissioning internal Justice Department reviews of politically sensitive matters, including the Russia probe.
But Barr has been persistently vexed by Trump's tweets, and he saw the president's commentary on Stone last week as something of a last straw. 
Trump had largely refrained from law enforcement commentary over the holiday weekend before erupting once more on Tuesday morning. The president quoted at length Andrew Napolitano, a former New Jersey Superior Court judge and Fox News commentator who, by Trump's telling, argued that Stone should receive a new trial because of 'the unambiguous - self outed bias of the foreperson of the jury.'
'Pretty obvious he should (get a new trial),' Trump quoted Napolitano as saying. 
Trump also reprised old attacks on the Mueller investigation. 
'The whole deal was a total SCAM. If I wasn't President, I'd be suing everyone all over the place,' Trump wrote. 'BUT MAYBE I STILL WILL. WITCH HUNT!'
Grisham, the press secretary, said Tuesday that 'the president's obviously frustrated.'
'For three years, he has been under attack in one way or the other, and the Mueller report is another example of that,' Grisham said during an appearance on 'Fox - Friends,' during which she also alluded to the Stone case. 'I mean the foreperson of a jury was somebody who was very vocal about not liking President Trump or his supporters. . . . That's scary stuff.'
The tweets came just before prosecutors and defense attorneys convened for a hearing in the Stone case to determine whether Stone's request for a new trial needed to be resolved before his sentencing, scheduled for Thursday. Stone's team had demanded the new trial Friday, one day after Trump suggested that the forewoman in the federal case had 'significant bias.' 
Trump was referring to Tomeka Hart, a former president of the Memphis City Schools Board of Commissioners and an unsuccessful Democratic candidate for Congress. Hart has identified herself as the forewoman of the jury in a Facebook post, saying she 'can't keep quiet any longer' in the wake of a Justice Department move to reduce prosecutors' sentencing recommendation for Stone. 
U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is presiding over Stone's case, decided that Stone will be sentenced Thursday, though the 'execution of the sentence will be deferred' while she decides whether Stone deserves a new trial. The Justice Department is notably opposing Stone in that matter "" with Barr's approval "" and a Justice Department official said that decision 'was made independent of the White House.'
Trump told reporters Tuesday that he thought Stone had been 'treated unfairly' but that he had not given any thought to pardoning him. Trump did issue several pardons to others Tuesday, including Rod Blagojevich, a former Illinois governor who was convicted on corruption charges in 2011 related to trying to sell President-elect Barack Obama's vacated Senate seat, and Bernard Kerik, a former New York police commissioner jailed on eight felony charges, including tax fraud.
Asked whether Stone deserves any prison time, Trump demurred, saying, 'You're going to see what happens.'
Stone has been a friend and adviser to Trump since the 1980s and was a key figure in his 2016 campaign, working to discover damaging information on Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. 
A jury convicted Stone in November on charges of witness tampering and lying to Congress about his efforts to gather damaging information about Clinton. Stone's were the last charges arising from Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Many of the most endangered Republicans have concluded that fully embracing President Trump is their only credible path to victory in November, rallying to his side in the final days of the Senate impeachment fight and indulging his most controversial actions and statements.
At-risk Republicans "" including those in battlegrounds such as Arizona, Colorado and Georgia "" are calculating that a strong economy and an energized pro-Trump base will be enough to carry the party as it works to retain the White House and its Senate majority in 2020, according to interviews and private discussions with more than a dozen Republican senators, Senate aides and veteran strategists and officials.
More broadly, most Republicans have also largely jettisoned plans to break ranks with Trump to woo independents and suburban women, who turned on the party in 2018 and helped hand the House to the Democrats. This political positioning is driven in part by their view that Democrats are again poised to nominate a uniquely vulnerable presidential standard-bearer weighed down with ideological or establishment baggage.
'There's nothing in the middle of the road other than dead possums and yellow lines,' said Will Ritter, co-founder of Poolhouse, a center-right ad agency. 'Like no other president before, Republican voters want you to wrap yourself around Trump. There is no upside to doing any distancing.'
Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) has concentrated in recent weeks on rallying base Republicans rather than appealing to moderates for her tough reelection fight, pushing for a swift acquittal in Trump's impeachment trial while raising money off a feud with a CNN reporter she called 'a liberal hack.' Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who is running for reelection in a state Hillary Clinton won by five points in 2016, came under attack by his likely Democratic opponent, former governor John Hickenlooper, after deciding against calling for impeachment witnesses and evidence this week.
And Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), facing a tough intraparty primary fight from Rep. Douglas A. Collins (R-Ga.), has gone all-in on supporting Trump in a state that Democrats are targeting for its growing diversity and booming Atlanta suburbs, including an attack this week on fellow Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) for supporting the call for witnesses.
Loeffler, who has been personally friendly with Romney and who has donated to him in the past, accused him in a tweet of trying to 'appease the left' and concluded: 'The circus is over. It's time to move on!'
Trump's uncontested grip over his party came into focus again Friday as two key Republican senators "" Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is retiring, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who is not up for reelection "" supported the president by blocking Democratic attempts to extend the trial, couching their positions as driven by frustrations with Democrats. It will mark the first time in U.S. history that no witnesses will be called in a Senate impeachment proceeding.
'There is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the United States Constitution's high bar for an impeachable offense,' Alexander said in a statement, arguing that while Trump had taken 'actions that are inappropriate,' they did not merit his removal from office.
It was the most significant political move made by Senate Republicans this week: Their refusal to join Democrats in calling for additional evidence or witnesses in Trump's impeachment trial, ensuring that it could wrap up in the coming days.
At the center of the calculation was Trump himself, and just how much Republicans feel they can distance themselves from a president who, in just over three years, has traveled from troublesome outsider to Republican Party standard-bearer.
Ritter said some vulnerable Republicans running in swing states and House districts may be able to differentiate themselves from Trump and appeal to the center on specific policy issues, but on something hyper-politicized like impeachment, they cannot afford to cross the president.
'On Trump, it's binary,' Ritter said. 'You're either a treacherous Democrat or you're with the president.'
The 2018 midterm elections did provide a flashing alarm for Republicans about the risks of being inextricably bound with Trump. Democrats retook the House majority after toppling Republican incumbents in many suburban districts and in state and local races "" a takeover that laid the groundwork for impeachment.
Former Republican senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania said challenges in suburbs, such as those surrounding Philadelphia, remain troubling for the party. But he said opposing Trump on impeachment is seen by most at-risk Republicans as the 'wrong way to try to win over those voters.'
'You won't get seen as playing to the suburbs,' Santorum said. 'You'll be seen as playing to the angry leftists who hate the president.'
Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who as the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee worked to keep the probe of Russian election interference as bipartisan as possible, said he fully supports Trump and is surprised that anyone might be surprised.
'He's a Republican, he's president and we support his agenda,' Burr said. 'The media, of course, tries to drive a wedge and wonder, but every poll today shows the president actually stronger today than he was four years ago.'
For Trump, Republican unity on impeachment is the fruit of the ultimate pressure campaign in a short political career defined by them. The president has upended so many norms that he has simply become the norm, with everyone else in the party scrambling to adjust.
That doesn't mean Republicans all personally like Trump or cheer his conduct, either on foreign policy or other matters "" in fact, many Republican lawmakers still complain loudly about him behind closed doors, sometimes mocking him as incompetent and undisciplined.
But many also privately acknowledge that Trump dominates the party in a potent and visceral way and say they are operating out of the partisan reality of an intensely divided nation.
Democrats, they add, should stop expecting a Republican establishment to stand up and block Trump, since Trump himself is now the establishment.
'I regularly talk to five or six Republicans who I feel some closeness to,' said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). 'I've heard for months that they know the president lies a lot. . . . They worry about his character. But they aren't willing to come forward and say that publicly. That's one of the tragedies of this era.'
Former Republican Georgia congressman Jack Kingston said he once had reservations about Trump but has since become an ardent admirer and booster. He explained his transformation with a shrug, saying his party and Washington 'needed a shake-up.'
'I accept it,' he said.
The Georgia primary fight brewing between Loeffler and Collins is a classic Trump-era standoff, he added.
'Any GOP candidate is going to want to show he or she is close to Trump,' Kingston said. 'If you think about the Republican Party, he's the center of the orbit. You don't want him to say something bad about you.'
The impulse for Republicans to link themselves tightly to the president spans the country, and includes some lawmakers not even currently up for reelection. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who doesn't face reelection for four years, released a 30-second ad in Iowa that sided with Trump and attacked former vice president Joe Biden and other Democrats.
'I'd like to thank the Democrats for badly botching this impeachment charade and for spending so much time in a coverup for Joe Biden,' says Scott, who introduces himself as a juror in the Senate trial. 'The real story here is the corruption Joe Biden got away with.'
The ad goes on to levy a series of factually problematic charges against Biden and his son Hunter, but its mere existence is sure to delight Trump "" and sparked speculation that Scott is eyeing a 2024 presidential bid, seeking to cast himself as the torchbearer of Trump's brand.
Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general under Trump who is now running to retake the Alabama Senate seat he vacated to join the administration, is also pushing to prove his fealty to the president "" despite the fact that Trump, furious at Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, publicly and privately berated and humiliated his attorney general for the majority of his tenure.
Nonetheless, on Wednesday, Sessions touted his loyalty to Trump in a trio of tweets focused on former national security adviser John Bolton, whose forthcoming book directly ties Trump to the Ukraine decision at the heart of his impeachment trial. Sessions emphasized that he never publicly criticized the president and dismissed Bolton's memoir as 'an act of disloyalty.'

Former senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he understands if Republicans poke holes in the Democrats' case against Trump and vote for acquittal but cannot accept Republicans insisting that Trump did nothing wrong. Those who do the latter, he said, are willfully taking a position they know is false.
'That's the difference. Vote to acquit? Okay. You can make that argument. But to say this wasn't an egregious abuse of his presidential duty? That's where this party has problems,' Flake said. 'To suggest otherwise signals complete subservience to the president.'
But Scott Reed, senior strategist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, pointed to Trump's 'unprecedented high approval ratings with the GOP rank and file.'
'It's Trump's party now "" there's no way around that,' Reed said. 'You may not agree with the boxes, but he's checking all the boxes.'
Democrats, meanwhile, have had their own challenges holding their ranks together as Trump voters in red states have made clear to Democratic senators that they will pay a price for opposing the president.
Two centrists who won election last year "" Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) "" as well as Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), who will face voters this year after a long-shot win in a special election in 2017, have been coy about how they will vote on acquittal, giving hope to Trump's allies that the president could win bipartisan support.
Many Republicans also believe that Trump stands a strong chance of reelection against a flawed Democratic opponent, whether a nominee from the left like Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), or a longtime politician like Biden.
Dick Wadhams, a longtime Republican strategist based in Colorado, said the specific choice between Trump and the eventual Democratic nominee will help Republicans who have tacked to the right to appease the party's base win over moderates, as well.
'It's going to be a choice on the ballot and not a referendum in 2020, and that's what makes this very different than 2018,' Wadhams said. He added that he was a begrudging Trump voter in 2016 but now is fully supportive. He pointed to Trump accomplishments like passing a tax cut and appointing conservative judicial nominees, as well as his concern about where the Democrats would take the country.
'I still have concerns about the way he behaves, his tweets drive me nuts, and a lot of Republicans feel that way, but at the same time "" Medicare-for-all, Green New Deal, killing fracking "" spare me,' he said, rattling off a list of liberal proposals. 'Democrats are driving people who might want to vote for them back to Trump.'

Post-impeachment purge of appointees deemed to lack fealty to president
President Trump has instructed his White House to identify and force out officials across his administration who are not seen-as sufficiently loyal, a post-impeachment escalation that administration officials say reflects a new phase of a campaign of retribution and restructuring ahead of the November election.
Johnny McEntee, Trump's former personal aide who now leads the effort as director of presidential personnel, has begun combing through various agencies with a mandate from the president to oust or sideline political appointees who have not proved their loyalty, according to several administration officials and others familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
The push comes in the aftermath of an impeachment process in which several members of Trump's administration provided damning testimony about his behavior with regard to Ukraine. The stream of officials publicly criticizing Trump's actions frustrated the president and caused him to fixate on cleaning house after his acquittal this month. 
'We want bad people out of our government!' Trump tweeted Feb. 13, kicking off a tumultuous stretch of firings, resignations, controversial appointments and private skirmishes that have since spilled into public view.
The National Security Council, the State Department and the Justice Department are targets of particular focus, according to two administration officials, and-there have recently been multiple resignations and reassignments at each of those agencies.
John C. Rood, the official in charge of Defense Department policy who had certified that Ukraine had met anti-corruption obligations, was let go this week. Victoria Coates, the deputy national security adviser who was viewed with suspicion by some White House aides, was removed from her post and was moved to an advisory position in the Energy Department.
McEntee spent part of this week asking officials in various Cabinet agencies to provide names of political appointees working in government who are not fully supportive of Trump's presidency, according to administration officials. 
The president instructed McEntee to find people in the administration who aren't aligned with Trump and 'get rid' of them, according to someone familiar with the president's directive. 
Trump did not provide additional specificity on what exactly he wanted beyond a workforce that more fully reflects his instincts, the person said, and it is-unclear what criteria are being-used to determine an official's fealty to the president. McEntee's discussions with Cabinet agencies were first reported by Axios.
The 29-year-old former campaign aide is planning to prepare a presentation for Trump about what he has found. While Sean Doocey, the former director of presidential personnel, reported to acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney's deputy, McEntee reports directly to the president, according to a senior administration official.
What began as a campaign of retribution against officials who participated in the impeachment process has evolved into a full-scale effort to create an administration more fully in sync with Trump's id and agenda, according to several officials familiar with the plan. It is unclear whether civil servants will be targeted as well, but it would be harder to dislodge them than removing political appointees. Civil servants, however, could be sidelined in other ways.
As he became the third president in American history to be impeached, Trump seethed against his own appointees who defied White House lawyers to comply with congressional subpoenas and testify about his conduct. The process clarified for Trump and his top advisers that they had not focused enough on personnel in the early part of the presidency, creating a loyalty deficiency the president is moving quickly to correct, officials said.
The burgeoning effort was reflected in Trump's decision this week to appoint Richard Grenell as the next acting director of national intelligence, placing a fiercely loyal but inexperienced ally atop an intelligence structure against which the president has frequently railed.
Mulvaney used a speech this week at the Oxford Union in Britain to inveigh against the 'deep state,' and he lamented that the administration could not fire more agency employees who do not implement the president's orders. He referred to some of testimony of the witnesses who participated in Trump's impeachment inquiry. 
Bureaucrats who want to make policy instead of implementing it 'should put their name on the effing ballot and run' for office, he said during remarks to a group of several hundred people, according to audio of a speech obtained by The Washington Post.
Trump's family members have been among the main champions of the effort to force out officials who have not proved their devotion to Trump.
Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and a senior adviser in the White House, has played a central role in the push, concentrating more power in the West Wing and working to combat leaks, officials said.
Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. wrote on Twitter that the impeachment investigation was helpful in 'unearthing who all needed to be fired.'
Cliff Sims, a former White House adviser who wrote a book titled 'Team of Vipers,' about his time in the White House, has said Trump's presidency has been repeatedly undermined by disloyal underlings. 
'Loyalist shouldn't be a dirty word,' he said. 'Loyalty to the duly elected president and his agenda is exactly what we should expect from our unelected appointees.'
Brendan Buck, a longtime adviser to former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), said that while Trump is entitled to have political appointees who support his agenda, the purity tests could make it difficult to find qualified people. 
'If they also insist on hiring only people who've never taken issue with something the president has done, it's going to be slim pickings,' he said. 
Trump selected Grenell, the-ambassador to Germany, to-lead the intelligence community in place of Joseph Maguire after becoming angry last week-when he learned that a U.S.-intelligence official had told-lawmakers that Russia wants to see him reelected, according to people familiar with the matter. 
Grenell has moved quickly to concentrate power within the intelligence agencies. Maguire's deputy, Andrew P. Hallman, resigned Friday. Grenell hired Kash Patel, a National Security Council aide who has worked in the past to cast doubt on the FBI's investigation into Russian election interference. Grenell has requested access to information from the C.I.A. and other intelligence agencies, the New York Times reported, citing two-people familiar with the matter. 
The moves reflect the skeptical view the president has had of-the intelligence community after his campaign's links to Russia were investigated and several of his associates were prosecuted.
The anger extends beyond the intelligence agencies, and Trump has also called for law enforcement officials who investigated his campaign to be investigated or prosecuted. Even some Trump allies are feeling heat over not being aggressive enough about taking on the president's perceived enemies.
At a donor roundtable Tuesday at the Montage Hotel in Los Angeles, one participant pointedly questioned Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) on why he was not holding accountable people who were responsible for the Russia investigation.
'I see you on Fox News every night, and then you do nothing about it. What are you going to do about it?' the donor asked, according to an attendee. 
'What a fantastic question!' Trump said.
Meanwhile, administration officials are conducting a search for the 'Anonymous' author of a tell-all book about Trump titled 'A Warning,' according to White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, who told CNN on Friday that the search had become a 'vocation with everybody.' 
McEntee, who lost his job in 2018 over concerns about his online gambling, has long expressed an interest in the personnel office despite having no previous government experience, two administration officials said. Within the West Wing, he is seen as fiercely devoted to the president and is well liked by first lady Melania Trump, the officials said. 
Some within the White House have bristled at his lack of experience and aggressive approach to ferreting out 'Never Trumpers.'
McEntee 'does not have the relevant experience to do this job, unless the job is to purge Never Trumpers and reward loyalists,' one official said.
Another senior administration official countered that McEntee was talented and up to the task, with the key qualification of having the president's confidence. 
As he gears up for the reelection contest, Trump has moved to surround himself with longtime allies who have proved their devotion to him while pushing away those who have not earned his trust. 
This month, Trump rehired Hope Hicks, one of his longest-serving aides and closest confidants.
During a podcast interview last week, Trump concurred when Fox News analyst Geraldo Rivera described the White House as 'a nest of vipers and snitches and backstabbers and rats.'
'I inherited a place with, you know, many different administrations, and they worked there for years and were civil service and with unions and all of it,' he said on Rivera's 'Roadkill' podcast. 'You can't do what you'd like to do.'

His standing improves as fewer Americans report fears regarding economy


President Trump begins his reelection year in a more competitive position than he was in last fall against potential Democratic challengers, aided by rising approval for his handling of the economy, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. 
The state of the economy and perceptions of Trump's handling of it pose a challenge for Democratic presidential candidates, who have criticized the president's policies and focused their economic messaging on inequities between the richest Americans and everyone else and on alleviating the financial struggles of many families who are dealing with rising health-care, child-care or educational costs. 
Despite Americans' concerns that the economic system favors the wealthy, the latest Post-ABC poll finds that fewer than half are worried about maintaining their own standard of living, a shift from 2016, when most expressed concern about losing their financial footing. 
With just over nine months until Election Day, Americans see Trump as a slight favorite for reelection, with 49-percent expecting him to win and 43-percent predicting that his Democratic challenger will prevail. But those expectations are highly partisan, with 87-percent of Republicans saying they believe Trump will win reelection while a somewhat smaller 78-percent majority of Democrats say they believe their party's nominee will win. 
The national Post-ABC poll tested Trump in six potential general-election matchups and finds that registered voters nationwide are roughly split between supporting the president and backing the Democratic candidates. Neither Trump nor Democrats hold a statistically significant advantage in any matchup. 

Former vice president Joe Biden is currently favored by 50-percent of registered voters, while 46-percent support Trump. Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg has 49-percent support to Trump's 46-percent, also virtually even given the poll's four-point margin of sampling error among registered voters. 
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) receives 49-percent to Trump's 47-percent, while Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) stands at 48-percent to Trump's 47-percent. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is tied with Trump at 48-percent. Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg is at 45-percent to Trump's 48-percent. 
Among the broader population of all voting-age adults rather than just registered voters, most Democrats maintain at least slight advantages over Trump, with Sanders and Bloomberg leading Trump by eight percentage points and Biden leading by seven points. Warren and Klobuchar each hold slighter five-point advantages over Trump, while Buttigieg is roughly even, with 46-percent to Trump's 45-percent. 
The close matchups between Trump and Democrats among registered voters represent a contrast with an October Post-ABC poll in which Biden, Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg all held double-digit advantages over the incumbent. (Bloomberg and Klobuchar were not tested against Trump in that poll.) 
The shift coincides with a rise in Trump's approval rating from 38-percent to 44-percent among the public overall, with 51-percent currently disapproving. Opinion is even more closely divided among registered voters, with 47-percent approving of Trump and 50-percent disapproving, matching the best margin of his presidency. 
Other national polls this month have not consistently found a rise in Trump's approval rating and also show Democratic candidates maintaining an advantage in national support over Trump. But the Post-ABC poll underscores how a modest improvement in Trump's political standing can boost his chances at reelection. 
Throughout his presidency, Trump's poll numbers have generally stayed within a narrow range, with far less variation than seen with his predecessors. When his ratings do move sharply in one direction or another at times, they tend to soon revert closer to the norm.
The improvement in his job approval rating in this poll "" to 44-percent, an increase of six percentage points since fall "" coincides with the Senate impeachment trial, which has further polarized the country. Whether it represents a lasting shift in Trump's favor has obvious political implications, given the stakes in the election year.
Trump's improved standing in the latest survey is in part due to political independents. Trump receives between 47-percent and 52-percent support among voters in this group, depending on his Democratic opponent, an improvement from October, when he got between 39-percent and 42-percent support. Self-identified independents make up 39-percent of the overall sample in the survey, almost identical to last October's poll. Most independents, though, lean toward either one party or the other, and in this month's poll, the mix of independents leaned less Democratic than in October. 

In 2016, exit polls showed that Trump won independents by four percentage points nationally and by seven points or more in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where narrow wins ensured his victory in the electoral college. 
The Post-ABC poll finds that 37-percent of registered voters say they would support Trump against all six Democratic candidates tested in the survey and that they would be 'very enthusiastic' or 'fairly enthusiastic' about doing so. Similarly, 33-percent of voters say they would support any of the six Democrats and are enthusiastic about opposing Trump. 
The remaining 30-percent who are inconsistent in their support or less enthusiastic about their decision represent a loose definition of voters whose allegiance to one side or the other is more tenuous. Some portion of that group is likely to be targeted for persuasion and mobilization efforts by the campaigns of the president and the eventual Democratic nominee. 
Nearly half of these up-for-grabs voters are nonwhite, and 50-percent identify themselves as moderate, both a larger portion than among voters overall. 
The 2020 election promises to continue the country's deep political divisions along gender, racial and educational lines. In a head-to-head matchup, 56-percent of white registered voters support Trump, while 68-percent of nonwhites support Biden. Fifty-eight percent of men support Trump, while 61-percent of women back Biden. Among whites only, 54-percent of college graduates favor Biden, while 64-percent of those without four-year college degrees support Trump. 
Those divisions were roughly similar in matchups between Trump and other Democrats. For instance, 60-percent of men support Trump in a matchup with Warren, while 59-percent of women support Warren in that scenario. 
Another critical question is how much Trump may benefit from an improving national economy. Economic growth has been a strong indicator of presidents' popularity and reelection chances for decades, but Trump's approval rating has been net negative since he entered office and has shown little sustained improvement despite positive perceptions about the economy. 
A newly evident easing of financial concerns and the overall economic climate could represent a key asset for Trump, who has sought to take as much credit as possible for historically low unemployment and the continuing economic recovery, which began in 2009. 
The 56 percent majority of Americans who now say they are not particularly worried or not worried at all about maintaining their standard of living marks a sharp increase from the start of the 2016 election year, when a minority of adults (37 percent) offered an optimistic view of their finances.
The Post-ABC poll also finds that 56 percent approve of Trump's handling of the economy, up 10 percentage points from last fall and the highest rating of his presidency on this issue. The difference of 12 points between Trump's economic approval rating and his overall approval is an indication of how public opinions on other aspects of Trump's performance have been a drag on his popularity. 

Indeed, Americans' more-positive views of the economy and Trump's handling of it may help him only insofar as they boost his overall job approval rating. 
For example, 13-percent of registered voters approve of Trump's handling of the economy but disapprove or have no opinion of his overall job performance. Among that group, 73-percent say they would support Biden while 15-percent would back Trump if the election were today. 
In the 2018 midterm elections, when nearly 7 in 10 voters said the economy was excellent or good, according to network exit polling, Republicans still lost a net of 40 seats in congressional elections, with Democrats gaining control of the House of Representatives. 
The Post-ABC poll was conducted by telephone from Jan. 20 through Jan. 23 among a random national sample of 1,004 adults, 65-percent of whom were reached on cellphones and 35-percent on landlines. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The error margin is four percentage points among the sample of 880 registered voters.

BRIEFER SAid RUSSIA PREFERS TRUMP
Perception of disloyalty leads to removal of DNI
A senior U.S. intelligence official told lawmakers last week that Russia wants to see President Trump reelected, viewing his administration as more favorable to the Kremlin's interests, according to people who were briefed on the comments.
After learning of that analysis, which was provided to House lawmakers in a classified hearing, Trump grew angry at his acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, in the Oval Office, seeing Maguire and his staff as disloyal for speaking to Congress about Russia's perceived preference. The intelligence official's analysis and Trump's furious response ruined Maguire's chances of becoming the permanent intelligence chief, according to people familiar with the matter who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.
It was not clear what specific steps, if any, U.S. intelligence officials think Russia may have taken to help Trump, according to the individuals. 
Trump announced on Wednesday that he was replacing Maguire with a vocal loyalist, Richard Grenell, who is the U.S. ambassador to Germany. The shake-up at the top of the intelligence community is the latest move in a post-impeachment purge. Trump has instructed aides to identify and remove officials across the government who aren't defending his interests, and he wants them replaced with loyalists.

Maguire, a career official who is respected by the intelligence rank and file, was considered a leading candidate to be nominated to the post of DNI, White House aides had said. But Trump's opinion shifted last week when he heard from a Republican ally about the official's remarks. 
The official, Shelby Pierson, said several times during the briefing that Russia had 'developed a preference' for Trump, according to a U.S. official familiar with her comments. That conclusion was part of a broader discussion of election security that also touched on when the U.S. government should warn Democratic candidates if they are being targeted by foreign governments. 
The New York Times first reported on the intelligence conclusion that Russia wants to help the president in 2020. 
Trump erroneously believed that Pierson had given the assessment exclusively to Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, people familiar with the matter said. Trump also believed that the information would be helpful to Democrats if it were released publicly, the people said. Schiff was the lead impeachment manager, or prosecutor, during Trump's Senate trial on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. 
Trump learned about Pierson's remarks from Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the committee's ranking Republican and a staunch Trump ally, said one person familiar with the matter. Trump's suspicions of the intelligence community have often been fueled by Nunes, who was with the president in California on Wednesday when he announced on Twitter that Grenell would become the acting director, officials said.
A spokesman for Nunes did not respond to requests for comment.
'Members on both sides participated, including ranking member Nunes, and heard the exact same briefing from experts across the intelligence community,' a committee official said. 'No special or separate briefing was provided to one side or to any single member, including the chairman.'
The briefing, which was offered to all members of the committee, covered 'election security and foreign interference in the run-up to the 2020 election,' the committee official said.

Other people familiar with the briefing described it as a contentious re-litigating of a previous intelligence assessment that Russia interfered in 2016 to help Trump. Republican members asked why the Russians would want to help Trump when he has levied punishing sanctions on their country, and they challenged Pierson to back up her claim with evidence. It is unclear how she responded.
Republicans on the committee also accused some of the briefers from other agencies of being part of an effort to sabotage Trump's reelection, these people said. Schiff, for his part, said in a tweet Thursday evening: 'We count on the intelligence community to inform Congress of any threat of foreign interference in our elections. If reports are true, and the president is interfering with that, he is again jeopardizing our efforts to stop foreign meddling.'
Trump became angry with Maguire and blamed him for Pierson's remarks when the two met the next day during a special briefing for Trump on election security attended by officials from other agencies, but not Pierson.
At that briefing, Trump angrily asked Maguire why he had to learn of what Pierson had said from Nunes and not from his own aides, according to administration officials with knowledge of the meeting. He said that Maguire should not have let the Capitol Hill briefing happen "" particularly before he received the briefing "" and that he should not have learned about it from a congressman, said one administration official.
Trump told Maguire and other aides in the Oval Office that he did not believe Russia was interfering to help him or planning to do so, and that the intelligence community was getting 'played,' according to an administration official with knowledge of the meeting. He said that the information would be used against him unfairly and that he could not believe that people were believing such a story again, reflecting his opinion that Russian interference in 2016 was a 'hoax' made up by officials with a political agenda.
Maguire struck an apologetic tone and said he was looking into it, this official said.
Trump gave Maguire 'a dressing-down,' said another individual, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. 'That was the catalyst' that led to the sidelining of Maguire in favor of Grenell, the person said.

Maguire came away 'despondent,' said another individual.
A spokeswoman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. The White House did not comment on Trump's Oval Office comments to Maguire.
Trump's removal of Maguire exacerbated long-standing tensions between intelligence officials and the president. Intelligence leaders have long been some of Trump's favorite targets on Twitter and at campaign rallies, where he portrays them as members of a 'deep state' bent on sabotaging his reelection. 
But officials at the agencies insist they have carried on the tradition of providing the president and his top aides with unvarnished information not infected by politics or policy agendas. 

Grenell has no lengthy intelligence experience. But his history of pro-Trump tweets and his personal relationships with Trump's children have caused current and former officials to doubt whether he could credibly serve as the country's top intelligence official, which they said Maguire did, despite having spent his career in the military. 
White House officials said that Trump's decision to make Grenell the acting director rather than nominate him for the permanent position reflected concerns that he might not win confirmation in the Senate, given his polarizing reputation. 
'The president likes acting [officials] better,' one White House official said. 
On Thursday, Grenell said in a tweet that the president would nominate a permanent DNI 'soon' and that it would not be him. A senior White House official said a nominee would be announced before March-11.
The president has been focused lately on officials who are allegedly disloyal to him, particularly at the Justice Department, the National Security Council, the Pentagon and the State Department, aides said, and has heard from outside advisers that 'real MAGA people can't get jobs in the administration,' in the words of an administration official, referring to Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, 'Make America Great Again.' 
Trump has centralized his efforts to purge the ranks of his perceived opponents. In recent weeks, he pushed out Sean Doo cey, the head of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, over the fierce objections of some White House aides, replacing him with Johnny McEntee, Trump's former personal assistant. Trump has instructed McEntee, who lost his job in 2018 over concerns about his online gambling, to install more loyalists in government positions.
Some of those removed from their jobs testified about the president's actions toward Ukraine during his impeachment hearings. 
Trump removed
Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, as well as Vindman's twin brother, who did not testify, from their positions at the National Security Council. Alexander Vindman witnessed a phone call Trump had with Ukraine's president in which Trump pressured the leader to conduct investigations of Trump's Democratic rivals.
Trump asked for the resignation of Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, who told House lawmakers that the president had engineered a quid pro quo with Ukraine, conditioning a White House meeting with the country's president on investigations of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter. 
This week, Trump also asked for the resignation of John C. Rood, the official in charge of Defense Department policy, who had certified that Ukraine had met anti-corruption obligations required by law to receive U.S. aid that Trump froze. 
The deputy national security adviser, Victoria Coates, has also been removed from her post after some colleagues, including trade adviser Peter Navarro, accused her of being the author of 'Anonymous,' a scathing account of dysfunction in the White House, according to people familiar with the matter. Coates has strenuously denied the accusation. She was moved to an advisory position in the Energy Department.
By contrast, Grenell appears to be an ideal Trump appointee. The president appreciates that he publicly bashes Germany over policy disagreements. Grenell also defends the president on Fox News and on Twitter, and when he visits the White House for meetings, Trump usually wants to see him, current and former administration officials say.
As acting DNI, Grenell will oversee the intelligence community's efforts to combat election interference and disinformation, but he has been skeptical of Russia's role in 2016. 
'Russian or Russian-approved tactics like cyber warfare and campaigns of misinformation have been happening for decades,' he wrote in a 2016 opinion article for Fox News, playing down the severity of the threat. That view is at odds with the conclusions of senior U.S. intelligence officials, who have said Russia's operation in 2016 was sweeping and systematic, and unlike previous Russian or Soviet efforts.

Mike Bloomberg is lagging behind his Democratic competitors in the polls, and he will not appear on the next presidential debate stage or on the ballot in Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina.
But the former New York mayor has attracted the obsessive attention of President Trump, who is annoyed by Bloomberg's constant ads targeting him, concerned about the billionaire's outsize spending, focused on his growing numbers in the polls and seemingly fixated on his TV appearances.
The president has repeatedly attacked Bloomberg on Twitter, calling him 'Mini Mike' to insult his small stature, and frequently focused on him in conversations with campaign advisers and White House officials.
'It's very clear that the ads we are running have gotten under his skin because they are effective,' said Howard Wolfson, a senior Bloomberg aide. 'Mike's poll numbers are improving, the president is screaming. Mike is a data-driven guy. When he sees data is working, he doubles down.'
Wolfson said to expect more blistering ads against the president in coming months. So far, Bloomberg's spots have targeted Trump over impeachment, his position on vaping, his health-care-policy decisions and his relationship with the military. Many have prompted rapid responses from Trump, sometimes minutes after they air.
Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey debuted a new ad on 'Fox - Friends' on Thursday that cited a new book by two Washington Post reporters, who chronicle how Trump lashed out at U.S. military leaders, characterizing them as 'dopes and babies.' Trump responded shortly after the spot aired.
'Mini Mike Bloomberg is playing poker with his foolhardy and unsuspecting Democrat rivals,' Trump tweeted. 'The fact is, when Mini losses [sic], he will be spending very little of his money on these 'clowns' because he will consider himself to be the biggest clown of them all "" and he will be right!'
Trump's advisers have repeatedly encouraged the president to focus on other opponents instead. Campaign manager Brad Parscale and senior adviser Jared Kushner have warned against giving Bloomberg more attention and do not see him as the threat that Trump does, aides have said. There is no plan for the campaign to target him with advertisements at this point, advisers said.
Trump has repeatedly brought up Bloomberg "" calling him 'evil,' in the words of one close adviser "" and said that he wants to destroy Trump with unrelenting money, even if the president does not believe Bloomberg can win, according to aides.
He has called Bloomberg's ads 'lies' that are unfair depictions of his record in the White House. Several advisers have said the president also references Bloomberg's 2016 Democratic convention speech as a sore point and repeatedly asks advisers about his polling numbers, which have hovered below 10-percent in public surveys.
Other advisers have sought to elevate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), hoping that a leftist candidate could give Trump a good foil in the general election.
Parscale said this week that he would only worry about Bloomberg if he surpassed former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in the Democratic race.
'It's a free country, and he can set his money on fire if he wants to. He's still in a statistical tie with the back of the pack in the Democrat field,' said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman.
Trolling the president is different from convincing skeptical primary voters and defending his own record on issues such as stop-and-frisk policing in New York City. Bloomberg endorsed George W. Bush, for instance, and welcomed the Republican National Convention in New York in 2004.
But his path to the nomination could become clearer if former vice president Joe Biden stumbles in Iowa and New Hampshire, creating an opening for Bloomberg to use his significant advertising budget to argue that he is the most electable alternative.
In the meantime, the campaign has been using attacks on Trump as a rallying cry, both to recruit staff to his campaign and to convince Democratic primary voters that his campaign is more than the vanity project of another billionaire candidate.
Sheekey said the campaign will either be the 'best primary campaign in American history' or the greatest independent spending campaign against an incumbent president that has ever been created.
As it stands, the Bloomberg advertising campaign is squarely focused on states that could help get Bloomberg the nomination, with only about 1 in 4 dollars going to the six swing states that his advisers expect to be competitive in the general election, according to Facebook ad spending data and a source familiar with the television buys, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because that person was not authorized to share the information publicly.
But that swing-state spending has still been considerable. Through Jan.-11, Bloomberg has spent $198-million on television advertising, including more than $47-million for spots in the projected swing states of Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. On Facebook, he has blasted another $3.6-million to voters in those states.
Before the year is over, he has promised to spend $100-million on a digital effort to defeat Trump in swing states, and he has committed millions more to an effort to register 500,000 new voters in those states. He is also building a data operation that he intends to use to elect a Democratic president whether or not he is the nominee, his advisers say.
In an interview, Wolfson said he wanted to draw a contrast with Democrats, who are attacking one another in New Hampshire and Iowa. Bloomberg has not competed in those states, knowing he would be unlikely to fare well, and is focused on Super Tuesday on March 3.
'We've chosen a different path. They are in Iowa and New Hampshire attacking one another. We're making the case against Donald Trump,' Wolfson said. 'Voters among all else are looking for a candidate that is best qualified to take on Donald Trump in a general election.'
Many of the ads Bloomberg has run include some mention of Trump, with many of the spots focusing on the president's perceived weaknesses among swing voters.
'Health care is a huge vulnerability for him,' Wolfson said of Trump. 'It's the issue that won the Democrats the midterms. It is difficult for him to defend his own record on health care.'
Bloomberg's aides also plan on using the ground campaign that Bloomberg is building against Trump, whether or not he wins the nomination. Those hired in potential general-election swing states "" 60 in Arizona and more than 80 in North Carolina, for example "" have been told they will have a job through the summer conventions or the November elections to organize against Trump.
Bloomberg seems to have approached the endeavor as a no-risk proposition, given that he has decided that defeating someone he calls an 'existential threat to our country' is one of his top priorities.
'My Plan B is a hell of a lot better than anybody else's Plan A,' he has told advisers, according to one aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.
Either Bloomberg wins the nomination and the presidency or he remains the 12th-richest person in the world with a chance of taking credit for defeating Trump.
On the stump, Bloomberg seems to delight in needling Trump, calling him a 'real estate promoter' and not a businessman. He will recount the phone call from Trump after the 2016 election, when the president-elect offered his cellphone number. Bloomberg says he didn't bother to write it down.
-Bloomberg also repeats an anecdote about Trump not knowing how to use a New York City subway card when they rode together many years ago. Trump has said this description is untrue, saying the gates were opened for them because they were traveling with a large entourage.
'I never had a MetroCard when I rode the subway with him,' Trump told The Washington Post last year.

Defense of convicted ally continues a pattern of assailing federal judiciary
First he went after the prosecutors who recommended a multiyear sentence for his friend Roger Stone. Then President Trump turned his Twitter ire to the 'witch hunt disgrace' of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation, which led to Stone's indictment. But perhaps most surprising was Trump's decision to target U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson "" who will determine Stone's fate when he appears in her courtroom next Thursday. 
It was not the first time Trump had gone after a federal judge or questioned the judiciary, but Tuesday's attack was nevertheless vexing to current and former judges as Jackson prepares to decide whether to send the president's friend to prison "" and for how long. 
'The timing is outrageous, and the notion that you're attempting to influence a judge,' retired federal judge Nancy Gertner said. 
'He's trying to delegitimize anyone appointed by someone other than him and say that the only people who can be trusted are Trump judges,' she said.
The targeting of Jackson, who has presided over a set of cases involving Trump associates in the past year, is the latest in a drumbeat of disparagement from the president when he disagrees with rulings. After Trump criticized a district court judge who ruled against the administration in 2018, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. took the rare step of responding and countering the president's characterization of the judge as an 'Obama judge.' Roberts, nominated by President George W. Bush, has himself been the target of the president's ire. Trump labeled him an 'absolute disaster' for his vote in 2012 to uphold the Affordable Care Act. 
Other presidents have expressed dismay at court decisions, as President Barack Obama did during his 2010 State of the Union address after the Supreme Court's decision in Citizens United v. FEC opened the door for corporations and unions to spend freely in elections. But Trump's criticism comes as Stone's sentencing is pending and the president is being lobbied to pardon his friend. Michael Caputo, a former campaign adviser to Trump, on Wednesday announced a committee to raise money for Stone's appeal alongside a petition drive for him to be pardoned.
'Roger Stone stood up for Donald Trump. Now America should stand up for Roger Stone. Please take just a few seconds to help by signing the petition to pardon Roger Stone!' says the committee's website.
When asked Wednesday by reporters whether he was considering a pardon for Stone, Trump said, 'I don't want to say that yet.'
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Stone's sentencing by Jackson is scheduled for Feb. 20. A jury convicted Stone in November on charges of witness tampering and lying to Congress about his efforts to gather damaging information about Trump's 2016 presidential election opponent Hillary Clinton. Stone's defense has asked for a sentence of probation, citing his age, 67, and lack of criminal history.
On Tuesday, Trump criticized as unduly harsh the initial sentencing recommendation of seven to nine years made by front-line prosecutors. Shortly thereafter, the Justice Department signaled that it would seek a more lenient sentence for Stone, a move that prompted all four career prosecutors to withdraw from the case "" and one to resign from the government. 
Hours later, Trump targeted Jackson for her treatment of another ally of his, Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman, and suggested that the judge had been soft on Clinton. 
'Is this the Judge that put Paul Manafort in SOLITARY CONFINEMENT, something that not even mobster Al Capone had to endure? How did she treat Crooked Hillary Clinton? Just asking!' the president wrote, sharing a tweet that named Jackson as the judge who sentenced Manafort.
Just one day before Trump voiced his displeasure with Jackson, the judge issued a ruling favorable to the administration. She threw out a lawsuit filed by historians and watchdog groups seeking to compel the White House to preserve records of the president's calls and meetings with foreign leaders. 
Jackson, 65, has played a central role in cases involving Trump associates and Mueller's Russia investigation. She sentenced Trump's former deputy campaign chairman, Rick Gates, in December. She presided over the trial of Gregory B. Craig, a Democratic former White House counsel who was charged in a spinoff from the Mueller probe and was acquitted in September.
Before adding 3½ years to the almost four years Manafort received after his trial in Alexandria, Jackson said: 'This defendant is not public enemy number one, but he's also not a victim either. There's no question this defendant knew better, and he knew exactly what he was doing.'
She did not as a judge, however, have any authority over the conditions of Manafort's confinement, as the president suggested in his tweet.
Jackson, a 2011 nominee of Obama's, was born in Baltimore, the daughter of a U.S. Army-trained physician. A graduate of Harvard University and its law school, Jackson spent time both as a federal prosecutor in Washington and as a white-collar defense lawyer. With lawyer Robert P. Trout, she represented former Louisiana congressman William J. Jefferson on corruption charges after a search turned up $90,000 in cash stashed in the Democrat's freezer.
Jackson, through a court spokeswoman, declined to comment. 
Her current and former colleagues say she is unquestionably independent and will not be pressured by Trump's tactics, even if she would prefer not to be the subject of his attacks. 
'I have no doubt that she will not be deterred, pressured or intimidated by the unwarranted and inappropriate remarks of the president or anyone else for that matter,' said a colleague, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
 U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman, another colleague of Jackson's on the court in Washington, recently warned of the consequences of similar attacks from the president. Trump, Friedman said in a speech, 'seems to view the courts and the justice system as obstacles to be attacked and undermined, not as a coequal branch to be respected even when he disagrees with its decisions.'
Jackson has already tangled with Stone. Last February, a photo of the judge on Stone's Instagram account seemed to violate a gag order she had imposed on him because of concerns about pretrial publicity. The image appeared to show a gun sight's crosshairs next to a photo of Jackson's face. Stone said he wasn't sure who posted the image, but he said he viewed it as a Celtic cross. He apologized for it. 

Paul G. Cassell, a former federal judge in Utah, called the personal nature of the president's attacks 'highly unusual and an extraordinary departure from the way things are ordinarily handled.'
But, he said, the nation's system of government insulates judges from political pressure because they are appointed for life. While most judges would prefer not to be the target of attacks on social media, including from the president, he said, the independence of the judiciary provides protection from repercussions.
'Judge Jackson will simply move forward and decide the case,' said Cassell, now a law professor at the University of Utah, 'and ignore the surrounding atmospherics from the president and the others who are responding to him.'

No charges against former FBI official
President claims right to intervene in cases
The Justice Department on Friday revealed that it would not charge former acting FBI director Andrew McCabe, a longtime target of President Trump's wrath, exacerbating the angry divide between Trump, his attorney general and federal law enforcement officials. 
The development came just a day after Attorney General William P. Barr made a televised entreaty to Trump to stop tweeting about criminal cases "" and just hours after Trump defied that request. 
While three White House officials said Barr, one of Trump's most loyal and effective Cabinet secretaries, was in no immediate danger of being fired, the attorney general's relationship with the president is facing its gravest threat yet. Inside and outside the Justice Department, officials watched warily "" some questioning whether Barr was truly at odds with Trump, others heartened by what seemed to be Barr defending the institution's historical independence and all wondering what comes next. 
The eventful day began "" as many in Washington do now "" with a defiant Trump reacting on Twitter to something he saw on television. The president quoted from Barr's interview Thursday with ABC News, during which the attorney general asserted that Trump had never asked him to do anything related to a criminal case.
'This doesn't mean that I do not have, as President, the legal right to do so, I do, but I have so far chosen not to!' Trump added in his own voice.
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment on Trump's tweet. 

Hours later, the department made a move that might be seen as exerting its independence, revealing that it would not charge McCabe with lying to investigators about a media disclosure years ago. 
Officials familiar with the matter, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss Trump's interactions, said the president was not told about the McCabe decision in advance and was upset. White House lawyers, including White House counsel Pat Cipollone, moved to calm the president, these people said. One official said Trump 'believes very strongly that action should be taken.'
Trump, who is spending the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago Club in South Florida, did not address Barr's TV interview or the McCabe case in a speech before departing the White House. He and Barr spoke Friday afternoon, but the substance of their discussion was not immediately clear, a person familiar with the matter said. White House aides are counseling Trump not to discuss McCabe at all, according to those familiar with the matter. 
Democratic lawmakers and legal analysts, meanwhile, remained wary of what Barr was up to, and another development Friday indicated he was far from a complete break with the president. 
According to people familiar with the matter, Barr has tasked outside prosecutors "" in the deputy attorney general's office and from the U.S. attorney's office in St. Louis "" to review the handling of the criminal case against former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn and other sensitive national security and public corruption prosecutions in the U.S. attorney's office in Washington. Among the other cases are the investigation into Blackwater founder Erik Prince for potentially lying to Congress, along with other matters that have not yet been made public, a person familiar with the matter said. 
The prosecutors began their work in recent weeks, coinciding with the transition of office leadership from former U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu to interim U.S. attorney Timothy J. Shea, a former Barr counselor. One Justice Department official said a prosecutor with the St. Louis U.S. attorney's office is working with Flynn prosecutor Brandon Van Grack, characterizing his work as 'assisting' Van Grack in a review of the case.
That has fueled concerns among career prosecutors and others that the department's political leadership is making a push to exert more control at a key point in sensitive, high-profile cases. Flynn was one of the early people to plead guilty in connection with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe, admitting he lied to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States, though he has since tried to withdraw his plea and allege misconduct on behalf of prosecutors. 
The review was first reported by the New York Times. 
Trump has consistently sought to undermine Mueller's probe and those involved in it "" either by asking for investigations of the investigators or, in more extreme cases, that criminal charges be filed against them. That has been particularly true for McCabe and his former boss, James B. Comey. 
'Of all of them, it's Comey and McCabe that seem to really rile him up,' one person close to Trump and Barr said of the president. 
Behind the scenes, Trump has raged over the lack of legal action against the pair, including last August "" when officials announced that Comey would not face charges for his handling of memos he wrote while FBI director "" and in January, when The Washington Post reported that a re-examination of corruption allegations related to Hillary Clinton had come up empty, according to people familiar with the discussions.
As a top law enforcement official, McCabe authorized the FBI to begin investigating Trump personally for possible obstruction of justice in connection with the probe into whether the Trump campaign coordinated with Russia to influence the 2016 election.
McCabe became the focus of a grand jury probe over allegations from the Justice Department inspector general that he lied to investigators exploring a media disclosure. Department officials authorized prosecutors to seek an indictment of him last year, and in September a grand jury that had been hearing evidence was summoned back to consider the case after a months-long hiatus. 
But the day came and went with no public charges being filed. McCabe's legal team was told nothing. A spokeswoman for the D.C. U.S. attorney's office, which led the investigation, declined to comment. 
McCabe, a CNN contributor, said on the network Friday that the investigation was a 'horrific black cloud that's been hanging over me and my family for almost the last two years' and that the formal end of it was a 'relief' he could not put into words. 
'It's just a very emotional moment for my whole family,' he said. 
Trump's attacks made a prosecution of McCabe especially complicated. According to materials made public Friday in a Freedom of Information Act case related to the investigation, a federal judge in D.C. warned prosecutors in the case that the public was watching and that comments from the White House were detrimental.
'I just think it's a banana republic when we go down that road and we have those type of statements being made that are conceivably, even if not, influencing the ultimate decision,' Judge Reggie B. Walton said. 'I think there are a lot of people on the outside who perceive that there is undue,inappropriate pressure being brought to bear.'
He added later, 'I think as a government and as a society we're going to pay a price at some point for this.'

Barr, too, had for weeks been concerned with Trump's tweets about criminal cases, and on Thursday he decided to make his feelings known publicly. 
'I think it's time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases,' he told ABC News, adding that such statements 'about the department, about people in the department, our men and women here, about cases pending here, and about judges before whom we have cases, make it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors and the department that we're doing our work with integrity.'
Justice Department staff informed the White House about Barr's ABC interview after it was recorded, but before it aired, a person familiar with the matter said. They did not provide specifics, the person said. In recent weeks, Barr had told Trump privately more than once that the president's tweets and public statements were creating difficulties for the Justice Department, but when those private talks seemed not to have the desired effect, the attorney general decided to raise the issue publicly, according to people familiar with the matter.
Barr also said in the interview Thursday that Trump would be within his rights to ask for a criminal investigation in an area that didn't affect his personal interest "" such as in a terrorism case or fraud by a bank. But he said an attorney general would not listen to an order to investigate a political opponent.
'If he were to say go investigate somebody, and you sense it's because they're a political opponent, then an attorney general shouldn't carry that out, wouldn't carry that out,' Barr said.
The public rebuke of the president by a sitting member of his Cabinet arose from a crisis of confidence at the Justice Department, which had been accused this week of buckling to an angry tweet the president issued after he learned of prosecutors' initial prison recommendation for his longtime friend Roger Stone. 
A federal jury convicted Stone in November on charges of witness tampering and lying to Congress about his efforts to gather damaging information about Clinton, Trump's 2016 presidential election opponent.
On Tuesday, Trump criticized as unduly harsh the initial sentencing recommendation of seven to nine years made by front-line prosecutors. Shortly thereafter, the Justice Department signaled that it would seek a more lenient sentence for Stone, a move that prompted the four career prosecutors to withdraw from the case "" and one to resign from the government.
Barr has said the decision was made before Trump's tweet on the matter. His assertions, though, have not fully placated legal analysts and Democrats on Capitol Hill concerned that he is not adequately protecting the Justice Department's independence. Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) asserted Friday on Twitter that Barr had admitted intervening in a case 'to cover up for the President.'
'He's only upset that Trump's tweets made the political nature of his intervention obvious,' Schiff wrote. 'Barr fools no one. He's a witting accomplice to Trump's attack on the rule of law.'
Stone is scheduled to be sentenced next Thursday, though on Friday his defense attorneys demanded a new trial. The request came one day after Trump said on Twitter that the forewoman of the jury that convicted him 'had significant bias'

We know this much already: There will be an election next year. People will spend money, eat food, watch (and play) sports, use phone apps and play video games, and countries around the world will engage in diplomacy "" and conflict. The details of all those things, as always, will be what make the year interesting. To get a jump on the future, we asked Washington Post beat reporters and columnists to think about the big stories, themes and questions that we'll look back on this time next December. Here is Outlook's fourth Year in Preview.
 TV by Steven Zeitchik 
New big streaming services will mean new big hits (and new big bills)
The last few months of 2019 were filled with streaming news. Buckets of it. From the nonstop marketing of Jennifer Aniston in Apple TV Plus's 'The Morning Show' to that ubiquitous Baby Yoda from Disney Plus's 'The Mandalorian,' it seemed like the spigot might never turn off. 
And it won't, not anytime soon. This will be a year of new digital programming "" and new services to deliver it.
Just two weeks into 2020, Comcast will unveil more details about Peacock, its new service with content from across NBC Universal properties, set to launch several months later. The spring will also bring HBO Max, the prestige-branded service with all manner of TV shows and movies from the WarnerMedia empire. Disney Plus and Apple TV Plus, both of which launched in November, will add more content throughout the year, too "" as will Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post).
Viewers will have an ever-wider choice of fresh programming. Want new seasons of fan favorites 'Search Party' and 'The Boondocks'? They'll be on HBO Max. It's the final episodes of 'BoJack Horseman' you crave? Where else but Netflix. Looking for 'The Falcon and the Winter Soldier' to give you a fix between Marvel movies? Disney Plus has you covered.
Finding out when new episodes premiere, let alone whether they're worth watching, will be a task far more complicated than your Twitter feed can keep up with.
All these services know they need to offer some reliable hits to complement the new stuff. That means many popular sitcoms are migrating from Netflix. 'The Office' is headed to Peacock; 'Friends' to HBO Max.
And it will all be expensive. Turns out spending sacks of cash on new shows and movies "" Netflix alone is expected to shell out in excess of $15 billion in 2020 "" isn't easy without ad revenue. Services have to charge, whether that's the $5 a month for Apple TV Plus or the $15 for HBO Max. For consumers, that means piling on to a monthly entertainment bill or making tough choices about what to forgo.
But don't get too despondent. If some of the recent sitcoms you seek are too unwieldy or costly to find on streaming services, there's a suddenly appealing option: traditional television. Many shows, after all, will continue to air in syndication.

 Brexit by Karla Adam 
Britain will leave Europe. And then the negotiations will continue.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, fresh off an election victory, has vowed to 'get Brexit done.' Brexit will probably not be 'done' in 2020, but it will "" finally "" get started.
In January, 3 1/2 years after voting narrowly in favor of Brexit, Britain will officially split from the European Union. Expect a big party and fireworks, but don't expect a big rupture in relations between London and Brussels. The status quo will largely continue as the country enters an 11-month transition period, during which Britain will attempt to negotiate a trade deal with the E.U., its largest trading partner, as well as come to agreements on issues including security and law enforcement. Analysts think this is a crazy tight timetable, especially if Johnson wants to diverge substantially from E.U. rules. If a deal isn't completed by the end of the year, it's possible Johnson could break his pledge and seek to extend the transition period. Alternatively, Britain could crash out of the E.U. without a trade pact, reviving anxieties about an abrupt, chaotic and economically damaging 'no-deal' Brexit. 
One reason it's tricky to predict how Johnson will tack in the upcoming negotiations "" Does Britain stay closely aligned with the E.U.? Or does it tilt toward less regulation, in the spirit of Margaret Thatcher? "" is that the prime minister is hard to pin down politically.
But he could be tempted to keep Britain more in lockstep with the E.U., not least because his whopping majority means he won't be beholden to Euroskeptics in his party anymore. Plus, closer alignment could help with his political problems in Scotland and Northern Ireland: As the reality of Brexit sinks in, nationalist movements could gain momentum outside England, and a closer relationship with the E.U. could help head off those threats.

 Food by Laura Reiley 
You will soon taste meat grown in a lab, not on a farm
Plant-based meat was so 2019. Big Beef st(e)aked out territory, demanding legislation that put this interloper on the defensive, mostly in anticipation of what will surely be the food world's biggest game changer in the year to come: Cell-cultured meat, poultry and seafood products derived from muscle tissue grown in a lab with cells harvested from a living animal. 
It is unclear which U.S. company will be first to market "" chicken and duck from Memphis Meats in Berkeley, Calif., with investors such as Bill Gates, Richard Branson and Tyson Foods; Wagyu beef or chicken nuggets from Just (formerly Hampton Creek), whose investors include Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff, Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund; or bluefin tuna from Finless Foods "" but Barclays analysts say 'alt meat' could in the next decade capture 10 percent of the $1.4 trillion global meat industry.
Much of it hinges on rates of adoption. The numbers of vegans and vegetarians aren't growing much. These new products are geared toward omnivores and 'flexitarians,' but as with genetically modified organisms more than a decade ago, some consumers distrust food that has been tinkered with in a laboratory.
As it happens, that will also be an issue with another trend this coming year: grocery store foods that are gene-edited with CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Romaine and white potatoes that don't brown or bruise, and a gene-edited farmed tilapia that grows quickly, are among the foods improved via tiny DNA snips, essentially accelerating the selection of desirable traits that Gregor Mendel achieved via crossbreeding his peas. Whether consumers will embrace these new foods is unknown. For now, the Food and Drug Administration has proposed overseeing gene-edited animals as drugs, something the meat industry thinks will disadvantage American producers.

Tech by Tony Romm 
Washington will try to lock down Silicon Valley
Very few things unite President Trump and the Democrats vying to take his place in the White House, but both are readying for battle against Big Tech.
 Amazon, Facebook, Google and their Silicon Valley peers could face the first major consequences in the coming year from investigations by state and federal regulators into whether they undermine privacy, mishandle sensitive online content, damage elections or quash competition. 
Amazon is in the crosshairs for the tactics it's used to dominate e-commerce, Facebook for the way it gobbles up users' data (and its corporate rivals) and Google for its dominance of the online ad business. (Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.) Attorney General William P. Barr has said the Justice Department plans to wrap up its wide-ranging look at search, social media and online shopping in 2020. That could result in calls for new regulations and potentially punishments "" the most extreme being an attempt to break up one or more companies.
The House Judiciary Committee spent 2019 demanding internal documents from Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google. In 2020, it's expected to issue a report on whether the industry has, in effect, subverted federal antitrust protections. And if Trump loses the White House, the pressure will mount: Democratic contenders, especially Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), have promised to unwind some of the mergers that helped the giants become so big in the first place, such as Facebook's purchases of the photo-sharing app Instagram and the messaging platform WhatsApp.
Internet companies spent $55 million over the first nine months of this year to lobby Washington, and they'll throw more political weight around as the threat grows. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg hinted about a fierce counteroffensive in a talk with employees last summer. 'At the end of the day, if someone's going to try to threaten something that existential, you go to the mat and you fight,' he said. That fight is about to intensify.

Russia by Will Englund
Putin will press his advantage in the Middle East
If Russian President Vladimir Putin suspects that President Trump has been irretrievably weakened or distracted "" and especially if he thinks Trump will be replaced by a more mainstream alternative "" expect him to redouble his efforts to secure a deeper Russian role in the Middle East while he still has a chance.
Russia has been on a roll in the region, with a winning military intervention in Syria; a strengthening of diplomatic and commercial ties with Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Israel; a mercenary involvement in Libya; and a toe in the waters of the western Mediterranean through joint naval exercises with Algeria. But Moscow's gains have come through craft, stealth and a large measure of luck, rather than through major-power prowess, and the challenge will be to sustain and build on those achievements. 
Potential pitfalls abound. Putin has forged a generally useful working relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, but he may have to start fresh in a post-Netanyahu era, depending on Israel's third round of elections in March. Turkey and Saudi Arabia have been receptive to Russian dealmaking, but neither is a client state of Moscow by any measure. And the real key to Russia's Middle Eastern success almost certainly depends on its longtime ally Iran, now shaken by violent protests.
In Syria, the Russian military effort has come with little cost and less pain. The real fighting on the ground on behalf of the government of Bashar al-Assad has been carried out by Iran and its Hezbollah allies. But anti-Hezbollah unrest in Lebanon, anti-Iran unrest in Iraq and upheaval on the streets of Iran itself could significantly alter the calculation.
If Iran stumbles, would Putin be forced to bail out Assad, at the risk of getting ensnared in Syria and sparking disquiet at home? Could he continue to avoid a confrontation with Turkey? Would the Saudis be as friendly with Moscow if they thought Iran was distracted by its own troubles? Will the mood shift unpredictably in Washington?
In 2019, Russia demonstrated its agility in the Middle East. The real test may still lie ahead.

 Sports by Barry Svrluga 
It's finally safe to believe here in the District of Champions
Whatever awaits the rest of the country, not to mention 'official Washington,' in 2020, our little sports town occupies a fundamentally different space than it did just 20 months ago. Then, the default setting was dread. The expectation was not just for a loss, but a loss that would come in the most excruciating manner imaginable. How will I be kicked in the stomach today? 
Now? This is new territory, with pain replaced by possibility. Think about how the following sentences would have sounded in, say, December 2017: 'The Capitals are good. Really good. They might be the best team in hockey. They could definitely win the Stanley Cup.' 'The Nationals should be good. Really good. One more offseason move, and they could be favored for a division championship. If things break right, maybe they could win the World Series.'
Two years ago, that would have seemed outlandish and preposterous. Now, it sounds reasonable. Because it actually happened.
While basketball's Wizards might not be where hockey's Capitals and baseball's Nationals are at the moment "" expecting to contend "" the environment is such that their rebuilding project seems less laborious and more fun. A slow simmer of anger about another losing season is replaced by the joy of finding hope for the future. Plus, the Mystics won the WNBA title in 2019. We know winning basketball here!
It must be noted that the football team exists in a different reality, separate from the rest. It's as if the expectations for Washington sports have been turned around "" with the football team left behind. What awaits that outfit in 2020 "" a new coach, for sure, and perhaps even new leadership above him "" will be monitored closely. But the fans who have fled the football team have other places to land.
There's no way to tell what will happen with Washington sports in the year ahead. What we know, though, is that the reality has finally met the expectations, and that completely alters what we believe is possible.

The Economy by Heather Long 
A fragile boom keeps going and going
Although risks remain, the U.S. economy appears unlikely to fall into a recession in 2020. Another year of decent growth will probably make it easier for even more Americans to find jobs "" and boost President Trump's chances of reelection. And the trade wars that dominated economic discussion in 2019 seem to be over, at least for now. 
Growth is expected to be 1.8 percent next year, according to a closely watched survey of economists. That's far from the boom that Trump promised and slower than this year's pace of about 2.2 percent and last year's rate of 2.9 percent "" but the president and the Federal Reserve may have it in their power to nudge the figure upward.
Trump just reached trade agreements with China, Canada and Mexico. The deals are more modest than what he vowed he could achieve, but they signal that he is hitting pause on his trade battles, a welcome relief for Wall Street investors and many business leaders. Although consumers continue to spend at a healthy clip, companies had dramatically scaled back purchases this year because of the trade uncertainty. If Trump keeps the peace on trade, business spending could resume. 
Economists and investors also expect the Fed to lower rates at least once more in 2020, providing another boost. Three rate cuts by the Fed in 2019 were a major reason the stock market hit record highs and recession fears abated.
Although unemployment is at a 50-year low, the position of the middle class remains precarious. Jobs that pay middle-income wages are increasingly going away, replaced by positions paying over $100,000 or under $30,000. That socially destabilizing phenomenon will be a focus of the presidential race.
Economists, meanwhile, are also keeping a vigilant eye on robots "" because firms typically accelerate the automation of jobs done by temporary and low-skilled workers in the months leading up to a significant downturn.
But the general expectation is that the longest expansion in U.S. history, which began in mid-2009, will last at least one more year.

 Hollywood by Elahe Izadi 
No one will stay canceled for good
We've had a full year of hand-wringing over 'cancel culture,' particularly as it relates to comedians. Shane Gillis, for example, hired and then fired by 'Saturday Night Live' for racist language on podcasts, was denounced on social media by celebrities "" and also defended by famous comedians.
But 2020 may be the year when we learn that no one is canceled forever. 
The controversies will continue, yes. The society-wide reckoning with sexual harassment and assault won't abate. There will be more denounced jokes; comedy, more than most art forms, ages terribly. Norms and tastes rapidly evolve. More performers will come under fire for past or recent statements, jokes, offstage behavior or allegations of sexual misconduct.
'Getting canceled,' though, means suffering professional and personal consequences, not being permanently silenced.
Look at Aziz Ansari, who was embroiled in controversy in 2018 after Babe.net published an anonymous accusation of sexual impropriety (Ansari said that the interaction 'by all indications was completely consensual'). He retreated from the limelight for a while, but then he returned to stand-up, doing small shows to work out material before hitting the road to perform in packed theaters. He even addressed the allegation in an acclaimed Netflix special.
Louis C.K., who admitted to sexual misconduct after the New York Times published allegations from five women, lost his manager, publicist and all of the cultural cachet he had built up in his career. But he had a massive email list pre-scandal, and he can still promote himself to his diehard fans, the ones most likely to have remained as subscribers. C.K. is still performing, and as he announced to his list, he has several club and theater gigs in the United States and abroad in 2020.
Even Bill Cosby, convicted of assault, has found an audience "" albeit behind bars "" eager to listen to him opine.
Corporate entities putting together TV shows and movies will remain skittish about backing performers accused of problematic behavior or ones criticized for offensive material. But there will still be audiences willing to watch.

 THE World by Ishaan Tharoor
Protests won't stop. Neither will government crackdowns.
The motives of the millions who took to the streets in Santiago, La Paz, Algiers and Basra were as varied as their geography. But the demonstrators were united in what has become an epochal display of global discontent, an explosion of popular unrest that capped a decade of angst and anger. When they weren't clamoring for greater freedoms and democracy, protesters were marching against corruption, inequality and state brutality. In their wake, presidents fled, prime ministers resigned and governments fell. 
And the movements that flared in 2019 aren't about to peter out.
 Across Latin America, a creaking social contract seems on the verge of collapse: In Chile, widely viewed as one of South America's most stable societies, weeks of protests against austerity measures compelled the center-right president to shuffle his cabinet and announce reforms. But protesters remain on the streets, demanding a wholesale remaking of the socioeconomic order. Demonstrators in Ecuador, Colombia, Argentina and Haiti echoed the call for economic justice. An uprising in Bolivia chased out a long-ruling leftist president, while autocrats in Venezuela and Nicaragua cling to power despite popular challenges. More polarization, paralysis and violence may follow.
That's all the more on view in the Arab world, where a stunning wave of protests unseated leaders in Algeria, Sudan, Lebanon and Iraq. But an entrenched and often corrupt old guard is desperately trying to stay in control. In Iraq, security forces and pro-Iran militias have killed about 500 people and are preparing for a deeper crackdown. 
Iran hasn't been spared, either. In November, authorities cut off Internet access and killed potentially hundreds to quash protests that erupted after a rise in fuel prices. As Iran's theocratic regime enters its fifth decade, a tanking economy and widespread public anger over political elites' mismanagement and corruption only add to the sense of a brewing existential crisis.
In Hong Kong, a sustained pro-democracy movement remains grimly determined, defying the authoritarian leadership in Beijing and its local proxies. China has no intention of acceding to protesters' demands, though, and 2020 could mark a bloody tipping point for Asia's financial capital.
President Trump, known more for his coziness with autocrats than commitment to democracy struggles abroad, has been conspicuously silent about most of these displays of people power. But only in a few instances "" Hong Kong's American-flag-waving youth come to mind "" are any of these movements explicitly calling for U.S. support. The immediacy of social media still allows us to bear witness and hold repressive governments to account. There will be plenty to watch in the year to come.

The White House by Josh Dawsey
President Trump knows you don't like him. He doesn't care.
President Trump has begun admitting what polls have shown for three years: Many, many people hate him. And he's okay with that.
'You don't like me. You have no choice but to vote for me,' he told Wall Street bankers last month. 'You're … not nice people at all, but you have to vote for me,' he said to a room of Jewish supporters in December. 'You have no choice … you're not going to vote for the wealth tax!' 
It is a rare admission from a politician. But it's key to a campaign strategy built around an awareness that Trump's favorability "" even before he was impeached by the House "" is near record lows and that he won't stop tweeting, offering bombast and insults, saying things that aren't true, or making polarizing decisions. So Trump's advisers are leaning in.
'He's no Mr. Nice Guy,' said the narrator in a $1 million-plus ad that ran during the World Series, highlighting some of the president's accomplishments while admitting that voters might not like him. 'But sometimes it takes a Donald Trump to change Washington.'
The idea is to talk more about his record and less about his personality "" while slashing and burning Democratic opponents. At a briefing with reporters in mid-December, campaign manager Brad Parscale and senior adviser Jared Kushner showed data from 2016 indicating that people who said they disapproved of Trump still voted for him. They said many people don't want to publicly admit that they back Trump, but they ultimately will. Their targets are primarily suburban women and independents.
Essentially, Trump's bet is: If your paycheck is better, and we can make you hate the other candidate, you will vote for the president, even if you find him detestable. 
The campaign expects to send surrogates who are less bombastic, such as Ivanka Trump, into areas where suburban women might be persuaded to vote for him.
Officials point to statistics that cut in the president's favor. For example, a recent Quinnipiac poll showed that 57 percent of voters nationally say they are better off than before Trump's presidency. He regularly scores high marks on the economy, which has continued to improve.
That same poll, though, found Trump losing to Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Mike Bloomberg, Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar. And his approval ratings are mired below 50 percent.
But to Trump's team, that's no reason for panic: On Election Day in 2016, 61 percent of the country rated Trump unfavorably. Now he's running for a second term.

Gaming by Gene Park 
The newest celebrities will play video games
With $152 billion in revenue expected in 2019, gaming has become the dominant entertainment medium of the past decade. And if gaming is this century's rock-and-roll, its biggest personalities are becoming a new class of rock stars. 
These celebrities are much closer to the irreverence of rock and rap icons than any of the Hollywood guard: They're younger, have little interest in social filters and are mostly unimpressed by the lingering sheen of 20th-century stardom. But they're still causing 'utter destruction' in hotel rooms across the world, like the famous troublemakers who came before them.
Tyler 'Ninja' Blevins, the most visible such star recently, has been at the forefront, with an unprecedented exclusive contract with Microsoft's Mixer streaming platform. Others have followed suit, signing lucrative (and secretive) contracts. PewDiePie, arguably the most powerful person on the Internet, hit two milestones in 2019: becoming the first YouTuber to accumulate 100 million subscribers and marrying his longtime girlfriend, Marzia, in a royal wedding for the meme generation. And Dr. Disrespect, who brings the pomp and panache of pro wrestling to Twitch, just signed a TV deal, another first for a pro gamer.
Besides building careers as gamers, they also share brushes with controversy "" which may have been inevitable, given the challenges of communicating to an always-online, always-posting, always-angry audience. Celebrities have had to watch what they say for generations. But gamers grew up with social media, which often rewards the loudest in the room, no matter what.
All signs point to a messy integration between the populist media darlings of Gen Z and the existing power structure for politically correct pop. Ready or not, this clash of cultures is looming "" and Player One is determined to win the game at any cost.

The Supreme Court by Robert Barnes 
Impeachment will land squarely on the chief justice
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist added the famous Gilbert-and-Sullivan-inspired gold stripes to his black robe long before he wielded the gavel at President Bill Clinton's Senate impeachment trial in 1999.
But he did borrow from the operetta 'Iolanthe' in describing his role at the trial: 'I did nothing in particular, and I did it very well,' he told a television interviewer two years later. 
Now on deck: Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. The man who made judge-as-umpire his credo during his confirmation hearing would be only the third chief justice to preside at a presidential impeachment trial. It would also be the first trial of any kind where the lawyer turned appellate judge has been in charge.
Roberts was a law clerk to Rehnquist and shares with his predecessor the goal "" perhaps only aspirational, probably unobtainable "" of convincing the public that he and his fellow justices are impartial to outcomes and immune to partisan influence and bias.
Although the Supreme Court itself has no formal role in President Trump's impeachment, Trump has, perhaps wishfully, imagined that it might. He tweeted this month: 'Shouldn't even be allowed. Can we go to Supreme Court to stop?' Trump has also asked the court to protect his financial records from prosecutors and members of Congress, separate from impeachment; the justices will review that question in the spring.
But it is the chief justice, usually just one of nine, who by constitutional design plays the lone judicial role in presidential impeachment.
Like Rehnquist, Roberts is a student of history and the Constitution. Rehnquist wrote a book on impeachment; those who've studied the Clinton trial say he was reluctant to make broad rulings that could be overruled by a simple majority of senators. He left it to lawmakers to work out details over motions and witnesses. Roberts, who has chided Trump for suggesting that judges' views are more political bias than studied reasoning, will be looking to preserve his own reputation in a process that by design is more political than legal.

 Politics by Michael SchereR 
The billionaires are coming
Call it influence inflation: Back when Bill Clinton was president, $100,000 was enough to get a political donor invited to sleep over in the Lincoln Bedroom. These days, top political benefactors dole out $100 million or more to elect favored candidates. The amount of money spent on presidential campaigns by independent groups rose from almost $129 million in 2008 to nearly $670 million in 2016, according to the Campaign Finance Institute. And essential functions like collecting and analyzing voter data, voter registration drives and spending on political ads are increasingly funded by America's 607 billionaires, outside the direct control of politicians or parties. (One of the richest, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post, and in the 2018 cycle, donated $10.1 million to a super PAC supporting military veterans running for office, as well as $52,400 to five other federal PACs and campaigns, according to public records.) 
Next year will set new records, reaffirming the return of a gilded age for political money. What Brookings Institution scholar Darrell West calls the 'wealthification' of American politics is changing the players as well as the game. Two Democratic billionaires, Mike Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, are self-funding presidential campaigns to dethrone the billionaire president, Donald Trump (and to replace his Cabinet, the wealthiest in modern history, including billionaire Education Secretary Betsy DeVos). A co-chair of the Republican National Committee, Thomas Hicks Jr., is the son of one of the country's wealthiest families, as is the party's finance chairman, Todd Ricketts, while Linda McMahon, a former head of the Small Business Administration whose husband is a billionaire, chairs the top pro-Trump super PAC.
Polls have shown for years that strong majorities of voters think there is too much money in politics. But that hasn't changed the bottom line: The exceedingly wealthy increasingly fund the political world. You just vote in it.

While campaigning, president boasts of being at center of operation 

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. "" President Trump has quickly turned the U.S. drone killing of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani into a boast for the campaign trail, regaling supporters with tales of his role in the operation as he seeks to burnish his commander-in-chief credentials in an election year.
 At a campaign rally in Milwaukee last week and in a private event with Republican donors at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., this weekend, Trump has cast Maj. Gen. Soleimani's death this month as overdue justice for a man who denigrated the United States and used roadside explosives to kill and maim. 
In doing so, Trump has not bothered to vigorously defend the legal justification for the drone strike he ordered. (The administration has said Soleimani was planning 'imminent' attacks on U.S. assets but has not put forward detailed evidence.) Trump also seems to have abandoned his unfounded claim that up to four U.S. embassies were threatened after Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and other top officials acknowledged they were not aware of such a threat.
Rather, Trump has focused on placing himself at the center of the action. In leaked audio from the GOP fundraiser, Trump described listening in the White House Situation Room to live updates from a U.S. official who counted down the seconds until the strike on Soleimani was carried out.
'Then, all of a sudden, boom,' the president said. 
Other presidents have made the demise of high-profile national security threats a feature of their talking points for the campaign trail, including former president Barack Obama, who used the killing of al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden to push back against Republicans who had called him feckless during his run for reelection in 2012. 
But Trump's focus on Soleimani, as well as the killing of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a U.S. miliary raid in Syria this past fall, comes at a particularly fraught moment for a president who faces an impeachment trial in the Senate and has been consistently criticized by Democrats, and some Republicans, as lacking the temperament to lead the country.
Last month, former vice president Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, unveiled a campaign ad featuring a viral video of foreign leaders laughing while privately talking about Trump at a NATO gathering. A group of prominent GOP political strategists launched a major fundraising effort to help defeat him in crucial swing states in 2020. And a new book "" 'A Very Stable Genius,' written by two Washington Post reporters "" has offered alarming details of Trump dressing down U.S. military leaders and his own national security aides as 'a bunch of dopes and babies' during a private briefing at the Pentagon in 2017. 
By talking tough about the deaths of Soleimani and Baghdadi, Trump appeals 'to an electorate who likes to hear those sorts of things,' said Bryan McGrath, a retired naval officer who helped organize one of two 'Never Trump' letters signed by Republican national security experts in 2016. 'Most importantly, he's putting himself out there as a man of action, and I think that is appealing to his base.'
McGrath said he retains deep misgivings about Trump's leadership, but, he added: 'I like that Soleimani was taken out. I'm not exactly sure about all the planning that went into it. But I won't hold that one against him.'
Since announcing Soleimani's death, Trump has touted the operation as a measure of his resolve, criticizing Obama and former president George W. Bush for having passed up chances to kill the Iranian general. Both of them reportedly were concerned that such an act would lead to a war.
At his rally in Milwaukee on Tuesday, Trump spent much of the opening portion of his remarks boasting of his 'bold and decisive action to defend American lives and deliver American justice' against 'the world's number one terrorist.' 
Soleimani 'was the king of the roadside bombs,' Trump said. 'Great percentages of people don't have legs right now and arms because of this son of a bitch, okay?' He hammered Democrats who questioned the rationale for the strike and his overall Iran strategy, saying his political rivals 'should be outraged by Soleimani's evil crimes, not the decision to end his wretched life.'
As he did in his remarks at the private GOP fundraiser, Trump at the rally re-created a purported conversation he had with another unnamed official "" this one on the night that Iran responded to Soleimani's killing by launching a dozen ballistic missiles at Iraqi military bases that house U.S. troops. 
'I said, 'How many killed?' 'Nobody, sir.' I said, 'How many hurt?' They said, 'Nobody, sir.' And I said, 'They just saved themselves $1-trillion and a lot of lives,' ' Trump said, suggesting he would have escalated the conflict with additional sanctions and military strikes if U.S. personnel had been injured. 
Despite Trump's public statements that no Americans were wounded, at least eight U.S. troops suffered signs of concussions in the attack, officials said.
Robert Spalding, a retired Air Force general who served on Trump's National Security Council, said the president's use of Soleimani's death as a political cudgel is 'consistent with what's been done in the past.'
 'I don't see it as something outside the realm of what other people have done,' he said. 'Does talking about things like that burnish his credentials as a military leader? Well, I think that's up to whoever is listening to it.'
Polls suggest Trump has not won over the public on his Iran strategy. According to an ABC News-Ipsos poll, 56-percent of the public disapprove of Trump's approach on Iran, compared to 43-percent who approve. And 52-percent feel less safe after the strike on Soleimani vs. 25-percent who feel safer, the poll found. A Reuters poll taken before Iran's missile attack found that 71-percent of the public believe war with Iran is very or somewhat likely over the next few years. Just 51-percent held that view in May. 
Trump supporters have pointed to Iran's public statements that it does not seek to further escalate the crisis as evidence that the president scored a tactical victory in taking out Tehran's top military strategist with minimal costs to U.S. personnel. 
But critics have noted that the confrontation led Iraq's government to temporarily suspend counterterrorist operations against the Islamic State and vote to expel U.S. troops from the country, a demand Trump opposed this month. 
Last week, Douglas London, a retired CIA officer, wrote in Just Security, a national security journal, that he feared Trump was focusing on big-name 'celebrity' targets instead of more strategic operations. Along with Soleimani, London cited bin Laden's son Hamza, who was killed this past summer in an operation in which the United States played a role. 
'I am of the mind, knowing what a bad guy Soleimani was and the intelligence collection the U.S. is capable of, that it was quite probable that we had the intelligence case to justify this kind of operation' on Soleimani, said Ned Price, a former CIA officer who served as a spokesman for the National Security Council under Obama. 'What worries me is the prospect that President Trump undertook an operation with an eye more to the politics than to the strategic context. This, to me, sounds like a president who wants to look and act tough as he enters the election cycle.'

MORE MAY FOLLOW VINDMAN, SONDLAND 
Purge indicates president not inclined to move on
President Trump on Friday punished two witnesses who testified in the investigation that led to his impeachment, removing them from their posts in an apparent campaign to exact retribution on his perceived enemies in the wake of his acquittal in the Senate this week.
The White House ousted Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman from his post on the National Security Council and recalled U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland, moves that were quickly condemned as vindictive and an attempt to intimidate government officials who speak out against Trump.
Vindman, a decorated combat veteran who testified in November that he was disturbed by Trump's call for Ukraine to investigate the president's political rivals, was escorted out of the White House on Friday, according to his lawyer, David Pressman. 
'There is no question in the mind of any American why this man's job is over, why this country now has one less soldier serving it at the White House,' Pressman said in a statement. 'LTC Vindman was asked to leave for telling the truth. His honor, his commitment to right, frightened the powerful.'
Sondland, who donated $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee, fell out of favor with the president after his testimony in November alleging that the president pursued an improper 'quid pro quo' tying military aid for Ukraine to political investigations. Trump has long wanted to remove Sondland but was counseled against doing so during the impeachment process, according to officials who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration deliberations.
Trump's push to remove Sondland and Vindman "" and to exact punishment on other figures involved in the nearly five-month impeachment process "" underscored how his fixation with settling scores is outweighing any effort to move on to less divisive issues in the wake of his acquittal. 
Vindman's twin brother, Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, was also removed from his job at the National Security Council, where he worked as a lawyer, and was escorted off the grounds Friday afternoon.
The firings of Sondland and Alexander Vindman amounted to a post-impeachment bloodletting of key figures who complied with congressional subpoenas and testified in a process that Trump sought to delegitimize as a 'hoax' and a 'witch hunt.'

'I'm not happy with him,' Trump said earlier Friday when asked about Vindman's future. 'You think I'm supposed to be happy with him? I'm not.'
There was little resistance from within the Republican Party to the idea of punishing Vindman, a Purple Heart recipient and Ukraine expert, after The Washington Post reported Thursday night that he could soon be removed from his White House job. Some GOP lawmakers egged the president on "" a sign of how much Trump has asserted his influence on the party. 
Many lawmakers appeared to take it as a given that a president who fired an FBI director during a federal investigation into his campaign and who attacked the religious sincerity of his perceived enemies during a prayer breakfast this week would set out for revenge in the wake of an effort to end his presidency. 
'I think the president's entitled to have whoever he wants on the NSC,' said Rep. Paul Mitchell (R-Mich.). 'It's not like they're being put on the street, they'll go back to "" in Vindman's case, he goes back to the Pentagon.'
Both of the Vindmans were detailed to the NSC and will return to jobs in the Defense Department, with Alexander Vindman then planning to report to the Army War College in July. 
But underscoring the sense of retribution is that Alexander Vindman recently told senior officials at the NSC and the Army that he intended to leave his White House position by the end of February, months ahead of schedule. That appears not to have been soon enough for the president.
Several other officials who testified during the House impeachment inquiry have left the government, including former ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch; William B. Taylor Jr., her replacement; vice presidential aide Jennifer Williams; State Department official Michael McKinley; special envoy for Ukraine negotiations Kurt Volker; and NSC official Tim Morrison.
More firings are possible.
The president and his advisers have also discussed removing Michael Atkinson, the inspector general of the intelligence community, though no final decision has been made, officials said. Trump has expressed frustration that Atkinson allowed a whistleblower report documenting Trump's alleged misconduct toward Ukraine to be transmitted to Congress.
Some advisers have also counseled the president to remove Victoria Coates, the deputy national security adviser, who has told others in the White House that she fears her job is in jeopardy. 
Trump has regularly asked aides to continue slashing the size of the NSC, and national security adviser Robert C. O'Brien has said he plans to do so, telling NPR in an interview last month that the policy staff, which he put at about 180 people when he took over in September, was bloated.
By the end of February, O'Brien said, he hoped to have cut it by a third. A senior administration official said there will be widespread departures at the NSC in the next week.
The crux of the impeachment case against Trump was the allegation that he withheld military aid and a White House meeting to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden "" who served on the board of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma while the elder Biden was vice president "" as well as a widely discredited theory that Ukrainians interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Sondland had been an ally of the president before his explosive testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. He told lawmakers that he had come to believe that the Trump administration was tying almost $400 million of security assistance for Ukraine to Trump's push to have the country investigate his political rivals.
'Everyone was in the loop,' he said of Trump's administration.
Trump denied the damning allegations, but he could not easily dismiss his top donor and appointee as a 'deep state' bureaucrat or 'Never Trump' operative. 
Trump regularly mocked Vindman for his uniform and how he spoke during his testimony, according to people who heard his comments and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss them. Of all the witnesses, Trump had the most visceral disdain for Vindman, White House officials said.
Trump has told White House officials that he believes Vindman was responsible for providing information about Trump's conduct to the whistleblower. That allegation, while unsubstantiated, formed the root of Trump's anger with Vindman, two White House officials said. 
Democrats called Vindman's removal vindictive.
'As usual, the White House runs away from the truth,' Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement. 'Lt. Col. Vindman lived up to his oath to protect and defend our Constitution. This action is not a sign of strength. It only shows President Trump's weakness.'
It was not clear what other forms of retribution the White House might pursue in the wake of Trump's acquittal. A White House statement released after the Senate trial concluded Wednesday ominously posed a rhetorical question: 'Will there be no retribution?'

Asked about Friday's moves, the National Security Council said, 'We do not comment on personnel matters.' 
The Vindman brothers were among several people Trump mocked and attacked during a 63-minute event Thursday at the White House that was billed as his official public response to his acquittal.
In his testimony before House investigators, Vindman said he did not think it was 'proper' for Trump to 'demand that a foreign government investigate' the Bidens.
Vindman, who has 20 years' service and testified in his uniform, also described his family's journey from the Soviet Union to the United States, casting his upbringing and military service as a storied version of the American Dream. 
His remarks about how 'here, right matters' were repeated by House impeachment managers as they sought to make a case in the Senate that convicting Trump was a matter of simple right and wrong. 
In his rebuttal Thursday, Trump declared himself completely innocent and zeroed in on his perceived enemies.
'We went through hell, unfairly,' he said in the East Room. 'Did nothing wrong. Did nothing wrong.'
Speaking Thursday on Fox News, the White House press secretary described the president's mind-set in stark terms, saying that Trump had been treated unfairly by the impeachment process and that 'maybe people should pay for that.' 
The vengeance effort being pushed by White House officials, Republican lawmakers, Trump family members and other allies has broadened and intensified this week as Trump made clear he was not interested in moving on. 
During his speech Thursday, Trump publicly singled out several of his perceived enemies, describing them as 'vicious,' 'horrible,' 'bad,' 'dirty' and 'corrupt.'
The pugilistic response to impeachment has been endorsed by some of Trump's closest allies, indicating that vengeance will likely be a key theme of the president's reelection effort. While Trump was impeached on allegations he abused his power to pressure a foreign government to attack his political rivals, his latest efforts indicate that he plans to continue his no-holds-barred brand of politics.
The White House has been disseminating talking points attacking Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah), the lone Republican to vote to convict Trump of abuse of power. Trump has privately discussed with Republican lawmakers ways to exact revenge on House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) for his leading role in the president's impeachment, according to people familiar with the conversations. Trump has tried to block the release of a tell-all book by former national security adviser John Bolton, and some Republicans are calling for Bolton's security clearance to be stripped.
GOP Senate committee chairmen are ramping up their investigation into Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine.
Trump's allies have framed the impeachment as part of a broader effort by Democrats to delegitimize his presidency, making the case that retribution is warranted.
'I really hope that Republicans learn to fight like the Democrats,' Trump's son Donald Trump Jr. said Thursday on Fox News. 'My father does the things that he does because he realizes, unlike so many in our party, that there is no acceptance of an apology. . . . They will cancel you. They will do whatever it takes to ruin you.'

DES MOINES "" The opening of the political year has collided with the end of the impeachment of President Trump. The coincidence of timing, unplanned perhaps but symbolic nonetheless, points directly to what is at stake when Americans vote in November. For now, healing is not on the agenda.
Impeachment is an infrequently used tool to restrain a runaway or corrupt president. On Wednesday, Trump will become the third president to be acquitted after being impeached. No president has ever been impeached and convicted, though, of course, Richard M. Nixon resigned and left town to avoid such a fate.
Trump will never escape the fact of having been impeached, but he will, no doubt, see acquittal as a victory. His supporters will share in that conclusion, offended that it ever came to this. Half of the country, however, that portion of the population that has said in polls they believe Trump should be removed from office for abusing his powers, will be at a minimum disappointed. Many of them will be genuinely angry.
That is the pretext for this election year. For both sides, November will offer the only avenue to resolve the question of how long Trump remains in office and what boundaries the American people choose to set on a presidency. There is no more significant question facing voters, and they are sharply divided in their views.

On Tuesday night, on the eve of the Senate's scheduled acquittal vote, the president will deliver his State of the Union address before an evermore divided House chamber. No matter what he says, no matter the claims he makes about himself and his accomplishments, the real state of this union at the beginning of 2020 is fraught: sour despite a good economy; distrustful of the opposition; despondent over seemingly permanent divisions; anxious about the future of democracy at this point in the country's history. Impeachment has only intensified those feelings.
The Senate trial has done nothing to help restore public confidence. On Friday, by 51 to 49, the Senate voted against calling witnesses to testify, preferring to push ahead to final votes. For a time, the outcome of that vote seemed in the balance. By the time it came, only two Republicans were prepared to buck their leadership and the president.
The vote blocked an appearance by former national security adviser John Bolton "" or anyone else with potentially relevant knowledge of what the president said and did in withholding military aid to Ukraine in an effort to get that country to announce investigations into former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Bolton has made clear he is willing to testify. Leaks of what he has written in his forthcoming book have been tantalizing, if not dispositive.

All senators swore to weigh impartial justice during the trial. In the end, the GOP showed what it means to be a member of what used to be called the Republican Party but now is simply the Party of Trump. This is not a new observation: Over the past four years, the president has remade the party into a wholly owned subsidiary of Trump Inc.
Friday's vote showed the value of that remaking, and the explanations provided by two Republicans "" Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, whose votes ultimately blocked witnesses "" are telling examples of how distorted the process became.
Murkowski concluded that the impeachment process was a failure and there was no reason to continue it. 'Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate,' she said. 'I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything. It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed.'

Alexander offered a different rationale for his vote. He waited until he was faced with the decision on whether to allow testimony to express real misgivings about what the president did. He concluded that the House managers had proved their case, that the president's actions were inappropriate but that what Trump did was not enough to warrant removal from office.
'The Constitution does not give the Senate the power to remove the president from office and ban him from this year's ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate,' he said. 'The question then is not whether the president did it, but whether the United States Senate or the American people should decide what to do about what he did. I believe that the Constitution provides that the people should make that decision in the presidential election that begins in Iowa on Monday.'
Most Republican senators have been unwilling even to describe what the president did as inappropriate. Instead, they have preferred to criticize House Democrats for what they say was a rushed and partisan impeachment process. By blocking witnesses, those senators have chosen to deny voters, in whose judgment they claim to be entrusting so much, additional and relevant information that might inform their decisions about whether the president deserves a second term in office.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) resisted impeachment for months and months, despite facing pressure from her liberal block. When the details of the president's pressure campaign against Ukraine in pursuit of his own political interests became public last fall, she changed her position, and her troops rushed to finish, pushing against an arbitrary, year-end deadline. In the end, the vote to impeach failed the test Pelosi had set out earlier, which is that, for impeachment to be successful, it should be bipartisan.
The Senate took a page from the House, deciding that a rushed process was in their interest and certainly the interest of the president, despite strong support from the public for testimony from witnesses who had relevant information and not yet been heard. They have ended up drawing no lines on presidential behavior. Trump, whose view of presidential power is extravagant, will interpret the result as he pleases.
That leaves the issue of Trump's future "" and questions about presidential powers, presidential behavior and the parameters of the Constitution "" back where it always was destined to be, with the voters.
The impeachment process has left many Democrats frustrated or worse. The votes in the Senate were stacked against them. That is not the case for the election that will be held in November.
Trump starts with advantages, the normal benefits of incumbency as well as the strength of the economy. He also starts, however, with almost half the people in the country saying they definitely will vote against him.
On Monday night, Iowa Democrats will trigger the process by which the party selects a nominee to challenge the president. Despite a year of campaigning, that choice has left countless people who want nothing more than to defeat the president almost frozen in indecision as they evaluate a field of candidates, none of whom appear to be a sure winner in November.
The impeachment process will soon be over, but its impact and meaning will remain to shape the choice in this election year. Because Trump is no ordinary president, this was never to be an ordinary reelection campaign. It was always destined to be one of the most significant in voters' lifetimes. After impeachment, the choices for voters are all the more fundamental "" and the outcome all the more consequential for the future of the country.

Officials report talk of 'trying to hide' things that would anger Trump 
Intelligence officers pride themselves as apolitical fact-finders who follow the rule of 'speak truth to power.' But President Trump has tacked on a new coda: 'Do so at your peril.'
In ousting his acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, last week after a revealing briefing on foreign election interference, Trump has reminded members of the intelligence community that he views the information they bring him through a deeply personal lens.
Trump upbraided Maguire in the Oval Office on Feb. 14, saying that the intelligence community had handed Democrats political ammunition during a bipartisan briefing a day earlier about efforts to secure the 2020 election. A senior career intelligence officer who worked for Maguire told lawmakers that Russia had 'developed a preference' for Trump. She also described other steps Russia is taking, including assistance to the presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
Trump responded not by rejecting Russia's interference or pressing his officials to work harder to deter it, but by telling Maguire and another senior career intelligence official present that they were being 'played,' according to a senior White House official. 
Five days later, Trump announced that Richard Grenell, the U.S. ambassador to Germany and a presidential loyalist, would step in as the new acting director of national intelligence. Maguire was told to vacate his office at the DNI's headquarters in Virginia by 10 a.m. the next morning, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. 
Current and former national security officials were appalled but not surprised by Maguire's unceremonious dispatch. '[I]n this administration, good men and women don't last long,' retired Adm. William H. McRaven, who led the raid that killed Osama bin Laden and is one of Maguire's closest friends, wrote in an opinion piece for The Washington Post on Friday.
 'Joe was dismissed for doing his job: overseeing the dissemination of intelligence to elected officials who needed that information to do their jobs,' McRaven wrote. 
Intelligence officers are used to working with presidents who don't enthusiastically embrace or always agree with their analysis. But Trump's tendency to shoot the messenger puts the people working for him in a precarious position. 
'Since the day Trump took office, we've had a president who has made clear to everyone around him that if you do things he doesn't like, there are going to be swift and public consequences,' said Katrina Mulligan, a former National Security Council aide for the Obama administration. 'So the intelligence community at this point is having to walk a tightrope. They have to provide him with information "" he's the one responsible for protecting the nation. And yet they might start to feel like they need to hold things back to avoid triggering his anger. That's not good.'
Three other former senior intelligence officials said that Trump's violent reactions could encourage his advisers to withhold unsettling information.
There is talk of 'trying to hide' stuff, one of the former officials said, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. 'Some people believe the president can't be trusted with this politically sensitive information anymore. There's a sense that he's installing his guy [Grenell] and they're going to come in and try to look for stuff, and they're not trustworthy.'
Grenell, who has no experience in the intelligence community, is close to Trump and his children. The president delights in his boosterism on Fox News and Twitter, where Grenell frequently clashes with the president's critics and with journalists. 
Current and former intelligence officials see Grenell's appointment, which he has said will last only until a permanent director is confirmed by the Senate, as a signal that Trump intends to exert more political control over the intelligence community.
A House intelligence committee official worried that Trump 'has installed a new acting DNI to protect himself and interfere politically in the crucial work of the intelligence community, leaving our elections more vulnerable to foreign interference than ever.'
The decision to move another Trump loyalist, Kash Patel, into a senior advisory position at the intelligence director's office further cemented that impression.
Patel, a former aide to Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) and most recently the top counterterrorism official on the National Security Council, has infuriated CIA and FBI personnel over his efforts to prove a conspiracy in the intelligence community to bring down the president by investigating his campaign's possible ties to Russia in 2016. 
U.S. intelligence agencies unanimously concluded that in 2016, Russia leaked emails from the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign as part of an effort to harm her candidacy and boost Trump, a finding that has long riled Trump and congressional Republicans. 
The recent analysis that Russia is again trying to help Trump inflamed a long-sensitive nerve.

Trump bristles at the mention of what he calls the 'hoax' of Russian interference in his first campaign, current and former administration officials have said. Former Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was told by acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney not to discuss the subject with the president because it would make him angry, according to current and former officials. 
Trump's frustrations with election security were on display again when he dressed down Maguire. The president questioned him about why Russia would want to help him, arguing there was no evidence to support the claim. 
Nunes, the ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee and one of Trump's most stalwart allies on Capitol Hill, had already told Trump that Maguire's election security coordinator, Shelby Pierson, and other officials at the briefing were unpersuasive, according to a White House official with knowledge of their conversation and the president's argument with his intelligence advisers.
The president was upset by what he said were Pierson's unsubstantiated comments. 
'If you're going to come in and say Russia is trying to interfere with our election, or has a preferred candidate, you better have the evidence for the president,' the official said. 
But other officials said Trump had been told before about Russian interference. The analysis that Russia favored Trump may have been new, but the president already knew about Russia's tactics and strategies heading into 2020. 
One U.S. official said Pierson's statement that Russia has 'developed a preference' for Trump 'may overstate the underlying intelligence.'
'The underlying intelligence doesn't conclusively support that assessment,' the official said. 
Some lawmakers told Pierson that Russia wouldn't support Trump because he provided lethal weapons to Ukraine to defend against Russia. (Trump froze other congressionally approved aid for Ukraine while he sought Ukrainian investigations of his political rivals, actions that led to his impeachment.) 
Intelligence, however, is often inconclusive. Current and former officials also noted that briefers like Pierson generally don't share raw intelligence or the evidence underlying a broader assessment with lawmakers.
Regardless of whether Pierson overstated what's currently known, the message from Trump to intelligence officers seemed clear. 
'The entire executive branch is spooked right now because election interference in his mind is about him,' one former intelligence official said. 'So you can't do anything that isn't essentially under the radar, or you might end up blowing up the effort.'

A senior U.S. intelligence official with direct knowledge of intelligence briefings with the president said that Trump is open to information he might not want to hear. 
'We never get a briefing canceled because we give him bad news,' said the senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the details of intelligence briefings. 
'We go in, and he treats us with respect. He listens, he asks questions, and he lets us answer those questions,' the official said. 'Much of our news is bad news. Yet he invites us back.' 
The official, who is familiar with briefings to former presidents, said intelligence officers understand that their job is to convey information to Trump and not to be pressured by his or others' public comments. 
'Our job isn't to listen to Twitter,' the official said. 'We are focused on and have to be able to explain everything that's going on in the world.'
Pierson, who has been the national intelligence manager for Russia, is the first election threats executive, a position created in July by then-DNI Daniel Coats to coordinate election security activities across the intelligence community. That includes monitoring different streams of intelligence that agencies collect about interference activities and intentions "" the kind of information used to conclude that Russia has developed a preference for reelecting Trump. 
With colleagues from other agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI, Pierson has sought to broaden and elevate the discussion about foreign interference threats.
'There's been a real push to raise public awareness across the voting populace,' she said in a discussion sponsored by American University's Tech Law and Security Program earlier this month.
Pierson also acknowledged officials were worried that election security could acquire a partisan tinge. 'There was some original concern that the government doesn't want to weigh in too heavily on this, particularly because of [the fear of it appearing to be] a political endeavor, which I think also makes these challenges . . . even more complicated,' she said.

Trump and Biden forgo rallies for critical ads and webinars amid pandemic

President Trump calls himself a ""wartime president"" and former vice president Joe Biden says the nation must ""put politics aside,"" but both leaders have allowed their campaigns to launch deeply personal offensives against the other in recent days as they confront a likely general election clash before a
nation
grappling with a viral pandemic. 
The faceoff comes as much of the presidential campaign has been either put on hold or shifted online as the contenders retool for an new era of economic crisis and social distancing. Fundraisers have been postponed, rallies have been canceled, and new technologies are under consideration.
General election strategists have put new polls in the field and shuffled plans for spring advertising campaigns, even as Biden's sole challenger for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), remains in the race. 
Few are willing to predict with any certainty how the events of the past few weeks will affect what is still expected to be a close election in November. But Democrats are hopeful that the crisis will put into sharp relief the arguments they have been making for months. 
Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to Biden, said that the American people were seeing in the pandemic response the consequences of ""the chaos around this president."" 
""There is a price that this nation pays for that behavior,"" Dunn said. ""As we move forward that is going to be a case we prosecute.""
Republicans, by contrast, are hopeful that Trump's role as head of the federal response to the novel coronavirus will insulate him against the coming Democratic critiques about his leadership. Trump has told advisers that his daily news conferences are helping him because they show him involved, and advisers are hoping to utilize the video footage of New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo praising the president in ads.
""Anybody who attempts to politicize and weaponize a public health crisis is revealed to be petty and peevish,"" said White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. ""To criticize Trump now is to criticize public health officials, FEMA, first responders, private-sector businesses that are all coming forward to help.""
Neither side has pulled its punches in near-daily diatribes.
Trump's campaign communications director accused Biden of pushing critiques of Trump that ""dangerously undermine the federal public health effort by purposely sowing confusion and fear merely for the sake of politics."" 
Biden, who has refrained from criticizing Trump while he is abroad out of respect for the office, told reporters Friday that Trump ""is falsely telling us he's taking action he has not taken, promising results he's not delivering and announcing actions that he has not even ordered.""
Biden's campaign also released a digital video accusing Trump of adopting a ""don't test, don't tell mind-set"" that failed to prepare the nation for the coronavirus.
As it adjusts to the pandemic, the Biden campaign has been scrambling to build out a new television studio in the recreation room of his Delaware home so he can communicate with voters - his first presentation took place Monday morning - and his staff is exploring technological solutions that would allow him brief interactions over video conference with individual voters that would imitate a rope-line encounter.
The campaign's immediate focus is on the policy response to the virus, but the political message focuses heavily on the Democratic case that Trump has mishandled the crisis. 
Biden used his address Monday to escalate his criticism of Trump's handling of the pandemic, saying he hoped Trump ""steps up and starts to get this right.""
""Trump keeps saying that he's a wartime president,"" Biden said. ""Well, start to act like one.""
""Donald Trump is not to blame for the coronavirus, but he does bear responsibility for our response,"" he added.


The attack builds upon a broader argument that the pandemic confirms concerns many potential swing voters have about Trump. 
""What the coronavirus response has done in very short order is demonstrated an immediate, tangible, significant impact of the president's impulsiveness and the chaos he has sowed,"" said Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, a super PAC that plans to spend $150 million in an effort to defeat Trump this year. Priorities bought $6 million in television and digital ads this week in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, criticizing Trump's virus response and praising Biden's. 
Democrats have also noted with relief that the viral emergency has forced a break in the Trump campaign's effort to disqualify Biden with personal attacks as he tries to unify the Democratic Party and refill his own campaign's considerably inferior coffers. 
""Biden is always going to do best when we look at this election as a referendum on who would be the best commander in chief,"" said Robby Mook, who managed Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. ""And this is a commander in chief moment."" 

Trump campaign advisers do see some liability in how the president handled the opening days of the virus - particularly in the lack of testing and the continuing slow response despite vocal pleas from overwhelmed hospitals. Some close to the president fear that if the stock market continues to drop - and unemployment goes into the double digits - it would be difficult to reelect the president who has cast his central argument as a booming economy. 
Trump has sought to rewrite history in some ways, insisting that he was focused on the pandemic early even as he downplayed it publicly and ignored warnings about its potential on American soil. He also is working to negotiate a large stimulus package that aides hope will have political benefits. 
Trump advisers have been cheered by recent public polling that finds more than half of the country approves of Trump's response to the crisis, a number far better than his typical approval numbers in polls. Some advisers say they believe the country will rally around the president during a crisis.
""Americans want to see their president out front and leading in a time of national crisis and that's exactly what President Trump is doing,"" Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign communications director, said in a statement. ""At the same time, Joe Biden and the Democrats offer nothing but ineffective partisan sniping from the sidelines.""
Biden himself has been pushing a different story line about Trump's performance. 
""The president has been behind the curve throughout this whole response,"" Biden told reporters Friday. ""Stop saying false things that make you sound like a hero . . . Stop, stop, stop swerving between overpromising, buck-passing, and start delivering protection to our people.""
Biden has been talking at length with his advisers to formulate an economic plan. Although staying largely in the background, he has been in frequent contact with House and Senate Democratic leaders to keep tabs on legislation that they are crafting and to offer his own feedback. While Trump has been holding calls with governors, Biden has, too. He has been in contact with Cuomo, Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee (D), and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D), among others.
But he has been frustrated that he's confined to his home in Wilmington, Del. - the virus has a higher mortality rate among older Americans like Biden, who is 77 years old - and the constraints that limitation has placed on his campaign. 
His advisers feel he is at a distinct disadvantage in an all-digital campaign because Biden's strength lies in the way he builds an emotional rapport with voters face-to-face, a type of campaigning that will be hindered now that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging Americans to avoid crowds larger than 10 people. 
Now, he has said, when campaign aides enter his home, they are first putting on masks and wearing gloves. 
The biggest shift in Biden's digital strategy is in fundraising. Over the weekend he held two high-dollar virtual fundraisers - appearing via video. But at the same time he was hoping to escalate his online fundraising appeals among those willing to give smaller amounts, aides said, the economic crisis has made them wary of hammering supporters over the head asking for money. Instead, they are trying softer approaches, sending emails that try to draw people into the campaign in other ways.
An aide said Biden's vast army of high-profile endorsers, many of them former presidential candidates, will probably be featured in digital events soon, too, perhaps even holding their own events. Former Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan, who has campaigned for Biden in several states, has volunteered to host yoga online during the time of quarantine. 
Trump begins what is effectively the start of the general election with a vast advantage in money, but replenishing his accounts is suddenly more problematic. One Republican strategist involved in the Trump campaign's efforts said it was a difficult time to ask for money because the markets are down and people are worried.
The president has no fundraisers or rallies planned at the moment, though Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, RNC finance chairman Todd Ricketts and others continue to make fundraising calls behind the scenes. 
Volunteers from Trump Victory, the RNC's field effort, are still calling supporters; a Republican official with knowledge of the matter said they made 1.4 million calls on Saturday. Officials working in battleground states across the country are holding webinars with field organizers and volunteers to strategize on reaching voters. (Trump's headquarters staffers, as well as Biden's, are working from home to lower their risk of catching the virus.)
The Trump campaign plans to lean on its significant data operation in the coming months to communicate digitally with supporters.
""The campaign and RNC have built up a massive, unparalleled database containing the contact information of tens of millions of voters and we are putting that information to work to maintain contact with voters and spread the President's message,"" Murtaugh said. ""We continue to consider new, creative ways to interact with voters, provide them with information, and let them know how they can help.""
American Bridge, another Democratic group spending money to defeat Trump, recently released a new digital ad that cuts together quotes from Trump downplaying the severity of the coronavirus with reports of the horrific potential consequences of the pandemic. 
Bradley Beychok, president of American Bridge, said the group was going to conduct research over the coming weeks about how to best push a message in television ads to hurt Trump among white working-class voters in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
Like other Democrats, he was hopeful that the president's support would take a hit.
""Trump's superpower sometimes is deflection,"" Beychok said. ""It is a very hard thing for Trump to distract people from what is going on right now.""

President Trump on Friday became the first president to attend the March for Life event in Washington, expressing solidarity with tens of thousands of conservative and evangelical voters that his campaign considers a core constituency for his reelection bid. 
Trump made no mention of the ongoing Senate impeachment proceedings taking place just blocks away at the Capitol as he addressed throngs of antiabortion activists on the Mall. But his relatively brief appearance offered an implicit split screen for a president who has been consumed with the Democrats' efforts to oust him.
The appearance also followed a threat Friday from the Trump administration to withhold federal funding from California over its requirement that private insurers cover abortions "" a move state officials immediately denounced as a 'cheap political' shot timed to coincide with the antiabortion rally.
Taking the lectern to his campaign theme, Lee Greenwood's 'God Bless the U.S.A.,' Trump basked in applause, pumping his fist and mouthing thank yous to the crowd. Some were dressed in 'Make America Great Again' hats, and chants of 'Four more years!' were audible as he began speaking.
'Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House,' Trump said, hewing closely to his prepared text in a 13-minute address that was peppered with partisan attacks on 'far-left Democrats,' whom he accused of 'working to erase all our God-given rights.'
'They are coming after me because I am fighting for you,' Trump declared. 
Though he was referring to the abortion debate, the president sounded like he could have been alluding to the impeachment fight when he added: 'We will win because we know how to win.'
Trump's decision to attend the rally in its 47th-year was the culmination of a remarkable shift by a president who had called himself 'very pro-choice' in a television interview two decades ago and who entered office amid some reservations among antiabortion activists. The president highlighted a list of actions he has taken over the past three years "" including a ban on nongovernmental organizations from using federal money to offer abortion services abroad "" that have earned him praise from movement leaders, who said he has done more than his Republican predecessors.
'It's really been remarkable. He's leaned into this more than any other pro-life president,' Jeanne Mancini, the president of March for Life, said on Fox News. 'This is unprecedented.'
Trump's reelection campaign heavily promoted his appearance at the rally, tweeting endorsements from influential figures and announcing the creation of a new outreach effort called 'Pro-Life Voices for Trump' that will be co-chaired by Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, and Catholic priest and activist Frank Pavone. 
 Surrogates quickly sought to paint Democrats as trying to undermine Trump's efforts to deliver on his legislative agenda.
Democrats spend the day 'grandstanding on lies for political self-interest,' Jenna Ellis, a legal adviser for the Trump campaign, wrote on Twitter. She asserted that Trump was 'standing firm on a moral truth to save the lives of millions.' 
But abortion rights activists denounced Trump for what they viewed as the president's false and dangerous rhetoric on abortion, as well as policies that Planned Parenthood said has 'endangered, if not completely cut off, health care for people at home and around the world.'
In his remarks, Trump said Democrats in New York cheered legislation that 'would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb right up until delivery.' Fact-checkers have called this interpretation of the law, which allows for abortions after 24 weeks if the mother's health is at risk or there is an absence of fetal viability, inaccurate. 
The president also accused Virginia's Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, of stating that he would 'execute a baby after birth,' though a spokeswoman for Northam said at the time that his words were taken out of context by Republicans.
'Trump has often parroted debunked, fearmongering rhetoric about abortion that is intended to mislead the public and shame women,' Samuel Lau, a Planned Parenthood official, wrote in a memo to reporters. 'It's important not to accept this kind of language as normal.'
 Trump has sought to rally evangelicals in recent weeks, after the editor in chief of Christianity Today published an op-ed in December endorsing the effort to impeach him over his conduct in allegedly pressuring Ukraine's leader to open an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden, a top Democratic presidential contender.
The president held a campaign rally for evangelicals in Miami this month, and his administration announced new measures last week to protect the rights of students to pray in public schools. On Friday, the administration's Office for Civil Rights said California was violating federal conscience protections with its abortion insurance requirements. 
In past years, Trump had addressed the March for Life through video messages, and Vice-President Pence made a surprise appearance on the Mall last year. Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's spokesman, said the president's decision to embrace the march reflects an understanding that 'for a lot of voters, opposing abortion is their number one issue.'
Murtaugh said the issue cuts across demographic lines and appeals to African Americans and Latinos, as well as Catholics 'who support the president because of this issue.' According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll last summer, about 1 in 7 voters overall called abortion 'one of the single most important issues,' with 20-percent of Democrats calling it that and 16-percent of Republicans. 
Ari Fleischer, who served as a White House press secretary under President George W. Bush, said Trump's decision to buck precedent among GOP presidents and attend the march showed how politics have changed as the country has become more sharply polarized.
'In an age of polarization, where getting your base out in maximum numbers is the new form of effective politics, his visit makes perfect sense,' Fleischer said. 'There used to be a [political] center, there used to be a lot more moderates, and politicians were mindful of them.'
Fleischer pointed to President Barack Obama announcing a personal shift to come out in support of same-sex marriage in 2012 as a past example of a president seeking to rally his base in an election year. 
He added that for Trump, projecting an image of delivering on his agenda 'is tremendously important. It's a great foil and contrast to those who want to throw him out of office, a very vivid demonstration of the polarization "" on one screen, they're saying, 'Throw the bum out,' and on the other screen, he's saying, 'Look what I'm doing for you.' '
Still, try as he might to project a confident air, the president continued to reflect his anxiety over the impeaching proceedings, attacking Democrats on Twitter for 'repeating, over and over again, the same old 'stuff.' '
As he spoke on the Mall, his image appeared on a jumbo screen, the Capitol visible behind it "" a stark reminder of his political troubles even as he sought to move past them.

Ten days before Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman dined with President Trump at his Washington hotel, they were part of a small group of Republican Party donors who met with the president at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, a new recording shows.
The two men "" who later assisted Rudolph W. Giuliani's efforts in Ukraine "" were part of a gathering held in an ornate room of the property and also attended by Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, according to the video and people in attendance.
While it was known that Fruman and Parnas had attended an event at Mar-a-Lago, the focus of the event, the timing and who else was in attendance had not been made public.
The April 2018 meeting came days before the two men took part in a donor dinner with the president at his Washington hotel, an encounter captured on a video released last week by Parnas's attorney.
During that dinner, Parnas told the president that the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was agitating against him, prompting Trump to abruptly call for her firing.
The recordings of the two events undercut Trump's repeated assertions that he does not know Parnas and Fruman, who were arrested in October on campaign finance charges. 'I don't know those gentlemen,' Trump said at the time. Last week, the president referred to Parnas as 'a con man' and a 'groupie.'
Taken together, the two recordings provide a window into Trump's close interactions with high-dollar donors, despite his pledge to 'drain the swamp.'
The White House declined to comment.
'On a given day, the Chairwoman greets hundreds if not thousands of people at events across the country,' RNC spokesman Michael Ahrens said in a statement. 'This is nothing more than that.'
He declined to answer additional questions regarding the event, including about the guests in attendance.
In an interview, Parnas said the back-to-back events he attended with Trump shows the proximity they had to the president.
'When Trump would see us, he would call us 'my boys,' ' he said. 'Me and Igor together? It's not something you'd forget, particularly in that scene.'
Giuliani "" who began working with Fruman and Parnas later that year "" was not present at either gathering, people familiar with the meetings said.
Parnas had donated $50,000 to a joint fundraising committee for Trump's campaign and the RNC in October 2016, campaign finance records show.
Parnas's attorney, Joseph A. Bondy, provided the recording of the Mar-a-Lago gathering to The Washington Post. He said he had previously given a copy to House impeachment investigators.
Parnas and Fruman say little in the recording, but Parnas can be seen acting as a photographer for the group, snapping photos of other attendees on their cellphones before posing for a picture with Trump.
McDaniel "" whose nameplate can be seen directly across from where Fruman is seated "" can be heard giving a presentation on polling and the 2018 midterms.
Also in attendance: then-Rep. Pete Sessions (R-Tex.) "" who has been subpoenaed as part of the ongoing criminal investigation involving Parnas and Fruman "" and Brian Ballard, a Florida lobbyist who is close with Trump.
Ballard and Sessions declined to comment.
In the recording, which lasts about 37 minutes, Trump talks about his poll numbers and asks Sessions and McDaniel to provide the group with an update on Republican efforts to win the 2018 midterm elections. Sessions had previously been head of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
McDaniel gives the group a pep talk about the upcoming elections, saying that Democrats are energized but that Republicans are excited with Trump's leadership.
'We must win. And we can win,' she says of the election, in which Democrats ultimately took control of the House.
At one point, the group talks about Syrian policy with the president, with an unidentified attendee criticizing President Barack Obama's actions in the country.
In response, Trump attacks the Obama administration's policy on Syria. 'Obama, he didn't go over the red line,' Trump says. 'That was a disaster. You know, Obama gave Syria up two or three years ago.'
At the end of the meeting, a donor from St. Petersburg, Fla., named Bill Edwards tells the president he spent years in the mortgage business giving loans to military veterans and complains about a provision in legislation to revise the Dodd-Frank Act.
Edwards appears to be referring to a measure introduced by Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) that Warren said at the time was designed to eliminate a practice known as churning, in which home loans are repeatedly refinanced to generate fees for lenders.
Edwards told The Post on Thursday that he raised the legislation with Trump as a retired Marine and an advocate for veterans. He said he is no longer a mortgage lender, so he had nothing to gain by advocating against the provision, which ended up being incorporated into law in late 2018.
'I wanted to make sure that everyone was aware that veterans were going to take a beating on this,' Edwards said.

Many of the 24 petitions approved by Trump had high-profile advocates

Two days after President Trump freed a great-grandmother sentenced to life in prison, he praised the reality-television star and social influencer who had championed the woman's release.
'Kim Kardashian was great because she brought Alice to my attention,' Trump said in 2018 of Alice Marie Johnson, who had served nearly 22 years for first-time, nonviolent drug-trafficking crimes. 
Johnson's image reappeared Sunday during the Super Bowl in an ad run by Trump's reelection campaign touting his record on criminal justice. 
The ad didn't mention Kim Kardashian West "" or that all but five of the 24 people who have received clemency from Trump had a line into the White House or currency with his political base, according to a review by The Washington Post. As the administration takes its cues from celebrities, political allies and Fox News, thousands of other offenders who followed Justice Department rules are waiting, passed over as cases that were brought directly to Trump leaped to the front of the line.
For more than 125 years, the Office of the Pardon Attorney in the Justice Department has quietly served as the key adviser on clemency, one of the most unlimited powers bestowed on the president by the Constitution.
Under Trump, the pardon office has become a bureaucratic way station, according to government data and interviews with lawyers, criminal justice advocates, and former pardon and White House officials. 
Most of Trump's grants of clemency have gone to well-connected offenders who had not filed petitions with the pardon office or did not meet its requirements, The Post review shows. 
'The joy you get finding meritorious people, working on those cases, making recommendations that go to the White House, seeing people receive the grants "" you feel like you've done something,' said Larry Kupers, the former head of the office, who quit last year. 'If that's not happening, it feels like you are spinning your wheels.'
Trump's approach is legal. The Constitution's only restriction on the pardon power is that it applies exclusively to federal crimes and not to impeachment.
Trump has reveled in that clout, saying 'the power to pardon is a beautiful thing' and claiming he has the 'absolute power' to pardon himself.
He has used the power, however, very sparingly. 
After about three years in office, Trump's six predecessors had signed off on hundreds or even thousands of petitions forwarded from the Justice Department. Most were denials, a disappointing but vital step for offenders in limbo who can't ask for clemency again until they are turned down.

Ronald Reagan set a low bar with 669 decisions during his first three years; 3,993 petitions processed during Barack Obama's first three years reached a high-water mark.
Trump has ruled on only 204 clemency requests "" 24 approvals and 180 denials. That is the slowest pace in decades.
-'I almost wish it would get denied. At least I would know that someone had looked at it,' said 39-year-old Nichole Forde, who handwrote her petition in 2016 from the Minnesota prison where she is serving a 27-year sentence for nonviolent drug crimes.
In the most recent end-runs around the pardon office and over the objections of Pentagon officials, Trump in November pardoned two former Army officers: Maj. Mathew L. Golsteyn, facing trial for premeditated murder, and 1st Lt. Clint Lorance, convicted of murder after ordering soldiers to fire at unarmed men in Afghanistan. The White House cited endorsements from several Republican congressmen and a Fox News host. 
Golsteyn's pardon means he will not stand trial. Three weeks after the Lorance and Golsteyn pardons, Trump brought the men onstage at a closed Republican fundraiser in Miami.
During the Super Bowl, the reelection campaign sent out a fundraising appeal invoking Johnson's release with 'Go Alice!'
Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said the ad reflects Trump's view that there is a right way and a wrong way to address inequities in the criminal justice system. The 30-second ad'clearly communicates how President Trump expressed his concerns about the issue "" he acted and he helped improve people's lives,' Parscale said.
The White House declined to answer detailed questions about the president's approach to clemency.
Asked what advice he would give offenders seeking leniency, Kupers said: 'Find a way to get to Kim Kardashian. I'm very serious about that.'
What is clemency?
Clemency can take two forms: Commutations shorten sentences, and pardons erase the civil consequences of criminal convictions, including limits on gun ownership, jury service and voting rights. 
For decades, federal offenders filed petitions for clemency with the pardon office, which assigns a staff attorney to investigate each case. 
The office may be one of the least visible and least understood corners of a federal government scorned by a president who has declared war on what he calls the 'deep state.'
With an annual budget of about $4.5-million, the office employs about 19-people, including 11-attorneys.
For pardons, the office looks for acceptance of responsibility and good conduct for a substantial period of time after conviction, among other considerations, according to Justice Department guidelines. Commutations hinge on the undue severity of a sentence, the amount of time served and demonstrated rehabilitation. 
The pardon office's decisions undergo scrutiny by the deputy attorney general, the No.-2 official at the Justice Department, who makes final recommendations to the Office of White House Counsel. During the Trump administration, the counsel's office has been almost singularly focused on selecting conservative judicial nominees and, more recently, impeachment. 
What's more, the administration inherited a backlog of more than 11,300 petitions, according to Justice Department statistics. 
As of late January, nearly 7,600 petitions have been filed since Trump took office. About 5,900 petitions have been closed by the pardon office during Trump's presidency because the inmate was released, died or was ineligible for clemency.
Trump's decisions on only 204-petitions means that nearly 13,000-people are waiting. 
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to say how many of its recommendations are backlogged at the White House.
The current pardon attorney, Rosalind Sargent-Burns, said she was not authorized to talk to reporters.
Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas declined to comment on the pace or nature of clemency grants under Trump but noted his singular authority.
'The president always retains the plenary power granted to him by the Constitution to pardon or commute sentences, and does so at his sole discretion, guided when he sees fit by the advice of the pardon attorney,' Navas said.
A former senior White House official, who, like some others interviewed, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal decisions, echoed that assessment.
'The pardon power is one of the few presidential powers that is subject to few, if any, limitations,' the official said. 'Trump has used it in a way that is probably more transparently political than his predecessors, but all things considered, he's been reasonably restrained in the number of times he's exercised it.'

Starting with his first pardon, for former sheriff Joe Arpaio of Arizona, Trump signaled that he would ignore convention.
Arpaio, a Trump booster who had defied a judge's orders on detaining suspected undocumented immigrants, had not filed a petition and was pardoned one month after his conviction on a contempt charge. Justice Department guidelines generally prohibit pardon requests until five years after conviction or release from confinement, whichever comes later.
A lawyer for George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide who served 12-days in prison in 2018 for lying to the FBI in the Russia investigation, requested a pardon only a few months after his release.
'Because of the unique circumstances of George's case . . . it was very clear to me that a traditional submission to the DOJ Office of the Pardon Attorney would not be the most prudent strategy,' said his attorney, Caroline J. Polisi. 'Given what we knew about the unorthodox way the president has approached his granting of other pardons, we decided a less formal approach was appropriate.' She declined to say whom in the White House she approached. 
Former White House officials describe a freewheeling atmosphere in which staff members have fielded suggestions from Trump friends while sometimes throwing in their own recommendations.
Former White House staff secretary Rob Porter, whose job was managing the flow of paperwork and people into the Oval Office, took a leading role refereeing pardon requests before he left, according to four former or current officials. Senior advisers Kellyanne Conway and Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, also have relayed clemency requests to Trump in largely informal settings, those officials said. 
When Trump began talking about pardoning Arpaio in the spring of 2017, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions advised waiting until after a verdict. Trump was undeterred; Arpaio had endorsed Trump in early 2016 when he was a long-shot candidate, and the president thought the ex-lawman had been treated unfairly, former White House officials said. 
'It was so obviously political,' a former official said. 'The first early discussion we had was about Joe Arpaio, and there was discussion about, 'Do you want this to be the first?' '
How other presidents did it
Most presidents in recent decades have faced accusations at one time or another that they exploited the pardon power. Bill Clinton issued pardons in the final hours of his presidency to his half brother, a Whitewater business partner, his former housing secretary and a fugitive commodities trader married to a major Democratic donor.
Presidents also have circumvented the formal pardon process to advance national interests, as when Obama offered clemency to seven Iranians charged with violating U.S. trade sanctions in exchange for the release of four Americans imprisoned in Iran, including Post reporter Jason Rezaian.
Under Trump, however, politically motivated grants have become the rule, not the exception.
'I don't blame Kim Kardashian putting forward names. I blame them for listening to her,' said Kevin Ring, president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a nonprofit that promotes sentencing reform. 'It makes people cynical because the process isn't based on merit.'
Of the five people who received clemency without White House connections or appeal to Trump's political base, one went to a man whose pardon from Obama mistakenly omitted one conviction. The other four were for men who committed minor crimes in the 1980s and '90s.
Roy McKeever, one of the four, said he was a 'stupid kid who wanted fast money' in 1988 when he was busted for transporting marijuana from Mexico to Oklahoma. He served one year in prison and a year of probation. He applied for the pardon in 2016, he said, 'so my dad wouldn't be so disappointed.'
'It surprised me, too,' McKeever, now 50, said when he heard last year that he had been pardoned. 'I didn't think you could get a pardon unless you knew somebody.'
Oklahoma City lawyer Michael Risley said he had no idea how his client "" his first for a federal pardon "" got to the front of the line. 'My sincere hope is that it's because we did a good job on the paperwork,' Risley said.
Money and access have proved to be far more valuable under Trump. 
Celebrity attorney Alan Dershowitz, a Trump ally who defended the president at his impeachment trial, got in a pitch for client Sholom Rubashkin during a 2017 visit to the White House to discuss Middle East policy. Dershowitz said he used a few minutes with Trump in the Oval Office to urge clemency for the Iowa kosher meatpacking executive sentenced to 27-years for money laundering. Trump was sympathetic to the argument that the business owner had been mistreated by the government, Dershowitz said.
 'That resonated with him. As a businessman, he understood it,' Dershowitz said of Trump.
Dershowitz said Trump also was moved by his assertion that anti-Semitism had resulted in a disproportionately harsh sentence. Rubashkin's backers included conservative Jews and evangelical Christians, significant strands of Trump's political coalition. Kushner, an Orthodox Jew, was Rubashkin's most vocal advocate inside the White House, according to two former officials.
Other Trump advisers urged caution because of the severity of Rubashkin's crimes, in which prosecutors said he had bilked lenders out of more than $26-million.
But Obama's denial of clemency for Rubashkin helped motivate Trump to adopt the opposite view, two advisers said.
'I would suspect a lot of pardons are given after face-to-face meetings,' said Dershowitz, who had failed to persuade Obama to help Rubashkin.
Obama's clemency approach
Obama granted a record-setting 1,700 commutations under a sweeping initiative that prioritized nonviolent drug offenders and expanded the criteria for commutations, triggering a flood of applicants. 
Nearly all of those selected had been sentenced under the mandatory-minimum penalties deployed during the 'war on drugs' of the 1980s.
Obama's clemency program was widely described as historic but also inefficient and chaotic. Then-Pardon Attorney Deborah Leff resigned in January 2016 in part, she said, because her office needed more staff and resources.
 An inspector general's report in 2018 said the program made 'significant strides' in its final year.
Kupers was a former federal public defender who joined the pardon office as a senior attorney in 2014, induced by Obama's program.
'The clemency initiative set up these hopes and then they were virtually and entirely dashed after Trump's election,' Kupers said.
Under Trump, the pardon office quietly reverted to the stricter pre-Obama guidelines for commutations.
Yet Trump also has raised hopes "" with off-the-cuff remarks that have surprised his own aides. 
On the day after Johnson's release, Trump vowed to grant more pardons. 'We have 3,000 names,' he told reporters. 'We're looking at them. Of the 3,000 names, many of those names really have been treated unfairly. . . . And I would get more thrill out of pardoning people that nobody knows.'
 Kupers, who served as acting pardon attorney and deputy pardon attorney during Trump's first two years in office, said he didn't know what the 3,000 referenced. 
The White House declined to comment on the meaning of what Trump said.
Some criminal justice advocates said they assumed the president was referring to names sent directly to the White House "" not the official pipeline.
But that mention rang like a fire alarm in the community of roughly 175,000 federal inmates and their families. 
Forde, the inmate who said she handwrote her petition in a sweltering room, dripping sweat onto the form, was so excited to hear about Trump's 'list' that she followed up with a letter to the White House.

More than three years later, Forde is losing hope. 
'Why did he bring it up at all?' she wrote in an email to The Post. 'It makes me want to pull my hair out. To feel like freedom is so close.' 
'I wonder if that list is still sitting there,' she added.
Mary Anne Locke, serving a 20-year sentence in the same prison as Forde, thought she, too, finally had a shot at a second chance after word of Trump's remarks spread through channels that people familiar with the criminal justice system dub 'inmatedotcom.' She was indicted in 2008 as part of a methamphetamine distribution scheme. The long sentence stunned her family because she had cooperated with law enforcement.
'I'm extremely happy for each and every person that gets any kind of relief, but I wish there were more opportunities for those of us without those connections,' Locke, 41, said in a telephone interview. 'If a connection is what it takes, then I pray for the right person to come along for me.'
Her father, John Owen, wrote an open letter in the Des Moines Register in July 2018 to Trump, describing his daughter's struggle to overcome her drug addiction. 
 'I'm frustrated that the entire system is so slow moving,' he said in a recent interview with The Post.
A bureaucratic slog
Lawyers who specialize in clemency say the system has moved slowly for decades.
The way they tell it, the pardon office is like a black box "" the only updates available on petitions are 'pending' and 'denied.' Deputy attorneys general, who make the final determination before petitions reach the Office of White House Counsel, tend to be reluctant to mitigate decisions made by fellow prosecutors in the criminal justice system. 

In that climate, a Kardashian West endorsement becomes all the more coveted.
'It feels UNBELIEVABLE - AMAZING to have her (Kim) support me - advocate for my release!' Chris Young, 31, an inmate in Texas serving a life sentence for drug crimes, wrote in an email to The Post. His commutation request was turned down by Obama, but Kardashian West has talked him up to Trump. 'I still have to keep a ton of humility - patience in me, cause i still haven't been released,' Young wrote.
Even the judge who sentenced Young, Kevin H. Sharp, has praised Kardashian West's advocacy for Young, tweeting after he left the bench: 'What I was required to do that day was cruel and did not make us safer.' 
Young's attorney, Brittany K. Barnett, is the co-founder of a legal project that has received funding from Kardashian West and assists inmates serving life sentences. Barnett has built a national reputation helping to secure commutations for eight people, including Johnson, whose clemency request had been rejected by Obama. 
'I don't feel that someone seeking clemency should have to have a celebrity endorsement, but as a lawyer, if that's the avenue I have to free my client, then we have to pursue it,' Barnett said. 'My alternative would be to let my client die in prison because Trump's not following the protocol.'
Kardashian West declined an interview request.
Lorance, the former Army infantry officer convicted of murder, also failed to win clemency from Obama. After Trump's election, Lorance's story gained traction in the media as Fox News hosts Sean Hannity and Pete Hegseth championed his case, and a Starz documentary highlighted inconsistencies in the prosecution.
'You never really know which pebble you drop on the scale of justice tips the balance,' said Lorance's attorney, John Maher. 'We were of the thought to use all of them.'
The made-for-television decisions by Trump are what drove Kupers to leave the pardon office in June. His colleagues included graduates of Yale, Northwestern and University of Texas law schools and former prosecutors and defense attorneys chosen for their strong analytical and writing skills.
'We had impartial lawyers who developed over time an expertise in evaluating applications and the skills to determine whether this is a person who could be a danger to the public,' Kupers said. 'If you leave it to the White House, you are more likely to get arbitrary, capricious pardons that may be perfectly legal but are not what the Founding Fathers had in mind.'

REPORT JOINS word it favors TRUMP
Senator condemns efforts to sway U.S. election
U.S. officials have told Sen. Bernie Sanders that Russia is attempting to help his presidential campaign as part of an effort to interfere with the Democratic contest, according to people familiar with the matter.
President Trump and lawmakers on Capitol Hill also have been informed about the Russian assistance to the senator from Vermont, those people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence.
It is not clear what form that Russian assistance has taken. U.S. prosecutors found a Russian effort in 2016 to use social media to boost Sanders's campaign against Hillary Clinton, part of a broader effort to hurt Clinton, sow dissension in the American electorate and ultimately help elect Donald Trump.
'I don't care, frankly, who [Russian President Vladimir] Putin wants to be president,' Sanders said in a statement. 'My message to Putin is clear: Stay out of American elections, and as president I will make sure that you do.
'In 2016, Russia used Internet propaganda to sow division in our country, and my understanding is that they are doing it again in 2020. Some of the ugly stuff on the Internet attributed to our campaign may well not be coming from real supporters.'
The disclosure of Russian assistance to Sanders follows a briefing to lawmakers last week in which a senior intelligence official said that Russia wants to see Trump reelected, viewing his administration as more favorable to the Kremlin's interests, according to people who were briefed on the comments.
In that closed hearing for the House Intelligence Committee, lawmakers were also told that Sanders had been informed about Russia's interference. The prospect of two rival campaigns both receiving help from Moscow appears to reflect what intelligence officials have previously described as Russia's broader interest in sowing division in the United States and uncertainty about the validity of American elections.
At a rally Friday in Nevada, Trump called reports that Putin wanted to help him 'disinformation.'
'Wouldn't he rather have Bernie, who honeymooned in Moscow?' Trump asked, referring to the senator's travels in the former Soviet Union.
Sanders told reporters Friday after The Post's report was published that he received the briefing 'about a month ago.' Asked why he did not disclose the briefing publicly, Sanders replied, 'Because I go to many intelligence briefings which I don't reveal to the public.'
Sanders offered few details about what officials told him.
'Well, it was not clear what role they're going to play,' he said, referring to Russia. 'We were told that Russia, maybe other countries, are going to get involved in this campaign. And look, here's the message, to Russia "" stay out of American elections.'
Asked why the briefing was reported now, a month later, Sanders said: 'I'll let you guess about one day before the, the Nevada caucus. Why do you think it came out?' Sanders pointed to a Post reporter and said sarcastically: 'It was The Washington Post? Good friends.'
'We report news when we learn it,' said Kristine Coratti, a spokeswoman for The Post.
A spokesperson for the FBI declined to comment. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not respond to requests for comment.
The intelligence assessment that Russia had a preference for Trump infuriated the president. Trump lambasted his then-acting intelligence director, Joseph Maguire, and DNI staff for sharing that information with lawmakers, believing that Democrats would use it to hurt Trump in the election.
The president has been told that the Russians are also trying to sow discord among Democrats and want to influence the primaries, a senior administration official said. Intelligence officials also have told Trump that Russia wanted to help Sanders, the official said, declining to say when Trump was informed.
Sanders has frequently warned about the threat of foreign interference in U.S. elections and criticized Trump for not doing enough to stop it.
'Let me be clear: We must not live in denial while allowing Russia and other state actors to undermine our democracy or divide us,' the senator said in January. 'Russia targets the divisions in our society; we will work to heal those divisions.'
Sanders's opponents have blamed some of his most vocal online supporters for injecting toxic rhetoric into the primaries. At a Democratic candidates debate Wednesday in Las Vegas, Sanders indirectly blamed Russia, saying it was possible that malign actors were trying to manipulate social media to inflame divisions among Democrats.
'All of us remember 2016, and what we remember is efforts by Russians and others to try to interfere in our elections and divide us up,' Sanders said. 'I'm not saying that's happening, but it would not shock me.'
In recent weeks, Sanders's rivals have raised concerns about the behavior of his supporters, blaming them for viciously attacking an influential Nevada culinary union that criticized his health-care plan and said the senator did not do enough to tamp down the online rhetoric of his most ardent advocates.
The senator has responded by distancing himself from such actions, questioning on several occasions whether the online rhetoric was coming from genuine Sanders supporters.
Sanders spent Friday campaigning in California and planned to finish the day in Nevada with an evening rally designed to build excitement for his campaign ahead of Saturday's caucuses.
Despite Trump's skepticism of Russian efforts to damage American democracy, officials in his administration have repeatedly warned that Russia has ongoing plans to interfere in U.S. elections and foster divisions among Americans, part of a strategic goal to undermine U.S. standing in the world. Some analysts believe the Kremlin's goal is to cause maximum disruption within the United States and that it throws the support of its hackers and trolls behind candidates based on that goal, not any particular affinity for the people running.
'Russian attempts to sow discord in the Democratic primary would be consistent with its strategy of undermining Americans' faith in democratic institutions and processes,' said Laura Rosenberger, a former National Security Council aide in the Obama administration who is now an election security expert with the Alliance for Securing Democracy. 'We have seen consistent messaging from Russian sources pushing the narrative that the primary process is rigged, and driving the idea that the 'establishment' favors some candidates over others.'
​'Many of us have been warning for some time that the Russians would likely try to drive divisions and discord in the Democratic primary, as they did in 2016,' Rosenberger said.
Russia has tried to assist Sanders in the past.
In a February 2018 indictment of 13 Russian individuals and three companies alleged to have orchestrated the 2016 social media scheme, prosecutors charged that the group 'engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.'
Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III also alleged that, working with WikiLeaks, the Russian government purposely released stolen internal Democratic Party emails on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in July 2016, so as to exacerbate party divisions and a sense of grievance by Sanders supporters.

STOP write More than 8 in 10 view president as racist
Pessimism runs deep, poll shows 
President perceived to have emboldened racists

President Trump made a stark appeal to blackAmericansduring the 2016 election when he asked, 'What have you got to lose?' Three years later, black Americans have rendered their verdict on his presidency with a deeply pessimistic assessment of their place in the United States under a leader seen by an overwhelming majority as racist.
The findings come from a Washington Post-Ipsos poll of African Americans nationwide, which reveals fears about whether their children will have a fair shot to succeed and a belief that white Americans don't fully appreciate the discrimination that black people experience.
While personally optimistic about their own lives, black Americans today offer a bleaker view about their community as a whole. They also express determination to try to limit Trump to a single term in office.
More than 8 in 10 black Americans say they believe Trump is a racist and that he has made racism a bigger problem in the country. Nine in 10 disapprove of his job performance overall. 
The pessimism goes well beyond assessments of the president. A 65 percent majority of African Americans say it is a 'bad time' to be a black person in America. That view is widely shared by clear majorities of black adults across income, generational and political lines. By contrast, 77 percent of black Americans say it is a 'good time' to be a white person, with a wide majority saying white people don't understand the discrimination faced by black Americans.
Courtney Tate, a 40-year-old elementary school teacher in Irving, Tex., outside Dallas, said that since Trump was elected, he's been having more conversations with his co-workers "" discussions that are simultaneously enlightening and exhausting "" about racial issues he and his students face every day. 

 'As a black person, you've always seen all the racism, the microaggressions. But as white people, they don't understand this is how things are going for me,' said Tate, who said he is the only black male teacher in his school. 'They don't live those experiences. They don't live in those neighborhoods. They moved out. It's so easy to be white and oblivious in this country.'
Francine Cartwright, a 44-year-old mother of three from Moorestown, N.J., said the ascent of Trump has altered the way she thinks about the white people in her life. 
'If I'm in a room with white women, I know that 50 percent of them voted for Trump and they believe in his ideas,' said Cartwright, a university researcher. 'I look at them and think, 'How do you see me? What is my humanity to you?' '

The president routinely talks about how a steadily growing economy and historically low unemployment have resulted in more African Americans with jobs and the lowest jobless rate for black Americans recorded. Months ago, he said, 'What I've done for African Americans in two and a half years, no president has been able to do anything like it.' 
Those factors have not translated positively for the president. A 77-percent majority of black Americans say Trump deserves 'only some' or 'hardly any' credit for the 5.5-percent unemployment rate among black adults, compared with 20-percent who say Trump deserves significant credit. 
In follow-up interviews, many said former president Barack Obama deserves more credit for the improvement in the unemployment rate, which declined from a high of 16.8-percent in 2010 to 7.5-percent when he left office. 
Others said their personal financial situation is more a product of their own efforts than anything the president has done. 
'I don't think [Trump] has anything to do with unemployment among African Americans,' said Ethel Smith, a 72-year-old nanny who lives in Lithonia, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta. 'I've always been a working poor person. That's just who I am.'

Black Americans report little change in their personal financial situations in the past few years, with 19-percent saying it has been getting better and 26-percent saying it has been getting worse. Most, 54-percent, say their financial situation has stayed the same. 
A similar 56-percent majority of African Americans rate the national economy as 'not so good' or 'poor,' contrasting with other surveys that find most Americans overall rate the economy positively, although there are sharp political divides on this question. 
Beyond questions about the economy, African Americans see a range of concerns impacting the country overall as well as their own communities. 
Just 16-percent of black Americans believe that most black children born in the United States today have 'a good opportunity to achieve a comfortable standard of living.' A 75-percent majority think most white children have such an opportunity. 
More than 8 in 10 say they do not trust police in the United States to treat people of all races equally, and 7 in 10 distrust police in their own communities. 
Black Americans also widely sense that their experiences with discrimination are underappreciated by white Americans.Justabout 2 in 10 say that most white Americans understand the level of discrimination black Americans face in their lives. 
The starkly negative outlook appears to be a turnabout from previous points during both the Obama and George W. Bush presidencies, according to surveys that asked related questions. A 2011 Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation survey found 73-percent of black women said it was a 'good time' to be a black woman in America, while a similar survey in 2006 found 60-percent of black men saying it was a good time to be a black man. 
Yet the Post-Ipsos poll also finds that 65-percent of black Americans say they feel optimistic about their own lives most or all of the time. This positive personal outlook crosses age and political groups. While it peaks among those who are older and with higher incomes, roughly half of black Americanswith incomes under $35,000 annually say they feel optimistic about their lives. 
Dana Clark, a father of 11 in Ontario, Calif., said he tells all of his children that it's possible to succeed in America, but that they'll have to work harder than the white children they encounter. 
'I tell them we're going to set this plan up. Whatever you want to do, you're going to be able to do it,' he said. 'But it ain't going to be easy, especially if [you] want to make some money because you're going to be in a world where they're not going to expect you to be there. You can get what you want, but you've got to work harder, faster and stronger.' 
The survey, by The Post and Ipsos, a nonpartisan research firm, is one of the most extensive recent surveys focused on views of the country and Trump among black Americans, who are often represented by only small samples in customary national polls. It was conducted among 1,088 non-Hispanic black adults, including 900 registered voters, drawn from a large online survey panel recruited through random sampling of U.S. households. 
Few black voters responded positively to Trump's campaign appeal for their votes. Exit polls taken during the 2016 election showed just 8-percent of African Americans supported Trump and 89-percent backed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, although black turnout was significantly lower than in 2008 and 2012 for the election and reelection of Obama, the country's first black president. 
In the Post-Ipsos poll, roughly three-quarters of black adults say the things that Trump is doing as president are 'bad for African Americans,' while a similar majority 

saysObama's actions as president were good. 
Kenneth Davis, a truck driver who lives outside Detroit, said that when Trump was elected, co-workers who secretly harbored racist thoughts felt emboldened to publicly express them. 
'One gentleman is waving the Confederate flag on the back of his pickup truck,' said Davis, 48, who is a Marine Corps veteran. 'He was very brave to say, 'Trump's president, I'm going to get my window [painted].' '
Retired federal prison Warden Keith Battle said the political climate has exposed 'unresolved racial issues' and that Trump has emboldened white supremacists. Battle, who lives in Wake Forest, N.C., said white supremacists 'are not the majority of whites in America, but there is a significant amount still, I'd say 30-percent, and I think they're just leading the country down a path of, eventually, chaos. They're feeling jeopardized of losing their white privilege.'
Survey respondents were asked to say how Trump's presidency has affected them personally or African Americans in general. The responses illuminated the data in the poll. 
'Donald Trump has not done anything for the African American people,' said one person.
'He has created an atmosphere of division and overt racism and fear of immigrants unseen in many years,' said another.
A third said, 'He has taken hatred against people of color, in general, from the closet to the front porch.'
Others echoed that sentiment, saying that the president has emboldened those with racially prejudiced views and therefore set back race relations for years. 'I sense a separation between myself and some of my white associates,' one person wrote.
Trump's overall approval rating among black Americans stands at 7-percent, with 90-percent disapproving, including 75-percent who disapprove 'strongly.' 
Similarly large majorities of black men and women disapprove of Trump, as do black Americansacross different age, education and income levels. Trump receives somewhat higher marks among self-identifiedblack conservatives, with 25-percent approving of his performance, compared with 5-percent of moderates and 3-percent among liberals. 
Few black Americans appear open to supporting Trump's bid for reelection at this point. He receives between 4 and 5-percent support among black registered voters in head-to-head matchups against eight potential Democratic nominees. But the level of Democratic support depends on who is the party's nominee, peaking at 82-percent for former vice presidentJoe Biden and falling to 57-percent for former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg.
The Post-Ipsos survey was conducted Jan. 2-8 through Ipsos's KnowledgePanel, a large online survey panel recruited through random sampling of U.S. households. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points among the sample of 1,088 black adults overall and four points among the sample of 900 registered voters.

President Trump on Friday became the first president to attend the March for Life event in Washington, expressing solidarity with tens of thousands of conservative and evangelical voters that his campaign considers a core constituency for his reelection bid. 
Trump made no mention of the ongoing Senate impeachment proceedings taking place just blocks away at the Capitol as he addressed throngs of antiabortion activists on the Mall. But his relatively brief appearance offered an implicit split screen for a president who has been consumed with the Democrats' efforts to oust him.
The appearance also followed a threat Friday from the Trump administration to withhold federal funding from California over its requirement that private insurers cover abortions "" a move state officials immediately denounced as a 'cheap political' shot timed to coincide with the antiabortion rally.
Taking the lectern to his campaign theme, Lee Greenwood's 'God Bless the U.S.A.,' Trump basked in applause, pumping his fist and mouthing thank yous to the crowd. Some were dressed in 'Make America Great Again' hats, and chants of 'Four more years!' were audible as he began speaking.
'Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House,' Trump said, hewing closely to his prepared text in a 13-minute address that was peppered with partisan attacks on 'far-left Democrats,' whom he accused of 'working to erase all our God-given rights.'
'They are coming after me because I am fighting for you,' Trump declared. 
Though he was referring to the abortion debate, the president sounded like he could have been alluding to the impeachment fight when he added: 'We will win because we know how to win.'
Trump's decision to attend the rally in its 47th-year was the culmination of a remarkable shift by a president who had called himself 'very pro-choice' in a television interview two decades ago and who entered office amid some reservations among antiabortion activists. The president highlighted a list of actions he has taken over the past three years "" including a ban on nongovernmental organizations from using federal money to offer abortion services abroad "" that have earned him praise from movement leaders, who said he has done more than his Republican predecessors.
'It's really been remarkable. He's leaned into this more than any other pro-life president,' Jeanne Mancini, the president of March for Life, said on Fox News. 'This is unprecedented.'
Trump's reelection campaign heavily promoted his appearance at the rally, tweeting endorsements from influential figures and announcing the creation of a new outreach effort called 'Pro-Life Voices for Trump' that will be co-chaired by Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, and Catholic priest and activist Frank Pavone. 
 Surrogates quickly sought to paint Democrats as trying to undermine Trump's efforts to deliver on his legislative agenda.
Democrats spend the day 'grandstanding on lies for political self-interest,' Jenna Ellis, a legal adviser for the Trump campaign, wrote on Twitter. She asserted that Trump was 'standing firm on a moral truth to save the lives of millions.' 
But abortion rights activists denounced Trump for what they viewed as the president's false and dangerous rhetoric on abortion, as well as policies that Planned Parenthood said has 'endangered, if not completely cut off, health care for people at home and around the world.'
In his remarks, Trump said Democrats in New York cheered legislation that 'would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb right up until delivery.' Fact-checkers have called this interpretation of the law, which allows for abortions after 24 weeks if the mother's health is at risk or there is an absence of fetal viability, inaccurate. 
The president also accused Virginia's Democratic governor, Ralph Northam, of stating that he would 'execute a baby after birth,' though a spokeswoman for Northam said at the time that his words were taken out of context by Republicans.
'Trump has often parroted debunked, fearmongering rhetoric about abortion that is intended to mislead the public and shame women,' Samuel Lau, a Planned Parenthood official, wrote in a memo to reporters. 'It's important not to accept this kind of language as normal.'
 Trump has sought to rally evangelicals in recent weeks, after the editor in chief of Christianity Today published an op-ed in December endorsing the effort to impeach him over his conduct in allegedly pressuring Ukraine's leader to open an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden, a top Democratic presidential contender.
The president held a campaign rally for evangelicals in Miami this month, and his administration announced new measures last week to protect the rights of students to pray in public schools. On Friday, the administration's Office for Civil Rights said California was violating federal conscience protections with its abortion insurance requirements. 
In past years, Trump had addressed the March for Life through video messages, and Vice-President Pence made a surprise appearance on the Mall last year. Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's spokesman, said the president's decision to embrace the march reflects an understanding that 'for a lot of voters, opposing abortion is their number one issue.'
Murtaugh said the issue cuts across demographic lines and appeals to African Americans and Latinos, as well as Catholics 'who support the president because of this issue.' According to a Washington Post-ABC News poll last summer, about 1 in 7 voters overall called abortion 'one of the single most important issues,' with 20-percent of Democrats calling it that and 16-percent of Republicans. 
Ari Fleischer, who served as a White House press secretary under President George W. Bush, said Trump's decision to buck precedent among GOP presidents and attend the march showed how politics have changed as the country has become more sharply polarized.
'In an age of polarization, where getting your base out in maximum numbers is the new form of effective politics, his visit makes perfect sense,' Fleischer said. 'There used to be a [political] center, there used to be a lot more moderates, and politicians were mindful of them.'
Fleischer pointed to President Barack Obama announcing a personal shift to come out in support of same-sex marriage in 2012 as a past example of a president seeking to rally his base in an election year. 
He added that for Trump, projecting an image of delivering on his agenda 'is tremendously important. It's a great foil and contrast to those who want to throw him out of office, a very vivid demonstration of the polarization "" on one screen, they're saying, 'Throw the bum out,' and on the other screen, he's saying, 'Look what I'm doing for you.' '
Still, try as he might to project a confident air, the president continued to reflect his anxiety over the impeaching proceedings, attacking Democrats on Twitter for 'repeating, over and over again, the same old 'stuff.' '
As he spoke on the Mall, his image appeared on a jumbo screen, the Capitol visible behind it "" a stark reminder of his political troubles even as he sought to move past them.
