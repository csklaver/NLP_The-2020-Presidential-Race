NEW DELHI "" President Trump began a whirlwind visit to the world's largest democracy Monday by praising what he called India's unity and tolerance, but offering no public critique of recent actions by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that have been widely condemned as discriminatory.
Amid pageantry and crowds that were enormous but apparently shy of the president's predictions, Trump and Modi celebrated their warm personal bond and shared nationalist political philosophy while talking up economic and military cooperation that is a bulwark to China. Trump said a long-promised trade deal with India is in sight, but he gave no date for its completion.
'India is a country that proudly embraces freedom, liberty, individual rights, the rule of law and the dignity of every human being,' Trump said. 'Your nation has always been admired around the Earth as the place where millions upon millions of Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs and Jains, Buddhists, Christians and Jews worship side by side in harmony; where you speak more than 100 languages and come from more than two dozen states, yet you have always stood strong as one great Indian nation. Your unity is an inspiration to the world.'
Trump returned to the theme repeatedly but did not mention Modi's controversial citizenship law that passed in December or the state of emergency that his Hindu nationalist government imposed on Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state. 
The references to India's democratic political system and diversity were apparently meant to air U.S. concerns without publicly criticizing Trump's host, who beamed nearby. In the run-up to the trip, a senior White House official said Trump would raise the issue of religious freedom with Modi in private. The decision not to discuss it publicly repeats a pattern of Trump rarely addressing human rights while abroad.
The Modi government has faced considerable international criticism, including from Republicans in Congress, over its crackdown in Kashmir. And the religion-based citizenship law has led to protests nationwide. On Monday, even as Trump was on his way to New Delhi, violence erupted in the country's capital between supporters and opponents of the law, leaving two dead. 
The new law gives undocumented immigrants of six religions a fast-track path to citizenship but excludes Islam "" a faith that 200 million Indian citizens practice. Last week, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, an independent government body whose leaders are appointed by the president and top lawmakers, called the law a 'significant downward turn in religious freedom in India.'
Modi, whose critics call his Hindu nationalism discriminatory, hit the same inclusive theme as he welcomed Trump.
'You are in an India that is full of diversity, where hundreds of languages are spoken and where there are hundreds of kinds of attire, several kinds of cuisine, several religions and communities,' Modi told his guest. 'This rich diversity of ours, unity and diversity and the vibrancy of unity, is our very strong foundation for the relations between India and America.'
The president's quick trip is long on symbolism and short on substance, although Trump announced new military sales. The trade agreement that he said would be ready last year may now wait until after the U.S. presidential election. Trump said Monday that it is in the 'early stages of discussion.'
On the first day of the 36-hour visit, the president and first lady Melania Trump toured an ashram where Mohandas 'Mahatma' Gandhi, the father of modern India, once lived, and later the Taj Mahal, uncharacteristically emptied of tourists and glowing in the late-day light.
'Really incredible, an incredible place,' Trump remarked to reporters about the 17th-century white marble mausoleum, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
Although half a world away from home, the 'Namaste Trump' rally "" the centerpiece of his visit to India, which also included meetings in the nation's capital "" had familiar traces of the president's campaign rallies.
Instead of red 'Make America Great Again' hats, the attendees at Motera Stadium wore white caps emblazoned with the event's name and the two countries' flags. Trump's signature walk-off theme song, the Rolling Stones' 'You Can't Always Get What You Want,' played as the event concluded. 
Outside the stadium, Trump's motorcade passed a marching band on camels and huge posters depicting him and Modi, along with a hastily built barrier meant to camouflage a sprawling slum.
Inside, Trump paid tribute to India's economic rise, which includes a rapidly expanding middle class and a decline in extreme poverty.
He devoted part of his 27-minute remarks to the U.S. economy ('booming like never before') and America's military might ('now stronger than ever before'), other fixtures of his domestic campaign speeches.
He claimed that 125,000 people were packed into the brand-new facility and that millions were witnessing the display of friendship. The cricket stadium, the largest in the world, seats 110,000 people, and organizers added seating for several thousand on the field where cricket will be played. Nearly all the sections were full when Trump and Modi arrived to loud cheers, preceded by the strains of the song 'Macho Man' by the Village People. 
Ahead of his visit, Trump said he expected as many as 10 million people to line the streets for his arrival, an exaggeration even in a country of 1.3 billion people.
'It is your faith in the strength of a free society, your confidence in your own people, your trust in your own citizens and your respect for the dignity of every person that makes the United States and India such a natural, beautiful, enduring friendship,' the president said.
He appeared to depart from prepared remarks only twice, both times to praise Modi as a 'tough' negotiator.
Few expected the leaders to sign a trade deal during Trump's visit, and the two nations had ratcheted up trade tensions last year as the United States ended preferential trade privileges for India, which responded by imposing retaliatory tariffs on agricultural products.
'I am optimistic that working together, the prime minister and I can reach a fantastic deal that is good and even great for both of our countries,' Trump said. 'Except that he's a very tough negotiator.'
Trump spent part of his speech focused on immigration and border security, proclaiming that 'our borders will always be closed to terrorists, terrorism and any form of extremism' and that the United States aggressively screens foreigners seeking entry.
He noted that his administration has been cooperating with Pakistan 'in a very positive way' in targeting the 'terrorist organizations and militants that operate on the Pakistani border.'
The crowd applauded loudly for that disapproving reference to Pakistan, India's neighbor and bitter adversary, but had no dis cern ible praise for his remark that the United States also maintains a 'very good' relationship with Pakistan. 
Trump is not visiting Pakistan on this trip, breaking with tradition for most senior U.S. officials who have made a point of not appearing to show favoritism. Trump hosted Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan at the White House last year, and angered Modi by saying that the Indian leader had broached the possibility of having Trump help mediate the nations' dispute over Kashmir.
In his remarks Monday, Trump said India should play a leadership role in calming regional tensions, and left it there.
'Every nation has the right to secure and control borders,' he said. 'The United States and India are committed to working together to stop terrorists and to fight their ideology.'
Yet the issue of immigration has been sensitive for Indians seeking to come to the United States, as the Trump administration has cracked down on employer-based immigration programs that traditionally benefit large numbers of Indian professionals and their spouses. 
Trump said Monday that the United States and India were poised to sign an agreement to sell $3 billion worth of U.S. military helicopters to the Indian armed forces as he touted a 'critical partnership' between the two countries. It may be the most substantive policy announcement of his visit. U.S. officials approved the deal last year, and the Indian cabinet did the same last week.
Last fall, the United States and India held their first joint military exercises in the air, on land and at sea, called 'Tiger Triumph,' which Trump touted as 'something to behold.' 
Trump drew the loudest cheers from Monday's audience when he paid homage to uniquely Indian phenomena: Bollywood movies, cricket stars and the world's tallest statue. The crowd clapped encouragement as he struggled with names and words in Hindi, including the name of a famous sage, Swami Vivekananda. The president's rendition omitted a few syllables.
As the crowd filed out of the stadium, there was little sense that Modi and Trump are polarizing figures who inspire intense opposition. The fact that Trump had traveled to India, then lavished extravagant praise on the country and its leader, was a source of pride for many. They also reveled in the stadium where the event was held.
Foram Bhavsar, 45, a doctor who lives in Ahmedabad, loved the fact that Trump referred in his speech to Indian festivals such as Diwali and Holi. She said that she had seen Modi speak many times but that she never expected to see Trump in her hometown. 'This is a lifetime memorable moment,' she said. 'Perhaps we will never see this another time.'

As Joe Biden racked up a string of unexpected victories in Super Tuesday primaries, he began to stitch together the kind of political coalition that had eluded his candidacy for months: a broad assembly of voters with the collective power to potentially defeat President Trump in November.
Biden's strong showing among African Americans, suburbanites and moderate white voters - spanning geographical regions and drawing from a surge in turnout - boosted confidence among Democrats that the former vice president could soon win a Democratic race that voters have turned into a contest over which candidate is best positioned to beat Trump.
Biden, who won primaries in Texas, Virginia and eight other states Tuesday, alluded to his burgeoning coalition during his victory speech Tuesday night in Los Angeles.
""Our campaign reflects the diversity of this party and this nation, and that's how it should be,"" he told supporters. ""Because we need to bring everybody along, everybody. We want a nominee who will beat Donald Trump, but also keep Nancy Pelosi the speaker of the House, and win back the United States Senate.""
His surprise overnight elevation to delegate leader pleased moderate Democrats and unnerved some Republicans who had expected Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to come out in front after 14 states voted on Super Tuesday.
The results also harked back to the 2018 midterm elections, in which Democrats won back the House and prevailed in several competitive gubernatorial races by capitalizing on disdain for Trump among moderate and suburban voters, combined with high turnout among members of the Democratic base.
Rep. Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.), who flipped a Republican congressional seat in 2018, said Biden's string of victories was reminiscent of his win in a district containing the suburbs of Charleston.
""A lot of folks who came out and supported us are the same ones who came out and supported him,"" said Cunningham, who endorsed Biden.
In a campaign where electability has been a major theme, Biden has taken to calling himself an ""Obama-Biden"" Democrat and pledging to rebuild the kind of diverse electorate that helped former president Barack Obama secure two terms.
But with Sanders capitalizing on energetic crowds and support from many young voters, Obama's coalition has not fully rallied behind Biden, said Amy Walter, national editor of the Cook Political Report. While Biden has trailed Sanders among young people and Hispanic voters, he has quickly put together an emerging coalition that capitalizes on the strong anti-Trump sentiment among black voters and suburban women, she said.
""Every campaign should have its own coalition that is organic for the candidate and is the right coalition for the moment,"" Walter said. ""These suburban voters who in years past would split their votes more evenly between Democrats and Republicans are now coming out overwhelmingly against Trump.""
Virginia, where voters showed up in record numbers for Tuesday's primary, is a case in point.

Roughly 1.3 million Virginia voters cast ballots, about 21 percent of the electorate, according to unofficial results. That's up from the previous record of about 986,000 votes and 18 percent of the electorate in 2008, when Obama was challenging Hillary Clinton for the party's nomination.
""The interest . . . in defeating Donald Trump is so intense that it's almost unprecedented,"" Richmond political scientist Bob Holsworth said.
Biden was the beneficiary of the Virginia groundswell, easily beating Sanders and three other candidates.
""It's just extraordinary. In the commonwealth of Virginia, folks are fired up. They want to beat Trump,"" former governor Terry McAuliffe (D) said in an interview. He pointed to massive jumps in turnout in the once-purple D.C. suburbs, which he said reflected ""the intensity of the anti-Trump feeling in Northern Virginia.""
Cities with large African American populations also registered strong gains, with black voters accounting for a quarter of all ballots cast.
Biden also prevailed in Minnesota, Massachusetts and across the South, building on a swift-moving series of events in which two of his main moderate challengers dropped out of the race and endorsed him before Tuesday.
The endorsements by former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, combined with Biden's resounding win Saturday in South Carolina, had an impact. Voters who decided late heavily backed Biden, according to exit poll results.
While Biden came away from Tuesday's primaries with the most delegates, the contests revealed some of the challenges he faces as he tries to secure the nomination and pull together a fractured party.
He was trailing Sanders in the country's most populous state, California, as votes were still being counted, and he continues to lag with Hispanics and younger voters. It's also not clear how Biden would win over the liberal wing of the party, which has supported Sanders's agenda advocating more sweeping changes.
But Biden's victories also brought into sharper relief Sanders's failure to deliver on his pledge to drive a surge in turnout among young people and disaffected voters he contended would power his campaign to a revolution-style victory.
Sanders on Tuesday acknowledged he was disappointed in the turnout figures.
""I will be honest with you, we have not done as well in bringing young people into the political process,"" he told reporters in Burlington, Vt. ""It is not easy.""

According to exit polls, about 13 percent of voters in Super Tuesday states were 18-to-29-year-olds, compared with 3 in 10 who were 65 or older.
Republicans were quick to point out that Biden entered the race last year as a presumed leader, only to falter because of uneven performances on the campaign trail and lackluster fundraising.
""Just a few days ago, Democrats had left Joe Biden for dead because they realized he was a terrible candidate. Nothing has changed,"" said Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh. ""He's still a terrible candidate, and we still don't know if he'll be President Trump's opponent.""
Trump and his campaign have sought to interfere with the Democrats' primaries, openly pushing for a protracted fight between the party's liberal and moderate wings that could last through the nominating convention in July.
Sanders said Tuesday that he planned to move forward with his campaign and attacked Biden as a member of the ""establishment"" who has voted for bad trade deals.
A drawn-out Democratic battle over delegates and party rules would allow Trump to continue his attempts to build his coalition ahead of the general election. Trump, who spoke to the Latino Coalition Legislative Summit on Wednesday, has been making a public appeal to minority voters to back his campaign.
Some younger Latino voters, who have backed Sanders overwhelmingly, distrust Biden because of the high number of deportations that took place during the Obama administration, said Stephen Nuño-Perez of Latino Decisions, a nonpartisan polling firm that focuses on Latino political and social attitudes and that has done work for Democratic organizations.
Exit polling suggested that Biden won the votes of roughly 70 percent of black voters in Virginia and Alabama and did nearly as well in North Carolina and Texas, getting roughly 60 percent of the vote. Biden also won in Tennessee, Oklahoma and Arkansas.
Darren Peters, who worked on the presidential campaigns of Bill and Hillary Clinton, said Biden's strong showing with black voters in Southern states could help him if he becomes the party's nominee.
""It shows an ability to galvanize the kinds of constituencies that are going to be needed to win in a general election,"" Peters said, highlighting the importance of the black vote in key swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan.
While some Democrats have wondered if Biden, a familiar face with a long track record, would lose in the same way as Hillary Clinton, Biden drew broader support in North Carolina and Virginia than Clinton did in 2016. Clinton won 86 percent of Virginia precincts and 65 percent of North Carolina precincts in 2016. Biden won 93 percent of precincts in both states.
Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who ended his presidential bid last year, said Trump should be nervous about Biden's ability to ""connect with the Whole Foods moms and the suburban women"" who may have voted Republican in the past but have been turned off by the president's divisiveness.
""I think there's a silent majority of people who want Donald Trump out of office,"" Ryan said. ""They don't want to have heated discussions with people about it. They don't want to get in fights with people about it. They don't want to be on social media about it, but they're appalled at his behavior.""

Democrats have more optimism about ticket, but uncertainties remain
Former vice president Joe Biden's sudden emergence as the Democratic front-runner and the disruptions caused by the spreading coronavirus are altering calculations about the shape of a general election campaign that only weeks ago many Democrats feared was tipping in the direction of President Trump.
Biden's string of primary victories over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has improved the outlook of many Democratic strategists, who had feared that a Sanders nomination, which looked increasingly possible, would make winning the general election more difficult and could threaten down-ballot candidates as well.
Biden's campaign has begun to shift its focus to the general election even as the nomination contest with Sanders continues. The two Democrats will debate Sunday night on CNN and face another round of primaries on Tuesday. In those four contests - Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio - Biden is heavily favored and likely to add to his growing lead in delegates.
Both the Trump campaign and Democratic strategists have been focused first on the four key states that made Trump president in 2016: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida. The campaigns also expect to compete in North Carolina, Arizona, Minnesota and possibly one or two other states in an effort to expand their paths to an electoral majority.
Biden's sizable victory in Michigan on Tuesday, powered by a sharp rise in suburban turnout and strength across the state, has generated a surge of optimism and some cautionary warnings among Democrats about their prospects of winning that crucial state and others who will decide the outcome in November if the former vice president is at the top of the ticket. The turnout gave them hope that the energy behind Democrats' decisive victories during the last midterms could spell trouble this year for Trump. 
""The dynamics in Michigan have not shifted from 2018, and that is bad news for the Republicans,"" said Richard Czuba, an independent Michigan pollster.

The bigger unknown is what political impact the spreading coronavirus could have in November. The massive disruption to daily lives and the meltdown in financial markets are likely to affect voters' views of their own futures and potentially the two candidates as well, but in what ways no one can say.
Judgments on the government's response to the crisis, pro or con, could affect swing voters as they make decisions in the fall, while shocks to the economy and the possibility of a recession could rob the president of the single strongest issue he has had in his bid for a second term. 
""Historically, there are periods in presidential history where people just want calmness after a storm,"" said Susan MacManus, emerita professor of political science at the University of South Florida. ""That would be one of the key things, is to see whether Biden can project calmness and competence after the tumultuous period we've been in.""
If anything, the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus makes planning for the general election more difficult, but also might open the possibility of other states coming into play by later in the year. Campaigns are only now beginning to assess but lack trustworthy data in the middle of the pandemic to be able to make decisions with confidence.
Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, expressed confidence about the president's prospects for winning a second term, asserting that the electoral map looks favorable whether the challenger is Biden or Sanders. 
""Joe Biden will have a problem with union workers all across the upper Midwest because of his support for the job-killing NAFTA and TPP [Trans Pacific Partnership] deals, so this myth of Biden as some kind of blue-collar hero will be destroyed,"" he said in an email message. ""Biden's support for the public option in health care is just another way of crowding our employer-provided health insurance that people know and value."" 

Biden's team is operating on painful lessons Democrats learned from 2016 on what could be the new realities of campaigning in a time of a pandemic. ""It's incredibly important that we start from a standpoint of how wide the landscape could be,"" said a senior Biden campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment of the race. ""It is a detailed belief that I have that you can't take anything for granted. . . . I'm not willing to sit here and say, 'We don't need Florida, and Ohio is dead.' ""
Democrats hope for the increase in turnout, particularly among suburban women, that helped them win the House in 2018 to continue.
Meanwhile, the Trump campaign is counting on increased turnout among voters in exurban and rural areas who sat out 2016 but could make the difference in November. It's also making appeals to Latinos and African Americans.
One Biden campaign official said that because of what the Trump campaign is doing to communicate to voters of color and what likely will be new rules of the road for voter contact and mobilization, the campaign will have to put even greater emphasis than ever in assuring that the party's core voters turn out in November. 
That means greater breadth and depth in trying to reach all potential supporters. ""We're going to have to do the work of persuasion and get out there and make sure people turn out,"" the official said.
Florida appears to be a must-win state for the president. If he successfully replicates his narrow victory of 2016, the three northern states, or equivalent substitutes, become crucial for the Democrats. Of those three, Wisconsin is considered the most difficult.
Democratic strategists see Biden as better positioned than Sanders to reach an electoral college majority, in large part because the senator from Vermont's past and current statements about Cuba and his democratic socialist agenda would cost him significantly among Hispanic voters in Florida. That doesn't mean Sanders would have no path to 270 electoral votes, only that his margin for error would be smaller than for Biden. 
These same strategists say Biden appears able to put together a coalition of African Americans, suburban women and enough working-class white voters to improve on Hillary Clinton's performance in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which she lost by a combined 77,000 votes. 

But some Democrats are more cautious in their assessments of Biden's prospects. They worry that Trump is working to persuade voters of color either to defect or stay on the sidelines and see a need for the Democratic nominee to engage with those communities as much as they appear to be looking to attract white working-class voters.
The Trump strategy ""is to amp up their base with messages that stoke fear across the electorate and draw defection from the Democratic electorate,"" said Patrick Schuh, Michigan state director for America Votes, a progressive organization. ""Democrats and the progressive coalition are energized right now, but is running against Donald Trump enough to keep that coalition energized? We have to appeal to both white working-class voters and voters of color.""
Florida's primary on Tuesday could offer some clues about the fall campaign, but Clinton routed Sanders there in the 2016 primary and still lost the state to Trump in November. Biden is seen as a stronger candidate in that state than Sanders. 
Trump won Florida by just over a percentage point and won each of the three northern states by less than a percentage point and a combined total of just 77,000 votes. He rates as a very slight favorite to win Florida again. 
Steve Schale, a Florida-based Democratic strategist who is part of the group that formed Unite America, the super PAC helping Biden, said his state has been through so many close elections at the national and state level that we should expect another in November. 
Florida's voting patterns are shifting, but he said the changes have not altered the overall partisan split in the state. ""Democrats are doing wildly better in south Florida than before, and Republicans are seeing huge growth in places like Naples and Fort Myers. They keep balancing each other out."" He predicted that two media markets in the central part of the state - Orlando and Tampa - will determine the outcome.
Some Democrats worry that Trump has been effective in registering voters who would be partial to the president but did not turn out in 2016. Many of these voters live outside of major population centers. ""They have done a good job registered downscale, white voters,"" said Jim Messina, Obama's 2012 campaign manager. Florida is one and Pennsylvania is another, he said.
Another issue that concerns some Democrats is the potential resistance among some Hispanic voters - Cuban Americans and Venezuelan immigrants - to a Democratic nominee. ""It is extremely sensitive territory for members of that community to know that U.S. leaders, especially the president of the United States will stand with them,"" said one Florida Democratic politician speaking privately. ""Biden will have to deal with that directly.""
MacManus identified another potential weakness for Biden in Florida. ""Over a third of our voters are the two youngest generations,"" she said. ""If they can't be encouraged to turn out and vote for Biden, that's a really big problem.""
Of the three crucial northern states, Democrats feel best now about Michigan followed by Pennsylvania and then Wisconsin, which is seen as the tipping-point state for November, meaning the state that could give one candidate or the other the 270th electoral vote.
Trump campaign officials have made clear they will compete hard in Minnesota, which Clinton carried narrowly in 2016. Democrats agree that it is a state they must watch carefully because of its demographics. The Republicans will target other states as well but are not likely to carry them unless the president is winning by bigger margins than in 2016.
Democrats long have seen Arizona and North Carolina as targets and believe with Biden as the nominee both are even more attractive because of his potential ability to build a broad coalition. 
Former president Barack Obama won North Carolina in 2008 before losing it in 2012, and Trump carried it in 2016. Arizona's changing demographics and a costly and competitive Senate race that Democrats are eyeing make it attractive. If Wisconsin proves too difficult for Democrats, Arizona's electoral votes could compensate.
""Democrats are going to wage holy war to put Arizona and North Carolina into play, and recent events have made that more doable,"" Messina said.
Countering that, Trump's team came close enough in Minnesota in 2016 to warrant a serious investment there. New Hampshire, too, was quite close in 2016 and, given the Trump campaign's vast resources, worth going for. Both sides will treat it as a legitimate battleground despite its small size. 
Republicans also have talked about New Mexico as a state Trump could win, but Democrats are skeptical that he can turn the state red. Meanwhile, Biden's team will look seriously at competing in Ohio and even Iowa, even though Trump won both handily four years ago.

President Trump proposed a sweeping Middle East peace plan Tuesday that would establish a disjointed Palestinian state largely surrounded by Israel, while granting Israel most of what it has sought over decades of conflict. The proposal appears to have little chance of success. 
Trump touted the plan as the potential solution to decades of bloody strife, but his administration did little to solicit the support of Palestinian leaders who had rejected it sight unseen and played no role in its drafting. The president presented the proposal as the best Palestinians could hope to get during a ceremony where he stood beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who eagerly embraced both the president and what he presented. 
'Today's agreement is a historic opportunity for the Palestinians to finally achieve an independent state of their very own,' Trump said. 'After 70 years of little progress, this could be the last opportunity they will ever have.'
The plan would grant Israel vast license to incorporate Jewish settlements and maintain a yoke of security on land it now occupies ""
proposals that could have immediate consequences. Netanyahu plans to move forward with
annexing the Jewish settlements
in the West Bank and parts of the Jordan Valley as soon as this weekend, a government official said, in a move that could inflame tensions in the region and is being done with the tacit support of the White House.

The detailed plan offers a four-year window for Palestinians to begin negotiations for what would amount to a smaller, weaker version of statehood than envisioned by past U.S. presidents. But the conditional sovereignty is still more than Palestinians have now, and more than many of Trump's critics thought he would offer.
'My vision presents a win-win opportunity for both sides,' Trump said. 'A realistic two-state solution that resolves the risk of Palestinian statehood to Israel's security.'
The announcement came as both Trump and Netanyahu face politically perilous moments at home. The U.S. Senate is in the midst of the president's impeachment trial, which has been roiled by new reports regarding his actions toward Ukraine. And hours before the peace plan's release in Washington, the prime minister's indictment on corruption charges was filed in a Jerusalem court.
Both men embraced the release of the long-awaited plan in a celebratory ceremony that they portrayed as a historic moment and a testament to their leadership.
'I was not elected to do small things or shy away from big problems,' Trump said.
The package of U.S. ideas calls for a remapping of the West Bank and Jerusalem while offering Palestinians a pathway to statehood if they meet a set of tests.
No Palestinians attended the White House preview of what Trump called a highly detailed proposal for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which dates from Israel's founding in 1948. Trump said he sent a letter Tuesday to Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas inviting him to consider the plan.
'President Abbas, I want you to know that if you choose the path to peace, America and many other countries will "" we will be there,' Trump pledged.
Trump tweeted a copy of the proposed new map of Israel and future Palestinian territories, and he also tweeted about the plan in Hebrew and Arabic.
Abbas met Tuesday with a rare collection of often-feuding factions, including leaders of Hamas, the Palestine Liberation Organization and Islamic Jihad. 
He dismissed the Trump plan "" nicknamed the 'deal of the century' "" as the 'slap of the century' and pledged not to abandon the quest for what he called true independence, even for a $50-billion investment fund envisioned in the White House proposal.
'Trump, Jerusalem is not for sale,' Abbas said. 'Our rights are not for sale.'
U.S. officials hope Arab leaders who are weary of the endless conflict will see the plan as perhaps the last, best chance to settle it before Israeli settlements, other construction and security measures on occupied territory render a self-governing Palestinian entity moot. 
In addition to concerns over the details of the proposal, some Arab countries were upset about how it was rolled out. An Arab official involved in previous meetings with a team led by Trump senior adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner said none of the Arab representatives had been allowed to see the final version of the plan before it was unveiled. A series of calls from the White House to Arab capitals over the weekend appeared mostly aimed at persuading leaders not to dismiss the proposal out of hand, said the official, who spoke on the condition that his name and country be withheld, citing the sensitive nature of the discussions with Washington.
'Where this has failed, badly, is in coordination and pre-briefs,' the official said. 'This is a case of the White House dictating a mostly Israeli vision of a way ahead and not selling it in advance. The 'Art of the Deal' appears lacking in this case,' the official said, referring to Trump's 1987 book on business deals.
Once a signature priority for Trump, the peace deal effort was hobbled early on by a Palestinian boycott and then repeatedly delayed by a political crisis in Israel.
After holding back the secretive package during two rounds of inconclusive elections in Israel, the Trump administration decided to publish it ahead of a third vote in March and let the chips fall where they may, several people familiar with the process said.
Standing with a grinning Netanyahu, Trump listed actions he has taken that seem to tip the scales toward Israel, including a 2017 announcement recognizing Jerusalem as the country's capital. Palestinians walked away from the peace effort at that point and have not returned.
Trump also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights and pulled out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal despised by Netanyahu.
'Therefore, it is only reasonable that I have to do a lot for the Palestinians, or it just wouldn't be fair,' Trump said as the room went quiet. 'Now, don't clap for that, okay? But it's true. It wouldn't be fair. I want this deal to be a great deal for the Palestinians. It has to be.'
The Palestinian entity depicted in the Trump document would occupy about 70 percent of the West Bank, less than in plans envisioned by Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush or Barack Obama, and would have a capital on the outskirts of East Jerusalem rather than in the heart of that ancient section of the city as long demanded by Palestinians and their Arab backers.
Israel would give up some land along the Egyptian border, adjacent to the Gaza Strip, and a chunk of territory along the northern tip of the West Bank largely occupied by Israeli Arabs who the plan says self-identify as Palestinians.
The United States cannot effect the proposals, but U.S. ideas for what a peace settlement should include have guided the most recent failed efforts at a negotiated settlement.
Netanyahu thanked Trump profusely, calling him the finest friend Israel has ever had and pledging to talk if Palestinians come to the table. He said Trump's view that Israel can absorb settlements is a key to lasting peace rather than its undoing.
'Rather than pay easy lip service to Israel's security and simply shut your eyes, hope for the best, you recognized that Israel must have sovereignty in places that enable Israel to defend itself, by itself,' Netanyahu said.
Democrats and Middle East analysts were quick to criticize the White House proposal. Most characterized it as a one-sided abandonment of the two-state solution, and they predicted the Palestinians would reject it outright.
'Previous presidents of both parties successfully maintained the respect of both Israelis and Palestinians for the United States' role as a credible player in difficult negotiations,' a group of 12 Democratic senators led by Chris Van Hollen of Maryland wrote in a letter to Trump. 'Your one-sided actions have made that impossible. It is clear that this latest White House effort is not a legitimate attempt to advance peace. It is a recipe for renewed division and conflict in the region.'
Trump aired his proposals in private meetings Monday with Netanyahu and the veteran Israeli leader's challenger in upcoming elections, Benny Gantz, as part of the administration's strategy to release the U.S. guidelines for a settlement before Israelis vote in March. Netanyahu and Gantz are in a dead heat after two inconclusive elections in the past year.
The plan developed by Kushner addresses each of the major issues that have scuttled past peace efforts, including competing land claims and the administration of holy sites in Jerusalem.
In an interview Tuesday on CNN, Kushner said the plan does 'a great deal' for Palestinians but did not strike a conciliatory tone. If they reject it, 'they're going to screw up another opportunity, like they've screwed up every other opportunity that they've ever had in their existence,' Kushner said. 
Ahead of the plan's release, Hamas, the militant group governing the Gaza Strip, agreed to sit down Tuesday to craft a joint response with archrival Abbas, whose Fatah party controls the West Bank. 
'The unitary scene is the first nail in the coffin of this deal; when we are united, Trump and no one else will dare violate our rights,' Khalil al-Hayya, the deputy head of Hamas, said at a rally Monday night in Gaza City. 'We tell everyone that we are united against the deal of the century and to drop all conspiracies. We are one people under one flag.'

Focus is on a handful of senators as Republicans eye bipartisan acquittal 
Democrats are casting a nervous eye on a small group of publicly undecided senators in their ranks as Republicans target a coveted prize in the Senate impeachment trial "" a bipartisan acquittal of President Trump.
Under the spotlight are two centrist mavericks who won election last year "" Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) "" as well as Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), who will face voters this year after a long-shot win in a special election in 2017.
'I talk to those three every day; I don't have a sense on where they're going to be in the end,' said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who described the coming verdict as a 'conscience vote' in which senators are leaving colleagues to reach their own conclusions.
Senators hardly need to be reminded of the stakes, however. Public attention in the early stages of the trial has been heaped on the handful of Republican moderates who are set to determine whether unheard witnesses and unseen documents will be admitted to the proceedings after the White House stonewalled Congress, but the wavering Democrats could have a significant bearing on the ultimate political ramifications of the verdict.
Multiple Republicans suggested Wednesday that any defections would fuel their campaign to dismiss the nearly five-month impeachment probe as a partisan witch hunt, while undermining Democrats' attempts to cast doubt on the fairness of the Senate trial and use the impeachment probe as a cudgel in the upcoming elections.
'Everybody's focused on one thing, and that is whether or not the Republicans will stay united,' said Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.). 'The truth of the matter is that there are at least two if not three Democrats that can separate from their caucus, which would be a huge win because any bipartisan acquittal is big deal.'
Manchin, who has sought to maintain a working relationship with Trump even after the president campaigned heavily against him last year, is widely seen as the most likely Democratic vote for Trump's acquittal. That speculation has been based not only on the tilt of his state, which voted for Trump by 42 percentage points in 2016, but also his history of backing the president on key votes and the 72-year-old's refusal to rule out a 2024 reelection run or a second stint as governor.
In an interview Wednesday, Manchin invoked his home state repeatedly as he insisted that he was tuning out pressure from either party: 'I'm here because of West Virginia. I'm not here because of any senator, okay?' he said. 'No one's my boss except West Virginia.'
Jones is facing an even more precarious position in a similarly pro-Trump state. The surprise winner of a special election, Jones will face voters in November, and Republicans consider that by far their best opportunity to flip a Democratic seat in the 2020 cycle. But he also has little chance of reelection if he alienates his party's base voters by opposing Trump's removal.
'In every case, a judge says: 'Please don't start deliberating. Please don't make up your mind until you hear all the evidence,' ' Jones, a former U.S. attorney, told reporters Wednesday. 'Am I leaning on different things? Sure. But I ain't going to tell you guys that, for God's sake.'
In public comments this week, Jones suggested he is entertaining a split decision "" convicting Trump for abuse of power while acquitting him for obstruction of Congress "" although he suggested Wednesday he might be moving away from that view: 'The more I see the president of the United States attacking witnesses, the stronger that case gets,' he said, after Trump tweeted sharp words about John Bolton, his former national security adviser.
More than any other Democratic senator, Sinema has kept her thinking private.
'I will treat this process with the gravity and impartiality that our oaths demand and will not comment on the proceedings or facts until the trial concludes,' she said in a statement at the outset of the trial and has assiduously avoided addressing reporters since.
But Sinema is also perhaps the most unpredictable member of the Senate Democratic ranks, joining Manchin and Jones in February to confirm Attorney General William P. Barr before taking a week-long break mid-session to compete in a New Zealand triathlon.
Spokeswoman Hannah Hurley, declining an interview request on Sinema's behalf, pointed to that initial statement in explaining 'how seriously she takes this process, the oath that she swore, and what that oath demands of her and every other senator.'
Some Republicans have their eyes on a fourth Democrat: Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan, who is seeking a second term this year in a race that is looking increasingly competitive due to the aggressive fundraising of Republican businessman John James. But much like Jones, other Democrats see little chance Peters breaks faith with the vast majority of his party's voters who favor Trump's removal.
Peters said Wednesday that he remains undecided and that he would wait for the two-day question-and-answer process to conclude.
'I've learned through a lot of committee hearings: It's not the opening comments that are the most interesting. It's the questions and answers,' he said. 'I think it's important to keep an open mind.'
Democrats have been encouraged that all four senators have stayed publicly united on the question of summoning additional evidence. Over 12 procedural votes last week, party lines held firm on all but one question, where Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) joined with Democrats.
Trump and his allies have already sought to put a spotlight on the modest partisan crossover in the House, where Rep. Collin C. Peterson (D-Minn.) voted against both articles of impeachment, Rep. Jared Golden (D-Maine) voted against one, and Rep. Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey switched to the GOP after opposing both. They have at the same time dismissed the vote of Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), a conservative former Republican who left the party last year after facing blowback for his attacks on Trump.
In the Senate, Republicans could be facing defections of their own. Collins as well as Sens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) have signaled that their votes remain in flux. But many in the GOP believe that a Democratic crossover is more likely "" and potentially more significant.
'It would mean once again,' said Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), 'that the only bipartisan support is for the president.'
Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) played down the Republican pressure campaign and, like Murphy, said there has been 'no pressure and no demands and no retribution suggested for anyone' in the Democratic ranks. Any claims of bipartisanship on Trump's part, he said, would ultimately be flimsy.
'If I get one Republican vote, I talk about my 'bipartisan measure' "" that's natural around here. But you know, I think people will understand if it's just one, two, three people as opposed to a larger number,' he said, pointing to the 1999 Bill Clinton impeachment, where five Republicans joined Democrats to reject one article, and 10 rejected another. 'I think that was bipartisan. It's in the eye of the beholder.'

Choose your scapegoat: Democrats, the media, the Chinese government, the ""deep state,"" Bernie Sanders or even ""identity politics."" 
All received some share of the blame this week from conservative media figures for the growing public concern over the coronavirus, the communicable disease that has spread across the globe.
In fact, many conservative commentators have expressed less interest in the spread of the virus or efforts to combat it than in the story of the virus - a story they are convinced shows bias designed to harm President Trump.
Rush Limbaugh's, Sean Hannity's and Tucker Carlson's commentaries mixed paranoia, erroneous information and sometimes dangerous conspiracy theories about the virus, which has killed about 2,800 people, mostly in China, where it was first detected.
Trump, who often engages in a feedback loop with allied media figures, has already picked up on one strand of the popular pundits' thinking: that the news media and Democrats have hyped the threat posed by the outbreak. 

""Low Ratings Fake News MSDNC (Comcast) & @CNN are doing everything possible to make the Caronavirus look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible,"" he tweeted Wednesday, misspelling the name of the disease in the process. ""Likewise their incompetent Do Nothing Democrat comrades are all talk, no action. USA in great shape!""
Hannity took Trump's argument a step further Thursday with a focus on the Democrats, who he argued were ""sadly politicizing and weaponizing an infectious disease as their next effort to bludgeon President Trump.""
Limbaugh - who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Trump this month - was early to tar the media as the villain. The conservative radio titan said on his program Monday that the media's coverage of the virus was ""an effort to get Trump"" and spook investors. (The Dow Jones was down more than 1,100 points Thursday, adding to its drop over the past week.)
During the same broadcast, Limbaugh repeated a debunked theory that the virus was engineered by the Chinese as a bioweapon. But then he dismissed the coronavirus as just ""the common cold, folks.""
Experts say that's not the case. Early reports suggest that about 2 percent of those who contract the coronavirus die of it, making it about 20 times more lethal than the flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the flu killed about 34,000 people in the United States during the 2018-2019 flu season.
In view of the uncertainty and risk, the attacks on the news media could be particularly damaging and ill-timed, given that they may undermine sources of reliable information at a time when such information is vital.
China has also drawn suspicious glances from Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who suggested on her prime-time program this week that Chinese officials may be taking some consolation from the growing crisis because it might hurt Trump's reelection chances.

 ""I think they want to use this - I mean, in China, they don't want to deal with Trump anymore, with the tariffs,"" she said on air Tuesday. ""I think for them, the best thing would be if this hurt Trump in his reelection, correct?""
Ingraham also bashed Democrats for ""relishing in this moment,"" adding, ""How sick that these people seem almost happiest when Americans are hurting.""
Among those who came into conservatives' crosshairs this week was Nancy Messonnier, the head of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. During a media briefing Tuesday, Messonnier said an outbreak of coronavirus in the United States was inevitable. The warning quickly turned out to be accurate when reports of the first apparent case of ""community transmission"" of the virus in the United States came out Thursday.
Despite Messonnier's expertise and experience with infectious diseases, conservatives spied a ""deep state"" conspiracy. They called her comments into question because of a family connection: She is the sister of Rod J. Rosenstein, the former deputy attorney general who oversaw special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation of Trump.
Limbaugh suggested Wednesday that Messonnier couldn't be trusted because she's related to Rosenstein, a theme echoed by the far-right, conspiracy-minded Gateway Pundit blog.
 Noting that Messonnier spoke while Trump was on a state visit to India, the Pundit's Joe Hoft wrote Wednesday: ""The brother of the CDC's Dr. Nancy Messonnier, is the corrupt disgraced former DAG Rod Rosenstein. Following in his footsteps, Dr. Messonnier dropped a bomb on President Trump while he was in India yesterday. . . . This was eerily similar to past presidential trips when former and corrupt DAG Rod Rosenstein and the corrupt and criminal Mueller gang would drop shocking news as the president was overseas.""
But the ""real"" threat might be Bernie Sanders, the front-runner in the Democratic presidential race, not coronavirus, according to Fox Business host Stuart Varney.
""The real driver [of the stock market's 10 percent fall over the past four days] is obviously the spreading virus,"" Varney said. ""There's no question about that. But politics is a factor. And if you see a Bernie Sanders presidency or a Democrat presidency looming at you, as the president says, anything can happen in an election. No matter how remote, you're going to get worried if you're an investor.""
Limbaugh also invoked Sanders, judging him more worrisome than the virus: ""There's no question that Bernie Sanders poses a far greater threat to this country and the Democrat Party than the coronavirus - and I mean to say that,"" he said Wednesday. ""The Democrat Party, as it's currently constituted, poses a much greater threat to this country than the coronavirus does.""
The most abstract critique may have come from Tucker Carlson, who blamed ""wokeness"" for misinforming people about the dangers posed by the virus.
""For weeks the media told you it was wrong to worry about the coronavirus,"" Carlson said. ""If you think maybe we ought to take some steps to protect ourselves from it, then you're a bigot.""
""Countless publications wagged their fingers in the face of readers, and told them it was irrational, probably immoral, in fact, to worry more about the coronavirus than the annual flu,"" he continued. ""Identity politics trumped public health and not for the first time. . . . They would let you die before they admitted that diversity is not our strength.""

Were it up to Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), historians would mention President Trump's all-but-certain impeachment acquittal much the same way baseball fans mention Barry Bonds's career home-run record "" an achievement destined to be obscured by an eternal cloud. 
While Trump, unlike Bonds, does not stand accused of benefiting from performance-enhancing drugs, Democrats started to make an aggressive case this week that the Republican-led Senate's decision Friday to end Trump's trial without summoning witnesses or documents should cast grave doubt on its outcome.
The charge has been led by the most senior Democratic officials as it grew increasingly clear this week that Republican senators would vote to reject additional evidence and pave the way for a largely partisan verdict.
Hours before the Senate voted Friday, Schumer declared any acquittal at such a trial to be 'meaningless.'
'If there are no witnesses, no documents in this trial, there will be a permanent asterisk next to the acquittal of President Trump written in permanent ink,' he said, harking to the punctuation mark that once accompanied contested records in sports almanacs.
On Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) declared flatly that Trump 'will not be acquitted' regardless of the vote. 
'You cannot be acquitted if you don't have a trial,' she said. 'And you don't have a trial if you don't have witnesses and documentation.'
Prior to Trump's trial, the Senate has held 15 impeachment trials, including two for a president. All had witnesses.
The Democratic rhetoric was, on one hand, an early attempt to salvage what promises to be a crushing political loss. After warning for months about the dangers of a partisan impeachment, Pelosi led the House down that path after allegations of grave misdeeds emerged from the Trump administration "" only to find the GOP ever-willing to stand by Trump in the face of damaging revelations.
On the other hand, Schumer, Pelosi and other Democrats are launching an appeal that they hope will have staying power. In the short term, that means impressing on voters that they ought to treat Trump's certain claims of vindication with deep skepticism. In the longer term, they are banking that history will remember unkindly those who stood with Trump.
'This is only the third time we've had a vote on convicting and removing a president,' said Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.). 'I think it's going to be remembered as something incredibly serious, and certainly we want to point out to colleagues that they should be thinking about that now.'
Some Republican senators have suggested they are indeed thinking about their place in history. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) launched his political career in the shadow of fellow Tennessee Republican Howard Baker Jr., who as a member of the Senate Watergate Committee helped expose President Richard M. Nixon's wrongdoing and later persuaded him to resign rather than face impeachment.
Alexander told reporters Friday he believed he had followed Baker's example, concluding that Trump's 'inappropriate conduct' was not worthy of removal from office nine months before an election. 
Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) reached for institutional concerns Friday in announcing her decision not to pursue additional evidence, decrying the 'partisan nature' of the impeachment and attempts to 'drag the Supreme Court into the fray,' citing attacks on Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.
For most Republicans, any attempts to cast aspersions on the trial in the GOP Senate were met with attacks on the impeachment process in the Democratic House, which raced over the course of three months to assemble a case against Trump despite the White House blocking witnesses and withholding documents. In the end, no Republicans voted for the two articles of impeachment; Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), a former Republican, joined with Democrats.
'There is a massive asterisk on the impeachment itself, the way that the entire House process was run,' said Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.). 'And if Senator Schumer's effort to rewrite history . . . will look back on what happened over on the House side "" the fact is [the Senate] inherited a fatally flawed case, a fatally flawed process from the House.' 
For Trump, the focus has been less on the history books and more on his reelection prospects, as he has used virtually every lever of persuasion at his disposal "" from his Twitter account to a massive campaign account "" to drive the message that the impeachment has been an unfair partisan witch hunt that misconstrued a 'perfect phone call' with the Ukrainian president in July.
The argument was echoed in the Senate chamber during the trial by Trump's defense team, which argued repeatedly that Trump did 'absolutely nothing wrong,' and it is expected to persist well after the acquittal "" with claims of vindication likely to stretch through the November elections and beyond.
While the outcome of the witness vote was in doubt until Alexander announced a no vote Thursday night, the likelihood of an acquittal was never seriously challenged. A conviction would require at least 20 Republicans to join with all 47 members of the Democratic caucus, and no more than a small handful of GOP lawmakers ever swayed publicly about the allegations that Trump used military aid and a White House meeting as leverage to force investigations of his domestic political rivals.
Trump's maximalist defense, however, was undermined this week with such senators as Alexander and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) arguing that Trump's behavior was in fact wrong, though not impeachable. 
Republicans have anticipated, and Democrats have braced for, a Trump victory tour of sorts "" one that, depending on how quickly the Senate can move to a verdict, could begin with Tuesday's State of the Union address. 
The 'permanent asterisk' rhetoric this week has paved the road for the Democratic pushback for months, if not decades to come, by throwing doubt on the verdict.
'We know better,' Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said of any claims of vindication. 'He's going to talk about the end of the 'witch hunt' and so forth, but I think the fact that the Republicans are so afraid of a trial and so afraid of the truth speaks for itself.'
Said Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), 'You cannot have a true acquittal if you've not had a fair trial.'
'No witnesses means no exoneration,' Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) tweeted Friday.
Democrats say their incessant public campaign for 'witness and documents' "" one that began with Pelosi's surprise decision to hold out on naming managers and formally sending the articles to the Senate "" will ultimately pay political dividends as Americans turn away from the impeachment saga and toward the presidential race.
 'The way in which Republicans have conducted this will allow Democrats for the next 10 months to draw issue with Trump's acquittal which we wouldn't have been able to do if we had come to an agreement on rules and we had had witnesses and we had had deliberations,' said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). 'We now have legitimate reason to contest the fairness of the trial and the acquittal of the president, and I think that's impactful.'

In letter to Barr, Nadler calls events at Justice 'deeply troubling'
The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee asked Attorney General William P. Barr on Friday to allow the four career prosecutors who quit the criminal case against President Trump's friend Roger Stone to testify before lawmakers as part of a wide-ranging inquiry into possible White House interference at the Justice Department.
In a letter to Barr, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) wrote that recent events at the Justice Department - including leadership's unusual intervention to reduce career prosecutors' sentencing recommendation for Stone - have been ""deeply troubling"" and requested that Barr turn over communications between the White House and the Justice Department on several politically sensitive cases.
Nadler also asked that Barr make available for testimony or interviews 15 different current and former officials involved in the matters, including the four career prosecutors who until recently handled the Stone case and all the U.S. attorneys across the country that the Justice Department has recently tapped for special assignments of interest to Trump.
Barr is scheduled to testify before the Judiciary Committee on March 31, and Nadler asked for a response to his letter by March 13.
The Justice Department is generally resistant to providing Congress with White House communications, which could be protected by executive privilege, or with information about ongoing investigations - making it unlikely Nadler will get much, if any, of what he is seeking. The chairman's request for testimony from low-level line prosecutors, who are not politically appointed, also is unusual and could be met with resistance even within his own party.
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Nadler conceded in his letter that the Trump administration's position has been that ""the Department typically does not provide information regarding ongoing matters,"" but he cited recent precedents that show the Justice Department has not always taken that tack.
For example, he wrote, when the Judiciary Committee examined the FBI's investigation of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, as well as the FBI's 2016 opening of an investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign, ""the Justice Department made available nearly one million pages of documents, including classified materials, memos describing interactions with President Trump, and electronic communications authorizing investigations into Russian election interference.""
Nadler noted that the department also made available 15 current and former Justice Department and FBI employees for interviews, including career officials, for those legislative inquiries.
Barr has faced intense criticism since he intervened in the Stone case this month - after Trump tweeted about the matter - to reduce the seven-to-nine-year sentencing recommendation that career prosecutors had made to a judge. The move prompted the four prosecutors - Jonathan Kravis, Aaron S.J. Zelinsky, Adam C. Jed and Michael J. Marando - to quit the case, with Kravis leaving government entirely. In an open letter, more than 2,000 former Justice Department officials soon called on Barr to resign.
Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress as it sought to investigate possible coordination between Trump's campaign and Russia, was ultimately sentenced to three years and four months in prison.
Barr has said he chose to intervene before Trump's tweet, and in an ABC News interview, he openly rebuked the president for speaking publicly about Justice Department criminal cases. Barr told ABC News that Trump's comments made it ""impossible for me to do my job."" 
His Justice Department is resisting Stone's bid for a new trial based on allegations that the jury forewoman was biased against Trump, even though Trump has endorsed Stone's claims publicly. On Friday, a federal judge unsealed a filing in Washington indicating federal prosecutors had called Stone's request for a new trial ""frivolous"" and alleged his defense attorneys were trying to publicly promote ""a conspiracy-laden narrative"" to undermine the verdict.
The net effect has been harmful to morale in the department. Many career officials already had viewed Barr - and his predecessor, Jeff Sessions - warily for appointing outside U.S. attorneys to carry out tasks that would seemingly be of political benefit to Trump.
For example, Barr assigned U.S. Attorney John Durham in Connecticut to investigate how the FBI initiated its 2016 probe into Trump's campaign and tapped U.S. Attorney Scott W. Brady in Pittsburgh to take information from Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, about what Giuliani sees as wrongdoing by former vice president Joe Biden and his family in Ukraine. In the wake of the Stone sentencing, it was revealed that Barr had also tapped Jeff Jensen, the U.S. attorney in St. Louis, to review and ""assist"" prosecutors handling the case against Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Nadler's letter called for all of those U.S. attorneys - and several others involved in similar matters - to be made available to testify.

Analysts say Putin may try to exploit rift
between U.S. and Iraq


MOSCOW "" Some of the loudest critics of President Trump's order to kill a senior Iranian commander "" other than Iranians "" are Russian officials, who have denounced it as an illegal assassination and a politically motivated election-year decision.
But it is Russia that may end up benefiting from the fallout. If the United States withdraws from Iraq as backlash over the killing widens, Russia could strengthen its foothold in the country "" much as it did in Syria after Trump ordered a troop pullout there last fall, a step that was later partly reversed.
Speaking to French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday, Russian President Vladimir Putin-warned that Friday's targeted killing of Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani would seriously destabilize the region. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov cast it as illegal and counterproductive to his counterparts in China, Turkey and Iran, as well as to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.




German Chancellor Angela Merkel will meet Putin in Moscow on Saturday at his invitation to discuss the crisis. 
The strike could see the United States pulled deeper into Iraq to defend against threatened Iranian reprisals, despite its plans to draw down forces there and elsewhere. But the opposite could also happen: U.S. forces might pull out if the Iraqi government demands it, as Iraq's parliament called on it to do Sunday. Or Trump might decide he does not want to risk a dangerous quagmire in an election year.
A hasty U.S. departure would give Iran what it has sought for years, analysts said. But they noted that it could also create a void for Russia to exploit, although it is more likely to do so through diplomatic overtures, trade deals and arms sales than by taking up any military slack.
'Under the circumstances of a forced and precipitous U.S. withdrawal, a power vacuum would emerge that would benefit Iran and Russia the most,' said Michael Carpenter, managing director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement and a former Pentagon deputy assistant secretary on Russia, Ukraine and Eurasia.
Richard N. Haass, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, tweeted that the strike would see U.S. military and diplomats leaving Iraq, either because Iraq demanded it or they were too much of a target or both. 'One sure result of the US strike is that the era of US-Iraq cooperation is over,' he wrote Friday, adding Monday that Trump's 'Truly counter-productive' threats against Iraq made it more likely U.S. forces would have to leave.
For Russia, there's a major difference between Syria, its decades-long ally, and Iraq, where the Kremlin's footprint has been limited since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. In Syria, President Bashar al-Assad asked Putin to intervene as the Islamic State and anti-government rebels threatened his power. When Putin agreed, many warned Russia could be bogged down in an intractable, expensive war that could make it more of a target for the extremists.
The man who argued Assad's case to Russian defense and security officials "" and convinced them the war was still winnable "" was Soleimani, who traveled to Moscow in July 2015, unfurled a map of Syria on the table and explained what could be done to prevent Assad's regime from falling, according to a Reuters report at the time citing a senior regional official. The following April, Reuters cited a senior Iranian official reporting that Soleimani met with Putin and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu in Moscow to discuss deliveries of Russian missiles to Syria. According to media reports from 2015 to 2017, he traveled numerous times to Moscow in breach of a U.N. travel ban.
Moscow officials have never admitted that such meetings took place. But Soleimani's mission paid off for Russia, saving its strategic naval base in Tartus on Syria's Mediterranean coast. Russia also expanded its military foothold on Europe's doorstep, gaining use of the nearby Hmeimim air base and establishing what some in NATO see as an air defense zone in the region.
Russia's Defense Ministry sent condolences on Soleimani's death and paid tribute to his 'well-deserved authority and significant influence' in the region. 'His personal merits in the fight against ISIS in Syria are undeniable,' it said in a statement.
Carpenter said Russian security officials worked well with Soleimani because they had values in common with him.
'They shared the same beliefs in neo-imperialism and power politics. Soleimani didn't really fit the mold of a religious zealot or mullah,' he said. 'The Russian intelligence and military apparatus could thus relate to him, and they also admired him for his shrewd strategic outlook and mastery of hybrid warfare.'
Putin's strategic goals include rebuilding Russian power after its retreat in the 1990s; creating global alliances designed to counter U.S. influence; and inserting the country in strategic regions such as the Middle East as the party no one can afford to ignore. He has shown willingness to take surprising risks to widen Russia's geopolitical clout, moving into regions abandoned or neglected by the United States. But he is considered to be wary of trying to repeat his Syrian triumph in Iraq, even if invited. The United States' long unhappy Iraq mission illustrates the move's potential challenges.
Moscow's relations with Baghdad have warmed in recent years. Diplomats meet regularly, announcing energy and arms deals. Russian energy giants Lukoil, Gazprom and Rosneft all operate in Iraq.


Eugene Rumer, former national intelligence officer for Russia and Eurasia and director of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Russia and Eurasia program, is skeptical that Russia would intervene militarily, even if U.S. forces do suddenly leave Iraq.

'If there was a fundamental breach between the United States and Iraq, I think it's more likely they would use that moment diplomatically,' he said. 'They might send in military advisers. They have sold weapons to Iraq and they might sell more. They might sign some trade deals.'
Russia would not be slow to exploit tension between Washington and Baghdad over the Soleimani killing, Carpenter said.
'A weakened U.S. relationship with Iraq allows Russia to cement its already-warming ties to Baghdad and augments Russia's role as the premier power broker across the Middle East,' he said.
Russia's view is that the strike was illegal under international law, because it took place without the permission of the host country and involved the killing of a senior official in a U.N. member state. The subtext of its message is about U.S. hypocrisy when it condemns Russian breaches of international law, for example in its 2014 annexation of Crimea. According to Anatol Lieven, an expert on global terrorism and the former Soviet Union based at Georgetown University's campus in Doha, Qatar, the argument has traction in many places.
'Already across most of the world, including virtually all my own students from the Middle East, Africa and South Asia, people see no difference between U.S. and Russian international behavior when it comes to aggression, illegality and immorality,' he said.
Russian officials have also suggested that Trump's real motive was political, as he faces impeachment in an election year.
'For the moment at least it takes the attention of the American media and international media away from things like Ukraine and Russian meddling and it puts the spotlight on President Trump as this erratic, not very responsible loose cannon who is prepared to do whatever it takes, not so much to protect the United States but to take away the spotlight from the impeachment trial and to change domestic dynamics. So I think this plays well for the Russians,' Rumer said. 'It raises the question of the real rationale behind the strikes and it makes Putin look like the more responsible leader.'
If there's a regional crisis, Russia could benefit from increased global oil prices, though Lieven said Russia wouldn't want to see prices go too high for too long.
'Assuming that Iran does strike back, then Saudi refineries, ports and tankers will definitely be targets,' he said. 'The question is whether . . . Iran now has the capacity to inflict such massive damage that oil prices will rocket and stay high for a prolonged period, producing another global recession.'
Lieven said that higher oil prices would benefit Russia in the short term but added: 'The lessons of the 1970s and 80s would tend to suggest that in the longer run, global recession brings prices down again very radically. Moreover, another oil shock would increase further moves in Europe and China to reduce dependence on oil.'

Happy about acquittal, president visits four states in as many days

LAS VEGAS "" Since the Republican-controlled Senate voted to acquit him on impeachment charges, President Trump has been on something of a perpetual victory lap.
He has tweeted, he has crowed, he has purged.
Then, this week, he took his triumphant show to the West Coast. 
Trump's post-impeachment, four-day swing through as many states "" three of which Hillary Clinton won in 2016 "" was the physical and geographic manifestation of Trump emboldened, as much a defiant flouting from an exultant president as a peripatetic hodgepodge of fundraising, rallies and official White House events out West.
Over stops in Arizona, California, Colorado and Nevada, Trump was buoyant almost to the point of giddiness, bounding over to greet supporters as he deplaned Air Force One and chatting off the record with his traveling press corps "" including Wednesday night when Trump, playing the role of eager host, led a klatch of reporters to his personal cabin aboard the Boeing 747 to watch the Democratic debate, which he had TiVo'd.
Yes, he has been impeached "" a historical humiliation and a forever asterisk on his presidency "" but this week, Trump witnessed the Democrats attack one another for two hours on a debate stage here, basked in the adulation of his cheering rally crowds and presented as a man increasingly confident about his reelection prospects.
Addressing an arena of supporters Wednesday night in Phoenix, Trump relayed the line-by-line of his kinetic day "" 'I started off with a speech in Nevada at 7:30 in the morning; I then went to California, made two speeches; I then went someplace else' "" and projected the image of someone weary but pressing forth, and siphoning vigor from his crowds. 
'I said, 'Am I finished?' 'No, you've got to go to Arizona tonight and speak in front of like 25,000 people,' ' Trump continued. 'I said, 'That's okay,' because I love this unbelievable energy in this crowd.' 
On Tuesday, Trump raised money in the liberal enclave of Beverly Hills, Calif., which he followed Wednesday morning with another fundraiser hosted by Oracle founder Larry Ellison at his verdant and exclusive Porcupine Creek golf club in Rancho Mirage, Calif. 
As if to underscore Trump's foray into Democratic country, Joe Grogan, the White House's director of the Domestic Policy Counsel, tweeted: 'Just landed in California. POTUS power swing through occupied territory.' 
Trump also scheduled a trio of consecutive campaign rallies "" Wednesday night in Phoenix, Thursday night in Colorado Springs and Friday afternoon in Las Vegas "" before heading back home to Washington. 
The Phoenix rally offered deliberate counterprogramming to the Democratic debate here "" Trump took the stage exactly 30-minutes after the slate of 2020 hopefuls assembled behind their own lecterns one state away "" and his Thursday rally was pointedly placed in Colorado, a state he lost by five percentage points to Clinton in 2016 but one that his campaign manager Brad Parscale is bullish he can win this November.
'With your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical Democrats and we are going to win Colorado in a landslide,' Trump said Thursday night at his rally in Colorado Springs. 
By Thursday evening, the president's cheerful disposition seemed to have faded slightly, with Trump offering a nearly 100-minute performance that was aggrieved and discursive at times.
He mocked former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) for what he said were their weak debate performances. (They both 'choked,' he said, mimicking a person clutching his chest and struggling to breathe.) He complained that 'Parasite,' a South Korean film with subtitles, had won the Oscar for best picture. ('We've got enough problems with South Korea,' he said, nostalgically calling for another winner like 'Gone With the Wind.') And he offered praise for a slew of individuals "" some familiar, some less so. (A 'nice, slim, beautiful-looking man,' he said, describing Interior Secretary David Bernhardt.) 
Trump is a reluctant traveler, partial to the comforts of his eponymously branded properties, and his proposed Western swings often have a way of crumbling under their own grandiosity, aides said. 
The president initially grumbled about this visit as well but was placated by being able to stay at his own Trump International hotel here every night, one official said.
Asked before leaving why he was returning to sleep at his own property each evening, Trump claimed he wasn't aware of the nightly arrangement. 
'Well, I don't know exactly the schedule because I don't set the schedule,' he said. 'Largely, the schedule is set by the Secret Service. We do what they want us to.'
A White House official then came back to the press cabin of Air Force One to explain that the president was overnighting in Las Vegas for security reasons, as well as to save money and create as small of an inconvenience as possible for multiple cities. 
Ultimately, Trump embraced the nearly week-long trip, sharing news of the final Friday rally here during an Oval Office visit with the president of Ecuador last week, before his campaign had even announced the event.
For the most part, only his tweets "" a buzzing current of angry energy that often started early in the morning "" belied his sanguine public demeanor. He mocked Bloomberg "" 'Mini Mike' or just 'Mini,' in his microbursts "" and continued to tweet about the Justice Department, despite Attorney General William P. Barr telling close associates he might have to resign if Trump kept on tweeting about Justice Department affairs.
'Mini Mike Bloomberg's debate performance tonight was perhaps the worst in the history of debates, and there have been some really bad ones,' Trump wrote. 'He was stumbling, bumbling and grossly incompetent. If this doesn't knock him out of the race, nothing will. Not so easy to do what I did!'
On Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI, the president weighed in again Thursday, quoting an ally and writing, 'The decision not to prosecute Andy McCabe is utterly inexplicable.'
And, like so much of what he does, the president managed to imbue even ostensibly serious events with a certain Trumpian panache. Speaking in Bakersfield, Calif., on Wednesday at what was billed as a roundtable to discuss water accessibility issues with rural voters, Trump claimed "" while offering no evidence "" that Bloomberg 'hates the farmer' and suggested that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) could very well emerge as the Democratic nominee for president.
'We'll have to start working on Crazy Bernie pretty soon,' he said. 
As the president's motorcade wound back to the airport there, en route to his next stop, a staffer enthused, 'Now that's how you do a rally-table!' "" coining a phrase to describe the rallylike feel Trump brought to the purported roundtable. 
On Thursday, Trump began his day addressing a graduation for prisoners here in Las Vegas. But after briefly extolling the virtues of redemption and second chances, Trump detoured to weigh in on the breaking news that Roger Stone, a longtime confidant, had been sentenced to three years and four months in prison for impeding a congressional investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
'I want the process to play out,' the president said. 'I think that's the best thing to do because I'd love to see Roger exonerated, and I'd love to see it happen because I personally think he was treated very unfairly.'
Trump's digression about Stone lasted several minutes, as he waxed poetic about how Stone is 'definitely a character' who 'everybody sort of knows' "" 'He's a little different, but those are sometimes the most interesting,' he mused "" and griped about the jury forewoman, who he claimed was a Never Trump activist. 
'Now, you wouldn't know about a bad jury?' Trump said, to appreciative laughter. 'Anybody here know about bad? No? These people know about more bad juries than everybody here, including the sheriff and the mayor and everybody.' 
Later, he again commiserated with the graduates "" newly released from prison and preparing to reenter society "" lamenting that everyone, even the president of the United States, has 'those days.'
'I mean, I didn't do anything wrong, and they impeached me a few weeks ago, right?' Trump asked, seeming bewildered. 'They impeached and I said, 'What happened? What did I do?' ' 
But he laughed, and then so did the crowd, because the president's good mood was infectious. 
And even Trump "" who has long raged and fumed over the impeachment inquiry against him, which he has repeatedly dismissed as a 'hoax' "" managed to look on the bright side. 
'The good news,' he said, 'my numbers went through the roof.'
The president's jovial mood continued straight through the end of his trip. Before heading back to Washington on Friday, Trump bemoaned that his western road show was coming a close.
'I have to get back to Washington and work,' he said at a rally in Las Vegas. 'I feel guilty. This is too much fun.'

Rep. Douglas A. Collins confirmed Wednesday that he will challenge Sen. Kelly Loeffler in Georgia, a move that sparked an intraparty Republican brawl between a top defender of President Trump and a business executive who was appointed to the post by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp.
'We're in for the Georgia Senate race down here,' Collins said during an appearance on Fox News from Atlanta. He said a more formal announcement would come later.
Collins, a four-term Republican from northern Georgia, had lobbied hard for the position when Sen. Johnny Isakson (R) announced his retirement last year. Kemp, however, chose Loeffler, against the advice of Trump, who backed Collins for the job.
Democrats are eyeing Georgia as a top 2020 target in their bid to retake the Senate. Since the race would constitute a special election to finish the final two years of Isakson's term, it would not include a primary, allowing multiple candidates of both parties to run for the position. 
That means, should Democrats unite behind one candidate, they could take advantage of a split in the GOP base. If no candidate receives more than a majority of the vote, the top two candidates would proceed to a runoff in January 2021.
During his television appearance, Collins said he was not concerned about the prospect of a Democrat prevailing.
'We just need to have a process that lets people decide,' he said. 'I look forward to an exchange of ideas, and I look forward to the election.'
The National Republican Senatorial Committee immediately made clear that it would support Loeffler and suggested that Collins's entrance into the race will hurt the prospects of other Republicans on the ticket and put Georgia in play in the presidential election.
'All he has done is put two Senate seats, multiple House seats, and Georgia's 16 electoral votes in play,' Kevin McLaughlin, the group's executive director, said in a statement. 'The NRSC stands firmly behind Sen. Kelly Loeffler and urges anyone who wants to re-elect President Trump, hold the GOP Senate majority, and stop socialism to do the same.'
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokeswoman Helen Kalla said the 'protracted brawl' between Loeffler and Collins would be 'a race to the right that reveals just how out of touch both are with Georgia voters.'
Republicans hold a 53-to-47 majority in the Senate but are defending more seats in the November election. Twenty-three GOP seats are on the ballot, including competitive races in Maine, Colorado and Arizona, and two in Georgia.
As the ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Collins has played an integral role in defending the president in the impeachment inquiry and on television. He is expected to have the backing of Trump's most aggressive supporters in the House, which could cause problems for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Both have backed Loeffler.
Loeffler is the chief executive of Bakkt, a subsidiary of Intercontinental Exchange, and co-owns the Atlanta Dream team of the WNBA. Her wealth allows her to self-fund her campaign.
But she has faced questions about whether she is conservative enough. On Monday, she accused Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) of trying to 'appease the left' in favoring witnesses in Trump's impeachment trial.

Finally, after three years of a presidency like none other, after street protests and raucous rallies, after awkward Thanksgiving dinners and broken friendships, after predictions of fractured democracy and celebrations of disrupted government, Americans will begin voting Monday.
They will vote on whether to turn away from smash-mouth politics or double down on a presidency that serves as a national blowoff valve. They will vote on whether they prefer a restoration of quieter governing or a wholesale change of the economic system. Above all, they will vote on whether they have had enough of President Trump "" and what to do about the direction of a country that all sides seem to agree faces significant trouble. 
When Iowa voters assemble in caucuses Monday evening to begin selecting presidential nominees, they will lead off a tightly packed parade of opportunities for Americans to state their verdict, including potentially bitter Democratic primaries culminating with the ultimate decision day on Nov. 3. 
This vote feels momentous, said Chris Buskirk, publisher of American Greatness, a conservative website, because Trump supporters 'hope that his reelection would finally legitimize him as president' and because the president's opponents see one last opportunity to get rid of the man they blame for exacerbating the country's divisions.
'But actually, I'm not optimistic that this election will solve anything,' Buskirk said. 'The divisions and stresses in the country may be worse than they were three years ago. It's almost a World War I mind-set now "" it's trench warfare, and you fight and scramble, and you get nowhere.'

In Iowa, for almost half a century the place where Americans begin the selection of presidents, the vote follows more than a year of intense campaigning. Ben Mowat, a 19-year-old from Colorado, chose to attend Drake University in Des Moines because he wanted to participate in the first-in-the-nation caucuses.
'It feels weird,' the freshman said. '2020 was this idea, and now it's here.'
Mowat, a volunteer for Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., said he has been driven by the prospect of ejecting Trump from the White House, but his excitement is tempered by a sense of responsibility and even, sometimes, the dread of a possible loss.
'I feel guilty when I'm not knocking doors,' he said.
Katie Cameron and Susan Tille, sisters who drove more than two hours from Livermore, Iowa, to attend Trump's rally in Des Moines on Thursday night, can't wait to vote to assure a second term for a president they say has given the economy a healthy boost.
'He's made a lot of positive changes,' said Tille, citing the growth in her 401(k) retirement account. 'He's done a lot of good for the economy.'
The sisters, who own a swimming pool store, want to send a message to Trump's opponents, telling them to stop fighting his every move. Cameron, whose 2016 vote for Trump was her first after a lifetime of steering clear of politics, said she has become more politically engaged in the past three years and considers herself a member of his base. She's no fan of some of Trump's tweets, but she said Americans have gotten used to 'how he communicates.'
By now, Frank Luntz figured that emotionally exhausted Americans would be hungry for unity, eager to embrace moderate messages and candidates who promised to find and claim common ground.
But Luntz, a longtime Republican consultant who conducts focus groups for news organizations, has been taking the temperatures of voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and other states, and he has found that 'people are desperate to vote, but the center has collapsed.' 
'They want the pitchfork message, not the unity message "" on both sides,' he said. 
'I wish I was wrong, but that fear of losing the country is deep and very emotional, on both sides,' Luntz added. 'The Trump side believes the left is trying to overturn democracy, and they will fight like hell to prevent it. And the Democrats have a disdain for Donald Trump that I've never seen. This isn't as bad as 1968, but it's pretty damn bad.'
In the '68 election, amid the Vietnam War, riots in American cities, political assassinations and a widespread sense that the country was spinning out of control, Richard Nixon won the presidency with chilling TV ads reflecting the fear of crime on dark city streets and a slogan that spoke to existential angst in the electorate: 'This time, vote like your whole world depended on it.'
A similar root anxiety about the future of the country and the planet pervades many voters' attitudes now.
Psychologists hear it from clients whether they are pro- or anti-Trump. 'It is a collective anxiety, and it is bipartisan,' said Washington therapist Elisabeth LaMotte. 'This is not a trusting time.'


On the anti-Trump side, La Motte sees people for whom politics is a significant driver of stress, 'but it's more complicated than that.'
'I hear much more concern about the environment and the future of the planet than I did two years ago,' she said. 
In the pro-Trump camp, she said: 'I hear people say they can't talk to certain people anymore. They're feeling isolated and frustrated, like there isn't permission to say what you think and feel, even to close friends.'
Many people have found it necessary to step away from the political fray: They limit their news diet, avoid talking to certain friends and get involved in community activities. Others have become more politically active.
'I tell people with political anxiety to do something productive or proactive, like volunteering for a campaign,' said Jennifer Contarino Panning, a clinical psychologist in Evanston, Ill. 'Voting is a crucial part of that; in 2018, I saw people find some relief in voting. It gave a sense of hope, and people are desperate for that.'
At a Buttigieg campaign event in Ankeny, Iowa, flight attendant Tamara Galeazzi, 52, could hardly wait for Monday's caucuses.
'It's almost like, 'Thank God it's almost over,' ' she said. 'Being in Iowa, we hear it from Day One until the caucus. When the commercials start slowing down the day after, it's like, 'Thank goodness, normalcy.' I'm nervous. Very nervous. This cannot go on for another four years. Just pick someone on our side, and stick with it. It's very nerve-racking.'
But for many people, the vote is neither a sufficient salve to the stress of the Trump era nor a big enough cudgel to break through to people on the other side of the divide.
'I work primarily with progressives, and they looked to the Mueller report and the impeachment trial for some relief, and then nothing changed,' Panning said. 'They felt hopeless and fatigued. Now they're really hesitant to believe in anything.'
LaMotte said her patients in Virginia, Maryland and the District have edged away from politics over the past few years, choosing instead to engage in their local communities, finding relief from the stress of national news in getting involved with a Girl Scouts group or volunteering at a neighborhood school. She sees hope in a growing resilience, even if it's not necessarily associated with voting.
Luntz has heard little such hope. The voters he has been surveying 'have weaponized grievances and are seeking revenge against the other side,' he said. 'Whatever the result of the election, half the country will believe America has been saved, and half will say it's been destroyed. These two Americas do not eat together, do not play together. They say it's too late for unity. They have simply lost trust.'


Some voters who crave a unifying message fear that their fellow Americans are too frustrated or exhausted to bring about change. Austin Bayliss, 32, sees worrying signs that antipathy to Trump may not be enough to carry Democrats to victory. That recipe failed four years ago, he said, 'and sometimes I feel like I'm right back there.
'What are the Democrats going to do to close the enthusiasm gap?' said Bayliss, who runs a professional wrestling company near Iowa City. 'You'd think the chance to hit back at Trump would be enough, but I went to Joe Biden's event yesterday in Muscatine, and there were 60 people there and 45 media. I was the youngest person there.'
The enthusiasm gap Bayliss worried about was palpable at Trump's rally Thursday. Martha Ahrens, a retired court system worker who traveled to the event from Boone, Iowa, said the Democrats' persistent attacks on Trump have bolstered her support of the president, who she said can be 'arrogant' but has done well with the economy.
Like a number of others at the Trump rally, she said she's more excited to vote this year than she was in 2016. 'Everybody is so tired of everything. They're tired of the Democrats constantly since he was elected going after him,' she said. 'It's just one thing after another, you know, instead of focusing on what they're going to do as president.'

Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat who represents suburbs outside Richmond, unseated a conservative Republican in 2018 and spends many weekends meeting with constituents, making a particular effort to sit down with pro-Trump voters. She sees a divide so deep that one election cannot heal it.
'We used to debate ideas,' she said. 'Now it's just, 'You think this, therefore you're bad,' a zero-sum game, us versus them. We've been moving to this place where our entertainment is disagreement.'
Nonetheless, the congresswoman says many voters this year 'want a restoration of, just, decency, just respecting people.' To get there, however, will take many one-on-one encounters, not just a political platform and a bunch of ads. 
'I walked into a place, and a woman started wagging her finger at me, saying, 'I love Donald Trump,'-' Spanberger recalled. 'I said, 'Ma'am, a lot of people do.' She saw me and expected a fight. I don't know that she wanted a fight, and that's an important distinction. But I changed the tone and acknowledged what she said, and she softened, and we had a really good conversation.'
The yearning for a return to a less combative politics is palpable among many Iowans who plan to attend the Democratic caucuses. Mary Amborn, 78, from Ottumwa contemplated traveling to Des Moines on Thursday to protest at the Trump rally there, but she decided instead to stay closer to home and hear Biden speak at the American Legion Hall.
Amborn, who is leaning toward voting for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) but was still considering Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), said she's doing well but feels compelled to vote against Trump on behalf of her 26 grandchildren and great-grandchildren, including three who served in the military and one who is a homeless veteran 'who can teach college calculus, but he can't keep a home.'
'I am very, very happy,' she said. 'I have a great retirement. I have wonderful medical. I worked the factory for years and years at John Deere. Now, the folks who have my job, when they retire, they will not have medical. And so I am worried about those that follow me. If I get it wrong, my 26 grandkids "" they will suffer.' She wiped away tears. 'I can hardly talk about it. I'm voting for them.'
After a 2016 election in which the long-standing leadership in both parties seemed out of sync with voters' frustrations and concerns, Luntz sees a similar disconnect developing this time: 'The Trump campaign seems overconfident,' he said. 'Trump energizes people at his rallies but not beyond that hardcore group. They don't understand the fatigue that some Trump voters feel. People are tired of having to defend Trump's language.'
Luntz doesn't see Democratic candidates clicking with voters either. 'The Democratic message is so over-caffeinated against Trump that it's overwhelming people who are already suffering from insomnia,' he said. 'I have no idea what's going to happen.'

The president said he didn't require a test, then took one
After President Trump attended a conservative conference where a man tested positive for coronavirus, he said he was unconcerned.
After he came into contact with congressmen who were exposed to the virus, he said it was no big deal. 
And after a Brazilian official with whom he posed for a photograph at his Mar-a-Lago estate contracted the disease, Trump shrugged it off, saying at a Friday news conference that he did not need to be tested. Then, a few minutes later, he said he probably would get tested. Hours after that, however, the White House emailed out a statement from Trump's physician that said the president was fine and did not need a test.
But on Saturday, Trump said he was tested Friday night, apparently as a precaution, and he told reporters his body temperature was ""totally normal."" Hours later, the White House physician announced Trump tested negative for the virus.
Trump's announcement and test results capped days of evasiveness by the White House and Trump's own refusal to submit to the same rules and standards his administration is asking the rest of the nation to adopt to slow the spread of the pandemic.
His reluctance to get tested also fed into criticism that Trump was not taking the virus outbreak seriously enough, even as he praised the job he and his administration have done.
""The results are very, very good, and when you compare this with what is happening around the world, we are very proud of our people,"" he said Saturday.
Trump's testing announcement appeared to catch some aides off guard, including Vice President Pence, especially given that the president's physician released a memo hours earlier stating that the risk for Trump was ""low.""
The abrupt pivot came as the White House appeared to be enacting new screening measures, announcing that anyone in proximity to Trump or Pence would have their temperatures taken. White House correspondents were screened ahead of the briefing, and one was turned away after aides said the journalist had a fever reading of above 100.4 degrees on three successive measurements from a noncontact thermometer.
Whether the moves were taken to demonstrate additional seriousness in the face of the global pandemic or over fears for Trump's health, they came after weeks in which the president sought to play down the risks and touted the nation's relatively low, although quickly growing, number of confirmed cases and deaths. Experts said they expect the cases to grow exponentially, even as the administration has implemented new travel restrictions and other measures. 
In recent weeks, as cities and states began banning large gatherings, airlines and cruises were grounded, professional sports leagues canceled their seasons, and schools shut down, Trump appeared determined to carry on with business as usual, in an apparent effort to bolster public confidence. He has continued to shake hands with supporters and aides, met with more than 1,000 donors at his private Mar-a-Lago resort the previous weekend, and has interacted with several congressmen who later self-quarantined, as well as the Brazilian delegation that has multiple officials who have tested positive for coronavirus.
Experts have called Trump's behavior a risky and irresponsible example for a nation in the midst of a burgeoning health crisis and amid the exhortations of medical experts that all Americans should practice social distancing to help slow the spread of the virus.
Asked Saturday if his shift to more prudent personal conduct aimed to demonstrate greater urgency, Trump insisted that ""this was urgent for me right from the beginning,"" citing his early decision to ban travel from China, where the illness originated.
He said he agreed it would be wise not to shake hands and that he had long viewed the practice as unsanitary, but he explained that it was difficult for him to break the habit since becoming president.
""Political people, they walk up to me and want to shake my hand,"" Trump said. ""It's sort of a natural reflex. We're all getting out of it. All of us have that problem.""
The president spent the previous weekend at his private resort in Palm Beach, Fla., that was teeming with an eclectic mix of visitors: donors attending the annual Republican National Committee retreat, a delegation led by Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, and family and friends celebrating the birthday of Kimberly Guilfoyle, the former Fox News host who is dating Donald Trump Jr. 
Among the guests were Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, as well as Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who both self-quarantined last week - Gaetz after flying home to Washington with Trump aboard Air Force One.
""It was louder and wilder than usual,"" said one person who was there and spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private scene.
Graham said there were up to 500 people at the birthday celebration alone. 
""It's hard to tell who you've met and who you didn't,"" he said in an interview, as guests assess their potential exposure risk after the fact. 
Trump arrived on March 6 after spending the day touring tornado-damaged sections of Nashville and visiting the Centers for Disease Control headquarters in Atlanta for a coronavirus update.
At his resort that evening, Trump told the donors that ""nobody is blaming us"" for the virus, according to an account from another guest who asked for anonymity to quote the president's private remarks. Despite big drops in the stock markets, the president seemed eager to spin the potential upside - that the closing of borders around the world would promote his ""America First"" agenda.
""Certain industries are going to be hit very hard - cruise ships and airlines and certain industries,"" the president said, according to the guest. ""But at the same time, I've been saying for a long time people should stay in our country and travel in our country, and that's going to happen.""
Observers said Trump appeared to be in a good mood and exhibited no personal concerns about the virus, despite the large number of people in the facility.
Since the weekend, however, at least four people who were at the resort have tested positive for the coronavirus. That includes three Brazilians who interacted with Trump - Bolsonora's communications secretary Fabio Wajngarten, who took a photo with him, and two who attended the dinner, including acting Brazilian ambassador Nestor Forster Jr.
RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, who led the donors conference at the resort, confirmed to The Washington Post on Saturday that she has been tested for the virus and is awaiting the results while in self-quarantine in Michigan after exhibiting flu-like symptoms. 
To national security experts, the scene at Mar-a-Lago raised flags about the ad hoc nature of Trump's interactions at his private venues and the relatively unregulated access that guests have to him. 
""That's how Trump does business among friends, and he considers Bolsonaro and his delegation as a group of friends,"" said Fernando Cutz, who served as Western Hemisphere director at the National Security Council before leaving in 2018. ""Bolsonaro's son was there. Trump likes that. He feels connected to the thought of the children of the president being involved. That plays a role in it. He was acting in a very unguarded, friendly, Mar-a-Lago-type way.""
In a photo posted to Wajngarten's social media, Trump and Pence are seen posing with the Bolsonaro aide and a Brazilian businessman, with the president clutching a ""Make Brazil Great Again"" hat. 
Wajngarten initially dismissed Brazilian news reports that he tested positive, but the government acknowledged that he had. Bolsonaro's office said the Brazilian president tested negative.
""There was somebody who they say has it. I have no idea who he is,"" Trump said at a White House news conference Friday. ""I haven't seen the pictures. I take hundreds of pictures a day. That night I was taking hundreds of pictures so I don't know."" 
Brazilian officials and other guests said the White House asked basic screening questions of at least some who were in proximity to the president, including where they had traveled recently and whether they felt ill. But it does not appear that guests had their temperatures taken. Experts have said that those infected with coronavirus can be asymptomatic and still pass the illness to others.
After the dinner, some in the Brazilian delegation joined Trump and other U.S. officials at Guilfoyle's birthday party. Trump offered a toast to the group for their ""energy."" Ivanka Trump and Kushner also gave toasts, according to one of the people who was at the resort, and Graham gave a speech lauding Guilfoyle for being the political opposite of liberal Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). 
In all, Trump attended at least four fundraisers throughout the weekend, said a person familiar with his schedule, and he introduced some donors to Bolsonaro.
On Friday, Trump's campaign sent an email to donors alerting them that more than one guest had tested positive for coronavirus and urging them to consult doctors if they show symptoms. 
The day after the dinner with Bolsonaro, Trump again addressed the GOP donors.
""We've done good,"" he said of the administration's coronavirus response, according to the guest who relayed his remarks to The Post. ""But no matter what we do, it will never be good for the press. Because they're using this to try and win an election.""

REPUBLICANS WEIGH CALL FOR WITNESSES 
Amid new revelations, trial set to start next week
The House delivered two articles of impeachment to the Senate on Wednesday, laying the groundwork for President Trump's trial as Republicans rallied behind the idea of parity between the two parties in possibly calling witnesses. 
The impeachment managers' brief ceremonial journey across the Capitol "" a month after the House voted to impeach Trump "" relinquished Democratic control over a process that is expected to end in the president's election-year acquittal by the Republican-led Senate. The procession, which solemnly set in motion the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history, capped a rancorous day of partisan conflict and heightened the pressure on Senate moderates, whose views on seeking additional evidence after unmitigated stonewalling by the White House will define the scope of Trump's trial.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) declared that Trump was guilty of 'an assault on the Constitution of the United States' and rejected criticism that his impeachment was politically motivated.
'We take it very seriously,' Pelosi said on the House floor. 'It's not personal. It's not political. It's not partisan. It's patriotic.'
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) attacked the House's inquiry as 'unprecedented and dangerous' and accused Democrats of 'pure factionalism.' 
'This has been naked partisanship all along,' McConnell said on the Senate floor. '. . . We had a 230-year tradition of rejecting purely political impeachments. It died last month.' 
As tensions increased across the Capitol, new evidence of Trump's pressure campaign toward Ukraine for his political benefit added urgency to Democrats' push for more witness testimony and documents during the trial phase. 
Records from Lev Parnas, an associate of Trump personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, showed Ukraine's top prosecutor offering damaging information related to former vice president Joe Biden if the Trump administration recalled the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. They also revealed claims from a Republican congressional candidate that he had the then-ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, under physical and electronic surveillance. 
The impeachment charges "" abuse of power and obstruction of Congress "" center on the allegation that Trump withheld military aid and a White House meeting to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, including Biden. 
Pelosi argued that the revelations proved the wisdom of her decision to withhold the articles for a month "" a gambit that did not fulfill her primary goals of ensuring witness testimony or forcing McConnell to outline terms for the trial. 
'Time has been our friend in all of this, because it has yielded incriminating evidence, more truth into the public domain,' the speaker said at a Capitol Hill news conference. 
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), one of the moderates whose views on further evidence could shape the trial, held a different view. 
'Doesn't that suggest that the House did an incomplete job, then?' she said. 
The records were released Tuesday night by the four House committees that ran the impeachment inquiry "" just as Senate Republicans began coalescing around the idea of each party having the opportunity to call witnesses, should enough moderates agree with Democrats that more evidence is needed. 
A day after Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) proposed the idea of 'reciprocity' "" which would enable Trump's legal team to call Hunter Biden if Democrats get enough votes to summon former national security adviser John Bolton, for example "" two moderate Republicans signaled they were open to the idea.
'The idea that only the House managers should be able to call witnesses is one I reject,' said Collins, who has insisted on a vote on whether to call witnesses. 'It clearly should be both sides, both sides should have the opportunity. But as far as approving specific witnesses, I haven't heard the case yet.'
Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said Wednesday that he would be amenable to each side choosing 'which witnesses they want to appear, as opposed to going in and saying, 'Well, I want that one, I want that one.' . . . I think I expect both sides to be able to put together their own list of demands.' 
Should moderates decide witnesses are necessary, it would require four Republicans to join with all members of the Democratic caucus to vote in favor.
Privately, McConnell and other senior Republicans still hope a majority of senators will think they have heard enough "" after days of arguments from the House impeachment managers, the president's defense counsel and several rounds of questioning "" to move to a vote to determine whether Trump should be removed from office. 
Several closely watched Republican senators declined to say whether they believed Hunter Biden was worthy of summoning to the impeachment trial. 
Biden served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma, and Trump and Giuliani have promoted an unfounded theory that Joe Biden, while vice president, tried to stop a corruption investigation of the company to protect his son. Hunter Biden is no longer on Burisma's board.
'I'm not going to opine on that at this stage,' Romney said of whether Hunter Biden's testimony is warranted. 'I think each side should be able to choose the people they want to hear from.' 
'You're asking me to prejudge the evidence,' Collins said. 'I don't know which witnesses we're going to need until I hear the case.' 
'I feel like I'm just going to print a sign "" I don't know whether I'm going to have it on my back or on my chest "" saying there will be a time in the process where we will have an opportunity to make a determination as to what further information we need, whether it is from Hunter Biden or Ambassador Bolton or Lisa Murkowski,' said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). 'So until that point in time, I'm not thinking about each individual witness.' 
Democrats were unanimous in their view that Hunter Biden's testimony would be irrelevant. 
'Any trial judge in this country would rule such a witness as irrelevant and inadmissible,' said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), one of the impeachment managers approved by the chamber Wednesday. 
'If someone is accused of robbing a bank, witnesses who say, 'We saw him run into the bank. We saw him someplace else,' are relevant,' Nadler said. 'A witness who says, 'He committed forgery on some other document,' is not relevant to the bank robbery charge. That's the distinction.'
'The Senate is on trial, as well as the president,' with impeachment, Nadler said. 
The transmission of the articles marked the end of the four-week standoff between Pelosi and McConnell "" though an array of proxy battles over timing and protocol highlighted the lingering resentments. 
The House voted Wednesday to send the Senate the two articles and to approve seven Democratic lawmakers to serve as impeachment managers, or prosecutors. 
That group is notably smaller and more diverse than the team of lawmakers tapped by House Republicans to present the case during President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999, when all 13 managers were white men. Pelosi's team includes three women and two African Americans. 
The resolution was approved 228 to 193, breaking largely along party lines.
The procedural formalities of the trial are expected to begin Thursday with the reading of the articles; the swearing-in of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who will preside; and the swearing-in of the senators as jurors. After that, the Senate is expected to recess for the weekend; the trial will begin in earnest Tuesday, according to McConnell. 
The White House signaled Wednesday that it does not expect the Senate impeachment trial to last longer than two weeks, casting acquittal as a foregone conclusion and arguing that Trump's team will present 'a very strong case for the president.'
Asked whether Trump would go ahead with plans to deliver his State of the Union address on Feb. 4 even if the impeachment trial hasn't concluded by then, a senior administration official told reporters, 'I think it's extraordinarily unlikely that we'd be going beyond two weeks.'
'We think that this case is overwhelming for the president, and the Senate's not going to be having any need to be taking that amount of time on this,' said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about internal White House deliberations and discussed the matter on the condition of anonymity. 
In the House, debate was animated over the resolution to send the articles and approve managers. Pelosi emphasized that Trump is 'impeached for life,' regardless of what happens in the Senate. 
'The president is not above the law,' the speaker said. 'He will be held accountable. He has been held accountable. He has been impeached. He has been impeached forever. They can never erase that.'

Seven days after his closed-door testimony in the House impeachment hearings "" seven days after his face was plastered across every screen in America "" William B. Taylor Jr. found himself in Mariupol, some 5,000-miles from Washington and just 12-miles from the front lines of a war between the Ukrainian military and Russian-backed separatists.
The setting was an economic conference sponsored by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that spoke volumes about the country's uncertain state. The nearest airport to Mariupol had been destroyed in the fighting. For many of the attendees, the fastest route to the conference was a brutal 18-hour train ride.
Among the conference's big attractions was a chance to pitch to Ukraine's president ideas for sparking the economy. Each of the hundreds of attendees got two minutes.
The other big lure was Taylor. Well-wishers swarmed him. The governor of the war-scarred Luhansk region, still partially controlled by Kremlin-backed separatists, told him that he had read all his prepared testimony and quoted back a few of the kind words Taylor had said about Ukraine.
By early January, Taylor was back home in the Washington suburbs trying to make sense of the surreal swirl of his time in Ukraine, his testimony before Congress and the rancorous aftermath.
His mind turned to Mariupol and then to President Trump, whose antipathy toward Ukraine was, for him, among the biggest mysteries of all.
'I'm trying to figure out where [it] came from,' he said, 'this deep suspicion of this little country. I mean it's 44-million people. It's not that big a deal.'
Trump has emerged from his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial aggrieved and triumphant. Those who testified against him "" a mix of political appointees and career bureaucrats "" are trying to figure out their place in the Washington left behind following his acquittal.
Last week, Trump banished Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman from the White House and suggested he should face disciplinary action from the military for testifying against him. Vindman returned to the Pentagon, which has said it isn't investigating him.
Marie Yovanovitch, forced last spring from her position as ambassador in Kyiv by Trump, left the government and delivered a powerful speech lamenting the costs to the State Department and America's standing in the world. 'An amoral, keep-'em-guessing foreign policy that substitutes threats, fear and confusion for trust cannot work over the long haul,' she warned on Wednesday.
The aftermath for Taylor, who was hurriedly dispatched to Ukraine as an emergency fill-in for Yovanovitch, has been quieter. He's currently taking time off, catching up with his family and considering his next move.
Like Yovanovitch, he has had plenty of time to ponder the damage. Taylor dedicated his life to service within the vast foreign policy institutions that the United States built following the war. Since his days as an infantry officer in Vietnam, he lived by their rules, which he saw as 'cumbersome, but thorough,' a necessity for a great power whose routine decisions could alter the course of millions of lives in faraway places like Kyiv or Mariupol.
Trump was the first president Taylor had served who held these institutions in contempt. He doubted their loyalty and distrusted their expertise, often preferring the musings of television commentators or his conspiracy-minded personal attorney to the experts on his White House staff and in his intelligence briefings.
Most Americans describe Trump in Manichaean terms "" he's brilliant or terrible, compassionate or irredeemably cruel. To Taylor, he was beyond his comprehension.
'I don't understand the president,' he said. 'I can't get in his head to see what motivates him and what he thinks.'
Sometimes, he wondered if it was even worth trying.
'It's no longer hypothetical'
Last spring, Taylor was out of the government and serving as the executive vice president at the U.S. Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan think tank established by Congress, when George Kent, a former State Department colleague and future impeachment inquiry witness, asked if he might 'hypothetically' be interested in serving as the ambassador to Ukraine. Yovanovitch was fighting a smear campaign fomented by self-interested Ukrainian politicians and the president's personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
The following day, Kent called him back. 'It's no longer hypothetical,' he said.
Taylor's wife, Deborah, urged him to reject the job. A big worry was her husband's reputation. Nearly five decades of government service had instilled in him a respect for his chain of command and an instinct for compromise. Both were potentially lethal traits inside the Trump administration.
'Bill's Achilles' heel "" and everyone has them "" is wanting to find agreement,' she said. 'I was concerned he'd sully himself. . . . He passed that test.'
Shortly before he left for Ukraine, Taylor got a lesson in how power works in Trump's Washington. In May, he learned from officials in the White House that Trump had refused to sign a letter congratulating Ukraine's president on his resounding election victory.
Taylor raised his concerns about Trump with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
'I think your boss doesn't like Ukraine,' Taylor said, still doubtful that he would take the job.
'You're right, and it's my job to turn him around,' Pompeo replied, according to several U.S. officials familiar with the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly.
Taylor then mentioned the unsigned letter. 'Find out about this,' Pompeo told his staff. Within 36-hours, a new letter had been drafted and signed by the president.
Taylor tucked a copy of it in a briefcase and headed off to Ukraine.
Patriotic and fragile Ukraine
Each morning at 8:30 in Kyiv, Ukrainian troops gather in formation outside the Ministry of Defense. A soldier rings a bell. Shots are fired. An officer then reads the names of the Ukrainian soldiers killed on that day over the course of the country's six-year war with Russian-backed separatists.
When Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) visited Kyiv last fall, Taylor took them to the ceremony. He wanted them to see a bit of Ukraine as he saw it: patriotic, fragile and under daily assault from Vladimir Putin's Russia.
Taylor arrived in Ukraine in June 2019, just weeks after Zelensky won the presidency in a landslide. He believed that the 2013 Ukrainian revolution, followed by Russia's invasion a few months later and annexation of Crimea, had created a new sense of solidarity in the country. Corruption was still rampant. The war had ravaged the economy. But, there was a hope for Ukraine that wasn't present when he left in 2009, after concluding his stint as ambassador under President George W. Bush.
'There's an idealism, a spirit of youth, a charm represented by this new president,' he said. 'It's a chance. A real chance, which you don't get very often in the history of countries.'
About a month after Taylor arrived in Kyiv, he learned via a routine conference call with Washington that Trump had ordered a hold on $391-million in aid to Ukraine. Initially, he assumed it was a misunderstanding.
Weeks passed, and the hold remained in place. Kurt Volker, the administration's special representative to Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, a Trump megadonor serving as ambassador to the European Union, blamed the problem on Giuliani. Both later became impeachment witnesses.
Their fix was to broker a deal that might get Giuliani to back off. Giuliani was looking for dirt on former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who had been paid between $50,000 and $100,000 a month to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. The Ukrainians wanted an Oval Office visit for Zelensky.
Taylor urged Zelensky's top advisers to keep their distance. 'Rudy is up to no good. If you think he's doing this because he cares about Ukraine, you're wrong,' he warned Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Zelensky.
On Aug. 27, national security adviser John Bolton visited Kyiv for a meeting with Zelensky, who still did not know the aid was frozen. Before Bolton left, Taylor asked for five minutes with him at his hotel. Taylor worried that if the aid freeze became public, it would undermine Zelensky and strengthen Putin. Bolton asked Taylor to make the case for the aid to Pompeo in a cable.
'It'll get noticed,' he promised.
In the cable's last line, Taylor made it clear that if the hold wasn't lifted, he wouldn't be able to support the policy and would resign. It was the first time in almost 50-years of government service that he had threatened to quit.
At that point, Taylor had no idea a CIA whistleblower had accused Trump of using 'the power of his office to solicit interference . . . in the 2020 U.S. election.' The complaint, emailed to the intelligence community's inspector general on Aug.-12, was a bomb ready to explode.
A request to leave
By early January, it was clear that Trump was most likely going to be acquitted. In Kyiv, Taylor got a glimpse of the likely aftermath. He was finishing his tour as acting ambassador and preparing for a Pompeo visit on Jan.-2.
A senior aide to the secretary informed him that Pompeo wanted to meet with the Ukrainian president in Kyiv one-on-one, without embassy staff to take notes.
'I'm going to protest,' Taylor told officials in Washington. 'I'm going to become a pain on this.' Taylor worried that such an arrangement would signal that Pompeo didn't trust his embassy staff. Ukrainians might conclude that they couldn't trust the embassy either.
In Kyiv, Taylor quickly realized that he "" not the embassy "" was the problem.
Taylor hadn't spoken to Pompeo since his meeting in May, before taking the job. But, he knew that his testimony had upset the president, who blasted him as a 'never Trumper,' a subset of Republicans Trump described as 'human scum.'
So, Taylor proposed that his deputy accompany the secretary to the meeting. Pompeo's staff agreed. Then they asked Taylor to leave his position six days early so that he would not be in charge when Pompeo arrived in Kyiv.
Last month, Taylor returned to Washington and the modest bungalow that he and his wife bought in 1983 as he was beginning his government career.
Scattered amid a lifetime of mementos from postings in Afghanistan, Iraq, Ukraine and Israel were reminders of the last few tumultuous months.
On the coffee table by the front door, there was a picture of Taylor testifying before Congress "" a gift from Yovanovitch. Upstairs, a block of wood with the message 'Stand Your Ground,' etched in Russian, sat on Taylor's desk. He had been given it a few days earlier by another impeachment witness.
At the dining room table, Deborah, a biblical scholar, was translating a text from ancient Greek. A bracelet from Ukraine bearing an anti-Putin epithet dangled from her wrist.
Taylor had caught snippets of the Senate trial in the car. His wife, who had watched 'every frigging second' of the House hearings, was avoiding it.
'I am not learning anything,' she said of the Senate proceedings. 'I am just experiencing the emotion.'
Earlier that day, Pompeo made his visit to Kyiv, which had been delayed a month. Taylor was pleased to see a photograph of Kristina Kvien, the acting ambassador, with Pompeo and the Ukrainian foreign minister.
After his meeting, Pompeo pledged that America's support for Ukraine 'would not waver.' To back up that promise, the Trump administration said it was budgeting another $400-million in aid to Ukraine for 2021. The move had strong bipartisan backing from Congress.
Some former officials, such as Yovanovitch, were warning of the damage wrought by Trump. 'Right now, the State Department is in trouble,' she said.
Taylor tended to focus on how well Washington's institutions had held up, despite the battering.
Trump might still despise Kyiv. His strange affection for Putin almost certainly remained. At the highest levels of government, senior officials still had to work around Trump's grudges, impulses and rages.
But for all the chaos of the past few months, Taylor noted that the administration's official policy toward Ukraine and Russia "" articulated by Pompeo, supported by Congress and codified in White House strategy documents "" remained essentially unchanged. Ukraine was still America's ally. Russia was still an adversary. This was one more lesson of the impeachment saga. In much of institutional Washington "" Bill Taylor's Washington "" the president was strangely the outsider.

Moments after the Senate voted Wednesday to acquit President Trump, hundreds of people from across the country stormed onto the Capitol grounds with hand-drawn signs and bright orange letters lit up in lights that spelled out one word: Coverup. 
They were angry and exhausted. As the sun set on the Capitol dome, some wiped away tears. 
They carried posters declaring, 'Trump is guilty' and 'GOP coverup.' 
Some offered gratitude to the lone Republican "" Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah "" who defied his party to vote to convict Trump on a charge of abuse of power alongside Senate Democrats, waving signs that said, 'Thank you, Senator Romney.'
The protest, one of hundreds across the country on Wednesday dubbed 'Reject the Coverup,' was meant to showcase Americans' disapproval of the Senate's decision to acquit the president without calling for witnesses to testify at his trial. 
Organizers and speakers tried to focus on the future, the 2020 presidential election and upcoming Senate races.
'Today is a sad day, a devastating day,' Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) told the crowd. 'But we will recover, we will rebuild . . . We the people are powerful.'
Protesters shouted their agreement.
'Vote them out!' the crowd chanted. 'Trump, Pence out now!'
It was one of several demonstrations in the District organized in response to the Senate's vote to acquit Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
Trump was impeached by the House after an investigation into allegations that he withheld military aid and a White House meeting to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, including former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
'While this is the conclusion of one particular process, this is also a moment where President Trump was, for one of the few times in his life, held accountable for his actions,' said Jesse Littlewood, vice president of campaigns at Common Cause and an organizer of the evening demonstration.
Several hours earlier, tourists in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda on Wednesday stopped taking pictures of the busts and paintings on the ornate sandstone walls to take in another sight: 10 women who locked arms and demanded that senators vote to remove Trump from office.

The group, which broke off from an early-afternoon tour of the building, sat beneath the dome as a tour guide in a red jacket tried to draw visitors' attention to the bronze and marble statues of famous Americans and former presidents.
'Trump is guilty,' the women's chants echoed through the hall as about two dozen supporters "" wearing black shirts with messages such as 'Trump leads a mob of thugs' and 'Remove Trump' "" raised their fists in solidarity.
Bright flashes and the sound of camera shutters bounced off the walls as other tour groups were briefly caught in the commotion: Capitol Police officers encircling the demonstration as the women shouted in unison, 'Acquittal is a coverup.'
'Thank you,' said one woman from Minnesota. Others shook their heads in silence.
The 10 women were charged with obstructing and incommoding the Rotunda walkway, a misdemeanor. It is illegal to protest in the building.
'I think the president is a danger to democracy and a danger to America, and I wanted to give one last plea to Republican senators before the vote to honor their oath,' said Jennifer Fisher, 60, who was arrested Wednesday. Fisher, who came from New York for the demonstration, said she had never been arrested. 
'It just feels like the Ministry of Magic has been taken over by the followers of Voldemort,' she said. 'I felt like I had to be here, to say something.'
The 10 women were released by D.C. police within hours. Many went straight back to the Capitol to stand in protest on the East Lawn. 

Littlewood said having hundreds of people standing outside Congress moments after the impeachment vote will send a symbolic message to legislators about the disappointment many Americans feel.
'This is our opportunity to say we're not going to let Trump run roughshod over our democratic process, that even if the GOP gives [him] a pass, we're not going to,' he said.

Visit is another example of Giuliani promoting personal causes 

Rudolph W. Giuliani was huddled with a top Ukrainian official at a luxury Madrid hotel in August, on a mission to push for investigations sought by President Trump. But first, Giuliani made a personal ask on behalf of a former client in Ukraine. 
Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko, for whom Giuliani has said he did consulting work, was on the verge of being fired by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky from a separate post as the appointed head of the city administration, a move that would greatly reduce his power. Giuliani urged a Zelensky adviser at the Madrid conclave to retain Klitschko, according to Lev Parnas, a former Giuliani associate.
'Rudy told him, 'Make sure Klitschko stays,' ' Parnas, who participated in the meeting, told The Washington Post in an interview. 
The following month, Giuliani took that same message to Twitter. 'Reducing the power of Mayor Klitschko of Kiev was a very bad sign,' Giuliani wrote, implicitly chastising Zelensky, adding that the mayor, a former boxing champion, 'is very much admired and respected in the US.' 
Zelensky backed off the threat, and nearly six months later, Klitschko remains in his post.
The Zelensky adviser in Madrid, Andriy Yermak, confirmed in a statement that he and Giuliani discussed Klitschko but denied that Trump's personal attorney applied any pressure on Klitschko's behalf. Yermak said Giuliani told him he was not trying to influence him.
The previously unreported account of Giuliani's discussions with the Ukrainian government about Klitschko provides another example of how the former New York mayor has used his perch as a close adviser to Trump to promote his personal interests.
In 2017, Giuliani sought to persuade Trump and other top administration officials to adopt positions advocated by Turkey, the same year he was working as a lawyer for a politically connected gold trader from that country who was facing federal criminal charges. In September, he urged Justice Department officials not to pursue a case against a wealthy Venezuelan energy executive who had hired him as a private attorney.
Giuliani's activities have spurred deep unease among senior administration officials, who have said they are unclear about when he is working on behalf of his other private clients and when he is working in the interests of the president. 
Attorney General William P. Barr counseled Trump in several conversations in the fall that Giuliani had become a liability, The Post previously reported.
And, in a draft manuscript of his upcoming book, former national security adviser John Bolton claims that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo feared that Giuliani might be working on behalf of a client when he sought the removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, according to a person familiar with the project. 
Giuliani told The Post that he has been careful to define his role as a private lawyer for Trump, not as a representative of the U.S. government, and chalked up scrutiny of his work to resentment.
'People hate me' for representing Trump, Giuliani wrote in a text message. 'The better you do the more bitter they become.'
He noted that the president 'is not my only client or customer,' adding, 'I still have opinions and work I need to do and it's not expanded as a result of representing the President, it has of necessity declined so I can pay attention to my work for him.'
'What they are saying is true of any private lawyer for President,' he wrote, adding: 'There is nothing to suggest that it has affected my work.'
Asked about the Madrid meeting, Giuliani called Parnas, his former associate and client, a 'proven liar.' Parnas, who is facing federal campaign finance charges, began speaking publicly about his role in the Ukraine pressure campaign in recent weeks "" drawing attacks from Trump allies, who say he is seeking to reduce his criminal exposure.
Giuliani declined to say whether he sought to intervene on Klitschko's behalf, describing the boxer turned mayor as 'a good friend of mine over the years.' 
The balance of power at the Madrid meeting was decidedly in Giuliani's favor. At the time, Zelensky's team was urgently seeking a White House meeting with Trump to send a critical signal to Russia, which has been fueling a proxy war in Ukraine's east for more than five years. And days earlier, in a phone call with Zelensky, Trump had made it clear to the new Ukrainian president that he needed to work with Giuliani to win White House support.
Zelensky has still not secured his White House meeting. 'I would be ready to go tomorrow,' the Ukrainian leader said Friday during a joint appearance in Kyiv with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

'A great friend of Ukraine'
Giuliani has had business ties in Ukraine for at least a decade, work that brought him into contact with prominent Ukrainian figures and politicians, including Klitschko.
A three-time world heavyweight champion known as 'Dr. Ironfist' because of his doctorate in sports science, Klitschko is one of the most famous Ukrainian athletes. When he entered politics, the boxing legend said he wanted to bring the living standards he saw in the West to his native Ukraine.
In a previous interview with The Post, Giuliani said he was hired in 2008 as a political consultant to Klitschko, who at the time was making what would be a failed bid to become Kyiv's mayor. 
During a successful run for mayor in 2014, Klitschko hired Giuliani's consulting firm to advise him on combating corruption and crime in Ukraine's capital, Giuliani told The Post. 
Klitschko has offered contradictory accounts of their arrangement, saying in a statement last week that he never had a 'business relationship' with Giuliani. The Kyiv mayor also described Giuliani 'as a great friend of Ukraine and one of the most successful mayors in the world.'
Klitschko said that he first encountered Giuliani in 2006 during a visit the former New York mayor made to Ukraine. Since then, they have met many times in New York and Kyiv, Klitschko said.
'Considering our good personal relationship, sometimes I ask for his advice on municipal issues,' he said.
Klitschko, a leader of Ukraine's pro-Western revolution, won reelection as Kyiv's mayor in 2015 with more than 65-percent of the vote. Like his political ally, former president Petro Poroshenko, he entered office amid high expectations that he would crack down on the corruption and cronyism that have characterized Ukrainian politics. 
While Kyiv has largely prospered, and many regard Klitschko as an improvement over his predecessors, his detractors say that a number of the problems that have plagued the capital persist: poor delivery of services, substandard infrastructure and questionable construction projects. 
They also accuse him of relying on high-profile projects "" like a $10-million glass-and-concrete bridge in the city's center "" instead of focusing on substantive reforms. 
Klitschko's political future was thrown into doubt in April when Zelensky "" a comedian and political neophyte fresh off playing the president in a 'Veep'-style Ukrainian television series "" trounced Poroshenko in Ukraine's elections. 
In addition to functioning as Kyiv's elected mayor, Klitschko simultaneously has been serving as head of the Kyiv City State Administration under a deal he brokered with Poroshenko. That influential position, akin to city manager, is appointed by Ukraine's president.
Ousting Klitschko from the post would help Zelensky's team consolidate control over the Ukrainian capital, by far the country's most important power center. 
Zelensky informed Klitschko during a meeting in early July last year that he wanted to once again separate the positions and install his own appointee as head of the Kyiv administration, according to a video address Klitschko posted on Facebook after the meeting. 
Klitschko would retain the elected position of mayor, though his power would be greatly reduced.
In the Facebook post, Klitschko criticized the proposal as a rollback of Kyiv's rightful power of self-government. 
Leading the charge for Klitschko's firing was Andriy Bohdan, the former lawyer for Ukrainian tycoon Ihor Kolomoisky, whom Zelensky appointed as his equivalent to chief of staff. 
On July 30, Bohdan stepped up the political broadside against the Kyiv mayor, telling Ukrainian news outlets in a briefing that Klitschko had lost control of the situation in the city over the past five years and was beholden to wealthy figures controlling the city council. 
Klitschko said the comments made Bohdan look 'strange and incompetent.' 
Bohdan did not respond to requests for comment.
Last summer, amid speculation about whether he would be fired, Klitschko flew to the United States.
On July 31, the day after Bohdan's comments, Klitschko met with Giuliani in New York, posting a photo on Facebook of himself and the former New York mayor seated in Giuliani's office.
The meeting came just a week after Trump exhorted Zelensky in a July-25 phone call to coordinate with Giuliani on an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden and his son, who served on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma while his father was in office. 
In an interview, Parnas said he did not attend Giuliani's meeting with Klitschko in New York but was briefed on it afterward by Giuliani and a lawyer for Klitschko. 
Parnas said he was told by both men that, during the meeting, Klitschko complained to Giuliani that the Zelensky administration was trying to oust him "" and appealed for help. 
'He basically cried to Rudy, saying they were going after him unfairly,' Parnas said. 
Klitschko blamed Bohdan for his predicament, Parnas said, fueling Giuliani's anger at Zelensky's chief of staff and, by extension, at the Ukrainian president, who had not publicly committed to investigations that would benefit Trump.
In written comments to The Post, Klitschko denied requesting Giuliani's help. 
'I did not ask anyone for assistance. And our photo is a photo of a meeting of two public figures,' Klitschko said. He said they discussed how 'Ukraine needs further support from our Western partners and friends after the shift in power, support for local government and its development.' 

'Trump loves him'
Days later, Giuliani was due to hold a face-to-face meeting with Yermak, a top aide to Zelensky. 
Giuliani's primary goal for the Madrid summit was to press Yermak to get Zelensky to announce the investigations he sought on Trump's behalf, he previously told The Post.
Kurt Volker, then serving as a special envoy to Ukraine, testified in the House impeachment inquiry that he had connected Yermak and Giuliani. Volker said he hoped the Zelensky aide could convince Giuliani that the new Ukrainian president was an anti-corruption reformer "" and break a logjam that appeared to be preventing Trump from granting the new leader a White House visit. 
The Ukrainians hoped that by satisfying Giuliani, they could finally develop close relations with the Trump administration, text messages released by House impeachment investigators show.
Giuliani was pleased with the selection of Yermak, a former entertainment attorney, as Zelensky's representative for the meeting in Madrid, Parnas said, because he perceived Yermak as an equal, someone who played the same role for the Ukrainian president as he did for Trump: a lawyer and confidant.
 The meeting was held at a luxury hotel. Parnas said that he and Giuliani arrived first and secured a table in the impressive lobby. 
When Yermak arrived, the group exchanged pleasantries. 
After that, Parnas said, Giuliani got down to business. 
'Giuliani started going on about Klitschko and Bohdan,' he said. Giuliani told the Zelensky aide that Klitschko was a 'great guy for Ukraine.'
'He said, 'He can bring more interest to Ukraine, more business. He's a boxer. Americans love boxers,' ' Parnas recalled. 'He said, 'Trump loves him. I think Trump knows him "" he's fought at some of his places.' ' 
Klitschko told a Ukrainian news outlet in 2017 that when he and his brother Wladimir fought at the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City, they socialized with Trump. 
Parnas told The Post he did not know whether Giuliani had ever discussed Klitschko's predicament in Kyiv with Trump. 
In Madrid, Giuliani told the aide to Zelensky that he should make sure Klitschko remained in his powerful job, according to Parnas. 
Parnas said that Yermak appeared open to Giuliani's request. 
'Yermak basically said that he would do everything in his power, that he would personally meet with Klitschko and he would try to work it out,' Parnas said. 'He promised Rudy.'
In a statement, Yermak said he knew going into the meeting that Giuliani and the Kyiv mayor were 'well acquainted' and confirmed that Klitschko came up during the conversation. 
'Giuliani inquired about my opinion of Vitali Klitschko as mayor,' Yermak said. 'At the same time, he immediately made a disclaimer, so that I would not perceive this issue as an attempt to influence me.'
Yermak said he told Giuliani that he had known Klitschko for years and that the boxer was elected and supported by the people of Kyiv.
'On this, our conversation on the topic of Klitschko was over,' Yermak said. 'Therefore, any allegation that at the meeting, Mr. Giuliani tried to impose some kind of narrative on me or that some kind of agreement was reached . . . is not true.' 
The Post reported last week that Yermak has been urging the Ukrainian president to take a pro-Trump line to bolster his standing with the United States, according to diplomats familiar with the discussions.
Parnas said that after discussing Klitschko, Giuliani turned to the central issue that had brought them together: a proposed statement by the Ukrainians regarding investigations helpful to Trump. 
'They had to include a statement about Burisma and Biden,' Parnas said Giuliani explained.
In early September, Zelensky's cabinet passed a resolution to remove Klitschko from his administrative post. Zelensky has not signed the document, leaving Klitschko in place.
In his statement to The Post, Klitschko said he did not know why Zelensky backed off his threat to remove him.
'I cannot be responsible for the president,' he said.

 Analysts and senators urge steps beyond direct engagement with Kim
President Trump's decision to engage directly with Kim Jong Un was premised on the bet that three decades of U.S. policy failures to contain North Korea's nuclear program could be reversed by skipping over lower-level diplomatic talks and starting at the top of its authoritarian regime. 
But 19 months after the two leaders' first summit, the negotiations have broken down along the same sticking point as past efforts: how much sanctions relief the United States is willing to offer in exchange for how much of its arsenal Pyongyang is willing to dismantle.
Now, pressure is mounting on Trump to acknowledge that his strategy has failed and to change course, amid renewed warnings from Kim this week that the North would soon unveil a 'new strategic weapon,' which analysts said could mean a long-range ballistic missile test. Diplomatic engagement has been dormant for months, and the Kim regime, frustrated by the stalemate, has publicly rejected Trump's suggestion that the two leaders could soon meet for a fourth time.
'Regardless of your views about the wisdom of the original engagement between President Trump and Kim Jong Un, it's taken place and it has produced virtually nothing,' said Evans Revere, a former Asia policy official at the State Department who left in 2007. 'We now have a reaffirmation from the highest levels of the North Korean regime that they are determined to go as quickly as they can down the nuclear path. They are reiterating and strengthening some of their threats. This is essentially affirmation that nothing much has changed at the end of the day.' 
For Trump, the growing tensions on the Korean Peninsula suggest that Kim is increasingly in the driver's seat, as the president has sought to promote his North Korea strategy as a foreign policy triumph in an election year. Through a flurry of short-range ballistic missile tests in the second half of 2019, and in a lengthy speech on New Year's Eve, the young dictator has made clear he has continued to prioritize the nation's defense capabilities despite having announced a strategic shift toward economic development in 2018. 
In recent weeks, Trump's critics, including former national security adviser John Bolton and senators from both political parties, have faulted his approach and implored him to take additional steps, ranging from new economic sanctions to pursuing an interim deal with Kim.
So far, Trump has refused to alter his course, professing that his personal rapport with Kim remains positive and urging the North Korean leader not to violate that trust.
'I have a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un,' Trump told reporters Tuesday at his Mar-a-Lago golf resort in Florida. 'I know he's sending out certain messages about Christmas presents, and I hope his Christmas present is a beautiful vase as opposed to something else.'
But analysts said that even if Kim maintains a two-year moratorium on nuclear and ballistic missile testing, there appears to be a sense of diminishing returns in Pyongyang in dealing with a president saddled with the growing political liabilities of impeachment proceedings and a tough reelection slog.
'I think there are a number of reasons why engaging Trump at this point is probably viewed as a wasted effort,' said Suzanne DiMaggio, a foreign policy expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 
A White House spokesman declined to comment. 
Warned in late 2016 during a White House meeting with then-President Barack Obama that North Korea would be his most serious foreign policy challenge, Trump quickly elevated the rogue nation's nuclear program to the top of his foreign policy agenda. After ramping up economic sanctions and 'fire and fury' rhetorical pressure in 2017, Trump jumped at an invitation from Kim to meet the following spring.
In explaining his decision, White House aides dismissed past nuclear talks, including the Agreed Framework in the Clinton administration and the six-party talks during the George W. Bush years, as having failed because of a lack of clear commitment from the uppermost ranks of the Kim family regime. Aides suggested that Kim, who had sent a delegation headed by his sister to the Winter Olympics in South Korea in February 2018, had signaled a strategic shift to diplomacy that made a leader-level summit a worthwhile gamble. 
 But in flipping diplomatic engagement on its head, Trump rushed into his first meeting with Kim in Singapore in June 2018 without the kind of detailed agreement that comes from painstaking working-level meetings, former U.S. national security officials said. After three days in Southeast Asia, Trump and Kim signed a half-page document consisting of four vague bullet points, including a pledge to 'work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.' 
 Trump promoted it as a major breakthrough, pronouncing in a tweet that there was 'no longer a threat' from the North.
But the president 'misread entirely what it was they got out of Singapore,' a Democratic Senate foreign policy aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations with administration officials, said Thursday. 
'It's clear what North Korea thinks denuclearization constitutes and what it does not constitute.'
Analysts have said North Korea has long defined the term as meaning the United States would withdraw its nuclear-defense umbrella from South Korea and Japan as a prerequisite for any large-scale dismantlement of its own program. The gap between the sides became clear as diplomatic teams failed to hammer down a clear definition of 'denuclearization' in the wake of the Singapore summit.
Despite a lack of progress, the two leaders agreed to meet again, in Hanoi last February. But a working-level meeting ahead of the summit failed to make advances on a road map for a denuclearization process. Talks broke off in Hanoi after Trump demanded Pyongyang relinquish its entire nuclear program in exchange for broad sanctions relief, while Kim countered with a more incremental plan. 
Analysts said Trump failed to bestow authority in his negotiating team to speak for him in the same manner that his aides suggested the Kim family had long failed to do with North Korea's negotiators, leaving aides unable to translate the good feeling from Singapore into tangible, detailed agreements.
'The North Koreans were convinced the only person they could really deal with was Trump,' said Christopher R. Hill, who served as the Bush administration's lead negotiator during the six-party talks with North Korea. 
Efforts to restart talks since Hanoi have been fruitless, despite Trump becoming the first sitting U.S. president to set foot in North Korea during a brief handshake meeting with Kim at the Korean demilitarized zone in June. 
Many lawmakers on Capitol Hill and foreign policy analysts said the United States is in a worse position now than two years ago, as North Korea has continued to develop its nuclear program while the Trump administration has halted some joint military exercises with South Korea and the international sanctions regime assembled in 2017 has been weakened. 
Brookings Institution analyst Jung Pak, a former U.S. intelligence official on Korea issues, said the outcome has convinced her that the North Korean leadership was never serious about a policy shift away from nuclear development even as it embraced Trump. 
'The question looking back is: Were we in a special moment in 2018 and 2019? I don't think it was. It was a blip rather than a big inflection point,' Pak said. 'The U.S. and North Korea are fundamentally at odds in their strategic objectives. No amount of letters or phone conversations or summits at the leader level is going to shake that loose.'

Intelligence community hasn't found evidence of a 2020 election favorite
A senior U.S. intelligence official told Congress on Tuesday that the intelligence community does not as yet have evidence that Russia is interfering in the 2020 election to benefit a particular candidate, according to four officials familiar with the closed briefings in the House and Senate.
The head of national counterintelligence, William Evanina, appeared to be tempering an assessment delivered to lawmakers in the House last month that Russia had developed a ""preference"" for President Trump - an assessment that angered the president when he was told that it had been given to lawmakers, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the sessions were classified.
Evanina told senators that the Russians ""continue to be broadly engaged in social media activities designed to divide us further, to discredit our electoral system and to disrupt our election,"" said one official present at the all-members meeting.
In the Senate, Evanina's carefully worded answer came in response to the first question asked - by Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) - and ""felt orchestrated,"" said a second official, who was briefed on the meeting. ""Both question and response were clearly pre-drafted.""
The intelligence officials who gave the briefing, including National Security Agency Director Paul M. Nakasone and FBI Director Christopher A. Wray, did not give senators an impression that the Trump administration has a solid grip on dealing with foreign interference in the coming election, said a third official briefed on the session.
Senators ""came out of it without a true sense that this administration has a handle on this and we're going to be okay for 2020,"" the official said.
In the House, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the Intelligence Committee chairman, challenged the briefer on what struck them as an effort to play down the assessment given last month by Shelby Pierson, the intelligence community's point person on foreign election threats, a fourth official said.
Pierson had informed the bipartisan House Intelligence Committee panel that Russia had ""developed a preference"" for Trump in 2020. She did not say that Russia had taken steps based on that preference to intervene on behalf of Trump, an intelligence official said. But that nuance apparently did not mollify Trump, who when informed of her briefing grew angry and suspicious that Democrats might try to leak that assessment to undermine his bid for reelection.
Soon after, Trump replaced his then-acting director of national intelligence Joseph Maguire, whom he apparently blamed for Pierson's briefing, with Richard Grenell, a Trump loyalist and the U.S. ambassador to Germany.
On Tuesday, senators also were disconcerted that Grenell, as the head of the intelligence community, was not present, said one of the people briefed on the session. The heads of other agencies, including acting homeland security secretary Chad Wolf, were there, and Grenell had been scheduled to appear, according to a list of participants circulated to lawmakers on Monday.
But Grenell declined to go to the Hill, citing apprehension about his preparedness to address sensitive subjects that tend to upset the president, according to three people familiar with the matter.
He asked Trump to be excused from the briefings because he anticipated pointed questions from Democrats about politically volatile subjects - such as intelligence assessments that Russia is once more interfering in U.S. politics, two people familiar with the matter said. They, too, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions.
Maura Beard, a spokeswoman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), said in a statement that the agency never told Congress that Grenell would participate in the briefing. She said so despite the list circulated to lawmakers Monday showing that he was scheduled.
""FBI and DHS are the lead in charge of securing our elections, and the [intelligence community] is participating in today's briefings in support of that mission,"" Beard's statement said, referring to the Department of Homeland Security. ""The [intelligence community] is focused on detecting and countering foreign election-related threats.""
Grenell's name had been included in the list of briefers given to Congress on Feb. 27 as well, people familiar with the matter said, along with other national security officials including Wray, Nakasone and Wolf.
The latest list of briefers, provided to Congress on Tuesday morning, included Evanina in lieu of Grenell.
Trump has long chafed at notions that Russia has interfered in or sought to intervene in the election, dating back to his pique at the U.S. intelligence community's unanimous conclusion that Moscow took steps to aid his election in 2016.
""There is another Russia, Russia, Russia meeting today,"" Trump tweeted Tuesday morning. ""It is headed up by corrupt politician [House Intelligence Committee Chairman] Adam ""Shifty"" Schiff, so I wouldn't expect too much!""
Schiff tweeted in response: ""Mr. President, you are wrong. As usual. Today's briefing for all House Members focuses on the threat of foreign interference in our election. The briefers are agency heads and senior officials. They are your own people. We will insist on the truth, whether you like it or not.""
Grenell, who lacks substantive intelligence community experience, has been one of Trump's most vocal and partisan backers. Even before he took the ambassador position, he cast doubt on the idea of Russian interference in the 2016 election. In an opinion article for Fox News, he played down the severity of the threat, saying ""Russian or Russian-approved tactics like cyber warfare and campaign of misinformation have been happening for decades.""
Tuesday's briefing is part of a regular series to keep lawmakers apprised of the government's progress in securing federal elections and on foreign interference.

A Senate committee on Tuesday considered President Trump's nominee to fill a vacancy on the Federal Election Commission. If the nominee is confirmed, it would restore the agency's ability to conduct official business as the primary elections advance. 
The Senate Rules Committee's rare public hearing on a nominee for the FEC, James E. ""Trey"" Trainor III, served as the first step to confirm the conservative Texas lawyer, whose nomination has languished for three years. 
In August, the FEC lost the ability to do its official job after the resignation of a commissioner left it unable to operate for the first time in 11 years, without its necessary four-person quorum. 
Trainor has been nominated three times to the position since 2017, but he remained in limbo amid controversy over his social media postings and a standstill among Senate leaders on the logistics of appointing commissioners.
It remains unclear whether Trainor will be confirmed. The Rules Committee has not yet scheduled its vote to move his nomination to the full Senate. On Thursday, party leaders in the Senate remained split on Trainor's nomination. 
Trainor, an Austin-based elections lawyer, has pushed for less regulation of money in politics and fought efforts to require politically active nonprofit organizations to disclose their donors. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) attended the hearing to raise concerns about Trainor's past comments on limiting donor disclosure. Government transparency groups widely oppose Trainor's confirmation. 
Senators asked Trainor his role in redistricting and gerrymandering cases in Texas and his views on the enforcement role of the FEC. 
When asked about Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, Trainor did not mention Russia but acknowledged that ""there has been foreign interference in our elections, and I believe there is still the potential for our elections to be targeted by foreign entities."" 
Democratic senators asked whether he would recuse himself in cases involving President Trump, given his previous role advising the Republican National Committee and Trump during the 2016 election. 
Trainor said he would not apply a ""blanket recusal"" but that he would consult the FEC's ethics advisers to recuse from certain cases if necessary, noting that that is a standard process for commissioners. 
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has called for a full slate of six new FEC commissioners, said he supported restoring the quorum, reestablishing party balance among commissioners, and bringing the agency one step closer to having six new commissioners. 
The three commissioners are Republican Caroline Hunter, whose term expired in 2013; Democrat Ellen Weintraub, whose term expired in 2008; and Steven Walther, an independent who often caucuses with the Democrats, whose term expired in 2009. Under federal law, no more than three FEC commissioners can be from the same party, and the panel typically has been split equally along party lines. 
McConnell said he wishes to see ""a clean slate of commissioners, all serving on real, unexpired terms, to bring new energy, build new relationships and inject some new perspective."" 
Senate Democrats had pushed for restoring the quorum, and for upholding an unwritten tradition of appointing a pair of commissioners - one from each party - at a time. Senate Democrats said they vetted and recommended Shana Broussard, an FEC attorney, to the panel. But there has not yet been a formal nomination sent to the Rules Committee.

Senate Republicans on Sunday acknowledged that President Trump was wrong to pressure Ukraine for his own political benefit, even as they defended their decision to prohibit new evidence in his impeachment trial while pressing ahead with the president's all-but-certain acquittal.
The remarks from key Republicans "" including Sens. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) and Joni Ernst (Iowa) "" came after the Trump administration revealed the existence of emails that could shed light on the president's reasons for withholding military aid to Ukraine.
'I'm going to vote to acquit,' Alexander said in an interview on NBC News's 'Meet the Press.' 'I'm very concerned about any action that we could take that would establish a perpetual impeachment in the House of Representatives whenever the House was a different party than the president. That would immobilize the Senate.'
One Republican senator, a close ally of Trump, suggested a sweeping GOP counterattack following Wednesday's vote to acquit the president.
'It's going to happen in the coming weeks,' Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) said of the counteroffensive in an interview on Fox News's 'Sunday Morning Futures.'
Graham outlined a plan that would include an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden, who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and a pursuit of the whistleblower whose account triggered the probe into Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine.
It was unclear whether other Senate committee leaders were on board with Graham's proposal, however. Graham used his Sunday television appearance to make a direct appeal to Sen. James E. Risch (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
'Jim, if you're watching the show, I hope you are . . . let's call these people in. Eventually, we'll get to Hunter Biden,' Graham said, referring to the former vice president's son. He added: 'We're not going to let it go. Jim Risch, you need to start it.'
Risch's office and the Foreign Relations Committee did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The crux of the impeachment case against Trump is whether he used $391-million in military aid and a coveted White House meeting for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as leverage to force the foreign leader to conduct political investigations, including one focused on Joe Biden.
In a July-25 call, Trump asked Zelensky to 'do us a favor.'
Trump and administration officials repeatedly stonewalled House investigators, refusing to allow certain witnesses to testify and to provide requested documents.
The House voted in December to impeach Trump, and in recent weeks, new evidence against him has emerged, including reports that former national security adviser John Bolton says there was a quid pro quo conditioning the aid on investigations by Ukraine that could help the president politically.
In an interview Sunday with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Trump said he has no plans to delay his annual State of the Union address, which is scheduled for Tuesday.
'No, I'm going to have it,' Trump said in the interview, which aired on Fox ahead of the Super Bowl. 'It's going to be done. We're going to talk about the achievements that we've made.'
He added that the impeachment process and the Russia probe led by former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III were 'unfair to my family.'
'I mean, my family suffered because of all of this, and many other families suffered also,' he said.
Over the weekend, the administration acknowledged the existence of two dozen emails that could reveal the president's thinking about withholding the aid to Ukraine.
Some Democrats had been looking to Alexander last week as a potential crossover vote in favor of subpoenaing key witnesses and documents in the Senate trial. But the lawmaker said Sunday that while Trump's behavior was 'inappropriate,' it was 'a long way from treason, bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors.'
'I think he shouldn't have done it,' Alexander said of Trump's alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine. 'I think it was wrong. Inappropriate was the way I'd say "" improper, crossing the line. And then the only question left is who decides what to do about that.'
'Well, who decides what to do about that?' host Chuck Todd asked.
'The people,' Alexander responded.
On CNN's 'State of the Union,' Ernst said she, too, will vote to acquit the president. 
Ernst, who is facing a tough reelection race this year, said she would not have handled the Ukraine matter in the way Trump did. But she offered only gentle criticism of the president's actions. 
'Maybe not the perfect call,' Ernst said, referring to Trump's oft-repeated claim that his phone conversation with Zelensky was 'perfect.' 'He did it maybe in the wrong manner.'
'I think he could have done it through different channels,' such as the Department of Justice, she added.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and other leading Democrats have argued that any acquittal without the inclusion of witnesses and documents is meaningless "" a point Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) reemphasized Sunday.
'Senate Republicans keep voting for a sham trial without witnesses or documents,' Schumer tweeted. 'Make no mistake: The full truth will eventually come out, and Senate Republicans will have to answer for their cover-up.'
Harvard Law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz, a member of Trump's legal team, pushed back against the notion that the trial was a sham, saying that Pelosi and others are at fault 'for failing to charge an impeachable offense.'
'If they haven't charged an offense, then maybe he hasn't been acquitted, but he also hasn't been charged,' Dershowitz said on 'Fox News Sunday.'
Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), meanwhile, took a victory lap of sorts. In an appearance on CBS News's 'Face the Nation,' Schiff, the lead impeachment manager, pointed to the recent comments by Republican senators as proof that the House successfully made its case that Trump 'did withhold hundreds of millions of dollars from an ally to try to coerce that ally into helping him cheat in the next election.'
'I think it's enormously important that the country understand exactly what this president did, and we have proved it,' Schiff said.
Even so, he added, to simply call Trump's actions inappropriate 'doesn't begin to do justice to the gravity of this president's misconduct.'
Schiff also declined to say whether the House will subpoena Bolton, saying only that, 'whether it's in testimony before the House or it's in his book or it's in one form or another, the truth will continue to come out.'

The Conservative Political Action Conference began on Ash Wednesday in a reelection year with a quiet service on the shore of the Potomac River. Wearing Trump bumper stickers on their church hats or gold-colored ""Trump 2020"" pins on their collars, the faithful approached an altar branded with the logo of the Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center. A priest dabbed their foreheads with the mark of the cross and urged them to emulate Jesus. ""Act like him, think like him, talk like him.""
Two hours later, these few dozen people joined the broader CPAC audience in a cavernous ballroom, where President Trump campaign adviser Katrina Pierson urged them to ""bring home Donald J. Trump a win in 2020.""
""The best part about that,"" she promised, ""is we get to see more liberal tears.""
Since a pre-presidential Ronald Reagan helped inaugurate the annual gathering half a century ago, CPAC has become a sort of political pilgrimage for conservatives, an almost sacred event that has hosted some of the movement's important addresses and politicians. Since Trump's election four years ago, the conference has functioned in election years as the first revving of the Republican engine, priming the messaging and activist networks that will shortly flood the country. And this year was no different, even if the particular messaging strikes an apocalyptic note.
As the self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders takes the lead in early Democratic primaries and caucuses, CPAC's message for 2020 is ""America vs. Socialism."" The slogan was written on posters across the Gaylord and absorbed in the fashions of attendees who lined up for hours outside the ballroom to register: college students in ""Kiss Me I'm a Capitalist"" T-shirts, a woman in four-inch star-spangled heels, men in suits and tennis shoes, dogs in tiny faux combat jackets.
And this advance guard for Trump's reelection was nothing if not confident.
""Trump's going to win in a landslide,"" said Robert Rappaport, a 77-year-old retired engineer from Naples, Fla., whose conservative philosophy was rooted in the writings of Friedrich Hayek and the Bible, and expressed on his T-shirt: ""Deplorable Lives Matter.""
CPAC traditionally saves its best material for last, culminating on Saturday with a scheduled appearance by Trump. But Rappaport and about 800 other people showed up early and stayed late on the conference's first day for ""direct action training,"" a preview of the strategies Republicans will need to get one of the most nationally unpopular presidents in modern history reelected.
The session's titles sometimes promised more drama than the speakers delivered. ""Weaponize Social Media"" turned out to be a slide-show tutorial on how to share fundraising links with your friends. ""The Fate of Our Culture and Our Nation Hangs in the Balance"" was headlined by Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Tex.), who entertained the existence of ""well-intentioned liberals,"" but they end up being socialists anyway.
""They're pushing some of the most radical policies this country has ever seen,"" Crenshaw said. ""How did we get to a point where Bernie Sanders is the thought leader of a . . . Democratic Party?""
Gigantic TV screens entertained the crowd between sessions, blasting Trump quotes and cable news clips at such volume that one attendee's service dog began to bark in alarm. As Wednesday evening wound down, Mercedes Schlapp - a Trump campaign official who is married to Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, which runs CPAC - offered this advice on recruiting undecided voters to the cause: ""Tell them it is no longer your grandfather's Democratic Party.""
When the attendees returned Thursday morning, they were greeted by a newly erected barricade of metal detectors and Secret Service officers. CPAC's first major speaker, Vice President Pence, would arrive around noon.
Relatively minor conservative celebrities floated around the camera-lined hallways in the interim. Rep. Douglas A. Collins (R-Ga.), fresh off his role defending Trump against impeachment charges, was mobbed at nearly every TV or radio booth he walked past. Scott Jenkins, the Second Amendment-loving sheriff of Culpeper County, Va., paraded in uniform with a much smaller entourage.
Matt Schlapp paused to add his signature to a fan's 10-year-old traveling T-shirt, which already bore the marks of Andrew Breitbart and Joe the Plumber. Ronald Solomon, proprietor of TheMAGAMall.com, schmoozed the crowd and predicted an easy reelection for the president. ""I've never sold more hats,"" he noted.
An informal sampling of College Republicans, who had traveled here from schools across the country, yielded a more sober assessment of Trump's chances.
""I think it will be tight,"" said Olivia Higgins, a freshman at Carthage College in Kenosha, Wis. ""A lot of my peers, even most, are very liberal.""
Still, she emerged beaming from the massive auditorium where she and several thousand others watched Pence declare that the Democratic contest will end when ""a monster truck with a big T on the hood drives into the infield and runs right over them.""
The crowd inside readily burst into applause and chants - especially when a Trump impersonator in an oversized suit and copious face makeup tried to interrupt the speech, only to be marched outside and down the corridor by half a dozen security officers.
In the same hallway, a self-described anti-fascist demonstrator who had purchased a ticket was arguing at the top of his lungs with associates of far-right social media personality Laura Loomer.
""Isn't this interesting? It's a microcosm!"" marveled John Folsom as he watched the spectacle. A political ""agnostic,"" Folsom said he had come to CPAC to do outreach for a veteran's support group in Omaha. ""That's what I like about America,"" he said. ""You've got a free exchange of ideas. You've got two people who obviously don't agree with each other. It's an argument, not a discussion.""
Inside the auditorium, the arguments tended to veer one-sided. Trump relatives Ivanka, Lara and Donald Jr. graced CPAC's stage on Friday, praising their boss and patriarch's administration as effusively as Trump will probably do himself when he takes the stage this weekend.
""My father-in-law was probably like so many people in his room, so frustrated by what he saw happening to his country, and the wasteful spending,"" said Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law and a campaign adviser. ""I don't know if anyone remembers the shrimp on the treadmill,"" she added, referring to a federally funded study on water quality that enraged some conservatives in 2011.
In a panel on big technology, the president's son Donald Trump Jr., a campaign surrogate, complained that Trump fundraising emails were going into his junk mail, which he suspected was a plot by computer programmers to try to steal the election.
""They are going to cheat. They will,"" said campaign manager Brad Parscale, echoing a similar sentiment to Don but directing his ire at Democrats. ""What it's going to be is all of you standing up, doing something and fighting. . . . That's what's going to keep this movement alive. That's what's going to get this president four more years.""

Don't blame Trump for the rise of right-wing conspiracy theories, says historian Matthew Dallek. The GOP helped cultivate them "" until it was too late.
To explain President Trump's impeachment, the GOP has promulgated a flurry of baseless conspiracy theories about the forces arrayed against him. It has been surreal to hear some of the nation's most influential elected officials spouting ideas basically concocted from thin air. The House Intelligence Committee's ranking Republican, Devin Nunes (Calif.), denounces 'Ukrainian election meddling in 2016 . . . aimed against the Trump campaign.' The Judiciary Committee's Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) claims that if Congress could only talk to a certain three Democratic officials, then 'every fact of this investigation' would be unearthed. Conservatives online hold that former White House aide Fiona Hill was a mole planted by George Soros.
Of course, no one purveys these theories with as much verve as Trump. The president has suggested that the nation's first African American president was born abroad (he wasn't), that the father of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) had a part in JFK's assassination (he didn't), that Ukraine rather than Russia was responsible for election interference (it wasn't), that the Mueller investigation empaneled by his own administration was a Democratic plot against him, that the Clintons orchestrated the prison killing of accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein (who committed suicide, according to an autopsy) and that the Obama administration spied on his campaign, a claim most recently debunked by the Justice Department's inspector general.
It certainly appears, more than ever, that 'the truth itself is on trial,' as Peter Baker recently wrote in the New York Times. Some conservatives say Trump, and Trumpism, represent a new frontier of conspiratorial politics "" that the theories are unique to Trump's sensibility and peculiar to his paranoid White House. 'Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication,' former president George W. Bush said in a 2017 speech. The 'main problem' behind the proliferation of political conspiracy theories 'is a president who is also a self-invented fabulist,' argued Washington Post columnist Michael Gerson.

But in truth, the stew of 'alternative facts' has been simmering for more than half a century on the right fringe. The GOP had endless opportunities across the decades to banish these theories "" about scheming bureaucrats, Jews, the Federal Reserve, the United Nations "" and its leaders often saw them as absurd. But they were also useful, helping to rally support from an aggrieved government-hating base. So the party's mandarins allowed them to fester and grow until they spread from the toxic fringe to the mainstream, which they have finally overtaken. It's no wonder someone who embraced those ideas would become successful; Trump validates notions that his voters have long believed, ideas that the party refused to condemn and failed to repudiate.
Trump, then, isn't what caused these conspiracy theories. He's what happens when nobody stands in their way.

The intellectual life of the American right since Sen. Joe McCarthy's rise to prominence in 1950 can be seen partially as a series of flirtations with conspiracists and a dedicated reluctance to read fringe crackpots out of its ranks. Yes, William F. Buckley Jr.'s National Review attacked John Birch Society founder Robert Welch, who called Dwight Eisenhower a 'dedicated, conscious agent of the communist conspiracy,' in an iconic moment of movement history.
But conservative leaders more typically embraced the passion and support of the Birchers at the grass roots. At its 1964 national convention, the GOP rejected a plank condemning the society, along with its conspiratorial beliefs. Birchers such as John Rousselot and John Schmitz served in Congress as Republicans in good standing, while conservative oilman and family patriarch Fred Koch was a founding member of the society. Birchers took active part in Republican election campaigns and ran right-wing bookstores packed with conspiratorial treatises such as John Stormer's 'None Dare Call It Treason' (about Soviet 'infiltration of American government') and Fred Schwarz's 'You Can Trust the Communists (to Be Communists).' They served as members of local school boards and state legislatures. Other Republicans rarely spoke up to debunk the Birch view that fluoride in drinking water was part of a communist plot to cause cancer or control Americans' minds.
At times, the wild-eyed conspiracism came from the top. Vice President Spiro Agnew delivered speeches identifying a cabal of Washington- and New York-based power brokers who supposedly controlled the news media, whipping up what journalists at the time considered a frenzy of anti-Semitism on the far right. (In 1976, a few years after he'd been indicted on bribery and other charges, Agnew published a novel pushing the anti-Semitic trope that the media's 'Zionist lobby' was controlling America's foreign policy in the Middle East.)
At other times, understanding that they had to court the conspiracy-minded activists of 'the base,' the party's leaders went out of their way to confer legitimacy on extremists. Take the GOP's relationship with Christian Coalition leader Pat Robertson, who won four states in the 1988 Republican presidential primary contest. In 1991, Robertson published 'The New World Order,' holding that scheming government pooh-bahs were working to set up 'world government, a world police force, world courts, world banking and currency, and a world elite in charge of it all.' He even suggested that President George H.W. Bush was complicit in establishing this new world order. Still, Republicans wanted votes and donations from Robertson's acolytes, so Newt Gingrich, Oliver North, William Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jesse Helms and Dinesh D'Souza all happily spoke at his 'Road to Victory' conferences. Sen. Bob Dole, a pillar of the Republican establishment and at the time a presidential candidate, told Robertson's followers in 1995 that 'I am proud to stand up here and say that I've been awarded a 100 percent voting record in '93 and 100 percent in 1994 and 100 percent in 1995' from the Christian Coalition.
During the Clinton years, the crackpot theorizing became harder and harder to distinguish from the Republican Party itself. Conservative billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife sent investigators to Arkansas to dig up dirt on the president's past, and when they failed, they settled for salacious fabrications that Bill Clinton was part of a drug-smuggling ring. Scaife became what The Washington Post called 'a guiding force' behind Gingrich's Contract With America and a later generation of tea party activists. The Rev. Jerry Falwell, a leader of the religious right (his son is a big Trump supporter), started selling a $43 videotape that, among other charges, said Clinton was responsible for the deaths of 'countless people.'
Of course, Republican leaders didn't always or uniformly tolerate gonzo conspiracy theories. Presidential nominee John McCain, for instance, contradicted one of his supporters at a 2008 campaign event, telling her that Barack Obama was not, in fact, 'an Arab.' Onetime senator and 1996 presidential hopeful Arlen Specter (Pa.) also stuck up for the truth when he assailed two leading GOP conspiracy theorists, Robertson and Pat Buchanan, as leaders of the 'intolerant right.' 
Yet over the past seven decades, such voices "" pro-fact, pro-science and pro-reason "" lost the internal debate over how to treat the tinfoil-hat folks. And such moments of truth-telling by Republicans at all levels have been fleeting and rare.
While the GOP was actively courting allies who propagated conspiracy theories, the Democratic Party took much the opposite tack "" mostly rejecting the outlandish left-wing theories that surfaced from time to time. Although some research has found a recent uptick in Democratic support for conspiracy theories (a jump caused by a lack of political power), elected Democrats have typically fenced their party off from wild-eyed claims promulgated on the left. They never embraced the theory that the 9/11 attacks were an 'inside job' carried out by the Bush administration, for example. During the 2004 presidential primary race, even the most lefty antiwar candidates "" Dennis Kucinich, Howard Dean, Carol Moseley Braun "" largely eschewed conspiracy theories that President George W. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney had gone to war for oil or to enrich their friends in the construction business. The left has its share of anti-vaxxers who believe that vaccines cause autism, yet Democratic officials have battled that lie (which Trump himself has promoted).
One reason is that Democrats have been reluctant to use anti-government theories to tear down the things they would prefer to burnish, such as government and international institutions that they believe work for social justice and economic progress. Republicans' conspiracy theories about powerful secret actors are consistent with their small-government views; it is a shorter leap for conservatives to portray Washington as a swamp where individualism, justice and decency go to die.

Thanks to years of GOP tolerance for surreal thinking on the right, conspiracy theories have moved from the fringe to the center. One poll by Fairleigh Dickinson University found that 63 percent of registered voters subscribe to at least one such theory. Some social science research suggests that people who feel alienated from politics are more prone to thinking conspiratorially. Trump capitalized on that climate of suspicion.
It's easy to see the line from older conspiracy theories to the fact-free claims by Trump supporters today. White House adviser Stephen Miller has drawn anti-immigration rhetoric from white-nationalist publications like the 1973 French novel 'The Camp of the Saints,' which envisions hordes of immigrants obliterating Western civilization. Breitbart News has featured anti-immigrant, anti-gay and anti-black theories that could have been found in an earlier generation of far-right publications, including American Opinion and American Mercury.
Perhaps the biggest change of the Trump era is the approach of Republican leaders. In the past, they indulged these theories but never really espoused them. Today, elective officeholders embrace them openly, in the face of explicit counterevidence from the government they purport to run. National security officials have repeatedly stressed in recent weeks that Ukraine did not meddle in the 2016 election and that those who repeat the claim are advancing pro-Russian propaganda. Yet most Republican members of Congress now seem to believe this theory, pointing to a thin report in Politico that documented no top-down, coordinated interference. Trump's racism (calling Mexican immigrants 'rapists'; telling four congresswomen of color who are all U.S. citizens to 'go back' to their 'crime infested' home countries) and anti-Semitism (he implies Jews are loyal primarily to Israel and motivated mostly by money) align well with old allegations that Jewish bankers and assorted globalists have enriched themselves while inflicting economic havoc on 'the people,' as his closing 2016 television ad suggested.
Polarization has also made mainstream American culture hospitable to ideas once relegated to the margins. Voters have grown more tolerant of political leaders' failings as long as they adhere to the correct ideological positions, opening a space for someone like Trump to win the presidency and then govern with the support of a minority of the electorate. And grass-roots opinion has shifted in favor of conspiracy theories, a pattern that both follows the cues of political leaders and incentivizes those leaders' abasements. For instance, Twitter equips Trump to instantaneously air any theory, no matter how nutty, to raucous and affirming plaudits. Fox News also capitalizes on this shift to amplify Trumpian claims ('Russia didn't hack our democracy,' Fox host Tucker Carlson recently parroted). It's no wonder that, as Gallup found last February, 30 percent of Republicans see Russia in a favorable light. One recent Post survey of attitudes toward 2016 election conspiracy theories found that 26 percent of Americans believed that CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, invented a story of Russian election meddling in order to hide Ukraine's efforts to help Hillary Clinton.
Ultimately, Trump was the logical consequence of a posture followed for decades at the top echelons of the conservative movement: The batty screeds are silly, but since they help us, we won't work zealously to purge them. Trump's conspiracy-based capture of the GOP has less to do with him and his perspective than with a party that sought and often won the support of people who believe those notions.

SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic "" The politics of this Caribbean island nation do not frequently capture the attention of the stewards of America's foreign policy, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo phoned down last summer with a clear message. 
Dominican President Danilo Medina's supporters were pushing to change the country's constitution to allow him to run for an unprecedented third term. In a call with the president, Pompeo emphasized the importance of 'adherence to rule of law and the constitution,' according to a State Department readout.

That message was echoed a week later in person by President Trump's personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
'If you want to change the constitution, change it for the future,' Giuliani told reporters during a July 2019 visit to Santo Domingo. 'Don't make it look like you're changing it for you. Don't change it for this election.' 
Giuliani was not in the Dominican Republic as Trump's representative. He was speaking as a paid consultant to an opposition presidential candidate, Luis Abinader, a businessman who had been protesting the possibility of a constitutional change allowing the incumbent to run again. 
Days later, Medina announced that he would not seek reelection.
The overlapping interests of the U.S. administration and Giuliani's paying client underscores how his decision to work as an international consultant while serving as Trump's lawyer has caused disquiet, both among foreign leaders and U.S. administration officials.
Giuliani's presence in Santo Domingo annoyed rival Dominican presidential candidates who felt Abinader was trying to buy his campaign an American seal of approval, according to candidates and their advisers. And it concerned officials in the presidential palace who scrutinized Giuliani's comments for signs he was speaking for Trump, according to a person familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal talks.

Giuliani's visit to the Dominican Republic came around the same time that he "" with Trump's backing "" had been pressing Pompeo and U.S. diplomats to push Ukraine to announce investigations into Trump's political opponents, a gambit that led to the president's impeachment.

The State Department did not respond to multiple requests for comment. 
Giuliani did not respond directly to a question about whether he met with anyone at the State Department about his client there.
'Why in the world would you care about my work in the DR except to once again try to suggest falsely that there is some question about it?' he asked in a text message. 'Don't you have anything better to do? Whatever I did in DR was perfectly lawful and appropriate.'
The full scope of Giuliani's clientele is not known. The uncertainty about whom he represents "" and his willingness to take on foreign clients with interests before the U.S. government while working for the president "" has alarmed senior administration officials, as The Washington Post has previously reported.
In his various meetings last year with foreign and U.S. officials, Giuliani toggled between serving as Trump's emissary and representing other interests. During a sit-down in August with a top Ukrainian official to discuss the investigations Trump wanted, Giuliani advocated for a former client, the mayor of Kyiv. On that same trip, he stayed at a historic estate of a client, Venezuelan energy executive Alejandro Betancourt López "" and later met with top Justice Department officials to urge them not to charge him in a money-laundering case.
Giuliani, who says he works for Trump free, has told The Post that he is always careful to make clear he is a private lawyer for the president, not a representative of the U.S. government.
Since 2015, Giuliani has been hired by Abinader as a security consultant two times, according to Samuel Pereyra, an official in the Abinader campaign who managed the contracts.

 
His most recent contract, for $75,000, was secured last June, Pereyra said, more than a year after Giuliani joined Trump's legal team. 
For that sum, Giuliani made a two-day trip to the Dominican Republic in July, appearing with the candidate at a briefing for reporters and visiting a poor neighborhood in the capital, where he said people shouldn't have to live behind bars like prisoners.
While he was there, Giuliani also puffed cigars at his favorite Dominican cigar club and dined at the residence of the U.S. ambassador, Robin Bernstein, one of Trump's longtime Palm Beach, Fla., friends and an original member of Mar-a-Lago, according to people familiar with his activities.

Some members of Abinader's campaign team felt it was a mistake to rehire Giuliani, saying he spoke in generalities and provided little of value, and worried that the candidate had brought him aboard to get access to the president.
'I think [Abinader] wanted a direct line to Trump,' said one adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions. 'For me, that's the principal reason he was hired: It's a link to the White House and the State Department.'
Abinader denied that, telling The Post in an interview that he did not hire Giuliani to curry favor with the Trump administration. The two discussed only security issues, he said.


'Corruption no mas'
The campaign caravan inched through the narrow streets of Villa Altagracia, a working-class exurb north of Santo Domingo, blasting merengue and reggaeton basslines for the dancing crowds. Abinader stood up through the sunroof of his armored SUV and blew kisses to those below. 
'Here he is, the next president of the republic!' the emcee called out last month. 
With his composed, somewhat stiff persona, Abinader is not known for his charisma with the masses. But his pro-business, law-and-order message has resonated with voters who are tired of persistent crime and allegations of corruption in a ruling party that has been in power for 20 of the past 24 years. The Dominican Republic was ranked last year in the bottom quarter of Transparency International's list of most corrupt countries in the world. 
Abinader is a wealthy businessman of Lebanese descent whose father had been a cabinet minister, a presidential candidate and the founder of a private university. His family's diverse holdings included hotels, cement plants and data processing centers, according to Abinader's advisers. 
Before Abinader's first run for president in 2016, public opinion surveys showed that Dominicans' most pressing concern was crime and violence, and his polling numbers on these topics trailed other candidates. 
Like many Dominicans, Abinader had relatives in New York City, with particularly strong connections to Queens: His grandfather ran Corona Hardware in the borough. One of his cousins, Rodolfo Fuertes, was the president of the National Supermarket Association at the time, and suggested in 2015 that Abinader's campaign might benefit from Giuliani's help, Abinader said in an interview.
 The former New York mayor was famous for reducing crime during his tenure. After leaving office, Giuliani sought to capi tal ize on that reputation, offering consulting services on security and police reform to countries around the world. 
'You have to see Giuliani, he can clean up Santo Domingo,' Abinader recalled being told in a meeting with Fuertes and others.
After being hired on a $100,000 contract, Giuliani Security and Safety produced a 38-page
report for the campaign in April 2016 that discussed crime trends and recommended several reforms of the Dominican police, Pereyra said. 
That year, during a visit to Santo Domingo, Giuliani told an audience that the solution to the country's crime problems boiled down to one thing: eliminating corruption. 
'No tolerance. Not allowed. It has to end,' Giuliani told the crowd. 'Corruption no mas.' 
Abinader lost that bid. After Trump won his White House race later that year, Giuliani invited Abinader to the inauguration, where he attended a Latino gala at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Washington and met with Giuliani and others, Abinader said. 
Abinader decided to rehire Giuliani last June, Pereyra said. Abinader said in an interview that he valued Giuliani's counsel on security matters and the firm's advice helped him generate a security plan for the country. 
'It was a very important campaign issue,' Abinader said. 'I ended up highest in the polls in terms of fighting criminality.' 

Visit from president's lawyer
By last summer, with Giuliani's Ukrainian efforts at full steam, he made a return trip to Santo Domingo. At that point, Giuliani had been Trump's personal lawyer for nearly a year and a half. 
He also had been in contact with the secretary of state. In late March, Giuliani spoke to Pompeo by phone at least twice, according to State Department emails. In May, he sent Pompeo a packet of materials about his Ukraine research in a Manila envelope with 'The White House' written as the return address, according to documents released during the impeachment probe. 
Giuliani has said repeatedly that he did not do any lobbying related to his consulting in the Dominican Republic. In a previous interview with The Post, he described his work there and in other countries as focused only on security services.
Given his prominence, the Abinader campaign asked the U.S. Embassy if it wanted to provide security for Giuliani's visit in July. Embassy officials declined, as Giuliani was not a U.S. government employee, according to Abinader advisers.
The embassy referred questions about Giuliani's visit to the State Department, which did not respond to requests for comment. 
Abinader's team picked Giuliani up from the airport on July-16. The candidate and his aides met with Giuliani in a JW Marriott conference room for a couple of hours to discuss what Giuliani would tell the press the following day. 
'Giuliani was the frontman, the personality,' said Roberto Álvarez, a former Dominican ambassador to the Organization of American States and a foreign policy adviser to Abinader who met with Giuliani that day. 'He knows nothing about the cultural context.' 
During his visit, Giuliani had dinner with Bernstein, the U.S. ambassador, and her husband, Richard, who were Republican donors and had both sold insurance to Trump while in Palm Beach. 
One person who attended the embassy dinner with Giuliani described it as a social call, not a political gathering. The only topic of conversation this person recalled was the recent deaths of tourists at Dominican resorts, an image crisis for the government at the time. 
The morning after his arrival, Giuliani had a breakfast meeting with Dominican journalists and then gave a news conference at the JW Marriott, according to the campaign.
At that time, the constitutional question had seized Dominican politics. Critics of the proposal, including Abinader and other opponents, had staged protests and rallies to demand that the pro-Medina legislature not move forward with allowing a third term. 
'Keep the rules the way they are. Respect democracy,' Giuliani told reporters that day. He mentioned he was speaking as a 'private citizen.' 
A story in the Diario Libre newspaper about his visit referred to him as 'the lawyer for the president of the United States.' A headline that day on Dominican Today, an online news site, read: 'Giuliani jumps into Dominican Republic's reelection fray.' 
His visit was closely monitored by aides to Medina, the current president, who scrutinized Giuliani's remarks to see if he was speaking on behalf of Trump.
Abinader wanted 'to associate himself with the Trump administration and show that he is America's man,' said one senior Dominican official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. 
Abinader's rival candidates also saw Giuliani's presence as an attempt to signal an endorsement from the U.S. president. 
'It's a game of perception; they're trying to leave the impression' that 'the government of the United States favors them,' said Leonel Fernández, a former president who is running again this year. 'In the end, the Dominican voters are going to decide. They don't care whether President Trump is in favor or against.' 
Álvarez, the adviser to Abinader, denied that, saying the relationship with Giuliani was only about advice on security matters. 
 'Never did we use his contact in order to move U.S. policy,' he said.
After two days, Giuliani jetted out of Santo Domingo.
The Abinader campaign is now getting consulting advice on security issues from a former Giuliani partner, John Huvane, who left Giuliani's firm in October, officials said. Huvane did not respond to a request for comment. 
In recent polls, Abinader has held a strong lead "" more than 10-points "" over his two main rivals, including Medina's handpicked successor. The election will be held in May.

The Senate passed a resolution Thursday to limit President Trump's power to order military action against Iran without first seeking Congress's permission, a bipartisan rebuke of his administration's resistance to involving the legislative branch in decisions that some fear could lead to all-out war.
Eight Republicans joined all Democrats in voting 55 to 45 for the measure, despite sharp warnings from Trump that challenging his war powers would 'show weakness' and send 'a very bad signal' to Tehran. Trump will almost certainly veto the measure once it passes the House, and neither chamber of Congress has the votes to override that veto, lawmakers say.
Democrats behind the resolution say they are convinced the measure may yet influence Trump's future decisions on the Middle East.
'We've been talking to our constituents, we've been listening to them, and we know what they think about another war in the Middle East right now,' said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.). '[Trump's] got an election that he's focused on and he wants to win. . . . He could well veto it and then adjust behavior.'
Half the Senate Republicans who broke ranks with Trump had done so before on the same issue. In June, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine), Mike Lee (R-Utah), Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Jerry Moran (R-Kan.) joined Democrats in backing an amendment to the annual defense bill requiring that Trump approach Congress before taking military action against Iran, except in cases of clear self-defense or imminent attack.
In March, those four Republican senators "" along with Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Todd C. Young (R-Ind.) "" joined Democrats to back a war-powers resolution ordering the president to stop helping the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.
The number of GOP senators willing to cross Trump over his Iran policy has risen in the wake of the strike last month that killed top Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, amid the possibility that it could have triggered a wider war without any congressional involvement.
Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.), who have voted with Trump on previous Iran and war-powers measures, joined the group of Republicans breaking with the president Thursday, stating that there are limits to how much the president can do without first consulting Congress.
For some of those Republicans, the vote was not a criticism of the Soleimani strike but an assertion of the need for congressional authorization before the administration embarks on a conflict.
'If this resolution was in effect at the beginning of the year, President Trump would have still been able to carry out strikes against Iran and General Soleimani (which I supported),' Cassidy said in a statement explaining his vote. 'The founders gave Congress the power to declare war under Article 1 of the Constitution; we should fulfill this responsibility.'
Sen. James E. Risch (R-Idaho) argued against the resolution, saying that Congress's time would be better spent passing a resolution cheering Trump, as it did for President Barack Obama for ordering the operation that led to the death of Osama bin Laden "" who, Risch argued, posed much less of an imminent threat to the country than Soleimani did.
Presidents of both parties "" including George W. Bush, Obama and Trump "" have said they have the right to order military action as a matter of self-defense when they see threats they define as 'imminent.' But some lawmakers say the executive branch has expanded its war powers to the detriment of Congress, particularly when it invokes congressional authorizations passed in 2001 and 2002 to support action in conflicts never envisioned at that time.
National security adviser Robert C. O'Brien said the strike on Soleimani was justified by Congress's 2002 authorization of the war on Iraq.
Efforts in Congress to repeal the old authorizations or write new ones have failed, amid the divide between lawmakers who want to bring troops home and those who want to provide fresh authorization for current campaigns.
The debate over Iran has also been fueled by many lawmakers' frustration at what they see as a lack of candor from administration officials about what prompted the strike on Soleimani. Officials have offered shifting explanations of the basis for the strike, including that Soleimani posed an imminent threat to U.S. personnel in the Middle East and that it was retaliation for an attack on a U.S. base in Iraq that killed a U.S. contractor.
Lee, one of the Republican senators who openly criticized the administration for its mixed and limited messages, insisted this week that voting to reassert Congress's war powers 'should not be controversial' and that reclaiming such ground from the executive branch 'doesn't show weakness, that shows strength.'
It is not clear that the bipartisan nature of the vote in the House will be as strong as it was in the Senate. The House must take up Kaine's resolution before it can be sent to Trump's desk "" something House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) promised Thursday that she would do 'in the coming weeks.'
Last month, the House passed a similar but nonbinding Iran war-powers resolution by a vote of 224 to 194. Only three Republicans joined most of the Democrats to support that measure "" far fewer than joined Democrats in 2019 to back measures preventing Trump from using federal funds to conduct operations against Iran and invoking Congress's war powers to pull back support for the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen.
One of those Republicans, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), is a close ally of Trump's and a leading voice in his party for reasserting Congress's war powers and ending endless wars. In the wake of the House's vote last month, he told Politico that he suspected he had been kept off the president's team of defenders during his impeachment trial as retaliation for his vote to constrain Trump's actions against Iran.
The vote in the Senate came barely a week after Trump was acquitted of the impeachment charges against him. The Senate's singular focus on that trial for several weeks had kept the chamber from considering the war-powers resolution that passed Thursday.

ROME "" Vice President Pence, in Israel, marked the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. He slipped a prayer into Jerusalem's Western Wall and bowed his head. And he visited with Pope Francis here in Rome before gazing upward at the Sistine Chapel.
But Pence's whirlwind, 77-hour trip abroad was nearly as notable for what he didn't do "" and didn't say "" as for what he did.
Over two full days and two stops "" the first in Jerusalem, the second in Rome "" the vice president largely escaped the impeachment vortex consuming the nation's capital some 5,000 miles away.
President Trump spent his foreign sojourn to Davos this week obsessing over the Senate trial back home "" tweeting more than a dozen times before dawn on his final day in Switzerland and railing against what he called 'the hoax' focused on his alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine for political gain. Pence, by contrast, cut a calmer and more sanguine visage, ostensibly unconcerned by the constitutional controversy raging back home.
Pence never brought up impeachment unprompted, weighing in only when asked by reporters, including during a short news conference at the end of his day in Rome.
Pence reiterated his previous claims that he had no awareness of a push by Trump and his associates, including personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, to withhold critical U.S. aid from Ukraine in exchange for an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
'What I've said over and over again is I was never aware of the allegations that there was some pressure campaign for investigations against the Bidens that was underway until those matters became public,' he said.
The vice president also added that while he had initially said he had no problem releasing a transcript of his own phone conversation with Ukraine's president, he was now more reticent after coming to believe that the Democrats' impeachment inquiry was simply a 'sham investigation.'
'The outcome here is that the president should be acquitted,' Pence said. 
Outside those brief remarks, the most tangible reminder of the latest scandal engulfing the Trump presidency followed Pence abroad in the form of the screens of Fox News "" the in-flight entertainment choice that aired parts of the impeachment proceedings as Air Force Two knifed through a darkening sky.
On Thursday, at the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, the vice president extended an invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "" as well as to Benny Gantz, his rival in the country's upcoming elections "" to travel to Washington next week for the unveiling of the administration's new peace plan.
Earlier in the day, speaking alongside other world leaders at the Holocaust remembrance site Yad Vashem to commemorate the anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation, Pence condemned the 'vile tide of anti-Semitism that is fueling hate and violence all across the world.' He also singled out Iran, calling on other nations to 'stand strong against the leading state purveyor of anti-Semitism, against the one government in the world that denies the Holocaust as a matter of state policy and threatens to wipe Israel off the map.'
The vice president, who last year visited the concentration camp in Poland where more than 1.1-million men, women and children perished under Nazi control during World War II, recounted how moving the experience was for him.
'One cannot see the piles of shoes, the gas chambers, the crematoriums, the lone boxcar facing the gate to the camp and those grainy photographs of men, women and children being sent to their deaths without asking, 'How could they?' ' he said.
Pence's latest foreign trip is another reminder of the vice president's uncanny knack for seeming to sidestep the morass of the Trump administration, often through unintentionally well-timed travel out of town.
In August 2017, Pence left for a week-long trip to Latin America immediately after deadly violence at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville. He was still abroad when Trump held a much-criticized news conference in the lobby of Trump Tower declaring that 'both sides' were to blame.
Pence did weigh in at the time from Chile but largely sidestepped a question about whether he agreed with Trump that both sides were responsible, instead simply affirming that he stood with the president. He cut his trip short by a day, returning to Washington early for a strategy meeting with Trump and his national security team at Camp David.
In early 2018, Pence was in Japan, en route to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, when news broke that staff secretary Rob Porter was being pushed from the White House amid allegations of domestic abuse from his two ex-wives.
'I learned as I awoke this morning of those developments,' Pence said, prompting a follow-up question from his traveling press corps about why he often seemed 'a little bit out of the loop on some of this major news.'
Later that year, in November, Pence again traveled to Asia, just days after Democrats won control of the House in the midterm elections, when Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, installing loyalist Matthew G. Whitaker atop the Justice Department.
In February 2019, Pence flew to Colombia to announce new sanctions against Venezuela at the beginning of the week that Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney and fixer, testified before Congress about the president's alleged misdeeds. His trip also coincided with Trump's failed summit in Hanoi with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
And throughout much of last year "" as special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's Russia probe reached its culmination and the impeachment inquiry began to boil "" Pence was hopscotching the country, helping promote Trump's trade deal with Mexico and Canada.
Pence's far-flung travels are partly a function of the unconventional Trump White House. The president is a homebody reluctant to travel abroad, frequently delegating foreign trips to his No. 2. 
On Friday in Rome, Pence appeared both geographically and mentally removed from the spectacle of impeachment.
He began his day at the Vatican, deploying his standard opening line with the pope "" an offering of his 'warmest greetings' from Trump "" before the two men exchanged gifts, with Pence, a self-described 'evangelical Catholic,' giving the leader of the faith a wooden cross.
During the meeting, Pence and the pope discussed the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, displaced religious minorities in the Middle East and the antiabortion March for Life, Pence said. 
'I won't forget "" you made me a hero,' Pence told Francis before departing through the Clement VIII door, in a possible reference to Pence's mother's admiration for the pontiff.
Pence then entered the Sistine Chapel, which was already thick with tourists, some of whom momentarily averted their eyes from Michelangelo's fresco to gape at the vice president. One woman pointed at Pence, offered a thumbs up and requested a picture.
The vice president smiled before turning back to his tour guide, who made a good-natured gesture to signify that the eager tourist was just another one of the 'Americans' "" like Pence, far from home.

The Senate voted to bar new evidence in the impeachment trial Friday, paving the way for President Trump's acquittal even as several top Republicans acknowledged that his actions toward Ukraine were not appropriate.
Eleven days into the trial, the highly anticipated vote, which was decided 51 to 49, revealed the partisan divisions in the chamber over whether to subpoena witnesses and documents, a step Democrats argued was crucial to weighing whether Trump abused his power in pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations of his political rivals. Among Republicans, only Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Mitt Romney (Utah) supported the resolution. 
In declining to add to the case presented by House Democrats, the Senate delivered a victory for the White House that all but guaranteed that Trump will remain in office. With a final vote on the articles of impeachment set for Wednesday at 4-p.m., Democrats argued that Trump's expected acquittal will be illegitimate, an acknowledgment of their looming defeat.
'If [a] judge or president believes that it is to his or her advantage that there shall be a trial with no witnesses, they will cite the case of Donald Trump,' said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), one of the House impeachment managers. 'They will make the argument that you can adjudicate the guilt or innocence of the party without hearing from a single witness, without reviewing a single document. . . . I would submit that will be a very dangerous and long-lasting precedent that we will all have to live with.'
Soon the questions surrounding Trump's actions toward Ukraine will move from the Senate floor to the campaign trail, where voters instead of lawmakers will weigh the evidence in the heat of the 2020 presidential election. 
House Democrats have promised to continue investigating Trump, and new, potentially damaging information could emerge as it has at times during the trial from an indicted former associate of Trump's personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani and a forthcoming book by John Bolton, the former national security adviser.
But on Friday, Senate Republicans said they had finished weighing the matter "" united in their decision to move on, even if members offered varying and at times conflicting reasons for their impending votes to acquit.
Trump is accused of withholding military aid and an Oval Office meeting to push Ukraine's leaders into announcing probes of Democrats, including former vice president Joe Biden, now a presidential candidate, and his son Hunter. The House impeached Trump in December on two counts "" abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. 
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) called the result of the trial 'one of the worst tragedies that the Senate has ever overcome.'
'Americans will know that this trial was not a real trial. It had no witnesses, no documents,' Schumer told reporters after the vote. 'It is a tragedy on a very large scale.'
As the Senate concluded its business for the weekend, Trump accused Democrats of 'scamming America.' 
The Senate approved a resolution setting up closing arguments Monday. Senators will have an opportunity to give speeches Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday about how they plan to vote. 
Postponing the final stage of the trial until next week will allow senators to have a full weekend and was a relief for many who have complained about long hours and uncomfortable conditions in the Senate chamber. 
But extending the timetable into next week also means the trial will collide with two other major events on the political calendar "" the Iowa caucuses on Monday, in which four Democratic senators are competing, and Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday night. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called Trump on Friday evening to brief him on the updated timetable, and the president signed off on it, according to an official familiar with the conversation. 
Trump left for Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, on Friday afternoon without taking questions from reporters.
The impeachment managers' effort to persuade Republicans to support calling witnesses was confirmed as a failure earlier in the day when pivotal swing vote Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said she would oppose the motion. 
In a sharply worded statement, Murkowski decried the impeachment process that started last fall in the House, while declining to weigh in on Trump's actions. 
'Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate,' Murkowski said. 'I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything. It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed.'
While Murkowski said her decision was based on her distaste for the process, other Republicans acknowledged to varying degrees that the president was culpable "" a shift in position for some that distanced them from the White House and served as an attempt to inoculate themselves if new incriminating details emerge.
Among the Republicans who argued Trump's behavior was wrong or problematic but not impeachable were Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.), Rob Portman (Ohio), Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.) and Lamar Alexander (Tenn.).
'Just because actions meet a standard of impeachment does not mean it is in the best interest of the country to remove a President from office,' Rubio wrote Friday in a Medium post. 
'I believe that some of the president's actions in this case . . . were wrong and inappropriate,' Portman said Friday in a statement. 'But I do not believe that the president's actions rise to the level of removing a duly-elected president from office.' 
Alexander told The Washington Post on Friday, after announcing the previous night that he would not support calling witnesses, that 'there's a difference between inappropriate conduct, which that clearly is, and treason, bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors. There's a big gap between this conduct and impeachable conduct.'
Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said he had hoped Alexander would have a 'Howard Baker moment,' referring to the Tennessee Republican senator who played a key role in ending Richard M. Nixon's presidency during Watergate and for whom Alexander was a protege.
'But it appears he will not,' Durbin said. 
Republicans staked out their positions as new revelations from Bolton's unpublished manuscript seemed to undercut key elements of Trump's defense. 
The New York Times reported Friday that Bolton writes in his forthcoming book that Trump told him in early May to call newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and ask him to meet with Giuliani, who was pushing for investigations into the Bidens and a widely contested theory that Ukraine worked with Democrats to undermine Trump during the 2016 election. 
The directive to Bolton was reportedly given during a meeting that included Giuliani, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, who has led Trump's defense on the Senate floor. If true, it would represent the earliest reported example of Trump's direct involvement in the pressure campaign against Ukraine. 
Trump denied the report in a statement, saying the meeting 'never happened.' 
But Schiff seized on it in making his argument for witnesses. 
'The facts will come out,' he said. 'They will continue to come out. And the question before you today is whether they will come out in time for you to make a complete and informed judgment as to the guilt or innocence of the president.'
Also citing Bolton's manuscript, the Times reported Sunday that in a conversation with Bolton in August, Trump directly tied his hold on $391-million of military aid to investigations into Democrats. 
New revelations have also come from Lev Parnas, the ex-Giuliani associate now facing campaign finance charges, who submitted a letter to McConnell on Friday offering to testify about his participation in an effort to oust former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and gather damaging information about Joe and Hunter Biden. 
The letter, written by Parnas's lawyers, stated that the efforts involved a large group of top Republican officials and operatives, including Vice President Pence, then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Attorney General William P. Barr, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.).
Parnas had disclosed much of the information included in the letter in recent media interviews. His claims have been disputed by various Republican leaders, including Pence and Barr.
Trump's former chief of staff, John F. Kelly, who said earlier in the week that he believed Bolton, called the Senate trial 'half a trial' if no witnesses are called. 
'In my view, they kind of leave themselves open to a lot of criticism,' Kelly said in an interview with N.J. Advance Media. 'It's a job only half done. You open yourself up forever as a Senate that shirks its responsibilities.'
As Friday night drew to a close, it appeared Trump would deliver his State of the Union address before his expected acquittal, a small messaging coup for Democrats that was played down by the White House. 
'The president is gratified that finally, at long last, after multiple delays, the Senate will set a schedule for his acquittal next week,' said White House director of legislative affairs Eric Ueland. 'We do not believe the schedule interferes with his ability to deliver a strong and confident State of the Union message next week in the House of Representatives to the country.'

We live in stupid, scary times. 
And nothing illustrates this more vividly than one bizarre development among many others: That a Fox News host managed to get the president of the United States to take the coronavirus seriously when legions of public health experts around the world - and in his own administration - could not.
For weeks, President Trump was in abject denial about the deadly pandemic. He assured Americans it would disappear while losing precious time to take precautions to prevent the disease from spreading. His administration even turned down the opportunity to use millions of diagnostic tests from private companies, The Washington Post reported. This could have made a huge difference as the United States fell behind in testing its citizens.
And at a South Carolina campaign rally in late February, Trump even brushed off his political adversaries' alarm over the virus as ""their new hoax.""
Enter Tucker Carlson, who - unlike many of his scoffing Fox News colleagues - had admirably focused his prime-time show on the global health threat for weeks, even if it seemed his excuse to stoke anti-China sentiment. He was concerned enough to head down to Trump's Florida resort in early March to talk to Trump.
 It amounted to an intervention.
""I felt I had a moral obligation to be useful in whatever small way I could,"" Carlson told Joe Hagan in a Vanity Fair interview this week. 
There was no immediate turnaround. Trump continued to downplay the threat for days. 
But by early this week, his tone and attitude had dramatically changed.
""It's as if he finally realized how monumental this crisis is,"" tweeted The Post's White House bureau chief Philip Rucker, commenting on the president's more somber public remarks. Based on White House accounts, Rucker reported that Carlson's March 9 monologue was a turning point for Trump. 
""People you know will get sick, some may die. This is real,"" Carlson said on the segment, where he also made a pointed reference to the denier-in-chief as he told his audience: ""People you trust, people you probably voted for, have spent weeks minimizing what is clearly a very serious problem.""
Was Trump's turnaround all Carlson's doing? Of course not.
With the world turned upside down and Americans dying, Trump would have been forced to reckon with the disaster eventually. But the talk-show host did seem to get through to Trump in a way that no one else could, which is completely consistent with what we know about this president. 
Trump has always placed far too much emphasis on what he sees on television, especially on Fox News, which functions as his inspiration and megaphone. Sean Hannity is a close friend and adviser, who once got a slap on the wrist from Fox News brass by appearing with Trump at a rally.
It's no secret that the revolving door between the Trump White House and Fox News has never stopped spinning: Trump hired Fox News honcho Bill Shine to be his own communications chief, and Hope Hicks has skipped back and forth between the White House and Fox News.
And, of course, Trumpian tweets often echo Fox News broadcasts in a Mobius strip of dubious information. Last month, when Trump granted clemency to 11 people, many of them had connections to Fox News.
""I watched his wife on television,"" Trump explained to reporters about his pardon of former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich, who was in prison for attempting to sell President Barack Obama's Senate seat.
All of which is well beyond unseemly. It would be shocking except that we've all grown inured to it in this norm-shattering era of reality-TV star as president.
I'm no fan of Carlson's. I was appalled at his misleading rants about the supposed migrant ""invasion"" through Mexico as he demonized immigrants for the purpose of riling up voters. (That subject, a Fox News obsession, faded away quickly after the 2018 midterm elections.)
 And last year, Carlson's dismissal of white supremacy as a problem in America - ""this is a hoax, just like the Russian hoax"" - was especially offensive because it followed the August massacre at an El Paso Walmart, described as the deadliest attack on Latinos in American history and investigated as a hate crime. 
Now, though, Carlson has done something commendable. And he may well have saved lives because there is a sizable segment of the American population that believes Trump and Fox News, and not much else. 
That a cable-news host used his outsize influence for a positive purpose is something to be grateful for. But that he had such influence to begin with is nothing short of insane.

A U.S. Senate race in Georgia has turned into a proxy war ensnaring three national Republican committees and top GOP congressional leaders in a battle over whose allies get to work for which candidates.
The fight pitted the political lieutenants of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) against top political advisers to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel.
Ostensibly, the fight concerned McConnell's explicit support for Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), who was appointed to fill the vacancy left when Johnny Isakson (R) resigned in early January due to health problems. McConnell's team has tried to suffocate any Republican opposition to Loeffler, part of his long-standing policy to blacklist any political firms that work for candidates challenging a GOP incumbent.
But this came against the backdrop of President Trump's impeachment. Trump's family and close allies pushed Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp to appoint Rep. Douglas A. Collins to replace Isakson because, in his role as ranking Republican on the House Judiciary Committee, Collins emerged as a fierce defender of the president.
Instead, Kemp appointed Loeffler as the state's first female U.S. senator, tapping a political novice with a family fortune and willingness to burn at least $20-million to win the special election. Three weeks after Loeffler was sworn in, Collins jumped into the race anyway.
What has ensued since is the type of internecine battle that left many Republicans stunned over its intensity.
It also illustrates the different rules that these national party committees employ in doling out the hundreds of millions of dollars they control during election years, with leaders like McConnell and McCarthy exerting an outsize ability to dry up consulting revenue if they deem certain firms disloyal.
After years of producing hamstrung nominees from contested primaries, the National Republican Senatorial Committee announced in 2013 that it would not allow any dollars to go toward firms that worked for GOP challengers to incumbents. Only one GOP incumbent has lost a primary challenge since then.
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has no such rule, so consultants for Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.) face no blowback in his challenge to Sen. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.).
McConnell's team offers no apology for its tactics. Its blacklist policy is well-known to every Republican consulting firm, as is its well-honed image of being willing to be the toughest kid in the political sandbox.
'With this emotional, ill-informed decision, Doug Collins has united conservatives in opposition to his candidacy, and Senator Loeffler has quickly assembled more Republican support in Georgia than Collins ever knew existed,' said NRSC spokesman Jesse Hunt, calling the four-term congressman 'a swamp creature.'
McConnell does not want to risk a divided GOP field in the initial Nov. 3 ballot, which under special election rules would force the top two finishers into an unpredictable Jan. 5 runoff if no candidate clears a 50-percent majority. He wants Loeffler to win on the first ballot in the jungle primary rather than Democrats pushing one candidate toward an outright victory while the Republican vote splits. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams are united behind the candidacy of the Rev. Raphael Warnock, pastor of the Atlanta church where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached.
Collins, a familiar face on Fox News, is repositioning himself as the anti-establishment outsider because Loeffler is tied so closely to McConnell.
'Kelly Loeffler and her allies have spent over $8-million on ads and haven't moved the needle. Georgia voters know that Doug is the president's foremost defender. They are just not buying Loeffler,' said Dan McLagan, Collins's campaign spokesman, dubbing it the 'Potomac panic polka.'
Soon after Isakson announced his retirement plans in August, Collins began considering the Senate race. In early October, his campaign paid almost $30,000 to John McLaughlin, a well-known Republican pollster. With impeachment looming, Collins signed Convergence Media onto his House campaign account to boost his online fundraising presence.
Rob Simms and Mike Shields founded the firm after a wealth of experience helping run the National Republican Congressional Committee and the RNC. They maintain a close connection to McCarthy, whose campaign paid Convergence more than $1-million for fundraising consulting in 2019, according to Federal Election Commission records. The firm receives a $15,000-a-month retainer from the NRCC and is poised to work on the committee's vast 'independent expenditures' unit that does advertising in individual House races.
The firm plays a smaller role in Senate races, collecting almost $1.5-million in 2018 from the NRSC for work on three Senate races.
Kevin McLaughlin, NRSC's executive director, served as the blunt-force object in taking on those considering working for Collins, according to participants who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the internal fight.
McLaughlin, a longtime member of 'Team Mitch,' as the political operation bills itself, delivered a forceful recitation of the committee's policy, explaining how firms would lose access to consulting contracts.
Clients of the firms considering the Collins's race heard from NRSC officials.
One GOP consultant told McLaughlin that he was not afraid of the purported $20-million Loeffler was willing to spend. '$100 million,' McLaughlin responded.
The message was clear: Loeffler, a business executive and co-owner of a WNBA team, is willing to spend whatever it takes to win. Her husband, Jeffrey Sprecher, is chairman of the New York Stock Exchange.
The three GOP leaders "" McConnell, McCarthy and McDaniel "" never spoke to one another about the feud, according to their advisers. But the messages were sent at the highest staff levels.
NRSC officials complained to top advisers of McDaniel, who employs Shields's wife, Katie Walsh, as a consultant. And McConnell's world made their displeasure clear to McCarthy's orbit.
The harder McConnell's team fought, the deeper some firms dug in on their support of Collins.
Trump's lack of clarity on the Senate race has probably played a critical role in the final decisions.
At a White House celebration after his impeachment acquittal, Trump further confused things by praising Loeffler and Collins. 'Something is going to happen,' the president said, suggesting everything would work out.
Loeffler's side saw that as Trump looking to appoint Collins to something to get him out of the race. Collins's team read it as exactly the opposite: Trump looking to get Loeffler out.
It became impossible for firms like Convergence to go with Collins if it were possible Trump would endorse Loeffler somewhere down the line.
In a roughly 10-day span after Collins entered the race, Convergence Media declined to work on his Senate race, followed by a direct-mail firm and John McLaughlin, the GOP pollster.
The Collins campaign is stocking its lineup with other firms and vowing to fight, happy to run as the aggrieved outsider.
'The same D.C. establishment political swamp,' Collins tweeted Friday, 'that tried to stop President Trump is trying to stop me now!'

LEAVING HIM IN PLACE A DIRE RISK, THEY SAY
Impeachment managers assail president's character
House prosecutors finished their opening arguments in President Trump's impeachment trial on Friday, arguing that his conduct toward Ukraine reflected a dangerous reflex toward political expediency and a lack of character that will backfire on Republicans if they do not help remove him from office.
Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and his colleagues attempted to drive this argument home Friday to sway a handful of Republican senators whose position on gathering further evidence will determine the arc and scope of the trial. Yet there were few signs that any Republican was persuaded, leaving open the matter of possible witness testimony and further dampening Democrats' already meager hopes of a conviction in the GOP-controlled Senate. 
Schiff's pointed and increasingly personal approach was an attempt to go beyond the specifics of House Democrats' case to make the broader argument that Trump is an untrustworthy president who is likely to repeatedly flout the Constitution if allowed to stay in office.
'It goes to character,' Schiff said. 'You don't realize how important character is in the highest office in the land until you don't have it.' 
The Democrats' closing statements were their final appeal to senators before the next phase of the trial: an aggressive rebuttal from Trump's lawyers that will kick off Saturday and continue in earnest on Monday.
Speaking Friday on the Senate floor "" hours after new evidence emerged of Trump's campaign to oust the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine starting in 2018 "" Schiff predicted that Trump's future behavior would vindicate Democrats' claim that he abused his power, and he warned Republicans the president, now their ally, could ultimately turn on them.
'Do you think for a moment that any of you "" no matter what your relationship with this president, no matter how close you are to this president "" do you think for a moment that if he felt it was in his interest, he wouldn't ask you to be investigated?' he asked.
The remarks concluded the House managers' case for the first article of impeachment, which charges Trump with abuse of power over allegations he withheld military aid and an Oval Office meeting from Ukraine to pressure the country's leaders into announcing investigations into Trump's political rivals. These included former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, while his father was in office. The managers spent the rest of the day detailing their case for the second article of impeachment "" obstruction of Congress, following Trump's barring the executive branch from cooperating with the House investigation. 
The Senate will reconvene Saturday at 10 a.m. for several hours of what Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow described as 'coming attractions' from his side "" a preview of the pro-Trump case before the full-scale presentation begins Monday. The timetable is aimed at garnering peak television viewership "" a priority for Trump as he faces the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history "" though Sekulow also said that his side would not use its full 24-hour time allotment for defending Trump. 
'We're not going to try to run the clock out,' he said this week.
Democrats faced continued criticism from Republicans that their presentations were tedious and difficult to follow.
'I just thought yesterday was like, too much,' said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), calling the remarks repetitive and 'mind-numbing.' 'This needs to end. They've had an opportunity to make their case.'
While many Republicans echoed the view that the trial has been repetitive, every member of the Senate GOP caucus has voted against hearing from new witnesses or collecting new evidence.
It was clear when the trial resumed at 1 p.m. on Friday afternoon that Schiff heeded some of Republicans' complaints: rather than speaking for hours at a time, the managers presented in shorter spurts, rotating more often and punctuating their remarks with more video clips. 
After Trump's defense concludes, mostly likely on Monday, the trial will enter a question-and-answer phase that will last for up to 16 hours. This is expected to take place Tuesday and Wednesday, followed by a debate Thursday over whether to seek testimony from witnesses. Democrats are pushing for former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to appear, while most Republicans have shot down the idea of hearing from witnesses. But they have said that if Democrats secure the votes to subpoena any of their choices, the GOP will push for Joe or Hunter Biden to appear.
Democrats need four Republicans to join them in any attempt to secure new testimony or evidence and the senators being targeted have been careful to say that they have made no decision "" while giving no indication they are moving closer to supporting any subpoenas.
Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), one of the most closely watched Republican senators, said Friday that the House managers had 'presented us with a mountain of overwhelming evidence,' though it was unclear which way he was leaning on the question of hearing more. 
Alexander told reporters that he will make his decision on admitting witnesses and other new evidence only after the White House defense team makes its case.
'I think that question can only be answered then,' he said. 'We've been polite to the House managers, listened to them carefully, and now we're going to do the same with the president's lawyers. I think the House managers have done a good job of making their arguments. But that doesn't mean I will agree with them.'
Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) raised the prospect that a Senate trial could drag on for months if Trump administration witnesses are called, arguing that the issue of executive privilege would have to be litigated in the courts.
'This could tie up the Senate through the election and even beyond as the courts litigate these claims,' Cornyn said during an appearance on conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt's syndicated radio show. 'We'll wait and see, but right now, I'm not for extending this for months and months while claims of privilege and the like are litigated in the courts.'
The question of whether the Senate will seek more evidence was heightened Friday by a new Washington Post-ABC News poll revealing that a majority of American adults, 66 percent, support the Senate calling new witnesses to testify, as opposed to 27 percent who don't.
ABC News also reported Friday that it reviewed a recording of Trump at a private dinner telling associates that he wanted then-U. S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch gone, a reminder of the evidence yet to be uncovered about Trump's actions. 
'Get rid of her! Get her out tomorrow. I don't care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. Okay? Do it,' Trump is heard saying, according to ABC News.
Schiff challenged the Senate to call the administration's bluff on whether witnesses would be limited from testifying by executive privilege and let Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is presiding over the trial, make those calls.
Calling executive privilege 'the last refuge of the president's team to conceal the evidence from the American people,' Schiff argued that Roberts should 'decide issues of evidence and privilege' whenever witnesses or the president claim it, but that the assumption Trump will try to silence certain witnesses by claiming executive privilege should not keep the Senate from calling them to testify.
'The Senate will always have the opportunity to overrule the justice,' Schiff said to reporters, adding that 'you cannot use executive privilege to hide wrongdoing or criminality or impeachable misconduct, and that is exactly the purpose for which they seek to use-it.' 
After Roberts scolded both sides for overheated rhetoric late Tuesday night, Democrats took pains to tone down their accusations against Trump and his supporters in the Senate. 
Yet Schiff also sharpened his case on Friday, arguing that Republicans trust Trump at their own peril. 
He invoked the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) in arguing about the strategic importance of Ukraine as a U.S. ally and quoted him as saying, 'We are all Ukrainians.'
And he made a lengthy case that Trump's skepticism about the conclusions of U.S. intelligence services "" particularly about Russian interference in the 2016 election "" represents a 'coup' for Russia. 
'Has there ever been such a coup? I would submit to you that in the entire length of the Cold War, the Soviet Union had no such success. No such success,' Schiff said. 'I hope it was worth it. I hope it was worth it for the president. Because it certainly wasn't worth it for the United States.'
Trump's defenders are focused on Biden's push to oust former Ukraine prosecutor-general Viktor Shokin, who was overseeing a probe of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma and its owner at the same time that Biden's son was serving as a member of the company's board. 
Biden's actions were in line with official U.S. and European policy at the time "" a consensus that Shokin was involved in corrupt schemes and needed to be removed. 
Democrats detailed these facts on Thursday with the awareness that Trump's legal team was likely to focus on them during their defense of the president.
The president's aides and allies continued to portray the trial as a waste of time and one that is not capturing the public's attention. 
'As you've seen, the ratings keep going down every day in terms of viewers,' White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said on Fox News. 'I think that next week, we need to get this over with so we can get on with the business of the country.'Schiff concluded his remarks Friday night with a different message as he urged senators to support hearing more evidence.
'I ask you. I implore you: Give America a fair trial,' he told senators. 'Give America a fair trial. She's worth it.'

assertion of justice dept. independence
Stone case is part of deeper tensions with White House
Attorney General William P. Barr pushed back hard Thursday against President Trump's attacks on the Justice Department, saying, 'I'm not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody,' an assertion of independence that could jeopardize his tenure as the nation's top law enforcement official.
The remarkable public rebuke of the president by a sitting member of his Cabinet arose from a crisis of confidence at the Justice Department, which had been accused this week of buckling to an angry tweet the president issued after learning of prosecutors' initial prison recommendation for his longtime friend, Roger Stone.
'I think it's time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases,' Barr said in an interview with ABC News, adding that such statements 'about the department, about people in the department, our men and women here, about cases pending here, and about judges before whom we have cases, make it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors and the department that we're doing our work with integrity.'

People close to Barr said that in recent months he has become increasingly frustrated with Trump's tweets about the Justice Department. The president, they said, seemed not only to be undercutting his own political momentum but also to be fostering doubts about the department's independence. Trump's tweet complaining that he believed his friend was being treated unfairly proved something of a last straw, they said, because it was so damaging to morale at the department.
Barr was comfortable not being universally loved by career employees, but he felt the tweet Tuesday raised a bigger problem, giving people reason to wonder whether the department had been corrupted by political influence and decided he could no longer remain silent about the president's public denunciations, these people said.
Like others, they spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail private discussions within the administration.
Behind that public fight, according to people familiar with the discussions, is a deeper tension between Trump and Barr's Justice Department over the lack of criminal charges against former FBI director James B. Comey and those close to him. 
The tension has worsened in the past month, these people said, and came to a head Monday when prosecutors on the Stone case filed a recommendation to the court that Stone receive a seven- to nine-year prison sentence for his conviction on charges of obstruction of Congress and witness tampering. 
On Tuesday, after Trump denounced the move, the Justice Department filed a softer sentencing recommendation, and the four prosecutors who signed the initial court filing quit the Stone case. One left the government entirely. 
Barr insisted Thursday that he had planned to modify the sentencing recommendation before Trump issued his tweet but that the president's comments made the department look bad.
Since becoming attorney general last year, Barr has enthusiastically defended the president, much to the frustration of congressional Democrats and some current and former Justice Department officials upset over what they consider an erosion of the agency's independence. Thursday's interview marked a stunning break from that practice. 
The attorney general said he was prepared to accept the consequences of his comments.
'I cannot do my job here at the department with a constant background commentary that undercuts me,' he said. He also noted that when he became attorney general, he pledged to resist improper influence from any quarter, whether Congress, the White House or elsewhere.
The president has harshly criticized multiple current and former Justice Department officials "" and a federal judge "" over prosecutions and investigations involving Trump's former associates and alleged leaking by government officials. But Barr insisted Thursday that Trump 'has never asked me to do anything in a criminal case.' Trump, he said, 'never' talked with him about the Stone sentencing recommendation, and he had 'not discussed the Roger Stone case at the White House.'
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement late Thursday that the president had not lost confidence in the attorney general.
'The President wasn't bothered by the comments at all and he has the right, just like any American citizen, to publicly offer his opinions,' Grisham said. 'President Trump uses social media very effectively to fight for the American people against injustices in our country, including the fake news. The President has full faith and confidence in Attorney General Barr to do his job and uphold the law.'
The flare-up over the Stone case comes against a backdrop of growing behind-the-scenes anger from the president toward the Justice Department "" more about whom the department has not charged with crimes than about whom it has charged, according to people familiar with the discussions.
Trump has repeatedly complained about FBI Director Christopher A. Wray in recent months, saying that Wray has not done enough to change the FBI's culture, purge the bureau of people who are disloyal to him or change policies after violations of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
He has also tweeted many times that he thinks Comey should be charged with crimes, and he was particularly upset that no charges were filed over the former FBI director's handling of memos about his interactions with Trump. An inspector general report faulted the former director for keeping some of those memos at his home and for arranging for the contents of one of the memos to be shared with a reporter after Comey was fired in 2017.
Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz referred Comey's handling of the memos to prosecutors for possible criminal prosecution, but lawyers quickly determined it was not a close call and did not seek to build a case.
That sent Trump into a rage, according to people briefed on his comments. He complained so loudly and swore so frequently in the Oval Office that some of his aides discussed it for days, these people said. Trump repeatedly said that Comey deserved to be charged, according to their account.
'Can you [expletive] believe they didn't charge him?' Trump said on the night of the decision, these people said. Trump has also wanted charges filed against Comey's former deputy, Andrew McCabe. A separate inspector general investigation concluded that McCabe lied to investigators about his role in authorizing disclosures for a Wall Street Journal story in October 2016 about internal FBI tensions over an investigation of the Clinton Foundation. A grand jury in Washington seemed poised to make a decision on the case last year before fizzling into inaction.
Trump's anger over the lack of charges against FBI personnel flared again in January, prompted by two unrelated developments, according to people familiar with the matter.
First, prosecutors updated their position in the case of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, saying a sentence of some prison time would be appropriate. Around the same time, The Washington Post reported that U.S. Attorney John Huber in Utah "" tapped years earlier to reinvestigate several issues related to vague allegations of corruption against Hillary Clinton "" had quietly wound down his work after finding nothing of consequence.
Those two developments further enraged the president, according to people familiar with the discussions. These people said that while the public debate in recent days has focused on leniency for Stone, the president is more upset that the Justice Department has not been tougher on his perceived enemies.
In the president's mind, it is unacceptable that people such as Comey and McCabe have not been charged, particularly if people such as Stone and Flynn are going to be treated harshly, these people said.
In recent weeks, these people said, the president's anger has focused increasingly on Jessie Liu, the former U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, whose office has been handling many of the cases related to Comey and other former FBI officials.
That office has recently conducted interviews in a leak inquiry, eyeing senior FBI officials over news stories in 2017 that discussed a top-secret Russian intelligence document that influenced Comey's decision-making in 2016. Many of investigators' questions have seemed focused on the former FBI director.
Separately, Barr tapped U.S. Attorney John Durham in Connecticut to investigate whether any crimes were committed by FBI and CIA officials in the pursuit of allegations in 2016 that Russia interfered in the election to benefit Trump's campaign.
After learning that the Huber investigation is not likely to produce charges, Trump has become more insistent that Durham finish his work soon, according to people familiar with the discussions. Trump, these people said, wants to be able to use whatever Durham finds as a cudgel in his reelection campaign.
All of that frustration has fed into the public fight over the Stone case. 
In Thursday's ABC News interview, Barr said that he was surprised by prosecutors' first filing in the Stone case and that the president's tweet had nothing to do with his decision to soften the Stone sentencing recommendation less than 24 hours after it was filed.
The attorney general said that Tim Shea, Liu's successor as U.S. attorney for the District, had spoken with him briefly Monday, before the Stone filing, and told him the prosecutors 'very much wanted to recommend the seven to nine years to the judge.' But Barr claimed that Shea told him 'he thought that there was a way of satisfying everybody and providing more flexibility.'
'I was under the impression that what was going to happen was very much as I had suggested, which is deferring to the judge, and then pointing out various factors and circumstances,' Barr said.
Barr said when he saw news reports Monday night of the recommendation that was filed, he thought, 'Gee, the news is spinning this; this is not what we were going to do.'
'I was very surprised,' Barr said. 'And once I confirmed that that's actually what we filed, I said that night, to my staff, that we had to get ready because we had to do something in the morning to amend that and clarify what our position was.'
Next came the president's tweet complaining that Stone was being treated unfairly, which Barr said put him in an untenable position.
'Once the tweet occurred, the question is, 'Well, now what do I do?'-' Barr said. 'And do you go forward with what you think is the right decision, or do you pull back because of the tweet? And that just sort of illustrates how disruptive these tweets can be.'
Barr said Trump would be within his rights to ask for an investigation in an area that didn't affect his personal interests "" such as in a terrorism case, or fraud by a bank. But he said an attorney general would not listen to an order to investigate a political opponent.
'If he were to say go investigate somebody, and you sense it's because they're a political opponent, then an attorney general shouldn't carry that out, wouldn't carry that out,' Barr said.
Stone was convicted by a jury in November. The charges against him were the last filed by former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III as part of his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
The new sentencing recommendation "" signed by Shea and a different career prosecutor "" said the previous guidance 'could be considered excessive and unwarranted under the circumstances.' Shea, a former close adviser to Barr at Justice Department headquarters, was installed at the U.S. attorney's office in the District last month.
Prosecutors and defense lawyers can only make recommendations about prison sentences. Stone's sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 20 before U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, whom Trump also targeted this week in tweets complaining about her treatment of Paul Manafort, his former campaign chairman, and suggesting Jackson had, in another case, gone too easy on his Democratic rival in 2016, Hillary Clinton.

President Trump is preparing to push out a national security official who testified against him during the impeachment inquiry after he expressed deep anger on Thursday over the attempt to remove him from office because of his actions toward Ukraine.
Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman "" a National Security Council aide who testified during House Democrats' impeachment hearings "" will be informed in the coming days, likely on Friday, by administration officials that he is being reassigned to a position at the Defense Department, taking a key figure from the investigation out of the White House, according to two people familiar with the move who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss personnel decisions. 
Vindman had already informed senior officials at the NSC that he intended to take an early exit from his assignment and leave his post by the end of the month, according to people familiar with his decision, but Trump is eager to make a symbol of the Army officer soon after the Senate acquitted him of the impeachment charges approved by House Democrats.
Trump made clear on Thursday that he is ready to make his impeachment a key part of his reelection strategy and highlight his anger at Democratic leaders who led the charge to remove him from office, as well as Republicans who did not embrace the defense of his actions even though he was acquitted by the Senate on Wednesday.
At an event in the East Room of the White House, he called Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) a 'horrible person' and derided Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) as a flip-flopping Republican with 'no sign of principles' whose vote to convict Trump on abuse of power charges was born not out of principle but bitterness over his failed 2012 presidential bid.
And he kicked off the day at the National Prayer Breakfast by questioning the two lawmakers' claims about the role religion plays in their public lives.
'I don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong. Nor do I like people who say, 'I pray for you,' when they know that that's not so,' he told a room full of religious leaders.
Trump and his allies are considering doing more than just launching verbal fusillades at his perceived enemies over impeachment as the decision regarding Vindman shows. Some of the president's aides are discussing whether to remove or reassign several administration officials who testified during the impeachment inquiry, according to aides and advisers who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the plans. Meanwhile, Senate committee chairmen are ramping up their investigation into Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine while his father, Joe, was vice president.
'Lieutenant Colonel Col. Vindman and his twin brother "" right? "" we had some people that "" really amazing,' Trump said during an event at the White House, mocking the national security counsel aide who testified during hearings investigating the White House's actions toward Ukraine.
Trump has complained about Vindman in private, mocking the way he spoke, wore his uniform and conducted himself during the impeachment inquiry, according to people familiar with his remarks. He has discussed with aides removing other national security officials who testified or cooperated with House Democrats, with Trump calling them disloyal and asking whether he should further cull his national security staff after impeachment. He remains incensed that so many people in his administration testified last year, according to allies of the president. No final decisions have been made on what to do with the officials, these people said.
 But the White House is not hiding from the fact it would like to see Democrats and Romney to feel some pain for their role in his impeachment.
Stephanie Grisham, the president's press secretary, said making people pay for their conduct was a reason Trump held an event Thursday in the East Room of the White House, which Trump later said was not a speech but a 'celebration' of his acquittal by the Senate a day earlier.
Advisers to the president said Trump is already thinking about a scorched-earth nine-month campaign and how Democrats might attack him next "" and how he can land punches of his own.
'He's keenly aware of the fact that the Democrats only have one play: to destroy him personally every single day … until November,' said Jason Miller, an informal adviser and former campaign aide.
 Additionally, Trump sees it as valuable to frame previous investigations as witch hunts because he expects more probes, Miller and other Trump allies said, and the president has told his aides that Democrats will continue to investigate his finances, his Cabinet officials and his interactions with foreign leaders. 
Trump was not in a reflective mood about his conduct on Thursday.
He was impeached by the House on charges that he abused his office and obstructed Congress. The crux of the case against him is the allegation that he withheld military aid and a White House meeting to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden "" who served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, while his father was vice president "" as well as a widely discredited theory that Ukrainians interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Trump has denied any wrongdoing and "" despite some Republican senators calling his action wrong even if not impeachable "" he has shown no remorse.
That was evident from the time he left the White House on Thursday morning on his way to the prayer breakfast being held at a nearby hotel.
He rewrote parts of his speech for the event, scribbling en route, to highlight his impeachment and attack his foes at a traditionally staid, nonpartisan affair, according to officials. When Arthur Brooks, a conservative columnist, encouraged guests at the breakfast to 'love your enemies' and set aside contempt, Trump pointedly said that he did not concur.
'I don't know if I agree with you. I don't know if Arthur is going to like what I'm going to say,' he said, before attacking both Pelosi and Romney from the dais at the Washington Hilton. 
His event in the East Room later in the day was part celebration, part tirade as he thanked his supporters and laid into his critics.
'They are vicious and mean, vicious. These people are vicious,' he said of Democrats before focusing specifically on Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who led the impeachment inquiry.
He brought up Hunter Biden, criticizing his role in Ukraine and mocking him for being discharged from the Navy Reserve after allegedly testing positive for cocaine.
Trump plans to repeatedly bring up the younger Biden on the campaign trail, according to White House officials, hoping to use it against Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, and to argue that Democrats are corrupt. Neither Biden has been charged with any wrongdoing by Ukrainian officials.
Trump has continued to suggest to aides that his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, could have valuable information and that Hunter Biden resonates with the general public.
He may get help on this topic from Senate Republicans.
In a letter sent Wednesday to the head of the Secret Service, two Senate committee chairmen wrote that they are 'reviewing potential conflicts of interest posed by the business activities of Hunter Biden and his associates during the Obama administration, particularly with respect to his business activities in Ukraine and China.'
Sens. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa) and Ron Johnson (Wis.) said they are seeking information on any instances when Hunter Biden traveled with a protective security detail during the time his father was vice president, as well as when he flew on government planes.
Trump has been convinced by polling and rallies in recent months that relentlessly attacking Pelosi is key to his reelection success, and he has shown flashes of anger when discussing her, according to aides. 
Republican lawmakers and Trump have also discussed ways to exact revenge on Schiff for his leading role in the president's impeachment, according to people familiar with the conversations.
Some White House, campaign and congressional officials are pushing Trump to move on from talking about impeachment or attacking Romney, the lone Republican to vote for his conviction. RNC and campaign officials said they were happy Thursday that Trump did not seem to have a specific plan to take on Romney, even as the White House lashed into him in a long page of talking points. 
'There's a lot of anger there. But I think this, too, shall pass,' said Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah), a Trump ally. 

Trump's allies said he is in his strongest political position in years. His poll numbers rose during impeachment, with Gallup showing him at 49 percent approval, and the economy is performing well overall. Voters have not yet coalesced around a candidate in the splintered Democratic presidential field. And with the impeachment probe and the Russia investigation over, no investigative threat currently appears to loom over the president.

Aides said the mood in the West Wing is brighter than it has been in many months. 

'Look at the successes we've had. Contrast that to the Democrats,' House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said.

Several Senate Democrats are privately discussing the possibility of calling Republicans' bluff on witnesses, weighing an unusual trade in President Trump's impeachment trial: the testimony of Hunter Biden for the testimony of a key administration official.
Publicly, most Democrats have scoffed at the growing GOP clamor to hear former vice president Joe Biden's son testify, dismissing him as irrelevant to the charges against Trump and accusing Republicans of trying to distract from the allegations against the president.
But behind closed doors, a small group of Democratic senators and aides has begun to question that logic, sounding out colleagues on whether to back a witness deal that could lead to testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton or other administration officials with possible firsthand knowledge of the Ukraine controversy, according to multiple Democratic officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private discussions. 
These Democrats said they believe having Hunter "" or possibly Joe Biden "" testify could backfire on Trump and the GOP, giving Biden and the party a platform to strike back and paint Republicans and the White House as obsessed with trying to damage one of Trump's 2020 presidential rivals.
'If you want to give Joe Biden an opportunity to sit in the well of the Senate and answer the question, 'Do you think the president acted appropriately?' go right ahead,' said Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), a Biden supporter who is close with the family. Coons has not discussed the matter with Biden or Democratic leaders but said his longtime friend could hold his own.
'I can't imagine a person more comfortable in the well of the Senate than a man who spent 36 years here as a United States senator,' he said.
Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said Hunter Biden is immaterial to the impeachment charges, but he left the door open to the possibility of having him testify.
'If there are four Republicans who open the conversation about witnesses, then I assume there will be a negotiation that follows "" but I can't tell you where it goes,' he said.
The discussions about the Bidens are being closely held, and the issue is fraught for Democrats, due to the differing levels of support for Biden in a chamber stocked with presidential candidates and the clashing views on impeachment strategy. In private conversations in recent days, there has been much loathing of the Republicans' spotlight on the Bidens among Senate Democrats, but also a fear that unless a witness deal is eventually struck, the trial could proceed without witnesses, according to party officials and Senate aides.
That predicament has led to discussions about whether, down the line, Hunter Biden or Joe Biden should be considered as part of a witness proposal. But there is hesitancy to raise the issue publicly until Senate Democratic leaders signal interest, the officials and aides said.
'Whether I'd make a trade or not, I'd have to think about it, but the question is then: Well, how does that get us more information about the charges that have been put forth?' said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), who added that he believed Hunter Biden was irrelevant to Trump's impeachment charges.
The House impeachment charges center on the allegation that Trump withheld military aid and a White House meeting to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, as well as a discredited theory that Ukraine worked with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 election.
Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, when his father served as vice president. Trump and his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani have promoted an unfounded allegation that Biden tried to stop a corruption investigation in Ukraine to protect his son, who is no longer on Burisma's board. Hunter Biden was not accused of wrongdoing.
Inside Biden's 2020 operation, there is little interest in publicly engaging with what Biden's advisers and friends dismiss as 'a stupid Republican talking point,' said a person familiar with the campaign's stance on the issue, who like others involved with the former vice president spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the issue. These people also described Biden as sensitive to how his family is covered in the media and used by political opponents. 
'Biden and his people don't want to give it credibility, so there is a stalemate right now, in terms of doing anything new,' one Biden associate said regarding whether the former vice president or his son would testify. 
A Biden campaign aide sharply criticized Republicans on Tuesday for their emphasis on Hunter Biden amid Trump's impeachment, calling it a 'sad and obvious attempt at diversion.'
'Joe Biden was on the exact same page as Republicans and the rest of the Western world when he helped oust' Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin in 2016, the Biden campaign aide said. 'What's more, Hunter Biden's role with Burisma was announced in the spring of 2014 and was well-covered. The GOP didn't say a word about any of this until now, half a decade later.'
The topic appears to also annoy some Senate Democrats who are wary of publicly discussing an issue they contend is political gamesmanship by Republicans and should not be a part of Trump's trial. On Tuesday, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) scolded a reporter who inquired about the matter "" even though he said Sunday on CNN's 'State of the Union' that he was 'fine' with Hunter Biden testifying if it would lead to Trump officials appearing before the Senate. 
'It's a typical Donald Trump-Mitch McConnell distraction that the national media continues to play with and continues to assist them,' he said. 'I rarely criticize the media, but I just, I continue to hear this 'Hunter Biden' stuff like this has anything to do with it. And it all helps [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell just to muddy the waters.'
Brown's comments underscore how Democrats are grappling with whether to horse trade with Republicans on witnesses. If they make a deal and acquiesce to GOP demands on the Bidens, they'd be throwing one of their top 2020 candidates into the messy impeachment battle. But if they refuse to engage "" and are unable to persuade enough Republicans to join them in demanding witnesses "" they may never uncover what Trump said to his top aides about Ukraine.
For now, Senate Democrats are being advised by their leadership to reject the idea of a trade-off out of hand, keeping the focus instead on the GOP's refusal to subpoena key administration officials who may have firsthand knowledge about Trump's actions toward Ukraine. 
'The whole discussion is silly because Hunter Biden is not a witness to this matter. . . . Why not call him as a witness in the O.J. trial?' said Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), who caucuses with Democrats.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) initially floated the idea of a Hunter Biden-for-Bolton trade-off during a private GOP meeting last week. Since then, Hunter Biden's potential testimony has emerged as a potential flash point as it becomes clear that Republicans are determined to either avoid witnesses altogether or seek to trade one witness for another.
Most Democrats see the proposal by Cruz "" which has been echoed by other supporters of the president "" as an obvious gambit to prod Democrats toward a deal that would swing the spotlight away from Trump. 
'Hunter Biden is not accused of withholding $391 million of congressional authorized defense spending for one of our allies who's under attack by Russia,' said Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.), Biden's home-state colleague in the Senate for many years. 'Donald Trump is. We need to keep that in mind.'
Democrats interested in a possible deal said they would want an assurance from the president that he would not assert executive privilege over Bolton or whichever witness they choose. Most acknowledge that an agreement seems unlikely, even as they insist it isn't off the table. 
One Democrat argued it could be risky for the Biden campaign but said it could also give them a chance to steal the microphone from Trump. Additionally, some Democrats privately say Hunter, with his well-chronicled struggle with addiction, could come across as a sympathetic figure under GOP attacks. 
One idea that has been informally floated, according to two people close to the Biden campaign, is to instead offer testimony from Joe Biden in exchange for testimony from Trump. That would allow Democrats to put the spotlight on Trump's conduct while getting a chance to engage the president directly. Others have suggested that Biden could appear instead of his son, detailing his work fighting corruption in Ukraine and lambasting Republicans for attacking his family, which has been beset by tragedy.
Biden allies worry that allowing him or Hunter to get involved in impeachment would only distract from the former vice president's effort to win the nomination. But Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), a Biden supporter, said the former vice president won't let that happen, predicting that he 'is going stay focused on the issues facing Youngstown, Ohio, and places like it.'
'Joe isn't going to let the Republicans' M.O. "" trying to get Hunter to testify or whatever it is "" distract him,' he said.

His ouster would leave in place Supreme Court justices, policies and a party he defined, says scholar

Among the least convincing of the mainly irrelevant or disingenuous arguments asserted by President Trump's legal team during his Senate impeachment trial is that Trump's removal from office would amount to 'a brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election,' as White House lawyers Jay Sekulow and Pat Cipollone put it.
Swallowing this argument requires overlooking that the Constitution provides the American people with the ability to remove as well as to elect their chief executive, specifically through impeachment. And in the event of Trump's ejection, the presidency would go to his 2016 Republican running mate, Vice President Pence, not to his Democratic opponent in that race, Hillary Clinton "" let alone to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, third in the presidential line of succession.
Trump's departure would also mean that at least 20 Republican senators voted for removal, which at this point seems about as likely as a meteor hitting the Capitol. And even after removal, Citizen Trump could still run for president this year unless the Senate took a separate vote barring him from holding future office. 
But suppose an alternative-universe scenario in which Trump somehow was forced out of political life. Even in that universe, the 2016 election stands. Three years of Trump's occupation of the Oval Office are proof. For their votes, the Americans who put him there have two Supreme Court justices, the appointments of nearly 200 other conservative judges at all levels of the federal judiciary, a multibillion-dollar tax bill, a massive boost in military spending, the rollback of nearly 100 environmental regulations, and cuts to a number of health and social welfare programs. Those votes would not be torn up, as Cipollone asserted at the trial on Thursday. Those people and policies would not be dislodged. And that is because very little about our politics would change. The Republican Party is likely to remain a Trumpian party for the foreseeable future, whether Trump leads it or not, marked by the same uneasy combination of policy initiatives that mainly benefit the GOP's donor class, plus Trump-style unilateralism, demonization of political enemies and the continuous ceding of congressional power to the executive branch. The polarization that divides American society would only worsen with Trump's involuntary ouster "" perhaps even prolonging Trumpism.
A President Pence might want to return to some of the core Republican beliefs Trump jettisoned, such as free trade, small government and balanced budgets. But even before Trump entered the political scene, the Republicans were becoming the party of the white working class, for whom traditional GOP policies held little appeal. Such voters would push back hard against any leader of their party who may wish to tout the benefits of globalization, privatize or significantly cut entitlements like Social Security and Medicare that greatly benefit the white working class, or provide a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants along the lines of the amnesty Ronald Reagan offered through 1986's immigration reform.
The reality is that it will be a long time, if ever, before we see a return to a Reaganite Republican Party, so long as the party retains its base among the non-college-educated whites who now make up 6 out of 10 Republican voters. Trump rebranded the party around their economic, cultural and racial resentments. This intensified the devotion of such voters to their 'maximum leader' but accelerated the departure of the college-educated suburban voters who once reliably voted Republican. It will be exceptionally difficult for post-Trump GOP leaders to change that dynamic, even if they understand the perils of alienating the rest of society outside of the party's shrinking demographic base.
It's true that a President Pence probably would behave in a more conventionally 'presidential' manner than Trump. He most likely would abandon Trump's habit of savaging his enemies via Twitter and would restore a measure of order to the chaotic disunity that currently prevails in the executive branch. He would be less inclined to openly flout the constitutional and democratic norms that presidents of both parties used to uphold, and more inclined to utter the occasional bromide about the need for national unity. 
But the country's polarization ultimately stems less from malignant political rhetoric than from the widening division between prospering metropolitan areas, where the gains from the booming economy go disproportionately to the well-educated and highly skilled, and decaying rural areas and postindustrial cities and towns. 
Much of Trump's strength as a candidate in 2016 lay in his ability to talk about the problems that lopsidedly afflict those left-behind regions "" problems that other candidates from both parties found it convenient to ignore. These include economic inequality, manufacturing decline, family breakdown, crumbling infrastructure, the underemployment of prime working-age men, and the opioid epidemic and 'deaths of despair' that drove down American life expectancy for three years (though it rose slightly in 2018).
However, few of these problems have been seriously addressed under Trump, and most have grown worse. It's doubtful that Clinton, who was very much the candidate of the status quo and would constantly have been at swords' points with a Republican-controlled Congress, would have had any more success in dealing with them if she had won. To be sure, the United States under a Clinton presidency would not have withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement or the Iran nuclear deal, nor would the Trumpian executive orders, tax cuts or judicial appointments have happened. But nearly all the structural drivers of polarization would have remained firmly in place. In this deep systemic sense, at least, it made little difference which party won the 2016 presidential election. 
A successful effort to deal with these fundamental problems "" and other existential issues such as climate change, the global refugee and migration crisis, and threats to democracy around the world "" would require far-reaching bipartisan cooperation and compromise. But that has become anathema to leading factions in both parties, including Trump's most rabid supporters in the House Freedom Caucus and Bernie Sanders's partisans, who think that as president he could implement his socialist revolution with the repeated strokes of a pen. 
As Ezra Klein points out in his sharp new book on polarization, Republican intransigence has less to do with Trump than with the ideological, demographic and geographic sorting that both parties have undergone over the past half-century. This sorting has made the Republicans more homogenous, with little need to appeal to moderates as well as conservatives. And the increasing concentration of Americans in the largest and most Democratic states means that geographically advantaged Republicans can win elections at all levels despite rarely winning the popular vote, and have little incentive to cooperate with Democrats when they are out of power.
If America's democratic system is headed toward a legitimacy crisis, it won't be because the impeachment and removal of Trump would 'tear up' the votes of three years ago. Trump may have accelerated the eventuality of such a crisis, but he will not have caused it. Removing him would of course make him a martyred god to his followers; his impeachment would be a bloody shirt that Republicans would wave to justify their intransigence for decades to come. 
'They want to nullify your ballots, poison our democracy and overthrow the entire system of government,' Trump said at a rally in Des Moines on Thursday night. Somebody might want that, but it wouldn't have much to do with a vote in the Senate to remove Donald Trump.

STOCKTON, Calif. "" Mike Bloomberg's rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination clamor that the White House is not for sale "" not even for a buyer worth $60-billion. On the debate stage as well as the campaign trail, they castigate him as an out-of-touch plutocrat unfairly injecting hundreds of millions of dollars into the political system to manipulate democracy.
Yet here in Stockton, a central California crossroads where low-wage warehouse workers feel left out of the economic boom and the bustling immigrant community has been under siege by President Trump's crackdown, voters have a different take on Bloomberg's wealth.
Many Democrats here said they didn't know that much about the former New York mayor until he started popping up on television in recent weeks. But after an unprecedented advertising blitz in the run-up to the March-3 Super Tuesday contests "" when California's primary will be the biggest prize of all "" they have begun repeating Bloomberg's slogan: 'Mike will get it done.'
Lynn Silva, 66, a retired special-education instructor for incarcerated adults, is a lifelong Democrat. The Trump era has made her so anxious and so worried for the country that she can no longer stand to listen to the television when the president is speaking. Her list of favorites to run against him is long and ever-changing, but she is starting to conclude that Bloomberg, hardly her first choice to be the Democratic standard-bearer, may be 'the ultimate candidate' for a coldly calculated reason: He has the money to win.
'I don't care that he's a billionaire trying to buy the election,' she said. 'If that's what it takes to beat Trump, that's fine. I loved [Sen. Kamala D. Harris], but look at her: Out. I loved [Sen.] Cory Booker, but look at him: Out. No money.'
'These aren't regular times,' Silva added. 'We've got to get Trump out. That's the bottom line.'
Bloomberg is banking, literally, on Democratic voters across California and throughout the nation arriving at a similar conclusion. He hopes they will look past this week's feeble debate performance, ignore his history as a Republican and tune out the allegations of misogyny and racial insensitivities in his past "" deciding that the imperative to defeat Trump is so great that they can persuade themselves to love the multibillionaire simply because he's a multibillionaire.

Bloomberg, who founded a media and information company that bears his name, is worth an estimated $60 billion and has pledged to spend whatever it takes to win. He has been a candidate for just three months, but his campaign has reported spending a staggering $464-million through Feb.-1 "" $259-million of that on television advertising. 
Bloomberg's candidacy is challenging the adage in politics that buying your way into office is a net negative. Instead, Bloomberg is pitching his wealth as one of his greatest assets.
'I'm a philanthropist who didn't inherit his money but made his money, and I'm spending that money to get rid of Donald Trump, the worst president we have ever had,' Bloomberg said in Wednesday night's debate. 'And if I can get that done, it will be a great contribution to America and to my kids.'
The other Democratic candidates ascribed darker motives to Bloomberg. Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., said Bloomberg 'thinks he can buy this election.'
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) blasted Bloomberg for embodying 'a corrupt political system' and warned that 'real change never takes place from the top on down, never takes place from an oligarchy controlled by billionaires.'
And Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) likened Bloomberg to Trump, warning that 'Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.'
Yet here in California, where recent polls show Sanders leading the field and Bloomberg rising into contention, one likely primary voter after another said they were warming to the former New York mayor. 
As he was getting off work at a shopping mall in Stockton, Michael Rabago, 25, said that he wants more than anything to deny Trump a second term "" and that Bloomberg's billions make him the guy to do it.
'Money buys votes, and I just hope Trump doesn't win again,' Rabago said. 'I think it's going to take a rich guy to beat Trump. I personally want Bernie to win, but money is everything. That's sad to say, but that's how it is. I always see Bloomberg's commercials on TV: 'Mike for 2020.' '

Faidrian Smith, 49, said she has decided to vote for Bloomberg for a simple reason: 'If you don't have the money to fight him, Trump is going to win the election. Period.'
Smith, who is black and works as a driver for a food-delivery service, said as she dashed into a restaurant here to pick up a customer's order that she feels a personal imperative to defeat Trump.
'He's made racism so blunt and in-your-face now, and we have to change that,' Smith said. 'I'm not saying Mike Bloomberg should buy the election. But money helps. It makes him stronger.'
Bloomberg's wealth was a turnoff for some other voters here. Diana Gatewood, 61, a retired special-needs care worker, said: 'He's trying to buy our votes. It does take money to make the world go around, but just because he's a billionaire doesn't mean he's doing right by people.'
Gatewood said she has not decided whom to vote for in the March-3 primary, but she's leaning toward Sanders, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Tom Steyer, another billionaire who is self-funding his campaign but has had far more limited success than Bloomberg. 
Synthia, 57, a retired parole officer who declined to provide her last name for fear of political retribution, acknowledged that Bloomberg's billions would prove helpful in the general election but said she was disinclined to vote for him. 
'How does he help the people "" the underdogs, the working-class, the blue-collar?' she asked. 'I think he's playing a political game. . . . We're not pawns in a game. We're people with lives. At the end of the day, we go home to our bills and our stressors, and these billionaires go home to their rich lives.'

Bloomberg has a prominent and enthusiastic champion here in Michael Tubbs, Stockton's dynamic young black mayor and a self-described liberal Democrat.
Tubbs, 29, was elected mayor on the same night in 2016 that Trump was elected president, and he quickly began to fully comprehend what Trump's presidency meant for his city of about 311,000.
In his first few months as mayor, Tubbs said, he spent most of his time not on crime or roads or other typical municipal matters, but on immigration "" specifically, trying to reassure his constituents, roughly one-third of whom are foreign-born, that despite the president's rhetoric and the harsh crackdown on illegal immigration that he authorized, they would continue to have sanctuary in Stockton.
'Donald Trump is literally an existential threat,' Tubbs said. 'Their way of life, their way of being, their way of interacting in the community has been changed by his presidency, and the top priority has to be to get him out.'
Tubbs described Stockton as a microcosm of America, a diverse melting pot in which 45-percent of residents are white and the median household income is just $51,000, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. The city is a transportation and logistics hub, meaning many jobs here pay low wages, at least relative to Silicon Valley and California's other booming metropolises. 
Tubbs is a sort-of Bloomberg protege. He graduated from a Harvard University mayoral training program that Bloomberg funds and said he tries to model his use of data in running Stockton's municipal affairs after Bloomberg's administration in New York. 
As he considered which candidate to support for president, Tubbs first gravitated toward Harris, one of his home state's Democratic senators. But once she was out of the race, he eyed Bloomberg, who agreed to make Stockton his first stop in California as a candidate.
Since Bloomberg's visit here in December, Tubbs has been an evangelist for his candidacy, explaining to his working- and middle-class constituents why they should put their faith in a Manhattan billionaire.
'I tell people, 'Beating Donald Trump is the top priority,' ' Tubbs said. 'Donald Trump and the Republican Party are playing to win.' By nominating one of the other candidates, Tubbs argued, Democrats would be 'unilaterally disarming' in the face of Trump's campaign war chest.
'You can't beat Donald Trump with no money,' Tubbs said. 'It's just not happening. You're going to have to have the resources to compete and also to build up the infrastructure in states so that something like Donald Trump doesn't happen again, and Bloomberg has shown a willingness to do that.'

As we've heard repeatedly in recent days, the Senate considers itself the world's greatest deliberative body.
Is there an award for the slowest?
Perhaps that title is now applicable to the Senate confirmation process for political appointees. This issue affects more than nominees languishing in limbo. The slow confirmation process hits agency decisions, programs and ultimately service to taxpayers.
A new report by the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit good-government organization, sums up the current situation with this title: 'Senate Confirmation Process Slows to a Crawl.'
The crawl is a particular problem for sub-Cabinet appointees. Their nomination-to-confirmation waits under President Trump and former president Barack Obama have been about 3.5-times longer than timelines for agency leaders at the very top.
This has been developing for years, decades, generations. During Trump's first three years in the White House, the Senate took twice as long to confirm sub-Cabinet nominees, 115-days on average, as the 56-days during President Ronald Reagan's two terms.
The report cites various factors for the sluggishness, many of which have been around for a long time. What has changed is 'the increased use of Senate filibusters in recent years to delay nominations,' the report said. Another factor, added Max Stier, the Partnership's president and chief executive, is the increasing partisanship clogging the Senate's works.
Although the confirmation process is directly linked to presidential administrations and the Senate, the impact is felt in the agencies.
Stier likened acting, or temporary, officials who fill slots when there is no confirmed appointee to substitute teachers. They might have the needed qualifications and attitude for the job, but they lack the authority, in real terms, of the confirmed officeholder.
If you are a temporary official, 'you're not going to take on the long-term issues,' Stier said. 'And people on the outside aren't going to see you as a reasonable counterparty to make decisions over the long term either. So, you're basically putting an organization into statis.'
That can have a direct impact on service to the public.
Stier can't quantify the impact on taxpayers, but he said, 'It is quite frequently the case that the choices and decisions that need to be made do not get made as well or as quickly when you have temporary leadership in place.'
Political appointees set policies for federal agencies, but it is civil service employees who implement programs that flow from those policies. If policymaking is slowed by the confirmation process, policy implementation necessarily will be, too.
The long, laborious and intrusive confirmation process hurts in other ways.
'Leaders matter,' Stier said. But potential leaders are turned off by a confirmation process that simply isn't worth it.
'Many service-minded people even forgo a presidential appointment because the lengthy process takes a heavy toll on their professional and personal lives,' according to the report.
As the confirmation process for many agency officials has been slow, it is moving with all deliberate speed in the judiciary.
'After three years in office, President Trump has remade the federal judiciary, ensuring a conservative tilt for decades and cementing his legacy no matter the outcome of November's election,' my colleague Colby Itkowitz reported last month. Now, 25-percent of U.S. circuit court judges are Trump appointees.
Even as Congress and the nation have been consumed with Trump's impeachment, judicial confirmations continued apace. 'As the House voted to impeach the president,' Itkowitz wrote during the third week in December, 'the Republican-led Senate confirmed an additional 13 district court judges.'
To get ahead of the slow agency confirmation process, the Partnership's Center for Presidential Transition urges presidential hopefuls to begin preparing soon for the administration that will take office a year from now. The Partnership's report said presidential transition teams should identify and select potential candidates for Senate-confirmed positions before the presidential election.
'This need for effective planning is particularly acute for the Democratic challengers,' the center's bipartisan advisory board said in an open letter. 'If successful, a new president in short order will have to recruit 4,000 political appointees, including 1,200 who require Senate confirmation; prepare a $4.7-trillion budget; roll out and pursue a vigorous policy agenda; and learn how to manage a workforce of 2-million civilian employees and 2-million active duty and reserve troops.'
Four thousand political appointees, including 1,200 needing Senate confirmation? Do we need so many?
No, says the Partnership and Paul C. Light, a New York University public service professor who has written extensively about political appointees.
'The current appointments process cannot be saved with further tweaks,' Light said. 'I think the only way to go at this is to cut the number of presidential appointments to a bare minimum. We just don't need the current number and have lost all semblance of accountability.
'It's time to stop the madness by cutting the number of advise-and-consent appointees,' he added. 'If a post cannot be filled within a reasonable amount of time . . . then it should be abolished as a presidential appointment.'

Happy about acquittal, president visits four states in as many days

LAS VEGAS "" Since the Republican-controlled Senate voted to acquit him on impeachment charges, President Trump has been on something of a perpetual victory lap.
He has tweeted, he has crowed, he has purged.
Then, this week, he took his triumphant show to the West Coast. 
Trump's post-impeachment, four-day swing through as many states "" three of which Hillary Clinton won in 2016 "" was the physical and geographic manifestation of Trump emboldened, as much a defiant flouting from an exultant president as a peripatetic hodgepodge of fundraising, rallies and official White House events out West.
Over stops in Arizona, California, Colorado and Nevada, Trump was buoyant almost to the point of giddiness, bounding over to greet supporters as he deplaned Air Force One and chatting off the record with his traveling press corps "" including Wednesday night when Trump, playing the role of eager host, led a klatch of reporters to his personal cabin aboard the Boeing 747 to watch the Democratic debate, which he had TiVo'd.
Yes, he has been impeached "" a historical humiliation and a forever asterisk on his presidency "" but this week, Trump witnessed the Democrats attack one another for two hours on a debate stage here, basked in the adulation of his cheering rally crowds and presented as a man increasingly confident about his reelection prospects.
Addressing an arena of supporters Wednesday night in Phoenix, Trump relayed the line-by-line of his kinetic day "" 'I started off with a speech in Nevada at 7:30 in the morning; I then went to California, made two speeches; I then went someplace else' "" and projected the image of someone weary but pressing forth, and siphoning vigor from his crowds. 
'I said, 'Am I finished?' 'No, you've got to go to Arizona tonight and speak in front of like 25,000 people,' ' Trump continued. 'I said, 'That's okay,' because I love this unbelievable energy in this crowd.' 
On Tuesday, Trump raised money in the liberal enclave of Beverly Hills, Calif., which he followed Wednesday morning with another fundraiser hosted by Oracle founder Larry Ellison at his verdant and exclusive Porcupine Creek golf club in Rancho Mirage, Calif. 
As if to underscore Trump's foray into Democratic country, Joe Grogan, the White House's director of the Domestic Policy Counsel, tweeted: 'Just landed in California. POTUS power swing through occupied territory.' 
Trump also scheduled a trio of consecutive campaign rallies "" Wednesday night in Phoenix, Thursday night in Colorado Springs and Friday afternoon in Las Vegas "" before heading back home to Washington. 
The Phoenix rally offered deliberate counterprogramming to the Democratic debate here "" Trump took the stage exactly 30-minutes after the slate of 2020 hopefuls assembled behind their own lecterns one state away "" and his Thursday rally was pointedly placed in Colorado, a state he lost by five percentage points to Clinton in 2016 but one that his campaign manager Brad Parscale is bullish he can win this November.
'With your help this November, we are going to defeat the radical Democrats and we are going to win Colorado in a landslide,' Trump said Thursday night at his rally in Colorado Springs. 
By Thursday evening, the president's cheerful disposition seemed to have faded slightly, with Trump offering a nearly 100-minute performance that was aggrieved and discursive at times.
He mocked former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) for what he said were their weak debate performances. (They both 'choked,' he said, mimicking a person clutching his chest and struggling to breathe.) He complained that 'Parasite,' a South Korean film with subtitles, had won the Oscar for best picture. ('We've got enough problems with South Korea,' he said, nostalgically calling for another winner like 'Gone With the Wind.') And he offered praise for a slew of individuals "" some familiar, some less so. (A 'nice, slim, beautiful-looking man,' he said, describing Interior Secretary David Bernhardt.) 
Trump is a reluctant traveler, partial to the comforts of his eponymously branded properties, and his proposed Western swings often have a way of crumbling under their own grandiosity, aides said. 
The president initially grumbled about this visit as well but was placated by being able to stay at his own Trump International hotel here every night, one official said.
Asked before leaving why he was returning to sleep at his own property each evening, Trump claimed he wasn't aware of the nightly arrangement. 
'Well, I don't know exactly the schedule because I don't set the schedule,' he said. 'Largely, the schedule is set by the Secret Service. We do what they want us to.'
A White House official then came back to the press cabin of Air Force One to explain that the president was overnighting in Las Vegas for security reasons, as well as to save money and create as small of an inconvenience as possible for multiple cities. 
Ultimately, Trump embraced the nearly week-long trip, sharing news of the final Friday rally here during an Oval Office visit with the president of Ecuador last week, before his campaign had even announced the event.
For the most part, only his tweets "" a buzzing current of angry energy that often started early in the morning "" belied his sanguine public demeanor. He mocked Bloomberg "" 'Mini Mike' or just 'Mini,' in his microbursts "" and continued to tweet about the Justice Department, despite Attorney General William P. Barr telling close associates he might have to resign if Trump kept on tweeting about Justice Department affairs.
'Mini Mike Bloomberg's debate performance tonight was perhaps the worst in the history of debates, and there have been some really bad ones,' Trump wrote. 'He was stumbling, bumbling and grossly incompetent. If this doesn't knock him out of the race, nothing will. Not so easy to do what I did!'
On Andrew McCabe, the former deputy director of the FBI, the president weighed in again Thursday, quoting an ally and writing, 'The decision not to prosecute Andy McCabe is utterly inexplicable.'
And, like so much of what he does, the president managed to imbue even ostensibly serious events with a certain Trumpian panache. Speaking in Bakersfield, Calif., on Wednesday at what was billed as a roundtable to discuss water accessibility issues with rural voters, Trump claimed "" while offering no evidence "" that Bloomberg 'hates the farmer' and suggested that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) could very well emerge as the Democratic nominee for president.
'We'll have to start working on Crazy Bernie pretty soon,' he said. 
As the president's motorcade wound back to the airport there, en route to his next stop, a staffer enthused, 'Now that's how you do a rally-table!' "" coining a phrase to describe the rallylike feel Trump brought to the purported roundtable. 
On Thursday, Trump began his day addressing a graduation for prisoners here in Las Vegas. But after briefly extolling the virtues of redemption and second chances, Trump detoured to weigh in on the breaking news that Roger Stone, a longtime confidant, had been sentenced to three years and four months in prison for impeding a congressional investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
'I want the process to play out,' the president said. 'I think that's the best thing to do because I'd love to see Roger exonerated, and I'd love to see it happen because I personally think he was treated very unfairly.'
Trump's digression about Stone lasted several minutes, as he waxed poetic about how Stone is 'definitely a character' who 'everybody sort of knows' "" 'He's a little different, but those are sometimes the most interesting,' he mused "" and griped about the jury forewoman, who he claimed was a Never Trump activist. 
'Now, you wouldn't know about a bad jury?' Trump said, to appreciative laughter. 'Anybody here know about bad? No? These people know about more bad juries than everybody here, including the sheriff and the mayor and everybody.' 
Later, he again commiserated with the graduates "" newly released from prison and preparing to reenter society "" lamenting that everyone, even the president of the United States, has 'those days.'
'I mean, I didn't do anything wrong, and they impeached me a few weeks ago, right?' Trump asked, seeming bewildered. 'They impeached and I said, 'What happened? What did I do?' ' 
But he laughed, and then so did the crowd, because the president's good mood was infectious. 
And even Trump "" who has long raged and fumed over the impeachment inquiry against him, which he has repeatedly dismissed as a 'hoax' "" managed to look on the bright side. 
'The good news,' he said, 'my numbers went through the roof.'
The president's jovial mood continued straight through the end of his trip. Before heading back to Washington on Friday, Trump bemoaned that his western road show was coming a close.
'I have to get back to Washington and work,' he said at a rally in Las Vegas. 'I feel guilty. This is too much fun.'

Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. got an earful about President Trump while presiding over his impeachment trial and received a few words from the man himself Tuesday night at the State of the Union address.
The trial may be over, but these two are hardly done with each other.
Currently, the chief justice is either writing or reviewing the Supreme Court's decision on whether Trump acted within his power to end the program protecting young immigrant 'dreamers' from deportation. A decision could come at any time before the court's term concludes at the end of June.
Next month, Roberts will call the court to order to consider whether Trump may shield his personal financial information from a congressional committee and a New York prosecutor each investigating matters beyond the president's impeachment.
The case ensures that controversies over investigations into Trump's conduct will continue into the heart of the presidential election campaign.
And on and on it will go.
Trump's expansive view of his powers has met an unprecedented legal pushback from Democrats and civil rights organizations, and the president's lawyers have not hesitated to run quickly to the conservative Supreme Court, which they see as a counterbalance to liberal federal judges.
Even as Roberts presided one day at the impeachment trial, the Supreme Court on a 5-to-4 vote granted an emergency request allowing the Trump administration to begin implementing new rules making it easier to deny immigrants residency or admission to the United States because they have used or might use public-assistance programs.
Roberts, who marked his 65th birthday attempting to 'carry out ill-defined responsibilities in an unfamiliar setting,' invited lawmakers to visit, saying the front row of the court is always reserved for members of Congress 'who might want to drop by to see an argument or to escape one.'
He emphasized that 'we carry out our common commitment to the Constitution through the distinct roles assigned to us by that charter.' It was in line with the genial and neutral persona he tried to develop as the bitter, partisan fight was waged before him.
'If nothing else was clear from the last week or so,' said Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, 'it's that he has one of the best poker faces in Washington.'
That look was on display in the House chamber Tuesday night as Trump stopped to speak with Roberts on his way to deliver the State of the Union speech. A court spokeswoman declined on Roberts's behalf to reveal what Trump said, but Roberts responded with three nods of the head and a terse 'thank you.'
Anyone familiar with how Roberts has carried out his role as chief justice knew he would try not to emerge as a central figure in the impeachment proceedings.
Liberals criticized his passive approach, but in his most substantive statement during the trial, Roberts made clear he saw impeachment as a political event involving the elected branches.
He was spared from being called upon to break a tie on whether to call witnesses. But he made clear later he would not have voted.
Reminded last Friday night by Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) that Chief Justice Salmon Chase had broken ties during the 1868 impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson, Roberts said he had done the research.
'One concerned a motion to adjourn, the other concerned a motion to close deliberations,' Roberts said. 'I do not regard those isolated episodes 150 years ago as sufficient to support a general authority to break ties.' 
He added: 'If the members of this body, elected by the people and accountable to them, divide equally on a motion, the normal rule is that the motion fails. I think it would be inappropriate for me, an unelected official from a different branch of government, to assert the power to change that result so that the motion would succeed.'
 Roberts's only real intrusion in the trial was twice refusing to relay questions from Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) that would have revealed the name of the whistleblower whose allegations powered the impeachment inquiry.
But the investigations are hardly over, and the Supreme Court will play a pivotal role.
 House Democrats are pressing ahead in pending court battles with the Trump administration over witnesses and evidence as part of their 'ongoing inquiry' into the president's conduct. 
The federal appeals court in Washington could rule at any time in a pair of separation-of-powers cases over subpoenas for testimony from former White House counsel Donald McGahn and secret grand jury evidence gathered by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III during his investigation of Russia's interference in the 2016 election. 
House general counsel Douglas Letter told the court that investigators are examining whether Trump lied in his written responses to questions from Mueller. 
In a third pending case, the chairman of the House tax-writing committee sued the treasury secretary and the head of the Internal Revenue Service after the agencies refused to comply with subpoenas for the president's tax returns. The judge has delayed ruling in the matter until the appeals court has resolved the cases over McGahn's testimony and the grand jury evidence House Democrats seek.
But already on the docket are Trump v. Mazars, Trump v. Deutsche Bank and Trump v. Vance, cases that could result in landmark rulings on a president's immunity from investigation while he is in office.
 Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. and three Democratic-led congressional committees have won lower-court decisions granting their subpoenas for a broad range of Trump's financial records relating to him personally, his family and his businesses.
Unlike other modern presidents and presidential candidates, Trump has not released his tax returns. He and his personal lawyers have mounted a vigorous effort to keep that information private and defeat attempts to obtain the records from financial institutions and his accounting firm.
 'The subpoena cases may not end up as 5-4, but even before the impeachment trial, I think it stood to reason that the chief justice would be the central figure in them,' Vladeck said.
'Whether sitting through those presentations and machinations have affected his thinking is a fascinating question; I'm just not sure we'll have any sense of the answer until the rulings come out.'

Proposal was for help absolving Russia in DNC hack, attorney tells court

LONDON "" A lawyer for Julian Assange said in a British court Wednesday that former Republican congressman Dana Rohrabacher, an ally of President Trump, made an offer to the WikiLeaks founder on behalf of Trump to pardon Assange in exchange for saying that Russia had nothing to do with the 2016 hack and leak of emails from the Democratic National Committee.
Assange is in a British prison while he awaits a decision on an extradition request by the United States. The U.S. government wants him to stand trial on charges that he violated the Espionage Act by allegedly helping to obtain and then disseminating secret government documents in 2010 and 2011 relating to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Assange is fighting the extradition "" arguing that he acted as a publisher and journalist and that the United States is pursuing him for 'political offenses.' He faces a possible 175-year sentence if convicted.
In a hearing Wednesday, Edward Fitzgerald, one of Assange's lawyers, told a judge in Westminster Magistrates' Court here that Assange wanted to submit evidence that Trump offered him a deal in 2017 through Rohrabacher.
Fitzgerald made the assertion in seeking the court's permission to admit a statement by Jennifer Robinson, a lawyer for WikiLeaks who says she was present when Rohrabacher made the offer.
Robinson's statement, read in part in open court and reported by the British Press Association, lays out her version of what was said by Rohrabacher in the Ecuadoran Embassy in London on Aug. 16, 2017. Also present with Rohrabacher, then a congressman from Orange County, Calif., was Charles Johnson, a conservative political activist. Rohrabacher was defeated in 2018.
At the time of the meeting, Assange was not under indictment. The following year, he was indicted under seal. The indictment was unsealed in April.
District Judge Vanessa Baraitser ruled that Robinson's statement was admissible in court, thereby possibly dragging Trump into the proceedings.
Rohrabacher's meeting with Assange at the embassy was no secret.
Following his trip to London, Rohrabacher told the Orange Country Register that Assange 'reaffirmed his aggressive denial that the Russians had anything to do with the hacking of the DNC during the election.'
He added: 'I think it will have an earth-shattering political impact.'

In a statement posted to his website Wednesday, Rohrabacher said, 'At no time did I talk to President Trump about Julian Assange. Likewise, I was not directed by Trump or anyone else connected with him to meet with Julian Assange.'
He said he was on his 'own fact finding mission at personal expense' and that 'at no time did I offer Julian Assange anything from the President because I had not spoken with the President about this issue at all.' But, he added, he told Assange that if he gave him evidence about who provided him the DNC emails, he would ask Trump to pardon him.

White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham on Wednesday denied the allegation that Trump was seeking a trade with Assange. 'The president barely knows Dana Rohrabacher other than he's an ex-congressman,' she said in a statement. 'He's never spoken to him on this subject or almost any subject. It is a complete fabrication and a total lie. This is probably another never ending hoax and total lie from the DNC.'
Trump has long bristled at the U.S. intelligence community's 'high confidence' conclusion, revealed publicly in January 2017, that Moscow was behind the hacking and releasing of Democratic emails in the 2016 presidential contest, and that it was part of an effort ordered by Russian President Vladimir Putin to undermine Hillary Clinton's campaign and aid Trump's. The president has suggested that the hacker could have been 'some guy in his home in New Jersey' or the work of the Chinese.
The first hearing on Assange's extradition to the United States is scheduled to begin at Woolwich Crown Court outside London on Monday, with one week of legal argument. The case will be adjourned and will continue with three weeks of evidence on May-18.
It is not clear when Assange's defense team will present to the court their evidence that Rohrabacher sought to make a deal with Assange for Trump.
Assange has been incarcerated in Belmarsh Prison after he was found guilty of breaching his bail conditions when he fled to the Ecuadoran Embassy in London.
In 2012, Assange took refuge at the embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he was wanted for questioning over sexual assault allegations. Assange has always denied the allegations. Sweden has since ended its investigation.
Assange was holed up in the embassy for nearly seven years before his arrest in April.

Chelsea Manning, the former Army private who was convicted on charges she provided the Iraq and Afghanistan documents to WikiLeaks, is petitioning for release from jail. Manning, whose prison sentence was commuted in January 2017 by President Barack Obama, said she will never comply with a subpoena to testify in front of a grand jury about her interactions with Assange.

President Trump, a leading critic of the Obama White House's handling of the Ebola outbreak in 2014, is under increasing political pressure to mount a coordinated federal response to the threat of the new strain of coronavirus "" amid fears of a global health crisis with economic ramifications in an election year.
The White House has sought to tamp down criticism from Democrats in recent days by projecting an air of confidence and competence, with Trump presiding late Wednesday over an interagency briefing in the Situation Room. He also announced a new task force of senior aides to lead the government's response, including screenings at 20 U.S. airports, the repatriation of U.S. citizens from China and efforts to develop a potential vaccine to treat the novel virus.
The disease, dubbed a 'public health emergency' by the World Health Organization, has left more than 200 dead and infected more than 9,000 people in China and Taiwan, along with about 100 confirmed cases outside that country, including six people in the United States. 
'This is no cause for urgent panic in any way in the United States,' Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary of health, told reporters at the White House on Thursday. 'This is currently under control. But really, this is a dynamic and rapidly changing event, and the news can change at any moment. But the resources are deployed, the government is mobilized and we feel confident "" we know the right steps to take to contain it.'
Yet the vast uncertainty over the contagiousness and lethality of the coronavirus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, and the complicated geopolitics given Beijing's poor record of transparency in handling infectious diseases, have increased the stakes for the Trump administration. So has the president's interest in an election year of restoring more normal trade relations with China after years of tariff battles.
Democrats, including 2020 presidential candidates Joe Biden, the former vice president, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), have warned that the president's policies have made the United States more vulnerable to an infectious disease crisis.
They pointed to the dismantling of a global health security team in 2018 during a reorganization of the White House's National Security Council. And in an op-ed published in USA Today on Monday, Biden called Trump the 'worst possible leader' to oversee the government's response, citing his call for then-President Barack Obama to implement a travel ban on West African countries during the Ebola crisis even though public health experts opposed such a move. 
'I remember how Trump sought to stoke fear and stigma. . . . He called President Barack Obama a 'dope' and 'incompetent' and railed against the evidence-based response our administration put in place,' Biden wrote.
Trump has been uncharacteristically muted on the coronavirus. On Wednesday, he tweeted out photos of his Situation Room briefing and professed that his administration is working closely with China. 'We have the best experts anywhere in the world, and they are on top of it 24/7!' he wrote.
One senior administration official said Trump has been hesitant to speak out because some aides have cautioned that he could unnecessarily cause public alarm "" and assured him that China is working hard to keep the virus under control. But increasingly, there is a feeling among aides that the president must say more, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
Heath and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who is leading the new task force, provided Trump with a briefing on China's response that prompted the president to issue a more positive tweet last week about Beijing's performance than other officials, believed was warranted, the senior aide said. 
This week, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney began holding daily meetings focused on the issue, officials said, and aides have begun discussing how they could safely evacuate people from China, along with where they could be placed in the United States.
Some administration officials and members of Congress have expressed concern over how transparent Beijing has been in accounting for the breadth of the virus and its failure so far to share full data with the United States and other countries.
Meanwhile, some U.S. lawmakers have pressed for a targeted travel ban from China, which Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Okla.), a close White House ally, said in a letter to the administration was 'warranted to protect Americans until we know more about the virus and the outbreak is under control.' 
Trump's 2020 campaign countered Biden's criticism by pointing to remarks he made in April 2009 during an outbreak of swine flu that he would counsel his own family not to ride the subway or airplanes, which a White House spokesman later said might have caused people to be 'unduly alarmed.'

'This is another attempt by a failing candidate to gain credibility on an issue where he has almost none,' Trump campaign spokeswoman Sarah Matthews said of Biden. 
Experts said the new coronavirus appears to be more contagious but far less deadly than Ebola, which is thought to have infected more than 28,000 people and killed more than 11,000 during the 2014 outbreak. But China already has confirmed more cases of coronavirus than of SARS, a more deadly coronavirus, during an outbreak that spread through Asia in 2002 and 2003. 
As the midterm elections approached in fall 2014, Trump and numerous GOP leaders faulted Obama for his response to Ebola. Obama appointed Ron Klain, who has worked in multiple Democratic administrations in several roles, as the administration's Ebola czar.
All told, four people in the United States were found to have contracted the disease, including a Liberian national who died while visiting Dallas. The other three recovered, and Obama declared a qualified victory in early 2015 during an event at the White House with public health professionals. 
In an essay in the Atlantic on Thursday, Klain said Trump's 2014 criticism amounted to a 'virulent, xenophobic, fearmongering outburst.' He cited a study from the Obama White House's Office of Digital Strategy that concluded Trump's tweets were a driving factor in instilling a sense of unfounded fear over Ebola among the American public. 
Trump 'will have to trust the kind of government experts he has disdained to date, set aside his own terrible instincts, lead from the White House, and work closely with foreign leaders and global institutions "" all things he has failed to do in his first 1,200 days in office,' wrote Klain, who is advising Biden's campaign.
Some global health security experts said that a more senior White House official should be in charge of the Trump administration's response given that Azar has little authority over other agencies. Critics pointed to the 2018 restructuring at the NSC that led to the departure of Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer, who had overseen a team dedicated to the U.S. response to a deadly pandemic, as weakening the senior-level attention.
'This is much bigger than HHS,' said J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'There's a sluggishness built into the system by the way they have structured themselves.'
But Tim Morrison, who served on the NSC from 2018-2019, said Ziemer's team was merged with another NSC department and experts remain on the White House staff. He cited the administration's handling of an Ebola outbreak in the Congo in 2018 as evidence that the White House remains capable of coordinating an effective response to an international threat. 
White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien and his deputy, Matthew Pottinger, a fluent Mandarin speaker, are also on the president's task force. Vice President Pence has been involved in interagency meetings. 
'I think the administration is actually running a very effective process,' said Morrison, now a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute. 'They don't need an Ebola czar the way the Obama administration needed one. They've got the apparatus in place.' 
 On Capitol Hill, lawmakers have been in touch with Azar and other senior administration officials, and Democrats have mostly refrained from overt criticism of Trump, even as they pressed the administration to devote sufficient resources to managing the situation. 
'A global pandemic is like a meteor coming out of the sky,' said a Democratic congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
The White House 'recognizes the risk of the appearance of not being on top of the situation in case it does turn out this is worse or more problematic than it initially appears,' the aide added. 'There's very little political price you pay for overreacting because people will forget. There's a huge potential vulnerability for underreacting.'

When asked what kept him up at night, Ben Wikler, who is responsible for delivering a must-win state in November as chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, used to answer, ""unknown unknowns."" He no longer has to wonder what such a risk might look like. 
Presidential campaigns, parties and state election officials are scrambling to heed health warnings while safeguarding the democratic process against a growing coronavirus epidemic whose scope is difficult to predict.
Their planning has included advising voters not to lick their mail-in ballots, relocating polling places away from senior living communities, and weighing whether to move forward with plans to bring tens of thousands of visitors from around the world to Milwaukee and Charlotte for the planned Democratic and Republican summer conventions, respectively. 
Former vice president Joe Biden's digital staff was envisioning options for virtual campaigning if sweeping changes were necessary. Sen. Bernie Sanders's campaign already has an elaborate streaming operation, which it said it could tap in the event that campaigning is curtailed. Already, both campaigns have been providing hand sanitizer at events.
Over the weekend, the AFL-CIO, the nation's largest federation of unions, canceled a presidential forum scheduled for Thursday in Orlando, where Biden and Sanders (I-Vt.), the leading contenders for the Democratic nomination, had been scheduled to appear. It was the first such cancellation to have been attributed to the coronavirus's spread.
Asked about the wisdom of holding campaign events, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it ""really depends.""
""If you want to talk about large gatherings in a place where you have community spread, I think that's a judgment call, and if someone decides they want to cancel it I wouldn't publicly criticize them,"" he said during a White House briefing Monday. 
None of the presidential campaigns has made significant changes, even as all emphasize they will follow the recommendations of health experts. President Trump's reelection campaign said it was ""proceeding as normal,"" denying that a ""Women for Trump"" bus tour had been postponed because of the coronavirus, pointing instead to a ""scheduling conflict."" 
Still, the virus, which caused stocks to nose-dive on Monday, suddenly brought every assumption about the unfolding of the 2020 race into question - even the viability of activities as core to campaigning as knocking on doors. It also intensified fears about election interference and disinformation, after social media became host to false claims about last-minute voting changes on Super Tuesday.
""It's an item on the agenda of every meeting,"" Wikler said. ""Everyone involved in politics is deep in scenario planning.""
Most immediately, that meant protecting voters participating in contests Tuesday in six states, including Washington, the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States.
The state votes by mail, lessening concerns about transmission of the virus, apart from the potential issue of saliva on ballots or envelopes. Election officials, pressing voters to use a wet sponge or a cloth as a sealant, launched a public education campaign on social media with the slogan ""Whether healthy or sick, please don't lick!"" State officials were also advising that voters deliver their ballots to election drop boxes in an effort to spare postal workers the health risk. 
Speaking on a panel at the state capitol last month, the director of elections for Washington's most populous county named the coronavirus as one of the obstacles that keeps her ""up at night.""
""I think things like that - those things that we maybe don't have in the contingency plans, like a virus,"" King County Elections Director Julie Wise said at the event, which was hosted in part by the secretary of state's office.
Wise called 2020 a ""doozy of a year"" for election administrators.
""We often don't - or ever - cancel or delay an election, so we're still conducting an election regardless of if there is flooding, regardless of if there is a pandemic, regardless of if there is an earthquake,"" she said.
At least 45 states have laws that anticipate Election Day emergencies such as natural disasters, but these laws vary widely, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In eight states, including Florida, Texas and Virginia, the governor has the statutory power to delay or reschedule an election.
But in most states, officials closest to the ground have little guidance so far beyond what has been publicly released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meanwhile, messaging from the Trump administration has veered between caution and the president's early assertions that fears of the virus have been overblown. 
In Michigan, which has been a hub of recent campaigning before Tuesday's vote, a spokesman for the Wayne County Health Department pointed to CDC recommendations in explaining how the county, which includes Detroit, was encouraging voters to protect themselves ahead of Tuesday's primary. 

Campaigns, meanwhile, said they were relying on local health departments, while also following state and federal guidance.
""We're a campaign that believes in science, and we will go with what the science tells us,"" said Ari Rabin-Havt, a deputy campaign manager for Sanders. ""If we can't campaign one way, we'll campaign another way.""
Biden, who has been holding shorter events and spending less time greeting supporters on the rope line, was committed to ""complying with reasonable risk mitigations,"" his campaign said in a statement. ""At the same time, we will continue to run an aggressive, national campaign to win the Democratic nomination and defeat Donald Trump."" 
While the Trump reelection campaign uncharacteristically has not advertised a public rally for this week or beyond, Trump has not appeared to alter his schedule of fundraising meet-and-greet events or his practice of greeting supporters who are invited to be on hand when he lands at airports.
Trump attended events with donors on Monday in Florida and greeted a line of supporters on the tarmac in Orlando.
""Reports that the White House has issued formal guidelines to staff instructing them to limit in-person interactions and meetings are completely false,"" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.
After this week's voting, the Democratic contest turns to several states that will vote March 17, including Florida, whose voting population includes a substantial portion of retirees and senior citizens.
Already steps were being taken to protect them during voting. Numerous senior living centers that ordinarily serve as precinct locations had moved to relocate voting off their campuses, while others were still examining their options, according to Steve Bahmer, the president and chief executive of LeadingAge Florida, an association representing senior-living facilities. 
""Seniors tend to vote, and obviously there's a lot of interest in the 2020 election,"" Bahmer said. ""Voter disenfranchisement is a key concern, and steps are being taken in advance to make sure that doesn't happen.""
The complications will only deepen when the presidential contest enters the summer months. Right now, the CDC has advised people at higher risk of infection to avoid crowds. If that advice were to become broader, or if the government were to impose the type of travel restrictions introduced in other counties, it could impede the parties' abilities to hold their nominating conventions this summer. 
Committees overseeing both conventions said they were pressing ahead with their plans while monitoring developments. 
""We prioritize the health and safety of attendees and have the utmost confidence in the administration's work and preparations,"" said Blair Ellis, a spokeswoman for the Republican convention, scheduled for August in Charlotte. 
Joe Solmonese, the chief executive of the Democratic convention, set for July in Milwaukee, said in a statement that every convention requires ""developing a number of contingency plans to provide for a variety of scenarios.
""As we prepare to welcome Americans to Milwaukee this summer, the convention team will remain in constant communication with the local, state, and federal authorities responsible for protecting public health and security,"" he said. 
Alex Halderman, a computer scientist at the University of Michigan, said it would be difficult to replicate the social experience of the convention. The balloting process involved in selecting a nominee, however, could probably be transferred to an online system, he said, citing Google software as a possible alternative.
As for voting itself, Halderman said mail-in ballots offer an efficient alternative to in-person participation. But there are barriers, he cautioned, including states that don't offer no-excuse absentee voting. He also pointed to concerns about coercion that arise when large numbers of people are mailing in ballots rather than completing them in the privacy of a voting booth. 
Four states hold all elections entirely by mail, and at least 21 states allow certain elections to be conducted entirely by mail, depending on the circumstances, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
There is little precedent for the waging of a presidential race against the backdrop of an epidemic on this scale. 
The Spanish flu of 1918 was active during that year's midterm campaign and election season. Local news reports from the weeks before and after that election suggested that the virus did impact planning, with some officials ordering voters to wear masks or advising against congregating publicly to hear election results.
""The election of 1918 is the only truly momentous American election ever to take place in the midst of a major pandemic,"" the late professor Alfred W. Crosby wrote in ""America's Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918,"" published by Cambridge University Press. ""Spanish influenza certainly affected campaigning: it canceled political meetings; doused that American political perennial, the torchlight parade; and obliged politicians to abandon their plans for last-minute whirlwind speaking tours.""
Crosby cast doubt on whether the flu had depressed voter turnout, noting that while there was a ""sharp drop"" in votes compared with 1916, 1918 was a midterm election, when voter interest is typically lower.

President Trump will host Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro in Florida this weekend, Trump said Friday, confirming reports that the right-wing fellow populist would attend a private dinner at Trump's resort home.
Bolsonaro will dine with Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Saturday night, their first meeting since Trump blindsided Bolsonaro in December with an announcement of new tariffs on imported steel and aluminum.
""Yeah, I am. We're having dinner at Mar-a-Lago,"" Trump said, answering questions from reporters at the White House before leaving for a tour of storm damage in Tennessee and then a weekend of fundraising in Florida.
""He wanted to have dinner in Florida, if that was possible. The president of Brazil. So we'll be doing that,"" Trump said.
The White House followed up with a statement saying the two presidents ""will discuss opportunities to build a more prosperous, secure and democratic world.""
The political, economic and humanitarian crisis in Venezuela is among other agenda items. The White House statement did not mention the tariffs.
Caught unawares by the tariff announcement on Twitter, Bolsonaro seemed confused and flustered when reporters in Brazil asked him what had happened. He said he was sure that a call to Trump would fix matters. It may have worked, although Trump has not definitively removed the threat. Bolsonaro wrote on Facebook in late December that Trump had agreed not to go forward with the trade penalties, but the episode led to criticism in Brazil that Bolsonaro's coziness with Trump had backfired. 
Bolsonaro is visiting the United States for meetings with business leaders amid an economic slump. Brazil reported that economic growth slowed to 1.1 percent last year, and the country has acknowledged that the global coronavirus outbreak will further affect economic performance.
Bolsonaro is a Trump admirer who patterned his successful 2018 election campaign on Trump's 2016 victory, and he proudly called himself the ""Trump of the Tropics."" He has courted Trump and ties to U.S. businesses, and Trump aides touted Bolsonaro's election as both a welcome end to leftist rule and an endorsement of Trump's transactional foreign policy. The two men had a warm meeting at the White House last March, but Trump has not followed up with a promised visit to Brazil.
Trump has said he likes Bolsonaro and his pro-development agenda. Trump did not join other world leaders in criticizing Bolsonaro's handling of huge fires in the Amazon region last year that are linked to deforestation. Bolsonaro's critics say his policies on mining and other development have contributed to ecological disaster. 
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly in September, Bolsonaro rejected calls for foreign intervention in the burning Amazon, telling world leaders that his country would use the rainforest's resources as it sees fit.
The Amazon isn't in flames, he said, to snorts and laughter in the gallery. He said the region is rich with resources that Brazil alone will choose how to use.
The fires were blamed largely on loggers and farmers, who set them to clear land for pasture and agribusiness. Bolsonaro campaigned on promises to open the Amazon for development; deforestation rates there have nearly doubled since he took office in January 2019.

Seven days after his closed-door testimony in the House impeachment hearings "" seven days after his face was plastered across every screen in America "" William B. Taylor Jr. found himself in Mariupol, some 5,000-miles from Washington and just 12-miles from the front lines of a war between the Ukrainian military and Russian-backed separatists.
The setting was an economic conference sponsored by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that spoke volumes about the country's uncertain state. The nearest airport to Mariupol had been destroyed in the fighting. For many of the attendees, the fastest route to the conference was a brutal 18-hour train ride.
Among the conference's big attractions was a chance to pitch ideas for sparking the economy to Ukraine's president. Each of the hundreds of attendees got two minutes.
The other big lure was Taylor. Well-wishers swarmed him. The governor of the war-scarred Luhansk region, still partially controlled by Kremlin-backed separatists, told him that he had read all his prepared testimony and quoted back a few of the kind words Taylor had said about Ukraine.
By early January, Taylor was back home in the Washington suburbs trying to make sense of the surreal swirl of his time in Ukraine, his testimony before Congress and the rancorous aftermath.
His mind turned to Mariupol and then to President Trump, whose antipathy toward Ukraine was, for him, among the biggest mysteries of all.
'I'm trying to figure out where [it] came from,' he said, 'this deep suspicion of this little country. I mean, it's 44-million people. It's not that big a deal.'
Trump has emerged from his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial aggrieved and triumphant. Those who testified against him "" a mix of political appointees and career bureaucrats "" are trying to figure out their place in the Washington left behind following his acquittal.
Last week, Trump banished Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman from the White House and suggested he should face disciplinary action from the military for testifying against him. Vindman returned to the Pentagon, which has said it isn't investigating him.
Marie Yovanovitch, forced from her position as ambassador in Kyiv by Trump last spring, left the government and delivered a powerful speech lamenting the costs to the State Department and America's standing in the world. 'An amoral, keep-'em-guessing foreign policy that substitutes threats, fear and confusion for trust cannot work over the long haul,' she warned on Wednesday.
The aftermath for Taylor, who was hurriedly dispatched to Ukraine as an emergency fill-in for Yovanovitch, has been quieter. He's currently taking time off, catching up with his family and considering his next move.
Like Yovanovitch, he has had plenty of time to ponder the damage. Taylor dedicated his life to service within the vast foreign policy institutions that the United States built following the war. Since his days as an infantry officer in Vietnam, he lived by their rules, which he saw as 'cumbersome, but thorough,' a necessity for a great power whose routine decisions could alter the course of millions of lives in faraway places like Kyiv or Mariupol.
Trump was the first president Taylor had served who held these institutions in contempt. He doubted their loyalty and distrusted their expertise, often preferring the musings of television commentators or his conspiracy-minded personal attorney to the experts on his White House staff and in his intelligence briefings.
Most Americans describe Trump in Manichaean terms "" he's brilliant or terrible, compassionate or irredeemably cruel. To Taylor, he was beyond his comprehension.
'I don't understand the president,' he said. 'I can't get in his head to see what motivates him and what he thinks.'
Sometimes, he wondered if it was even worth trying.
'It's no longer hypothetical'
Last spring, Taylor was out of the government and serving as the executive vice president at the U.S. Institute of Peace, a nonpartisan think tank established by Congress, when George Kent, a former State Department colleague and future impeachment inquiry witness, asked if he might 'hypothetically' be interested in serving as the ambassador to Ukraine. Yovanovitch was fighting a smear campaign fomented by self-interested Ukrainian politicians and the president's personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
The following day, Kent called him back. 'It's no longer hypothetical,' he said.
Taylor's wife, Deborah, urged him to reject the job. A big worry was her husband's reputation. Nearly five decades of government service had instilled in him a respect for his chain of command and an instinct for compromise. Both were potentially lethal traits inside the Trump administration.
'Bill's Achilles' heel "" and everyone has them "" is wanting to find agreement,' she said. 'I was concerned he'd sully himself. . . . He passed that test.'
Shortly before he left for Ukraine, Taylor got a lesson in how power works in Trump's Washington. In May, he learned from officials in the White House that Trump had refused to sign a letter congratulating Ukraine's president on his resounding election victory.
Taylor raised his concerns about Trump with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
'I think your boss doesn't like Ukraine,' Taylor said, still doubtful that he would take the job.
'You're right, and it's my job to turn him around,' Pompeo replied, according to several U.S. officials familiar with the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly.
Taylor then mentioned the unsigned letter. 'Find out about this,' Pompeo told his staff. Within 36-hours, a new letter had been drafted and signed by the president.
Taylor tucked a copy of it in a briefcase and headed off to Ukraine.
Patriotic and fragile Ukraine
Each morning at 8:30 in Kyiv, Ukrainian troops gather in formation outside the Ministry of Defense. A soldier rings a bell. Shots are fired. An officer then reads the names of the Ukrainian soldiers killed on that day over the course of the country's six-year war with Russian-backed separatists.
When Sens. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) visited Kyiv last fall, Taylor took them to the ceremony. He wanted them to see a bit of Ukraine as he saw it: patriotic, fragile and under daily assault from Vladimir Putin's Russia.
Taylor arrived in Ukraine in June, just weeks after Zelensky won the presidency in a landslide. He believed that the 2013 Ukrainian revolution, followed by Russia's invasion a few months later and annexation of Crimea, had created a new sense of solidarity in the country. Corruption was still rampant. The war had ravaged the economy. But, there was a hope for Ukraine that wasn't present when he left in 2009, after concluding his stint as ambassador under President George W. Bush.
'There's an idealism, a spirit of youth, a charm represented by this new president,' he said. 'It's a chance. A real chance, which you don't get very often in the history of countries.'
About a month after Taylor arrived in Kyiv, he learned via a routine conference call with Washington that Trump had ordered a hold on $391-million in aid to Ukraine. Initially, he assumed it was a misunderstanding.
Weeks passed, and the hold remained in place. Kurt Volker, the administration's special representative to Ukraine, and Gordon Sondland, a Trump megadonor serving as ambassador to the European Union, blamed the problem on Giuliani. Both later became impeachment witnesses.
Their fix was to broker a deal that might get Giuliani to back off. Giuliani was looking for dirt on former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, who had been paid between $50,000 and $100,000 a month to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. The Ukrainians wanted an Oval Office visit for Zelensky.
Taylor urged Zelensky's top advisers to keep their distance. 'Rudy is up to no good. If you think he's doing this because he cares about Ukraine, you're wrong,' he warned Andriy Yermak, a top aide to Zelensky.
On Aug. 27, national security adviser John Bolton visited Kyiv for a meeting with Zelensky, who still did not know the aid was frozen. Before Bolton left, Taylor asked for five minutes with him at his hotel. Taylor worried that if the aid freeze became public, it would undermine Zelensky and strengthen Putin. Bolton asked Taylor to make the case for the aid to Pompeo in a cable.
'It'll get noticed,' he promised.
In the cable's last line, Taylor made it clear that if the hold wasn't lifted, he wouldn't be able to support the policy and would resign. It was the first time in almost 50-years of government service that he had threatened to quit.
At that point, Taylor had no idea a CIA whistleblower had accused Trump of using 'the power of his office to solicit interference . . . in the 2020 U.S. election.' The complaint, emailed to the intelligence community's inspector general on Aug.-12, was a bomb ready to explode.
A request to leave
By early January, it was clear that Trump was most likely going to be acquitted. In Kyiv, Taylor got a glimpse of the likely aftermath. He was finishing his tour as acting ambassador and preparing for a Pompeo visit on Jan.-2.
A senior aide to the secretary informed him that Pompeo wanted to meet with the Ukrainian president in Kyiv one-on-one, without embassy staff to take notes.
'I'm going to protest,' Taylor told officials in Washington. 'I'm going to become a pain on this.' Taylor worried that such an arrangement would signal that Pompeo didn't trust his embassy staff. Ukrainians might conclude that they couldn't trust the embassy either.
In Kyiv, Taylor quickly realized that he "" not the embassy "" was the problem.
Taylor hadn't spoken to Pompeo since his meeting in May, before taking the job. But, he knew that his testimony had upset the president, who blasted him as a 'never Trumper,' a subset of Republicans Trump described as 'human scum.'
So, Taylor proposed that his deputy accompany the secretary to the meeting. Pompeo's staff agreed. Then they asked Taylor to leave his position six days early so that he would not be in charge when Pompeo arrived in Kyiv.
Last month, Taylor returned to Washington and the modest bungalow that he and his wife bought in 1983 as he was beginning his government career.
Scattered amid a lifetime of mementos from postings in Afghanistan, Iraq, Ukraine and Israel were reminders of the last few tumultuous months.
On the coffee table by the front door, there was a picture of Taylor testifying before Congress "" a gift from Yovanovitch. Upstairs, a block of wood with the message 'Stand Your Ground,' etched in Russian, sat on Taylor's desk. He had been given it a few days earlier by another impeachment witness.
At the dining room table, Deborah, a biblical scholar, was translating a text from ancient Greek. A bracelet from Ukraine bearing an anti-Putin epithet dangled from her wrist.
Taylor had caught snippets of the Senate trial in the car. His wife, who had watched 'every frigging second' of the House hearings, was avoiding it.
'I am not learning anything,' she said of the Senate proceedings. 'I am just experiencing the emotion.'
Earlier that day, Pompeo made his visit to Kyiv, which had been delayed a month. Taylor was pleased to see a photograph of Kristina Kvien, the acting ambassador, with Pompeo and the Ukrainian foreign minister.
After his meeting, Pompeo pledged that America's support for Ukraine 'would not waver.' To back up that promise, the Trump administration said it was budgeting another $400-million in aid to Ukraine for 2021. The move had strong bipartisan backing from Congress.
Some former officials, such as Yovanovitch, were warning of the damage wrought by Trump. 'Right now, the State Department is in trouble,' she said.
Taylor tended to focus on how well Washington's institutions had held up, despite the battering.
Trump might still despise Kyiv. His strange affection for Putin almost certainly remained. At the highest levels of government, senior officials still had to work around Trump's grudges, impulses and rages.
But for all the chaos of the past few months, Taylor noted that the administration's official policy toward Ukraine and Russia "" articulated by Pompeo, supported by Congress and codified in White House strategy documents "" remained essentially unchanged. Ukraine was still America's ally. Russia was still an adversary. This was one more lesson of the impeachment saga. In much of institutional Washington "" Bill Taylor's Washington "" the president was strangely the outsider.

Less than two hours after President Trump finished speaking at the White House on Tuesday about his plan to bail out industries reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, Democrats made it clear they had their own priorities.
While the president spoke about helping airlines and cruise operators - and even individual companies such as Boeing - prominent Democrats insisted that any crisis aid must include plenty of conditions designed to benefit workers. The sharp reaction was a reminder that the political wounds from the government's response to the 2008 global financial crisis remain fresh.
""Let me be clear: We're not doing no-strings-attached bailouts that enrich shareholders or pay CEO bonuses. Period,"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted.
From progressives such as Sen. Sherrod Brown (Ohio) to business-friendly figures such as Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), Democrats insisted that any corporate rescue include restrictions on stock buybacks and executive compensation along with provisions for paid sick leave, including for informal ""gig economy"" workers.
In a sign of the election-year stakes, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said the emerging debate offered a clear contrast ""between us and our Republican friends.""
Trump, who once criticized President Barack Obama's bailout of the U.S. auto industry as ""ruining American industry,"" now confronts the toxic politics of crisis-fighting. As his two most recent predecessors discovered in 2008 and 2009, battling an economic emergency involves balancing competing imperatives: time and justice.
With businesses and jobs hanging in the balance, the federal government must act fast and with force to rescue the economy. But as Washington races to avert disaster, it faces demands to avoid rewarding the undeserving or worsening societal ills such as income and wealth inequality.
The president - who promised Tuesday that ""we're going big"" - appears to have embraced the first lesson. But he is struggling with the second. His plan to provide $50 billion to the airline industry, part of a $1 trillion package that includes cash payments to individual Americans, is rviving the debate about public bailouts of private businesses that has roiled national politics foer more than a decade.
""Every industry is affected. Every restaurant is affected. How are you going to draw the line between who gets government aid and who doesn't?"" said one person briefed on internal White House deliberations, who was not authorized to speak to reporters. ""It becomes a real corporate welfare scramble.""
The administration's request would put limits on ""increases in executive compensation"" until the loans are repaid by the airlines, according to a Treasury Department document obtained by The Washington Post.
The package also includes $150 billion in ""secured lending or loan guarantees"" for industries facing ""severe financial distress"" from the pandemic, but the document does not specify how that money would be used.
The $21 trillion U.S. economy has arrived at the brink of sudden collapse with astonishing speed. Just last month, forecasters anticipated steady economic growth for the rest of this year, and the Dow Jones industrial average was at a record high. It has fallen 9,000 points in the past month.
Now, as many as 3 million workers could lose their jobs by the end of the summer, said Josh Bivens, an economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
Yet it's not just Democrats who are uneasy about the rush to throw money at the problem. Prominent Republicans such as Sen. Rick Scott and Rep. Matt Gaetz, both of Florida, said they oppose corporate bailouts.
The administration's sales pitch reflects the sensitivities. In congressional testimony this month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin declined on four occasions to use the word ""bailout"" to describe the planned help.
""This is not a bailout. This is considering providing certain things for certain industries,"" he said.
The airlines are just the first in the line. A growing list of other industries, including hotels, casinos, cruise ships, restaurants and retailers, face similar losses.
The U.S. Travel Association on Tuesday asked Trump for $150 billion in assistance. Boeing weighed in with its own request for $60 billion in public and private cash, including loan guarantees, for aerospace manufacturers.
Hotel industry representatives met with Trump and Vice President Pence at the White House and warned of a ""catastrophic"" toll. As if to prove the point, Marriott, the world's largest hotel company, on Tuesday began furloughing or laying off tens of thousands of workers.
""The impact to our industry is already more severe than anything we've seen before, including September 11th and the Great Recession of 2008 combined,"" said Chip Rogers, president of the American Hotel & Lodging Association.
Although the incandescent anger Americans felt toward the big banks in 2008 is now absent, many Democrats want any company receiving taxpayer money to devote it to workers' pay and to refrain from stock buybacks or lavish executive pay. Some analysts said corporations should be barred from re-pricing executives' stock options to make it easier for them to profit from an economic recovery.
Asked Tuesday whether the bailouts would carry any restrictions, the president looked to the vice president, saying: ""I think I'm going to ask Mike. Answer that question, please.""
Pence parried, saying only the industry aid package is ""a work in progress.""
U.S. officials insist this time is different. In 2008, millions of voters blamed the big banks for wrecking the U.S. economy by making reckless investments. This time, the culprit behind the economic trauma is a natural force - the virus - and the companies are blameless.
""This is not their fault. We have to help them,"" Trump said.
Yet many Democrats are reluctant to write a check for corporations, which received a windfall from $1.5 trillion tax cut legislation in 2017.
The airlines, in particular, used much of the cash they generated during the long economic expansion to buy back their stock from investors. That typically pushes stock prices higher, which benefits executives whose compensation is tied to share prices.
United Airlines chief executive Oscar Muñoz, for example, earned total compensation of $10.5 million, according to the company's most recent securities filing.
Four airlines - American, United, Delta and Southwest - collectively spent more than $39 billion over the past five years on stock buybacks, said Howard Silverblatt, an analyst with S&P Global. Some of the lawmakers who will consider the airlines' requests for help want limits on such practices.
""If there is so much as a DIME of corporate bailout money in the next relief package, it should include a reinstated ban on stock buybacks,"" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) tweeted Tuesday.
The politics of any coronavirus bailout reflect the lessons of the 2008 Wall Street rescue, which began as a bipartisan venture only to sour into a source of polarization.
The George W. Bush and Obama administrations' $700 billion effort to rescue the financial system triggered massive political protests by the left and the right, fueling an anti-establishment wave that ultimately lifted a reality television star from New York to the White House.
By 2009, as Obama and congressional Democrats sought to use public money to rescue wounded financial institutions, their actions were opposed by many Republicans, who advocated letting the market sort out winners and losers.
When the banks that were saved in 2008 paid out $140 billion in executive bonuses in 2009, voters on both sides erupted.
Today, Democrats - who lost the House in 2010 amid a conservative rebellion over bailouts - demand strict conditions on aid. And many Republicans, including National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow - who wrote in 2008 that such programs make ""a mockery of free-market capitalism"" - have ditched their objections.
""The bailouts in 2008 were not the problem. The problem was the terms, conditions and recipients,"" said Dennis Kelleher, head of the nonpartisan group Better Markets. ""It created the tea party on the right, Occupy Wall Street on the left and ultimately delivered us President Trump.""

ROME "" Vice President Pence, in Israel, marked the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. He slipped a prayer into Jerusalem's Western Wall and bowed his head. And he visited with Pope Francis here in Rome before gazing upward at the Sistine Chapel.
But Pence's whirlwind, 77-hour trip abroad was nearly as notable for what he didn't do "" and didn't say "" as for what he did.
Over two full days and two stops "" the first in Jerusalem, the second in Rome "" the vice president largely escaped the impeachment vortex consuming the nation's capital some 5,000 miles away.
President Trump spent his foreign sojourn to Davos this week obsessing over the Senate trial back home "" tweeting more than a dozen times before dawn on his final day in Switzerland and railing against what he called 'the hoax' focused on his alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine for political gain. Pence, by contrast, cut a calmer and more sanguine visage, ostensibly unconcerned by the constitutional controversy raging back home.
Pence never brought up impeachment unprompted, weighing in only when asked by reporters, including during a short news conference at the end of his day in Rome.
Pence reiterated his previous claims that he had no awareness of a push by Trump and his associates, including personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, to withhold critical U.S. aid from Ukraine in exchange for an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
'What I've said over and over again is I was never aware of the allegations that there was some pressure campaign for investigations against the Bidens that was underway until those matters became public,' he said.
The vice president also added that while he had initially said he had no problem releasing a transcript of his own phone conversation with Ukraine's president, he was now more reticent after coming to believe that the Democrats' impeachment inquiry was simply a 'sham investigation.'
'The outcome here is that the president should be acquitted,' Pence said. 
Outside those brief remarks, the most tangible reminder of the latest scandal engulfing the Trump presidency followed Pence abroad in the form of the screens of Fox News "" the in-flight entertainment choice that aired parts of the impeachment proceedings as Air Force Two knifed through a darkening sky.
On Thursday, at the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, the vice president extended an invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "" as well as to Benny Gantz, his rival in the country's upcoming elections "" to travel to Washington next week for the unveiling of the administration's new peace plan.
Earlier in the day, speaking alongside other world leaders at the Holocaust remembrance site Yad Vashem to commemorate the anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation, Pence condemned the 'vile tide of anti-Semitism that is fueling hate and violence all across the world.' He also singled out Iran, calling on other nations to 'stand strong against the leading state purveyor of anti-Semitism, against the one government in the world that denies the Holocaust as a matter of state policy and threatens to wipe Israel off the map.'
The vice president, who last year visited the concentration camp in Poland where more than 1.1-million men, women and children perished under Nazi control during World War II, recounted how moving the experience was for him.
'One cannot see the piles of shoes, the gas chambers, the crematoriums, the lone boxcar facing the gate to the camp and those grainy photographs of men, women and children being sent to their deaths without asking, 'How could they?' ' he said.
Pence's latest foreign trip is another reminder of the vice president's uncanny knack for seeming to sidestep the morass of the Trump administration, often through unintentionally well-timed travel out of town.
In August 2017, Pence left for a week-long trip to Latin America immediately after deadly violence at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville. He was still abroad when Trump held a much-criticized news conference in the lobby of Trump Tower declaring that 'both sides' were to blame.
Pence did weigh in at the time from Chile but largely sidestepped a question about whether he agreed with Trump that both sides were responsible, instead simply affirming that he stood with the president. He cut his trip short by a day, returning to Washington early for a strategy meeting with Trump and his national security team at Camp David.
In early 2018, Pence was in Japan, en route to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, when news broke that staff secretary Rob Porter was being pushed from the White House amid allegations of domestic abuse from his two ex-wives.
'I learned as I awoke this morning of those developments,' Pence said, prompting a follow-up question from his traveling press corps about why he often seemed 'a little bit out of the loop on some of this major news.'
Later that year, in November, Pence again traveled to Asia, just days after Democrats won control of the House in the midterm elections, when Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, installing loyalist Matthew G. Whitaker atop the Justice Department.
In February 2019, Pence flew to Colombia to announce new sanctions against Venezuela at the beginning of the week that Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney and fixer, testified before Congress about the president's alleged misdeeds. His trip also coincided with Trump's failed summit in Hanoi with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
And throughout much of last year "" as special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's Russia probe reached its culmination and the impeachment inquiry began to boil "" Pence was hopscotching the country, helping promote Trump's trade deal with Mexico and Canada.
Pence's far-flung travels are partly a function of the unconventional Trump White House. The president is a homebody reluctant to travel abroad, frequently delegating foreign trips to his No. 2. 
On Friday in Rome, Pence appeared both geographically and mentally removed from the spectacle of impeachment.
He began his day at the Vatican, deploying his standard opening line with the pope "" an offering of his 'warmest greetings' from Trump "" before the two men exchanged gifts, with Pence, a self-described 'evangelical Catholic,' giving the leader of the faith a wooden cross.
During the meeting, Pence and the pope discussed the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, displaced religious minorities in the Middle East and the antiabortion March for Life, Pence said. 
'I won't forget "" you made me a hero,' Pence told Francis before departing through the Clement VIII door, in a possible reference to Pence's mother's admiration for the pontiff.
Pence then entered the Sistine Chapel, which was already thick with tourists, some of whom momentarily averted their eyes from Michelangelo's fresco to gape at the vice president. One woman pointed at Pence, offered a thumbs up and requested a picture.
The vice president smiled before turning back to his tour guide, who made a good-natured gesture to signify that the eager tourist was just another one of the 'Americans' "" like Pence, far from home.

Policy scholar
on how to interpret his State of the Union address
There was a mostly unexpected twist in Tuesday night's State of the Union address: President Trump's sustained adulation for the bootstrapping black American. 

The speech, essentially the opening argument of his reelection bid, suggests that Trump thinks black voters will be instrumental to who wins the White House in November. And it's fair to assume, based on his remarks, that his strategy in this regard is twofold: to counter those who accuse him of racial intolerance while trying to improve on his results in 2016 "" when exit polls showed he won 8 percent of the overall black vote and 13 percent of black men.
If his address is any indication, he'll try to accomplish this by highlighting African American stories of redemption and self-determination that appeal both to America's 'benevolent nation' narrative and to the conservative strain in black America grounded in bootstrapping "" the conviction that grit and ingenuity are enough to overcome racial discrimination and other obstacles to prosperity. The goal isn't only, or even primarily, to chip away at Democrats' advantage among black voters; it is to reassure white voters and depress black voters' enthusiasm (and turnout) for the eventual Democratic nominee.

Trump's appeal wasn't subtle. Studies show that, along with health care, black Americans' top concerns include education and the impact of racial discrimination on economic mobility. It's no wonder, then, that the president took credit for the black (and Latino and Asian American) unemployment rate, both overall and for youth, and the black poverty rate, all of which he said had hit 'the lowest levels in history.'
He called attention to the Opportunity Zones championed by Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), spotlighting (and drawing a round of applause for) the Senate's only black Republican. Then, pointing to black Army veteran Tony Rankins, who was seated in the House gallery, Trump told the nation how the program had helped Rankins overcome drug addiction, joblessness and homelessness through the dignity of work.
Focusing on education 'to expand equal opportunity,' Trump said, his administration 'achieved record and permanent funding' for historically black colleges and universities. And armed with the knowledge that black Americans favor school choice programs at higher rates than Democrats overall, he told the story of a black fourth-grader from Philadelphia "" she and her mother were invited guests in the gallery "" who he said was denied the opportunity to attend a better school. Trump blamed swing-state Pennsylvania's Democratic governor, saying that the governor had 'vetoed legislation to expand school choice to 50,000 children.' He then surprised the student with an 'opportunity scholarship' "" a euphemism for a public voucher "" to attend the school of her choice.
He called attention to another high-achieving black student in the gallery who the president said dreams of joining the new Space Force. Then he noted that the boy was sitting next to his great-grandfather, Charles McGee, a member of the famed Tuskegee Airmen, who served honorably in combat despite rampant racial discrimination. And then Trump announced that he'd promoted the senior McGee to the rank of brigadier general and had 'pinned the stars on his shoulders in the Oval Office' earlier that day.
In a moment foreshadowed by his Super Bowl campaign ad "" featuring Alice Marie Johnson, a black woman whose federal prison sentence he commuted "" Trump recounted his signing of the First Step Act, a prison reform statute that he accurately presented as a bipartisan win. Finally, as if fresh from a Black History Month seminar, there were Trump's hat tips to Martin Luther King Jr., 'the marchers at Selma,' Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass.

Reporting from the campaign trail suggests that, at events like the recent Black Voices for Trump rally in Atlanta, Trump is making an appeal to black men in particular.
In 2016, Trump bragged that as president, he'd do so much for black America that he'd get '95 percent' of the black vote in 2020. That's not even close "" but for Trump to win reelection, it doesn't have to be.
Between 1968 and 2004, Republican presidential candidates averaged nearly 12 percent of the black vote. That's four points more than Trump managed against Hillary Clinton. He underperformed every Republican presidential candidate in the past half-century who wasn't running against Barack Obama. To win again, he need only return to the average in a relatively low-turnout election to counter black voters' support for Democratic candidates. This probably means winning over more black men, perhaps something on the order of 1 in 6, and reducing black voters' share of the electorate.
So Trump's deployment of themes of heroic individualism and religion-inflected redemption is not accidental, as they get plenty of mileage in black America. A recent survey led by think tanks Third Way and the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies showed that a majority of black Americans subscribe to the view that 'most people can get ahead with hard work,' a finding that's not surpising, considering that 67 percent of African Americans are moderate or conservative, according to Gallup. And black Americans continue to have the highest levels of religiosity in the country.
The president's goal is not to upend African Americans' overwhelming support for Democrats "" there are clear reasons for it, none of which Trump can overcome in the short term. Rather, in a close contest, the goal is to shift the electorate just enough while hanging on to his core support. The State of the Union address provided a glimpse of how Trump intends to accomplish this. By employing rhetoric that recalls Richard Nixon's 'black capitalism' "" defined in one of Nixon's campaign ads as 'black power in the best sense of the word. It's the road that leads to black economic influence and black pride. It's the key to the black man's fight for equality' "" Trump is hoping that just enough black voters will respond by supporting him or sitting out the election altogether. It remains to be seen if Trump's pitch succeeds, and much of it hinges on whom Democrats nominate and if they mobilize black turnout. 
For now, if the president's address is an indication, the black electorate "" a slice of it, anyway "" figures to feature prominently in the Trump campaign's strategy.

In times of national crisis, people look to the president for direction, reassurance and confidence. President Trump's Oval Office speech on Wednesday night provided precisely the opposite.
From the misstatements to the omissions to his labored demeanor, the president sent a message that shook financial markets, disrupted relations with European allies, confused his many viewers and undermined the most precious commodity of any president, his credibility.
With the stock markets plunging into bear territory, the health-care system struggling to keep pace with the spreading novel coronavirus and Americans wondering what's next, Trump is dealing unsteadily with the greatest crisis of his presidency. The pandemic is a physical and economic threat to the well-being of millions of Americans. It also has become a political threat to the president's hopes for a second term.
Historians will eventually assess the president's prime-time effort to calm a scared and nervous nation that is taking unprecedented steps to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. In the moment and in the immediate aftermath of the speech, the judgments were as harsh as at any time in Trump's presidency.

Almost everything that could have gone wrong with the speech did go wrong. Stock futures began to crater as the president was speaking. Government officials were forced to correct the mistakes Trump made in describing the travel ban he was imposing. Anyone looking for information about the health-care system's capacity to respond was left wanting.
Trump said that ""we have been in frequent contact with our allies"" about the crisis, but European leaders were caught off guard by the new travel restrictions and issued a harsh statement in response. 
""The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to impose a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation,"" said the statement signed by two leaders of the E.U.
This has been described as akin to President George W. Bush's ""Katrina moment,"" the botched response to the 2005 hurricane that flooded parts of New Orleans. But for all the devastation caused by that storm, the coronavirus is far worse in its impacts and disruptions, and the consequences for Trump are potentially enormous. Daily life has been upended across the country in ways unimaginable when the virus began to hit people. The president's tweets, meanwhile, swing from upbeat claims to dire warnings to medical advice.
This is a crisis not of the president's making, but Trump has become the government's least credible leader in the response to it. He is a cheerleader by nature, a president who is more comfortable dealing in exaggerations than facts. Trained scientists and medical doctors in government have sought to provide realistic assessments to the public. Trump has made false predictions and statements that contradict the experts.

Visiting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last Friday, he said tests for the virus were available to anyone who wanted one, a demonstrably false statement at a time when the government was rushing to get more tests out and available, as other officials were acknowledging.
Trump went on to say those tests were totally reliable and, in a statement that revealed his own state of mind, drew a comparison with his telephone call to the Ukrainian president that led to his impeachment and acquittal. ""The tests are all perfect, like the letter was perfect,"" he said. ""The transcription was perfect.""
Vice President Pence, who is in charge of the overall federal response to the pandemic, has tried to project a sense of calm and knowledgeability. He defers as is necessary to the experts in the government. But he also feels a need constantly to praise the president, as if Trump has truly been the stable, guiding hand in all this.
Immediately after Trump spoke Wednesday night, the White House and an official at the Department of Homeland Security clarified misleading or incorrect statements made during the speech. Asked about this on Thursday morning on CNN, Pence replied, ""I don't think there was confusion,"" and he went on to praise the president for more ""historic"" steps.
Pence and those on the team tasked with coordinating the response are working cooperatively with state and local leaders, which is critical at this moment. Meanwhile, the president has called Gov. Jay Inslee (D) of Washington, where the outbreak has brought more deaths than anywhere in the country, ""a snake.""
The president looks to blame others. It's correct that the Chinese government made all this worse by initially trying to cover up the outbreak, which contributed to the virus's rapid spreading there and now around the world. But trying to make this into some kind of foreign invasion belies the nature of the pandemic.
Trump blames Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell for the tanking stock markets. The Washington Post reported Wednesday that an angry president ordered Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to press Powell to take more-aggressive action to stimulate the economy. Never mind that the Fed's first attempt to do so recently did nothing to prevent the markets from falling further.

The president spoke Wednesday night about forthcoming economic proposals designed to aid companies and individuals as they cope with the financial burdens of the crisis. Some things he can do by executive action; others, such as his call for payroll tax relief, would require congressional action and coordination with congressional Democrats. On Wednesday, House Democrats outlined their own package of economic assistance.
There is no more important priority for the president now than dealing with the coronavirus. By his tweets, it is evident he finds regular distractions, including the contest for the Democratic presidential nomination. He has chosen to be a frequent commentator about the Democratic race, a kibitzer and a disrupter.
He has suggested that the Democratic establishment has robbed Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) of the nomination. He has claimed that Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has helped weaken Sanders and thereby strengthened Joe Biden.
His Ukraine intervention was designed to harm Biden, and now it is all but certain that Biden will be his opponent in the general election. But before he gets to that confrontation, he must deal with the threats posed to the country by the deadly coronavirus.
""This is just a temporary moment of time that we will overcome together as a nation and as a world,"" Trump said from the Oval Office on Wednesday night.
That is everyone's hope. And along with that hope is a desire for the president to provide the leadership the moment demands.

Trump's approach to both allies and adversaries stirs worry for long-term effects
When President Trump decided early in his administration to pressure fellow NATO members to spend more on their military budgets, he threatened to pull out of the alliance.
When Iraqi leaders this month said they wanted U.S. troops to leave their country, the president said he would impose 'very big sanctions' on Baghdad in response.
And after tensions with Iran recently escalated to the point of potential war, his administration privately threatened large automobile tariffs on European countries if they didn't call out Tehran for alleged violations of the 2015 nuclear deal that Trump has sought to dismantle.
Trump's maximalist approach to diplomacy has become a hallmark of his administration's foreign policy, one that has scored him some short-term victories, been derided as extortion by his detractors and played a central role in an impeachment fight over his actions toward Ukraine that will play out on the floor of the Senate this week.
Although the president has been inconsistent in how he has carried out his worldview, he has made clear that he has no plans to back away from his strong-arm tactics even as they have increasingly antagonized American friends and foes alike, leaving the United States potentially more isolated on the world stage.
 Trump heads to snowy Davos, Switzerland, on Monday for an economic forum attended by world leaders and corporate honchos where tensions with his administration will probably be on display. The president is expected to use his address there Tuesday to crow about successful trade deals, a humming U.S. economy and his recent showdown with Iran.
'We are booming. Our country is the hottest country anywhere in the world. There's nothing even close,' Trump said Thursday as he confirmed that he planned to go to Davos. 'Every world leader sees me and they say, 'What have you done? This is the most incredible thing that we've ever seen.'-'
Trump's visit to Davos will put him in close quarters with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and executives from European manufacturers days after news that the Trump administration had threatened a 25-percent tariff on European automobiles.
The White House has not announced whether Trump will meet directly with Merkel, although diplomats said they expect the two to talk. Germany has been a central target of Trump's threats on several fronts, as he argues that it does not compensate the United States enough for the military units hosted there and has been allowed to take advantage of economic policies that are unfair to American consumers and companies.
How to deal with Iran is also likely to be a subject of discussion at the forum, particularly if Trump and Merkel meet.
Last week, the Trump administration confounded European officials by threatening to impose the auto tariffs if the governments of Britain, France and Germany didn't initiate a mechanism in the Iran nuclear accord that could reimpose an arms embargo and economic sanctions on Tehran. That step, which the three took Tuesday, could eventually unravel the wobbly remains of the Obama-era agreement, though the Europeans are still actively seeking to salvage it. Trump pulled the United States out of the international pact in 2018, but the other signatories to the deal have tried to keep Iran committed to its tenets.
'Extortion,' said one European official of the U.S. effort to coerce European foreign policy through tariffs.
That official and others spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the sensitive diplomacy on the record.
The U.S. allies had already planned to initiate the dispute mechanism, said U.S. and European officials, but the threat forced them to reevaluate their plans for fear of being viewed as bowing to Washington pressure. 
'We wanted to do this, but Trump's threat nearly derailed the plans because of how sensitive we are to being perceived as Washington's lap dog,' said a European official. 
Ultimately, Britain, France and Germany agreed to stay the course and keep the threat a secret. The Washington Post first reported on the administration's backroom dealings, causing embarrassment on both sides of the Atlantic. 
'This case demonstrated that the Trump administration has lost the art of diplomacy with allies,' said Jeremy Shapiro, director of research at the European Council on Foreign Relations. 'The entire nature of a close ally is that you work together to find ways to be in sync without resorting to threats.'
The incident also revealed a possible lack of internal coordination on the part of the administration that is also not uncommon during Trump's presidency. The U.S. ambassador to Germany, Richard Grenell, denied the accuracy of The Post article on Twitter and said he didn't think a tariff threat was ever issued. But David Hale, the undersecretary for political affairs at the State Department, communicated the warning to his European counterparts on Jan.-8, according to European officials familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to address the private discussions.
German Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer also confirmed the U.S. threat during a news conference in London last week.
'This expression, or threat, as you will, does exist,' she said.
Trump will also be in Davos as the Senate begins debating impeachment charges tied to his actions involving Ukraine. 
House Democrats allege that Trump tried to leverage a White House meeting and military aid, sought by Ukraine to combat Russian military aggression, to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, as well as a probe of an unfounded theory that Kyiv conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.
Trump insists he did nothing wrong and that his concern was with corruption broadly in Ukraine rather than to force investigations that could benefit him in his reelection campaign this year.
And as part of Trump's defense, administration officials have tried to couch his handling of Ukraine policy, which even concerned some Republicans while the aid was withheld over the summer, as fitting perfectly within his strong-arm foreign policy approach as they deny any corrupt intent on Trump's part.
'Elections do have consequences and they should,' acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said during an October news conference. 'And your foreign policy is going to change. [President Barack] Obama did it in one way; we're doing it a different way. And there's no problem with that.'
In the broader debate over Trump's foreign policy, there have been repeated clashes over both the short- and long-term implications for the United States. While proponents of Trump's coercive style say it has produced results, critics contend that it has hurt American leadership in the world and cost the United States some trust and goodwill among friends.
Trump rankled allies last year when he attempted to extract billions of dollars from them through a formula he coined 'cost plus 50-percent,' meaning that countries should pay the cost of stationing American troops on their territory plus 50-percent more. 
The formula alarmed European officials, most acutely in Germany, where the Pentagon has more than 33,000 troops. After the backlash, defense officials said the formula only pertained to U.S. allies in Asia. Japan and South Korea have not met the cost either, though Seoul has paid more to Washington than it did in the past.
Last year, South Korea agreed to pay $925-million for hosting 28,500 American troops. That was an 8.2-percent increase from the previous year's payment and about half the total costs. South Korean officials preferred a five-year agreement, but the deal covered only one.
On Thursday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper wrote a joint column in the Wall Street Journal proclaiming that 'Seoul can and should contribute more to its own national defense.' 
The article caused unease in Seoul because of its implication that South Korea was acting more like a 'dependent' than an 'ally' "" conversations that typically happen behind closed doors rather than in a national newspaper. 
'President Trump fails to understand why America has allies in the first place,' said Harry Kazianis, an Asia specialist at the Center for the National Interest. 'He treats allies more like mafia partners in crime who need to kiss up to America for protection.'
Trump says he is using the skills of a real estate magnate to get better deals for Americans whose global generosity he says has been abused. He points to a long-delayed remake of the North American Free Trade Agreement and an interim trade deal with China, both finalized last week, as evidence that tariffs and other punitive tactics are effective.
His supporters also argue that Mexico tightened its immigration enforcement last year because of Trump's threat to impose crushing economic tariffs.
Pompeo said in June that the immigration agreement with Mexico 'reflects diplomacy at its finest,' while being 'a significant win for the American people' and fulfillment of a core Trump promise to secure the U.S.-Mexico border.
But Trump's critics said there is little to no long-term strategic thought to his approach.
'Every day we learn more about the tactics this administration uses to further its goals, and every day we see that they are no more sophisticated than the tactics of gangsters,' said Dana Shell Smith, a former ambassador to Qatar who quit in protest of Trump policies.

Pact allows individuals to give nearly $600,000 to his reelection effort
Donors to President Trump's reelection are now permitted to give nearly $600,000 per year, boosting the president's ability to raise money from wealthy supporters months before the general election contest begins in earnest.
Under an agreement announced Wednesday by Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee for the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, a single donor can give as much as $580,600 this year to support Trump's reelection "" higher than the committee's previous caps on contributions.
That means the Republican National Committee's biggest contributors could end up having shelled out as much as $1.6 million to support Trump's 2020 reelection over the course of the four-year election cycle, according to a Washington Post analysis.
Trump has raised and spent more money than his predecessors, and this change is expected to give him a further fundraising advantage. Trump entered 2020 with nearly $200 million in cash, party officials said "" a huge war chest that outstrips the resources of his Democratic opponents as they head into primary contests.
It is the latest example of the dramatically expanding fundraising power of national party committees, made possible through pivotal legal changes in 2014 that loosened restrictions on individual contributions. While a person can give a maximum of $5,600 to Trump's campaign committee, a donor can legally give 103 times more in support of Trump's reelection through the new joint fundraising arrangement.
Trump Victory, which had been raising money for Trump 2020 and the RNC, was able to raise the top giving level by signing up 22 state parties to raise money together, which allows the committee to raise its contribution cap. The number of state parties supported through Trump Victory could expand, raising the possibility that the maximum contribution could grow even larger.
Both major political parties have taken advantage of this maneuver. Hillary Clinton was the first presidential candidate to establish a joint fundraising committee when she was a front-runner in the 2016 Democratic primaries, collecting up to $356,100 per year per donor for her White House bid, the Democratic National Committee and 32 state parties. Trump and the RNC then set up their own joint effort, Trump Victory, asking donors for as much as $449,400 in 2016.
These joint committees have allowed presidential candidates to collect massive sums from their party's top donors. The Hillary Victory Fund raised $530 million in 2015 and 2016, federal filings show. Trump Victory raised $108 million in the 2016 election cycle.
'With this agreement, the RNC, Trump campaign, and state parties will continue our massive fundraising advantage which allows for the largest data-driven ground game in Party history,' Mandi Merritt, an RNC spokeswoman, said in a statement.
The new agreement highlights the GOP's efforts to boost Trump's reelection war chest with an infusion of big donations "" a shift from Trump's first run for president, when he criticized opponents for relying on the help of rich contributors.
Trump also is supported by a second joint fundraising group, Trump Make America Great Again Committee. It can receive as much as $360,600 per donor per year but is typically used to raise smaller donations.
Trump's reelection campaign, the RNC and the two joint fundraising committees together have already scooped up a staggering $463 million in 2019, party officials said. In comparison, then-President Barack Obama and the Democratic Party raised roughly $220 million in 2011, the year before Obama's reelection.
On Wednesday, former Fox News personality Kimberly Guilfoyle was announced as the national chair of Trump Victory's Finance Committee "" an effort to draw on Guilfoyle's star power to recruit a national network of well-connected fundraisers to bring in large checks to the committee.
'The ability to accept the mega MAGA check is another nail in the eventual Democratic nominee's coffin "" and it's a big nail,' said Dan Eberhart, a prominent Trump donor. 'When the Democrats finally settle on a nominee in July, the lucky candidate is going to be nipping at the heels of a giant mastiff.'
The Democratic National Committee has been raising money through a joint fundraising committee as well, soliciting an even higher maximum check of $865,000 per year to raise money for the Democratic Party and 51 state parties. But because there is no nominee yet, none of the current Democratic candidates can benefit from that fundraising.
The Democratic presidential field together has outraised pro-Trump committees in 2019, which Democratic strategists say is a sign of mounting financial support that will coalesce for the eventual nominee. But much of the money raised by the candidates so far is likely to be spent by the time the nominee is chosen, leaving the nominee and the party needing to ramp up fundraising efforts quickly after the convention.
The DNC raised $28 million in the final three months of 2019, officials said Tuesday. Between the DNC and the Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund, the party raised $95 million for 2019, officials said Tuesday "" which they said was greater than the annual total in 2015 when the party held the White House.
The official fundraising figures from both parties will be made public by the Federal Election Commission on Jan. 31.

AKRON, Ohio "" By the time Mike Bloomberg sniffed the hydroponic basil growing in an old tire factory here, he had already traveled 1,700 miles in three hops on his chartered plane, met with the mayor of Chicago and climbed into a soybean tractor on the frozen plains of southern Minnesota.
It was a show of force "" four states in less than 17 hours on Wednesday, each event meticulously produced for local press, with separate rented motorcades and a button-down advance staff that choreographed his movements like a ballet. No other presidential candidate in the Democratic field would have tried to pull this off in January. 
As the cameras shuttered before the purple grow lights of an urban farm, he asked whether anyone knew the difference between a good salesman and a great one. The good salesman, he explained, can face rejection at one door and move on to the next just as convinced he will make the sale. 
'The great salesman knocks on the same door,' he said with a sly smile. 
The thing that makes Bloomberg different is that he can knock on all doors at once. Bloomberg is running aggressively to win the Democratic nomination, but he is simultaneously building out a general election machine to defeat President Trump, with a new structure "" data, field organizing, advertising and policy "" that aims to elect Democrats up and down the ballot even if the party's voters reject the former New York mayor this spring. 
The party he is moving to transform, which he only rejoined in October, has become little more than a bystander to his ambition. With more than 800 employees, $200 million in ad spending so far and a fully catered Times Square office that houses hundreds of employees, 'Mike Bloomberg 2020, Inc.' does not resemble a primary campaign in any traditional sense. It is an experiment in what happens to democracy when a single faction operates without economic constraints. 
While most presidential efforts start early and poor, the Bloomberg project exists in an inverted dimension, a fact that has caught the attention of Trump, who spent years closely tracking Bloomberg's political career in New York. The president has been monitoring Bloomberg's campaign, impressed by his extraordinary spending and fearful of his potential rise, according to Trump confidants with whom the president has discussed Bloomberg. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy.

Bloomberg's aides, in turn, have delighted in trying to find ways to get Trump's attention and increase his anxiety, such as the recent purchase of an $11 million Super Bowl ad that will run against a similar spot purchased by Trump's campaign. When Trump tweeted an attack on Bloomberg on Monday, the former mayor's team was delighted.
'Glad to see you're watching our ads,' Bloomberg tweeted in response. 
The extravagance is part of the message, an attempt to demonstrate his competence and show that he can manage something big with good intentions. 
'We also want people to know that we are building a juggernaut pointed at Donald Trump and the Republican Party,' said Tim O'Brien, a senior adviser to the campaign who has been taking the message to state parties around the country. 'One of Mike's goals is to make a machine that lasts. This idea that he wants to do a vanity run or is just buying exposure is belied by that.'

To begin with, that means building a fully staffed general election campaign in January to win primary contests in March, with a suite of high-profile recruits on the payroll, including former top executives for Facebook, Foursquare and GroupM, the world's largest advertising media company by billings. No one at headquarters knows what he will ultimately choose to spend, but they operate for the moment without budgets, putting the 12th-richest person on the planet on a path to spend $1-billion or more.
He wants Democrats to know he is happy to spread the money around. During a swing through Texas on Saturday, when his campaign staged more than 150 events in 27 states in a show of organizing prowess, he cast himself as a potential benefactor and mentor for all state and local party organizations. 
'I think you look at each,' Bloomberg said, when asked whether he would boost them. 'You look to see how well they're run, and if you tried to help, that you'd be able to help. That's number one. And number two would be that your money would be used efficiently. And it's not just money. We can bring some advice.'
Whether he wins or loses the nomination, the ubiquitous television and digital ads he is running have been crafted as the opening exchange in a conversation about Trump's failures that will continue through November.
'I am looking forward to making a multi-month-long case to voters that will end on Election Day with his defeat,' says Howard Wolfson, a top adviser overseeing the paid media efforts. 
New health-care spots that began airing Monday focus nearly as much on attacking Trump as introducing Bloomberg. 'America is sick of Donald Trump, and America is getting sicker,' begins one ad voice-over, as the screen shows unflattering photos of the president. 'There are 1 million more uninsured Americans every year under Trump.' 
In a sign of how closely Trump is monitoring Bloomberg's spots, the president responded Monday to a new ad that denounced Trump for supporting a Justice Department lawsuit to overturn protections for people with preexisting conditions. 
'Mini Mike Bloomberg is spending a lot of money on False Advertising,' Trump wrote, in a tweet that was itself misleading. 'I was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your Healthcare.' 
(Trump argues that he will urge Congress to reinstate the protections if he succeeds in court at removing them.)
Bloomberg's data operation, cryptically called Hawkfish, aims to incorporate expensive demographic and targeting data, parts of which can later be fed back into the party's databases or repurposed for the broader fight against Trump and Republicans. The fact that he is a candidate gives him greater access to party data than he would otherwise have, and as a candidate, he also benefits from lower television ad rates in swing states before their primary contests than he would if he simply advertised against Trump as a regular citizen. 
The massive campaign staffs he has been bringing on in swing states "" 60 in Arizona and more than 80 in North Carolina, for example, at a time when most candidates are focused in Iowa "" have been promised jobs through the July convention or November election, long after his primary campaign closes up shop.
On the walls of the campaign headquarters in Manhattan, on a floor previously occupied by the New York Times, two digital countdown clocks hang in pairs. One ticks to Super Tuesday, March 3, when Bloomberg hopes to pick up delegates in 14 states after declining to campaign in the first four contests. The other aims at the general election in November. 
'Either it is going to be the best primary campaign in American history, or the greatest IE that has ever been created,' said campaign manager Kevin Sheekey, using the political lingo for an independent expenditure campaign, the super PAC-type efforts that wealthy interests use to influence elections. 
All parts of any campaign that have been run before "" an aggressive constituency operation, a surrogate team, a Spanish-language effort, local media teams in dozens of states so far "" have been built out. Top aides have been telling Bloomberg to give his cellphone number to superdelegates whose support could play a decisive role in a contested convention. 
His campaign is turning out a steady stream of campaign swag "" sold at cost, not to raise money "" in the hopes of a coming demand for 'I LIKE MIKE' and 'Democracy is not a witch hunt' T-shirts.
His own social set has been taken care of, as well. Even though Bloomberg will not accept campaign contributions, part of his political operation, called Committee for Mike, is courting Wall Street executives, New York philanthropists and other local leaders with special events and weekly invite-only conference calls. The request is influence. 
'Amplify our message by acting as validators in the media, within your professional network, and other spheres,' the campaign wrote in a recent email to the group, after Bloomberg invited dozens to a campaign breakfast briefing at one of his Upper East Side buildings.
Despite all the spending, his primary hopes depend largely on factors well beyond his control. If former vice president Joe Biden performs well in the early states, Bloomberg's moderate appeal will likely be overshadowed. But in the case of a stumble, or a divided field, Bloomberg could position himself as a party broker with a minority of delegates, or as a moderate unity candidate, aiming to bring together the party. 
On the campaign trail, much of what he is doing in the meantime is defiant in its vague appeal. An engineer by nature who likes to talk about delegating authority, he is focused on process and efficient message delivery. Despite 12 years as mayor, he is still learning to emote and talk with his hands. His campaign signs have the same blue-on-blue design used by the 2012 Obama campaign, and his entrance song at events, lifted from John F. Kerry's acceptance speech at the 2004 convention, is U2's 'Beautiful Day.'
His policy, though sometimes nuanced on paper, is uncomplicated in presentation, leaning heavily on phrases known to move focus groups. 

'My pitch, I guess,' he told more than 500 potential supporters in Ohio on Wednesday, reading from notes, 'is if you want health insurance for everyone, if you want to combat inequality with fairer taxes and better jobs, if you want to share my belief in opportunity for all, if you support a commitment to quality education in this country for everybody, if you want to clean out the White House, clean out the Oval Office, if you want to get things done, join Team Bloomberg.' 
At an earlier event in Chicago, only a couple hundred showed up, and some of them seemed less than convinced. One group of a half-dozen younger attendees in the audience said they found out about the event through their employer, which one young woman said she was 'scared' to identify. 
But a few feet away, fear of a different sort had produced real support. 'We are really scared,' said Brenda Gordon, a teacher of dentistry from Chicago, speaking of Trump. She said she came to the event after signing up for the email list for a man she believed could win, whom she called 'my exception to the old white man rule.' 
'He is everything Trump wishes he was,' she said. 'He is a real billionaire.' 
As Bloomberg finished his remarks in Akron, and prepared to travel back to Queens, where his day had begun, he admitted that he was not looking forward to the fourth flight.
But he also wanted the crowd to know that he is just getting started.
 'Tomorrow, it starts again,' he said. 'I'm the luckiest guy in the world.'

Concerns about firms paying zero as aides work on middle-class tax break
Economic advisers to the White House have suggested President Trump propose a new minimum tax on corporations as part of his election year 'tax cut 2.0' package, two people briefed on the planning said, hoping to address criticism that the 2017 tax law allowed many of the country's largest firms to virtually eliminate their federal tax burden.
The idea, which is part of preliminary discussions and has not been officially endorsed, could attempt to blunt criticism from Democrats that the GOP tax law allowed many large corporations to wipe out their federal corporate taxes altogether. The plan could also help generate revenue that might be used to offset the impact of new middle-class tax cuts. Trump has promised he would roll out a middle-class tax plan before the 2020 presidential election.
The 2017 tax law lowered the corporate tax rate from 35-percent to 21-percent, but it allowed companies to continuing using loopholes and tax breaks to further lower their taxes. The tax law also eliminated the corporate alternative minimum tax, which was supposed to prevent companies from overusing deductions to avoid paying any taxes.
Democrats and critics have said this tax cut was heavily weighted toward the rich and corporations, and the component that benefits households is set to expire in a few years. Some advisers to the president fear a political backlash because of reports that some corporations have paid little or no taxes since the law's enactment, an issue seized on by some of Trump's top presidential rivals.
Both outside advisers to the president and White House officials cautioned that the process is in its preliminary stages and that no decisions have been made about the shape of a new tax cut package. Many of them spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the internal deliberations.
'Trump has been very clear: He wants this to be really targeted for people in the middle,' said one person involved in the effort. 'They are hunting for ideas and looking at what we can to do offset some of this stuff.'
Proposing a minimum tax on corporations could be interpreted by critics as an admission by the White House that its 2017 tax cut went too far in slashing business rates.
The potential tax plan also underscores the political and policy challenges the White House will face in crafting a second tax cut proposal in time for the 2020 election, in part because the White House appears to have overestimated the economic benefits that would result from the 2017 law.
External advisers to the White House have discussed constructing a $1-trillion tax cut package that is aimed at the middle class by lowering rates and expanding tax-free savings accounts. They have also discussed putting limits on the amount of state and local tax payments that companies are able to deduct from their federal taxes, people involved in the talks said.
'The White House is studying numerous proposals that will benefit the middle class and the American worker and promote long-term economic growth,' White House spokesman Judd Deere said.
An effort to limit state and local tax breaks for corporations would reprise one of the most bitter fights of the 2017 tax cut, which capped how much individual households could deduct in federal taxes from their state and local taxes. This provision, known as the 'SALT' cap, was attacked as an attempt by Trump to disproportionately raise money by taxing Democratic-run states with higher state and local tax burdens, such as California, New Jersey and New York.
'It's blue states that tend to have higher state corporate tax rates, and so they would be the ones hit most by a corporate SALT cap,' said Ernie Tedeschi, a former economist for the Obama administration.
After the tax law was passed, corporate tax payments came in about 40-percent lower than had been projected before any changes were made, according to the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank. The White House said the tax cuts would lead to a surge in new business investment, but business investment contracted much of last year. The White House also predicted that the tax cuts would help the economy grow 3-percent in 2019, but it instead grew 2.3-percent.
The 2017 tax cut is projected to increase the national debt by close to $2-trillion over 10 years, according to nonpartisan estimates, drawing criticisms against Trump of fiscal profligacy as the annual deficit rises above $1-trillion.
Opponents of the tax law such as presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have assailed the GOP and multibillion-dollar corporations for allegedly paying nothing in federal taxes under the new law. Ninety-one companies on the Fortune 500 paid zero in federal corporate taxes in 2018, more than double the amount in previous years, according to a left-leaning policy group, although experts caution it's difficult to draw exact comparisons to prior years.
The average federal tax rate of the country's largest 400 corporations was about 11-percent in 2018, the lowest rate since at least 1984 and a steep drop from the average 21-percent rate paid between 2008 and 2015, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
Companies have defended their low corporate tax burden, with some noting they are either deferring tax payments into future years or using new deductions intended to encourage new business investment. Republicans and conservative tax experts also say the business tax cut helped spur economic growth and dramatically increased business investment in the economy. The economy grew 2.9-percent in 2018, a three-year high.
'Americans are returning to the workforce, and consumers have more money in their pockets. President Trump's economic program is leading to more jobs and higher wages for hardworking Americans,' Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement last year.

Democrats on Thursday seized on a new report citing unredacted emails that bolster the case that President Trump was directly involved in withholding military aid to Ukraine as he was seeking investigations that could benefit his reelection bid.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) joined Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) in pressing for key witnesses and documents to be included in a Senate impeachment trial of Trump following the report.
Senate leaders remained at an impasse Thursday over the scope of a trial, and aides to Schumer and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the two men had not spoken over the holidays about the standoff. Pelosi has held off sending the articles of impeachment "" alleging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress "" to the Senate as Democrats seek guarantees about witnesses and documents that will be subpoenaed regarding Trump's conduct toward Ukraine.
The report by Kate Brannen, published by Just Security, referenced an email from Michael Duffey, associate director of national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget, to Elaine McCusker, the acting Pentagon comptroller, on Aug. 30, a little more than a month after Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for investigations during a phone call.
In the email, which followed a meeting with Trump that included senior administration officials, Duffey told McCusker, 'Clear direction from POTUS to hold.'
A redacted version of that email "" and several others cited in the report by Brannen, a veteran Pentagon reporter "" had previously been made public as the result of Freedom of Information Act litigation. 
'The newly-revealed unredacted emails are a devastating blow to Senator McConnell's push to have a trial without the documents and witnesses we've requested,' Schumer said in a statement Thursday. 'These emails further expose the serious concerns raised by Trump administration officials about the propriety and legality of the president's decision to cut off aid to Ukraine to benefit himself.'
Schumer has sought guarantees from McConnell that several administration officials who declined to participate in House impeachment proceedings will be subpoenaed to testify in a Senate trial, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, former national security adviser John Bolton and Duffey. McConnell has said the Senate should decide on what if any witnesses to call after hearing opening statements from House impeachment managers and Trump's lawyers.
Schumer said the unredacted emails raise 'questions that can only be answered by having the key Trump administration officials . . . testify under oath in a Senate trial.'
'The American people deserve a fair trial that gets to the truth, not a rigged process that enables a cover-up,' Schumer said.
At the heart of the Democrats' case is the allegation that Trump tried to leverage a White House meeting and $391-million in congressionally appropriated military aid, sought by Ukraine to combat Russian military aggression, to pressure Zelensky to launch an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 presidential candidate, and his son Hunter Biden, as well as a probe of an unfounded theory that Kyiv conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.
In a tweet, Pelosi said, 'Trump engaged in unprecedented, total obstruction of Congress, hiding these emails, all other documents, and his top aides from the American people. His excuse was a phony complaint about the House process. What's the excuse now? Why won't Trump - McConnell allow a fair trial?'

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said in a statement that the messages show that the White House 'cannot argue that the aid was held for any reason other than to pressure Ukraine into helping the President's re-election efforts.'

Were it up to Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), historians would mention President Trump's all-but-certain impeachment acquittal much the same way baseball fans mention Barry Bonds's career home-run record "" an achievement destined to be obscured by an eternal cloud. 
While Trump, unlike Bonds, does not stand accused of benefiting from performance-enhancing drugs, Democrats started this week to make an aggressive case that the Republican-led Senate's decision Friday to end Trump's trial without summoning witnesses or documents should cast grave doubt on its outcome.
The charge has been led by the most senior Democratic officials as it grew increasingly clear this week that Republican senators would vote to reject additional evidence and pave the way for a largely partisan verdict.
Hours before the Senate voted Friday, Schumer declared any acquittal at such a trial to be 'meaningless.'
'If there are no witnesses, no documents in this trial, there will be a permanent asterisk next to the acquittal of President Trump written in permanent ink,' he said, harking to the punctuation mark that once accompanied contested records in sports almanacs.
On Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) declared flatly that Trump 'will not be acquitted' regardless of the vote. 
'You cannot be acquitted if you don't have a trial,' she said. 'And you don't have a trial if you don't have witnesses and documentation.'
Prior to Trump's trial, the Senate has held 15 impeachment trials, including two for a president. All had witnesses.
The Democratic rhetoric was, on one hand, an early attempt to salvage what promises to be a crushing political loss. After warning for months about the dangers of a partisan impeachment, Pelosi led the House down that path after allegations of grave misdeeds emerged from the Trump administration "" only to find the GOP ever-willing to stand by Trump in the face of damaging revelations.
On the other hand, Schumer, Pelosi and other Democrats are launching an appeal that they hope will have staying power. In the short term, that means impressing on voters that they ought to treat Trump's certain claims of vindication with deep skepticism. In the longer term, they are banking that history will remember unkindly those who stood with Trump.
'This is only the third time we've had a vote on convicting and removing a president,' said Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.). 'I think it's going to be remembered as something incredibly serious, and certainly we want to point out to colleagues that they should be thinking about that now.'
Some Republican senators have suggested they are indeed thinking about their place in history. Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) launched his political career in the shadow of fellow Tennessee Republican Howard Baker Jr., who as a member of the Senate Watergate Committee helped expose President Richard M. Nixon's wrongdoing and later persuaded him to resign rather than face impeachment.
Alexander told reporters Friday he believed he had followed Baker's example, concluding that Trump's 'inappropriate conduct' was not worthy of removal from office nine months before an election. 
Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) reached for institutional concerns Friday in announcing her decision not to pursue additional evidence, decrying the 'partisan nature' of the impeachment and attempts to 'drag the Supreme Court into the fray,' citing attacks on Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.
For most Republicans, any attempts to cast aspersions on the trial in the GOP Senate were met with attacks on the impeachment process in the Democratic House, which raced over the course of three months to assemble a case against Trump despite the White House blocking witnesses and withholding documents. In the end, no Republicans voted for the two articles of impeachment; Rep. Justin Amash (I-Mich.), a former Republican, joined with Democrats.
'There is a massive asterisk on the impeachment itself, the way that the entire House process was run,' said Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.). 'And if Senator Schumer's effort to rewrite history . . . will look back on what happened over on the House side "" the fact is [the Senate] inherited a fatally flawed case, a fatally flawed process from the House.' 
For Trump, the focus has been less on the history books and more on his reelection prospects, as he has used virtually every lever of persuasion at his disposal "" from his Twitter account to a massive campaign account "" to drive the message that the impeachment has been an unfair partisan witch hunt that misconstrued a 'perfect phone call' with the Ukrainian president in July.
The argument was echoed in the Senate chamber during the trial by Trump's defense team, which argued repeatedly that Trump did 'absolutely nothing wrong,' and it is expected to persist well after the acquittal "" with claims of vindication likely to stretch through the November elections and beyond.
While the outcome of the witness vote was in doubt until Alexander announced a no vote Thursday night, the likelihood of an acquittal was never seriously challenged. A conviction would require at least 20 Republicans to join with all 47 members of the Democratic caucus, and no more than a small handful of GOP lawmakers ever swayed publicly about the allegations that Trump used military aid and a White House meeting as leverage to force investigations of his domestic political rivals.
Trump's maximalist defense, however, was undermined this week with such senators as Alexander and Rob Portman (R-Ohio) arguing that Trump's behavior was in fact wrong, though not impeachable. 
Republicans have anticipated, and Democrats have braced for, a Trump victory tour of sorts "" one that, depending on how quickly the Senate can move to a verdict, could begin with Tuesday's State of the Union address. 
The 'permanent asterisk' rhetoric this week has paved the road for the Democratic pushback for months, if not decades to come, by throwing doubt on the verdict.
'We know better,' Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said of any claims of vindication. 'He's going to talk about the end of the 'witch hunt' and so forth, but I think the fact that the Republicans are so afraid of a trial and so afraid of the truth speaks for itself.'
Said Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), 'You cannot have a true acquittal if you've not had a fair trial.'
'No witnesses means no exoneration,' Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) tweeted Friday.
Democrats say their incessant public campaign for 'witness and documents' "" one that began with Pelosi's surprise decision to hold out on naming managers and formally sending the articles to the Senate "" will ultimately pay political dividends as Americans turn away from the impeachment saga and toward the presidential race.
 'The way in which Republicans have conducted this will allow Democrats for the next 10 months to draw issue with Trump's acquittal which we wouldn't have been able to do if we had come to an agreement on rules and we had had witnesses and we had had deliberations,' said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). 'We now have legitimate reason to contest the fairness of the trial and the acquittal of the president, and I think that's impactful.'

President Trump has sought to demonstrate strong and decisive leadership in the targeted killing of Iran's top general, but he has overseen a chaotic and mistake-prone public response since the operation "" raising questions over the administration's preparation to anticipate and deal with the consequences.
In the days after a U.S. military drone killed Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani near the Baghdad airport, Trump and his top advisers have refused to provide details of what prompted the decision to strike and offered conflicting accounts over whether Soleimani was coordinating imminent attacks on U.S. facilities in the Middle East.
The lack of clear information continued late Tuesday in Washington, after Iran said it retaliated for Soleimani's death with missile attacks on military bases in Iraq. The White House announced Trump would make no public remarks in response Tuesday night, nor would any other senior administration officials. Hours later, Trump tweeted that he would address the nation Wednesday morning. 'All is well!' he declared.
'Assessment of casualties - damages taking place now,' Trump said. 'So far, so good! We have the most powerful and well equipped military anywhere in the world, by far!'

Previously, Trump had caused an international uproar after threatening to attack dozens of Iranian cultural sites "" only to retreat Tuesday following statements from his defense secretary and other officials dismissing such actions as illegal.
The Trump administration also was embarrassed after the Pentagon sent a letter to Iraqi officials this week stating the military would comply with the prime minister's demand to pull U.S. troops out of the country, only to call it a draft copy released by mistake.
And Trump surprised his own aides by publicly threatening to enact sanctions on Iraq if U.S. troops are forced out of the country, while suggesting privately that he would consider reducing foreign aid to Baghdad, senior officials said. Vice President Pence is preparing a speech slated for next week on Iran policy, one official said, in an attempt to provide a more cohesive explanation of the president's strategy.
The flurry of events has led to a sense of confusion in the White House and a lack of clarity around a highly sensitive operation that the administrations of his two predecessors, Barack Obama and George W. Bush, had chosen not to take due to risks that it could spark a regional war.
Allies, including Israel and several European powers, expressed discomfort with the military strike, with some objecting outright and complaining they were not consulted. Democrats on Capitol Hill cried foul over a lack of information from the administration, which began briefing key senators Tuesday.
The upshot was that a president who has taken pride in rejecting collaboration and institutional processes in favor of unilateral action and impulsiveness is facing his most severe test of that approach at a crucial moment "" amid a growing national security crisis in an election year.
'A decision looks decisive and bold or impulsive and reckless often in retrospect based on the effects,' said Richard Fontaine, chief executive of the Center for a New American Security, who served as a foreign policy adviser to the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.). 'But if the administration did game out all of the potential consequences of this action, it's not offering a huge amount of evidence publicly of what the fruits of that analysis were.'
Inside the White House, two administration officials conceded that some of Trump's messages over the weekend were unhelpful. The aides pointed to Trump's threat, first issued on Twitter, that the United States military would target 52 Iranian sites, including cultural ones, if Tehran retaliated for Soleimani's death.
Pentagon officials had not analyzed potential cultural site targets before the president's tweet, said one senior administration official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the geopolitical sensitivities.
Although administration aides, including Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, appeared to rule out such a move, suggesting it would violate international laws, the president initially reiterated his intent "" before moderating his message during remarks in the Oval Office on Tuesday afternoon.
'We are, according to various laws, supposed to be very careful with their cultural heritage,' Trump told reporters during a bilateral meeting with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. 'And you know what, if that's what the law is, I like to obey the law. But think of it: They kill our people, they blow up our people, and then we have to be very gentle with their cultural institutions. But I'm okay with it.'
Before Iran's apparent retaliation, Trump argued to aides that the attack on Soleimani would be politically popular and that Iran would not 'do anything too stupid,' in the words of one senior administration official who had spoken to the president. Republican lawmakers have mostly expressed support for the U.S. military operation and offered few signals they would seek to rein in Trump's ability to confront Iran.
But the president's critics pounced, with Democrats citing the messaging confusion as evidence that Trump had not developed a coordinated strategy ahead of time to deal with the fallout of the Soleimani strike. Coordination between Washington and Baghdad in the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria has been suspended, raising additional risks to U.S. national security interests, experts said.
'For three years now, everyday Americans, members of this body, our diplomatic corps and our allies and adversaries alike have wondered whether there's any sort of coherent strategy guiding the national security and foreign policy of President Donald Trump,' Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said Tuesday. 'If the events of recent days are any indication, the answer is a resounding 'no.' '
Trump's allies acknowledged the risks while defending the unique approach of a president who won office by bucking Washington's long-established protocols and the establishment orthodoxy of both major political parties.
'The common wisdom on Trump is that he's incompetent,' said Dan Eberhart, a GOP donor. 'Iran is his opportunity to disprove that. If Iran doesn't become a disaster, and the economy is good, Trump is untouchable in November. Trump has in effect bet his presidency on being able to contain an unstable Iran.'
Trump's surprising decision to authorize the covert drone operation came after an attack from an Iranian-backed militia in Iraq killed an American contractor in that country. Mounting hostilities, including a U.S. military strike on the militia's facilities, culminated with the militia, said to be under the direction of Soleimani, breaching the security around the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
Initially, Trump and his aides said the operation to kill Soleimani was justified because U.S. intelligence had learned of imminent attacks on U.S. facilities in the region that were being coordinated by the general.
But since then, administration officials have given varying accounts. Asked to provide more evidence of that intelligence Tuesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cited the militia attacks ahead of Soleimani's death.
A few hours later, Esper reiterated that there were new attacks being planned and pledged to brief lawmakers on the classified information.
The confusion could in part be viewed as a consequence of Trump's decisions, over his first three years in office, to downgrade the role of his White House press secretary "" there has been no formal briefing in more than 300 days "" and of the National Security Council. Former U.S. officials have said that Trump's NSC lacks the kind of rigorous vetting process that helped produce options for past presidents and helped them carry out their orders.
'People who have been in government or watched from outside have worried for a long time if, when a crisis develops, this administration will not be up to the challenge because they do not have the people or the processes in place,' said Jon Wolfsthal, who served as an arms control and nonproliferation expert on the NSC during Obama's administration. 'The decision to target Soleimani and deal with the aftermath is a terrific demonstration of that. The inability to coordinate messaging and communicate to congressional leadership and to allies effectively is a case study.'

The headline drew little notice when it appeared last spring on a blog called 'Disobedient Media.'
'John Bolton Took Money From Banks Tied To Cartels, Terrorists, Iran,' it read. 
On Monday, the blog entry gained sudden popularity. That's because its central claim "" based only on innuendo and half-truths "" proved useful to President Trump's most fervent online supporters, who rushed to discredit the former United Nations ambassador and national security adviser as news broke that his forthcoming book would corroborate accounts that the president held up aid to Ukraine to advance investigations into his domestic political rivals. 
The story quickly gained more than 5,000 interactions on Facebook "" meaning shares, likes or other user actions "" as it spread across pages and groups devoted to defending Trump. Soon, it became a building block of a campaign to discredit Bolton by impugning his motives and portraying him as a turncoat.
The attacks, which unfolded vividly in the 24 hours after it became clear Bolton had potentially damaging information to share, crescendoed on conservative podcasts and cable television, as individual catchphrases "" such as 'Book Deal Bolton' "" gained currency across the far-right firmament. By Tuesday, they offered a case study in how the pro-Trump Internet targets a perceived enemy, even an archconservative and war hawk.
The vilification of Bolton "" branding him as a traitor and member of the 'deep state,' a reference to a conspiracy theory favored by the president that a shadow government is working to thwart him "" made use of misleading text as well as eye-catching memes. It moved from anonymous Twitter accounts with a few dozen followers to prime-time hosts on Fox News with an audience of hundreds of thousands. Finally, it made its way to Capitol Hill, when Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Tuesday described the eyewitness to activity at the heart of the president's impeachment trial as a 'disgruntled, fired employee who now has a motive, a multimillion-dollar motive, to inflame the situation.'
Trump himself echoed some of the attacks Monday when he-retweeted a post from Lou Dobbs of the Fox Business Network calling Bolton a 'Rejected Neocon' and the 'Deep State's Last Desperate Act.'
That move, experts say, showcased how personal insults driven by online conspiracy theories "" which Trump harnessed on his path to the presidency "" remain fundamental to his hold on his base.
'It only makes sense to keep dancing with the ones who brought you to the prom,' said Joseph Uscinski, a political scientist at the University of Miami and co-author of 'American Conspiracy Theories.' The attacks are successful, he said, because Trump elevates them, 'hitting back fairly strongly with a smear-that pushes back on the allegation without really addressing it.'
The path traveled by the 'Disobedient Media' entry also illustrated how random nooks and crannies of the Internet can wind up being useful for political propaganda. The blog is written by William Craddick, who has a law degree from Pepperdine University and works in consumer advocacy in Los Angeles. The name of his blog, he said, was based on a 'joke with friends, capturing the sentiment of going against the grain.' 
The sensational headline mischaracterized the evidence presented in the post, which drew on a Washington Post story about how Bolton had earned speaking fees from Deutsche Bank, the British bank HSBC and a foundation operated by a Ukrainian steel magnate. All nuance was lost, however, when the blog post gained sudden traction on Monday, posted to about two dozen Facebook groups "" with a collective membership of more than 300,000. One of them was a group called 'Fox News Sean Hannity,' described as a forum for 'all Sean Hannity fans.' The blog post primed Fox viewers in the group "" which has no official links to the network or the popular Trump-friendly host "" for what they would hear when they tuned in that night. 
Craddick bluntly assessed the motivations behind the renewed interest in his post, but he had little sympathy for Bolton's boosters, either. 
'Now the Republicans don't like Bolton, so they'll take an article that makes him look bad and push it,' he said. 'But if the Democrats weren't getting something useful out of him, they wouldn't be fans either.'
Efforts to portray Bolton as craven and self-interested got underway simultaneously, seeking to raise doubts about the timing of the revelations, which emerged on the same day that his book became available for preorder on Amazon. A blogger drew up a meme pairing an image of the former national security adviser with the text, 'Turned his 'drug deal' into a book deal' "" a reference to Bolton's description of the shadow foreign policy pursued in Ukraine, according to the testimony of Fiona Hill, a former top White House adviser on Russia. 
The blogger, Craig Weide, who didn't respond to a request for comment, posted the meme to the Facebook page associated with his blog, which has about 16,000 followers, as well as to a handful of public groups, reaching a combined potential viewership of more than 74,000 within about five minutes on Sunday night. One was a group called 'FOX NEWS with Tucker Carlson,' an online assembly for fans of the Fox host, though it also has no formal ties to the network. 
The idea captured in the meme was also articulated in a memo from the Republican National Committee's rapid response team. 'How convenient that this leaked info happened to be released at the same time preorders were made available for the book on Amazon,' wrote Steve Guest, the RNC's rapid-response director. 'What a joke.' 
Jason Miller, a spokesman for Trump's 2016 campaign and co-host of Stephen K. Bannon's 'War Room: Impeachment' podcast, took to Twitter first thing Monday morning to brand the former national security adviser 'Book Deal Bolton.' The nickname spread widely on social media during the day, amplified by pro-Trump influencers with tens of thousands of followers.
A joint statement from Bolton, along with his publisher and literary agency, denied any coordination with the media. 
Conservative pundits were unconvinced, repackaging Twitter talking points for their prime-time audiences. The epithet 'Book Deal Bolton' appeared on screen Monday night on Fox News behind Hannity. 
'Good for John,' Hannity said. 'He can sell all the books he wants.'
But few went further than Dobbs, the hard-line Fox Business host and Trump whisperer who announced Monday night that Bolton had been 'reduced to a tool for the radical Dems and the deep state.'
The accusation of being a 'tool for the radical Dems' has been leveled widely on social media in recent months, applied to individuals as disparate as Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, and Univision's Jorge Ramos. What they have in common is rebutting the president's claims.
Using the same guilt-by-association logic supporting the blog entry in 'Disobedient Media,' Dobbs claimed that major donors to Bolton's super PAC were 'never Trumpers.'
'Do you see the pattern here with Mr. Bolton?' Dobbs said, not stating the pattern but relying on his viewers to put together the pieces of the conspiratorial puzzle.
The notion that Bolton, a longtime bugbear of Democrats who has worked in four Republican administrations, was operating furtively within the White House to advance liberal objectives bemused some who have dealt with him. 'I think it's ridiculous, and if it wasn't so serious, it'd be humorous,' said Chuck Hagel, the former defense secretary and Republican senator from Nebraska. 
'It shows you once again that there's very little honesty, decency or civility in Trump and the crowd around him,' added Hagel, who was on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when Bolton's nomination as U.N. ambassador foundered, leading to a recess appointment by President George W. Bush. 'I had my differences with him, but I would say that John Bolton is anything but 'deep state.'-'
Bolton's lawyer, Charles Cooper, didn't respond to a request for comment. Of the effort to cast Bolton as a disgruntled government holdover, a former aide, Fred Fleitz, said, 'He is an honorable man who had some significant achievements with President Trump in the National Security Council.' Fleitz on Monday published an op-ed urging the former White House official to postpone publication of his book until after the election. But he distanced himself from the more strident criticism, saying in an interview, 'I've never called John Bolton part of the deep state.' 
While lacking in evidence, the assertions made by Dobbs rested on a reliable scaffold of misleading claims bolted into place on Twitter over the course of the day. 
An account that goes by the name Philip Schuyler "" a Revolutionary-era general who went on to become a senator from New York "" and describes itself simply as a 'Supporter of President Trump' pointed implausibly to the 'deep state.' 

'Though a Republican, Bolton would've fit nicely into Obama's ultra conceited deep state,' the user
wrote
Monday morning. By noon, the conservative columnist Todd Starnes, a former Fox News Radio host,
was claiming
without evidence or explanation that, 'These Bolton allegations smell like Deep State swamp gas.'

SCATHING ATTACKS FROM TRUMP, ALLIES
Democrats cool to idea of 'witness swap' deal
House Democrats charged with prosecuting the impeachment case against President Trump on Wednesday scaled back their fiery language following a rare scolding from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., as they began laying out their case for Trump's removal from office for pressuring Ukraine to help him win reelection.
But as Democrats softened their tone if not their message, Trump and his fellow Republicans dialed up their partisan rhetoric, with GOP senators largely ignoring Roberts's admonition and leveling scathing attacks against the trial's prosecutors.
 Democrats also appeared to shut down talk of a deal to secure testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton by offering to trade testimony from the son of former vice president Joe Biden, who was the focus of Trump's alleged pressure campaign on Ukraine. Biden said he would refuse such an arrangement.
The Republican barrage was led by Trump himself, who in Davos, Switzerland, called the top House managers 'sleazebags' while denouncing his impeachment as a 'hoax' and 'disgrace' to his presidency. 
'I watched the lies from Adam Schiff. He'll stand, he'll look at a microphone, and he'll talk like he's so aggrieved,' Trump said at a news conference from the World Economic Forum in Davos, referring to the House Intelligence Committee chairman leading the prosecution. 
On Schiff and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold L. Nadler (D-N.Y.), another impeachment manager and longtime Trump foe, the president added: 'These two guys "" these are major sleazebags. They're very dishonest people. Very, very dishonest people.' 
As he flew back to Washington on Air Force One, Trump stirred up a veritable Twitter storm as he tweeted and retweeted messages primarily about impeachment, particularly from his Republican defenders "" a barrage that marked the most tweets of any day of his presidency, with 142 as of 10 p.m., according to Factba.se, a website that tracks Trump's tweets and speeches.
That posturing provided a sharp contrast to the Democratic House managers, who struck a chastened tone in the Senate chamber Wednesday after the Roberts admonishment issued in the early hours of Wednesday. Saying that the Democrats had 'adrenaline going through our veins,' Schiff began opening arguments Wednesday afternoon by expressing gratitude for the senators' attentiveness. 
And Nadler, whose accusations that GOP senators were engaging in 'treacherous' behavior angered Republicans, made sure to thank Roberts and the lawmakers for 'your temperate listening and your patience last night as we went into the long hours.' 
'I think that was an attempt to shift the tone,' said Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.). 'A lot of senators were offended last night at saying that a vote against their amendments was treachery, that it was a vote against the United States.' 
But the politics of the trial Wednesday rippled not only in Europe and in Washington but also in Iowa, where 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Biden was confronted with questions about whether he would be willing to testify in the proceedings. 
The former vice president "" who, along with his son Hunter, has been the target of political investigations that Trump had asked of Ukraine "" dismissed the idea that Democrats were even talking about a witness exchange involving Hunter and insisted he himself would not testify. 
'The reason I would not make the deal, the bottom line is, this is a constitutional issue,' Biden said in response to a voter's question in Osage, Iowa. 'We're not going to turn it into a farce or political theater. I want no part of that.'
Some Senate Democrats had started grappling with the prospect that they might have to greenlight witnesses desired by Republicans to subpoena key Trump administration officials. Such a decision could be made if a majority of senators agree to call witnesses after listening to opening arguments and questioning the two sides. 
But Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters Wednesday that any deal with Republicans on a witness trade involving the Bidens is 'off the table.' His remarks echoed those of Schiff, the lead impeachment manager, who said 'trials aren't trades for witnesses.'
Schiff laid out high expectations for senators as the trial got underway, calling on them to 'decide what kind of democracy that you believe we ought to be' and what Americans can expect 'in the conduct of their president.'
As he continued his remarks, Schiff called Trump 'the key player in the scheme' to pressure Ukraine for investigations that could benefit him politically in exchange for a White House meeting and the release of nearly $400-million of military aid. Both coveted items were of a 'great consequence to Ukraine,' Schiff said, particularly the funding meant to help the small Eastern European nation guard itself from Russia. 
'Everyone was in the loop,' Schiff said. '[Trump] directed the actions of his team. He personally asked a foreign government to investigate his opponent. These facts are not in dispute.'
Trump, who had wanted Ukraine to investigate the Bidens as well as a discredited theory that Ukraine worked with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 election, insists he has done nothing wrong and that a rough transcript of a July 25 call with Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, exonerates him of any wrongdoing. 
But if the Senate does not hold Trump accountable, Schiff warned, 'the damage to our democratic elections, to our national security, to our system of checks and balances will be long-lasting and potentially irreversible.' 
Even on the first day of opening arguments, the seats of many Republican senators and a handful of Democrats were empty as Schiff wrapped up his remarks. Some members were standing against the back wall to stretch their legs, but others stayed out of the chamber for an extended period, even though the rules call for senators, like jurors at any trial, to be in their seats the entire time.
During breaks outside the Senate chamber, Republicans dismissed the proceedings and said they were learning nothing new as they kept up their attacks on the House managers, particularly Nadler. 
When asked whether Trump's attorneys had also deserved their admonishment by Roberts, Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) responded, 'No,' saying Nadler 'is embarrassing.' 
'And it's outrageous,' Cornyn added. 'At some point, you got to call it what it is.'
The heated rhetoric from some Democrats on Tuesday risked turning off a small slate of influential GOP senators in the center of the procedural fight over witnesses and documents. 
'Well, I took it as very offensive,' Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said of Nadler's performance. 'As one who is listening attentively and working hard to get to a fair process, I was offended.' 
At a news conference in Davos, Trump said he 'can live either way' with the Senate's decision about whether to call witnesses at his impeachment trial, but he argued that testimony by former national security adviser John Bolton could pose national security and other concerns, including that Bolton left the administration on bad terms.
'You don't like people testifying when they didn't leave on good terms,' Trump said. 
Democrats seized on another portion of Trump's news conference, when he praised his legal team and added: 'Honestly, we have all the material. They don't have the material.'
Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.), one of the House impeachment managers, said that comment provided more evidence of obstruction of Congress. But Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's lawyers, responded by defending the president's executive privilege rights. 
 'This isn't nonsense,' Sekulow said. 'This is really what the Constitution is about.' 
Meanwhile, Trump said he would like to see an 'acquittal fairly quickly' during a Fox Business Network interview in which he also called the Democrats pressing the case against him 'totally nuts.'
But the White House set aside one avenue to end the proceedings quickly, at least for now, deciding against filing a motion Wednesday to dismiss the charges.
That does not preclude Trump's lawyers from filing such a motion later, but Senate Republican leaders have warned that such a move would not have majority support from senators until fuller trial proceedings take place.

WATERVILLE, Maine "" When Sen. Susan Collins declared late last week her support for calling witnesses to Capitol Hill, she became the first Republican member of Congress to formally break with the president on any aspect of his impeachment. 
Here in Maine, where the famously independent Collins is locked in a tight reelection campaign, the choice elicited a wintry mix of cold shoulders and icy glares. 
Republicans quietly counseled that Collins could go no further without inciting a rebellion from the party's Trump-loving base "" perhaps even a primary challenge. Democrats, meanwhile, heaped scorn on the senator for making gestures toward standing up to the president but not doing so when it counts. 
'She's like Lucy with the football and we're Charlie Brown,' said Pam Cunningham, a 55-year-old Democrat who said she voted for Collins in 2014 but intends to knock on doors to defeat her this time. 'How many times are we going to fall for the routine?'
In an era of rigorously enforced partisanship, the defiance from the senior senator from Maine stood out. And the chilly response illustrated why deviation from the party-proscribed path is so rare: The political rewards are few, while the costs are potentially career-ending. 
That dynamic has been a defining element of President Trump's impeachment process, which is almost certain to end with an acquittal Wednesday "" and with Collins rejoining the GOP fold.
Unlike Richard Nixon, who resigned before he could be impeached, or Bill Clinton, who was acquitted in the Senate, President Trump has experienced no significant swings in public opinion since the allegations for which he was impeached first surfaced. 
Views of whether Trump should be removed from office have barely budged since October, with nearly all Democrats in favor, Republicans virtually unanimous in opposition, and independents split. Rather than persuade members of one camp or the other to switch sides, new facts and arguments have only seemed to harden the divide.
The chasm in the country has been reflected in Congress, where waverers have retreated to the safety of their political homes. Defectors have been few. As politics has more closely resembled trench warfare, the middle has become an awkward "" even untenable "" place to linger.
Perhaps no senator has had trickier terrain to navigate than Collins, the last member of Congress representing what was once a prodigious political brand: the New England Republican. 
'She's very much an endangered species,' said Roger Katz, a Republican former member of the Maine state Senate who counts himself as a fellow moderate. 'She's always been rewarded for that center-of-the-road path she's taken. But politics has become so divisive, so tribal. That wonderful quality she has is becoming a liability.'

Whether it's enough to cost her reelection could determine whether Republican centrists go from endangered to extinct.
Collins, 67, has played a part in all three impeachments of modern times. 
As a Capitol Hill intern, she worked for William Cohen in the summer of 1974 while the then-congressman helped lead the Republican revolt against Nixon that would end his presidency.
As a freshman senator in Cohen's former seat in 1999, Collins spurned her party's leadership and voted to acquit Clinton. 
This time around, defiance on the ultimate call of whether the president should be removed is considered highly unlikely. Republicans here tolerated her support for witnesses "" a blow softened by the fact that only one other GOP senator joined her, and the motion was defeated. 
But siding with Democrats on whether the president should be removed would be unforgivable among Maine's rank-and-file Republicans, who are increasingly part of the Trump wing of the party, not the Collins wing.
'If she votes to convict,' said Katz, a Collins supporter, 'she's going to enrage the Republican base in Maine.' 
The base is already restless. In recent weeks, Collins's offices have been flooded with angry voice mails, many of them threatening and hate-filled. The vitriol has come from impeachment supporters as well as the president's defenders, outspoken in demanding that Collins take their side. 
The sound and fury around impeachment is in many respects a replay of the fall of 2018, when Collins played a pivotal role in the fight over whether Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh should be confirmed. 
Amid accusations that he had committed sexual assault at a high school party, Kavanaugh's nomination was in doubt until the very end. Collins's support, announced in a dramatic speech from the Senate floor, proved decisive.
Little has been the same for Collins in Maine since then. Through her four Senate terms, Collins had nurtured a reputation as a bipartisan problem-solver, one who enjoyed support from Republicans, Democrats and independents. The across-the-board backing gave her sky-high popularity and allowed her to coast to reelection in 2014. 
But her choice on Kavanaugh delivered Democrats a resonant symbol to argue that Collins had become just another Republican partisan in the age of Trump. 
Polls have shown her approval ratings fast eroding. Progressive groups that had once endorsed her "" including abortion rights and environmental organizations "" have withdrawn their support. A formidable opponent, state House Speaker Sara Gideon, looms in November. 
'Wherever I go in Maine, people come up to me and ask, 'What do you think happened to Susan Collins?' ' Gideon, 48, said in an interview. 'I can never answer.'
Cunningham is among the disenchanted. The Democrat voted for Collins in 2014 because 'I thought she was someone who could cross party lines and get things done. I believed the story line.'
Cunningham, a vacation rental manager, had never been particularly interested in politics. But Trump's election galvanized her to get involved. She hoped that Collins "" who declined to endorse Trump in 2016 "" would be a check on the new president's power. 
But she was disappointed to find that Collins sided with the president on key early votes, including his tax plan and his judicial nominees. Just before Collins's Kavanaugh vote, Cunningham and three other sexual assault survivors met with the senator to share their stories. 
'We thought that as a woman, she would understand that she couldn't vote to confirm him,' Cunningham said.

Instead, Collins told the group that she believed Kavanaugh's accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, might have been mistaken about who had assaulted her "" an argument she repeated on the Senate floor. 
'We were stunned,' said Cunningham, who is now co-director of a group that organizes protests against Collins. 'She wasn't the person I thought she was.' 
Collins's Maine allies insist she is exactly who she claims to be: the rare politician who will deeply study the facts and make a choice based on principle. 
During the impeachment trial, as colleagues dozed or thumbed through books, Collins filled thick legal pads with notes. After hours, she studied transcripts and reports. Her questions to the president's lawyers were challenging, probing whether Trump had ever pressed Ukraine on Hunter Biden before his father, former vice president Joe Biden, started vying for Trump's job.
'She's one of the few people who seems to have taken her role as a juror seriously,' said Mike Thibodeau, a Republican former president of the Maine state Senate. 'Democrats had made up their minds. Republicans did the same. But she's doing her homework, trying to understand.'
That's typical of Collins, who is renowned for her work ethic and her attention to detail. It also reflects, Thibodeau said, her dedication to civility even as others attempt to score political points. 
'There are a lot of people in Washington running around with gasoline, ready to throw it on the fire,' said Thibodeau, who described himself as far more conservative than Collins but an unabashed fan of her style. 'Susan Collins is not one of them.'
Collins is part of a long tradition of centrist, consensus-building Maine Republicans, including Margaret Chase Smith, Cohen and Olympia Snowe. But that line appears to be dying out: Maine's last Republican governor, Paul LePage, is regarded as a Trump forerunner for his bombastic style and offensive manner.
'The Republican Party in Maine isn't what it used to be,' said Mark Brewer, a University of Maine political scientist. 'It's not that Collins has changed. The political environment has changed around her.' 
While the right pressures her to stay in line, Collins knows she needs to continue to win over the independents and Democrats who have helped elect her in the past. 
The Collins campaign ads that are already playing around the clock on televisions across Maine, nine months before the vote, tout her independence. The data bear out the boast: The Lugar Center has named her the nation's most bipartisan senator for six years running, a stretch that included Collins's 2017 votes that helped scuttle Republican attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
Yet Gideon, who is also flooding the airwaves with ads, charged that Collins is highly selective about when she steps out of line. 
Impeachment is a prime example: Collins, she said, was 'given a hall pass' on the witness vote by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) once he knew he had the votes to override her objections. But on the ultimate question of conviction, it's unlikely the senator will break ranks.
'Every time there is a vote of consequence, she is voting with McConnell and her party,' Gideon said.
Whether voters agree, and whether it matters in November, remains to be seen. Most analysts regard the race as a toss-up "" a position that would have been 'unthinkable' for Collins just a few years back, Brewer said.
Interviews in Waterville, a hardscrabble former mill city on the Kennebec River, suggest that at least some of the goodwill that Collins built in Maine over decades still endures. 
Dana Sennett, a Democrat and former mayor, said he will vote for her. 
'She's getting slammed by both sides,' Sennett said. 'But it's very important to have people like that in Washington.'
Al Thiebault, a 69-year-old minister and Republican, said he will vote for Collins, too. He didn't like her vote for witnesses, considering the idea 'a waste of time.' And he thinks she occasionally gets too close to the 'progressives and the socialists.' But that's okay.
'I appreciate her independent thinking,' he said. 'I'm not going to agree with anyone all the time.'

DES MOINES "" In a packed arena here last week, President Trump focused on home-state issues, mentioning farmers 47 times, touting recent trade deals and taking credit for Iowa's low unemployment rate. 
Trump won Iowa decisively in 2016, and while Democrats made gains two years later, the party's presidential candidates "" after hundreds of rallies, town halls and parties over the past year "" now face a decision: whether to bother coming back.
'I worked so hard for this state. I worked so hard,' Trump said as he opened his rally. He added: 'We're going to win the great state of Iowa, and it's going to be a historic landslide. If we don't win, your farms are going to hell.' 
Iowa has long been competitive, but Trump's nine-point victory and the state's demographic makeup place it at the heart of a central question facing Democrats: Can they win back rural, white and industrial voters, or is the party's future elsewhere?
'How did Donald Trump win your state "" a purple swing state "" by almost 10 points?' Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang said at a Des Moines rally Saturday. 'Why is it that this state has gone from blue or purple to red over the last number of years? That's a fundamental question, and the Democrats have not been addressing it.' 
Some Democrats insist that Trump is vulnerable in Iowa, highlighting his flagging approval numbers and the 2018 midterm elections, when Democratic candidates performed well in areas that Trump had previously won.
Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg in particular has argued that he can capital ize on those areas. Iowa is home to more counties that flipped from Obama to Trump than any other state, and Buttigieg has boasted of touring 25 of those 31 counties.
'The president is going to be in big trouble here,' said Matt Sinovic, executive director of the liberal group Progress Iowa. 'His approval numbers are down, and every other underlying factor is what points to that.'
But it's no accident that Trump chose to hold a rally in Iowa "" before a capacity crowd at Drake University's Knapp Center "" just days before the Democrats in this state began the process of choosing his opponent. Trump's strength in rural counties propelled his victory in Iowa, which saw the largest swing away from Democrats among the six states that flipped from President Barack Obama to Trump between 2012 and 2016. 

Some Democrats' complaints about Iowa's first-in-the-nation role reflect a broader concern that its demographic profile is out of step with an increasingly diverse Democratic Party that performs best in areas with a larger share of minority voters. More than 90-percent of the population in Iowa is white.
Jim Messina, who served as Obama's 2012 campaign manager, said Trump and Republicans were 'heavy favorites to win in the general election' in Iowa.
While Democrats' chances in Iowa ultimately depend on which candidate they nominate, Messina said, the election is likely to be won or lost in other states. Iowa, he said, is 'clearly below the mid-tier of Midwestern states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.'
Iowa's recent drift is epitomized by Sen. Joni Ernst, a conservative Republican who won her seat after the 2014 retirement of Sen. Tom Harkin (D), a longtime liberal icon. Ernst caught fire that year with an ad declaring: 'I grew up castrating hogs on an Iowa farm, so when I get to Washington, I'll know how to cut pork.'
But amid a Democratic surge in 2018, Democrats retook two of Iowa's four U.S. House seats, flipping a 3-to-1 GOP edge to a 3-to-1-Democratic advantage. But both senators and the governor are Republican, and it's not clear if 2018 is a blip or a long-term trend.
For now, Trump's approval rating is underwater in Iowa, with 53-percent of voters disapproving of his performance and 44 percent approving, according to a poll released in December by Morning Consult. A January poll released by the Des Moines Register in coordination with CNN and Mediacom found that only 34 percent of Iowans said they would 'definitely' vote to reelect Trump.
Democrats say issues such as Trump's efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act have badly damaged his standing in the state. At his rally, Trump spent little time on health care, instead arguing that he has helped drive down the state's unemployment rate, which has been below 3 percent since October 2017, and touting his trade deals.
He also cited a New York Times-Siena College poll that showed him beating his Democratic presidential rivals, whom he characterized as radical left-wingers. 'They have me pitted against every one of the socialists, and we're winning by a lot,' Trump said, exaggerating the narrow lead he holds against most Democrats in the poll, some of which fall within the margin of error.
Trump took particular aim at Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who describes himself as a democratic socialist. 'Under three years of my administration, net farm income has already gone up nearly 50 percent and will now be rising even faster,' Trump told the crowd. 'What are you going to do? You are going to vote for Bernie? You are going to vote for Bernie?'
Still, Trump's trade war has clearly had a residual effect on the state's farmers. Ernst, speaking on CNN's 'State of the Union' on Sunday, said that while farmers were experiencing 'hurt' during the trade war, they continue to support Trump.
'What I heard from one farmer, she said, 'You know what? I'm tightening my belt. Things are tougher right now, but I know in the long run this is going to be better for my grandchildren,' ' Ernst said. 
And Trump's support among the state's Republicans has remained strong. According to a Des Moines Register-CNN-Mediacom poll released in November, 85 percent of Republicans approve of Trump's job performance. The president's campaign dispatched more than 80 surrogates to Iowa ahead of the caucuses as a show of force aimed at shoring up that support. 
State Sen. Tom Greene (R), one of those surrogates, predicted that the president will win easily in November. Trump 'carried the 93-of 99 countries in Iowa and carried the state by 190,000 votes in 2016,' he said. 'I expect similar results in 2020.'
Kayleigh McEnany, a spokeswoman for Trump's campaign, said the surrogates would be speaking at the Republican caucuses, where Trump does not face serious competition, to get ready for the effort in November. 
'This is an opportunity to work out those ground-game muscles and make sure we have our ducks in a row,' she said. 'We're not ever going to take a state for granted.'
Aside from Florida and Ohio, Iowa is the only state that has flipped between parties three times since 2000. After going for Republican George W. Bush in 2004, it voted twice for Obama before turning to Trump.
In 2016, Trump visited Iowa seven times in the final three months of the election compared with three for Democrat Hillary Clinton, an investment that appeared to pay off.
Sinovic said this time would be different now that voters have seen how Trump handles bread-and-butter issues such as health care.
'Americans and Iowans are furious about them trying to take away our health care,' Sinovic said. 'That has been the number one issue when it comes to these national elections these last couple years, and it's going to continue to be.'

RNC paying for two of Trump's attorneys, in contrast with Clinton 

As President Trump faces mounting legal bills from his impeachment trial, he is drawing on national party coffers flush with donations from energized supporters "" unlike the last president to be impeached, who left the White House 'dead broke.'
The Republican National Committee is picking up the tab for at least two of Trump's private attorneys in the ongoing trial, an arrangement that differs from the legal fund President Bill Clinton set up, only to see it fail to raise enough to cover his millions of dollars in bills before he left office.
The law firms of Trump's lead lawyer, Jay Sekulow, and attorney Jane Raskin have received $225,000 from the RNC through November, according to the most recent campaign finance reports. The party will pay the duo for their work this month and probably into February as the trial continues, according to people familiar with the arrangement who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal financing.
The president's legal team also includes celebrity lawyer Alan Dershowitz, former independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr and former Florida attorney general turned lobbyist Pam Bondi "" all of whom have raised their profiles and earnings potential with frequent media appearances defending Trump. 
Because Trump is on trial as a result of his status as an officeholder or candidate, election law allows him to dip into campaign or party funds for his legal bills.
'We are more than happy to cover some of the costs of defending the president from this partisan impeachment sham,' said Mike Reed, RNC deputy chief of staff for communications. 
The president is benefiting from a measure in a 2014 law that dramatically increased how much national parties can raise by allowing them to collect large donations for separate accounts to finance presidential conventions, building renovations and legal proceedings. Trump Victory, a joint fundraising committee of the Trump campaign and the RNC, transferred about $2.7 million into the RNC's legal account from September through November, as the impeachment inquiry escalated, according to campaign filings.
Donors to the RNC and Trump's reelection campaign have already covered millions of dollars in attorney fees stemming from the president's other legal travails: former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, court battles over the president's tax returns, and a now-withdrawn defamation lawsuit filed by a former campaign staffer. 
The House investigation, December impeachment vote and Senate trial, Reed said, have been a boon to fundraising efforts. Reed said there have been more than 600,000 new donors since House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) formally announced the impeachment inquiry in late September.
'The Democrat impeachment charade is the gift that keeps on giving for our side,' Reed said.
Dershowitz, whose clients have included O.J. Simpson and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, said he will not accept payment for his work. 
'For me, it's a matter of principle,' said Dershowitz, who argued Monday that the House charges of abuse of power and obstruction do not meet the constitutional standard of impeachment. 'If I am paid, it will go to charity. I will not keep any money I get from this case.'
Among the other private attorneys are Raskin, a Florida-based lawyer who since 2018 has worked for Trump navigating Mueller's probe; Starr, whose investigation into Clinton formed the basis of his impeachment; Robert A. Ray, Starr's successor in the independent counsel's office; and Eric D. Herschmann from the law firm of Trump's longtime lawyer Marc Kasowitz.
Starr declined to talk about his legal fees or to comment for this story. Ray, Herschmann and Raskin did not return messages seeking comment. 
Those lawyers work in tandem with a set of attorneys from the Office of the White House Counsel, led by Pat Cipollone, who represents the president in his official capacity. 
Seated around a cramped, arc-shaped table in front of the president's jury of 100 senators, the government lawyers include Patrick F. Philbin, who worked with Cipollone at the law firm Kirkland - Ellis, and Michael M. Purpura, a former federal prosecutor and top Justice Department official. They receive taxpayer-paid, annual salaries between $168,000 and $183,000, according to an annual report of White House personnel. 
Bondi joined the White House staff late last year after lobbying for clients such as Qatar and General Motors. Bondi did not respond to requests for comment about her salary.
House Democrats, who serve as prosecutors at the trial, also have enlisted outside legal help. In a brief filed before the impeachment trial, they acknowledged assistance from 16 lawyers who work for the House, in addition to five attorneys led by David A. O'Neil with the firm Debevoise - Plimpton. Those lawyers are not charging the House for their work, according to a spokesperson for Pelosi. 
As Clinton faced impeachment in 1998, supporters established a trust fund to raise money to cover the Clintons' bills, which eventually exceeded $10 million because of the years-long Whitewater investigation into a real estate deal, the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit and the impeachment proceedings and trial.
'Fundraising would spike when anything significant happened in the investigation or trial,' said Richard M. Lucas, who was counsel to the Clinton Legal Expense Trust. 'Average Americans wanted to express their view about what was happening.'
Clinton's popularity surged after his acquittal by the Senate in early February 1999 and in quick order "" by late that month "" his legal defense fund had raised more than $4.5 million.
Most of the trust money flowed to two Washington law firms: Williams - Connolly and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher - Flom.
Yet even with the legal fund, Hillary Clinton said in a 2014 interview that the couple left the White House 'not only dead broke, but in debt' as she defended the millions of dollars she and the former president earned giving paid speeches and writing books. The former secretary of state later said she regretted the remark.
Unlike Clinton, who was in his second term during the impeachment trial, Lucas said Trump and the Republican Party have more leverage to solicit donations ahead of Trump's 2020 reelection bid. 
'The party has become an extension of the administration,' Lucas said. 
As Trump declared in one recent campaign fundraising email: 'The Senate Impeachment Trial is today and the only way we can win this war is if every patriot steps up and becomes a 2020 Sustaining Member . . . I want to raise TWO MILLION DOLLARS in the NEXT 24 HOURS and end this Impeachment Trial Scam once and for all.'
Trump's campaign committee is not directly paying impeachment-related legal bills, according to a campaign official, although the campaign does transfer money to the RNC from time to time.
The 2014 measure that lifted some limits on national party fundraising means that along with a $35,500 check to the RNC, a donor also can spread $319,500 between the additional accounts for conventions, headquarters and legal proceedings. 
The provision was crafted by leaders of both parties with the help of leading campaign finance attorneys, including Marc Elias, former general counsel of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign. That the well-known Democratic election lawyer had a hand in expanding the amount the RNC can raise for Trump's impeachment trial is not lost on some campaign finance reformers.
'It was horrible the way we blew up the limits on donations to national parties because it allows people to buy access and influence,' said Paul S. Ryan, a vice president at Common Cause, a government-watchdog group. 'Contrary to popular perception, the Democratic Party has long fought to loosen restrictions on money and politics, hand in hand with the Republicans. The public doesn't think that because Democrats on the stump talk about campaign finance reform.' 
Elias defended the creation of the legal proceedings account, saying the Democratic Party has used that money to fund lawsuits challenging what it sees as voter suppression tactics around the country. 
'So while Democrats are using the money to protect voting rights, Republicans are using the money to protect Trump from removal,' Elias said.
One donor who gave the maximum contribution to the RNC in recent months, thereby padding the account for legal proceedings, was New York billionaire John Catsimatidis.
'I want to defend the president,' Catsimatidis said of his donation. 'He did not do high crimes and misdemeanors.' 
In addition to the two sets of Trump lawyers in the Senate chamber this week, the president's written legal brief lists another five private attorneys who work for a nonprofit Christian legal organization run by Sekulow.
The group, the American Center for Law and Justice, employs and contracts with several of Sekulow's relatives and companies they control, The Washington Post has reported. The ACLJ raises tens of millions of dollars each year from supporters of its antiabortion advocacy.
Sekulow's private law firm, the Constitutional Litigation and Advocacy Group, has received $120,000 from the RNC so far for impeachment work, according to public records. The firm was also paid $6.1 million by the ACLJ in the year ending April 2019, according to a tax return filed to the IRS last fall. Sekulow owns 50 percent of the law firm. 
During a break in the trial last week, Sekulow was asked about his role and compensation.
'I wouldn't say paid adviser "" I'm the president's retained counsel,' Sekulow told reporters. 'So I don't discuss my legal fees, but we're paid for our legal skills.'

Faith in fair elections is eroding, says political scientist

When the polls closed on Nov. 5, 2019, the initial count showed the governor of Kentucky, Republican Matt Bevin, losing to his Democratic challenger, Andy Beshear. But rather than concede that he fell short in what should have been an easy reelection, Bevin claimed that 'irregularities' had muddled the result "" though he produced no evidence to support his accusations. At first, some Kentucky legislative leaders appeared to back him, and some pointed to the legislature's power to resolve an election dispute and choose the governor regardless of the vote. But Bevin was not popular even within his own party, and eventually, he had to concede when the local GOP did not go along with him. 
We could imagine a similar scenario this November: What would happen if President Trump had an early lead that evaporated as votes were counted, and then he refused to concede? The idea isn't too far-fetched; Trump has raised it himself. Before the 2016 election, he wouldn't agree to accept the results if he lost. After winning in the electoral college but losing the popular count by about 3 million votes, Trump claimed "" with no evidence whatsoever "" that at least 3 million fraudulent votes had been cast for his opponent, Hillary Clinton. He set up an 'election integrity' commission headed by then-Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach to try to prove that 'voter fraud' is a major problem. But after the commission faced attacks from the left and the right for demanding state voter records with an apparent plan to use them to call for stricter registration rules, Trump disbanded it, with no work accomplished. In 2018, the president criticized elections in Florida and California, where late-counted votes shifted toward Democrats, suggesting without evidence that there was foul play.
It's not just Trump who might not accept election results. Imagine that he wins in the electoral college, this time thanks to what Democrats believe is voter suppression in Florida. The Florida legislature and governor have already sought to stymie Amendment 4, a 2018 ballot initiative to restore voting rights to formerly incarcerated felons. When the state Supreme Court agreed that felons could not register to vote until paying all their outstanding fines, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) praised the ruling and called voting a 'privilege,' rather than a right. Some Democrats have called the new rules a 'poll tax,' and a Florida public TV station concluded that 'the implications of the bill passed by a majority-Republican legislature preventing former felons from voting could work to ensure Trump wins the 2020 presidential election.' During Trump's impeachment trial this past week, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said that 'we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won' in November because of the allegations that Trump was trying to 'cheat' by pressuring Ukraine to announce an investigation into Joe Biden and his family.
External forces could cause an election meltdown, too. A recent NPR-News Hour-Marist poll found that 'almost 4 in 10 Americans . . . believe it is likely another country will tamper with the votes cast in 2020 in order to change the result.' What if Russians hack into Detroit's power grid and knock out electricity on Election Day, seriously depressing turnout "" and Trump wins the electoral college because he carries Michigan? Most states do not have a Plan B to deal with a terrorist attack or natural disaster affecting part of a presidential election.
The vote this year is particularly vulnerable to a crisis of legitimacy because Americans' trust in elections is already low; that NPR poll found that only 62 percent of Americans think our elections are fair. A number of factors are contributing to this worrisome trend. 
Republicans have passed laws and procedures aimed at suppressing the votes of Democrats, based on unsupported claims of voter fraud. Under Kobach's watch, for example, Kansas passed a law requiring people registering to vote to produce proof of citizenship, such as a birth or naturalization certificate. About 30,000 people had their registrations suspended or canceled for failure to show their papers until a federal court put the program on hold. Kobach defended the law in court in 2018, citing a handful of cases of noncitizen voting as the 'tip of the iceberg' and claiming that the law would deter many more. But at trial in a suit brought by the ACLU, U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson concluded there was no iceberg, merely an 'icicle.' Kobach's presentation of evidence was so faulty and deceptive that he was sanctioned twice by the courts. 
Time and again, courts and scholars have debunked the myth of widespread voter fraud "" but such claims still lead Republicans to believe that Democrats are cheating, and they prompt GOP-backed laws that lead Democrats, in turn, to believe that Republicans are cheating.
Yes, a few election administrators are incompetent, and in very close races, when procedures are put under a microscope during recounts and challenges, attention is focused on these weak links. Think of Brenda Snipes, the Democratic former election supervisor in Broward County, Fla., who presided over a series of mishaps during her tenure. In 2004, her office failed to deliver 58,000 ballots to absentee voters who had requested them. In 2012, election workers discovered almost 1,000 uncounted absentee ballots in county offices a week after the vote. In 2016, Snipes's office left a voter initiative on medical marijuana completely off some ballots. In the recount in the 2018 Senate race between Sen. Bill Nelson (D) and Gov. Rick Scott (R), Snipes's office missed "" by two minutes "" a key deadline because county officials did not know how to submit the vote totals to the state online. This error came after a faulty ballot design apparently caused many Broward voters to skip voting in the Senate contest entirely.
Snipes is not alone. Then-Georgia Secretary of State (and now governor) Brian Kemp engaged in one of the most despicable moments in modern American politics in 2018, when he wrongly accused Democrats of hacking into state voter registration databases (and posted the charges on the front page of the official secretary of state website the weekend before the election) to cover up his own failure to secure voters' private data.
Incompetent administrators come from both parties, but election problems tend to get the most notice in big cities, where there are more voters and more media attention "" and more votes for Democrats. Big blunders sometimes lead to Republican charges of intentional vote tampering. It is no surprise that Trump called out Snipes during the 2018 recount, accusing her, again without evidence, of cheating to help fellow Democrats. 
Recent elections have also seen both high-tech and old-fashioned dirty tricks used with uncomfortable frequency. In the 2017 U.S. Senate special election in Alabama, left-leaning groups backing Democrat Doug Jones (but working independently) used social media ma nipu la tion "" based on Russian tactics from 2016 "" to target Republican Roy Moore. One of these efforts, 'Dry Alabama,' involved inventing a pro-Moore Baptist group that supported a statewide ban on alcohol. One of the people behind the fake group told the New York Times that he hoped Dry Alabama's hardcore anti-alcohol message would depress turnout among moderate Republicans. 
The 2018 race in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District saw straight-up ballot tampering: Evidence of improper tactics by consultant Leslie McCrae Dowless to support the Republican candidate, Mark Harris, was so overwhelming that the bipartisan North Carolina Board of Elections voted unanimously to order a new election unmarred by fraud. Trump, who speaks nonstop about nonexistent Democratic voter fraud, has remained mostly silent about North Carolina.
Finally, we have seen a rise in incendiary rhetoric about stolen elections. At an October 2016 campaign rally in Ambridge, Pa., Trump told an enthusiastic, mostly white crowd that it is 'so important that you watch other communities, because we don't want this election stolen from us.'
In 2018, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) claimed that if Democrat Stacey Abrams lost the Georgia governor's race, it would be because Kemp 'stole' it. It is true that Kemp was an incompetent and malevolent secretary of state who was supervising the election in which he was running. But there was no good evidence that his actions changed the outcome of the election, which he won. Abrams nonetheless has refused repeatedly to call Kemp the 'legitimate' governor of Georgia.
The combination of these four factors "" Republican voter suppression, pockets of incompetence, dirty tricks and increasingly outrageous language about stolen elections "" creates a volatile mix in our hyperpolarized era. 
Unfortunately, we don't have any good short-term fixes available between now and November. It's not clear that we can rely on responsible leaders of both parties to assure democratic transitions and acceptance of election results. Republican responses to the impeachment hearings' evidence that Trump encouraged foreign interference in the 2020 elections are not encouraging. Many contested elections wind up in the courts: According to figures I've compiled for my new book, 'Election Meltdown,' election litigation has nearly tripled since 2000, with the highest number of cases occurring in the most recent national elections, in 2018. But the Supreme Court itself is polarized, and it is not certain that Democrats would accept a decision by a Republican-majority court handing yet another presidency to a Republican. 
There are about nine months until Election Day. Some concrete steps could help minimize the chances of a meltdown, since we can't do much to fix problems after they occur. For example, journalists could be more careful not to 'call' states for presidential candidates until they are absolutely sure enough votes have been counted that the outcome is clear. Social media companies could ban 'deep fake' videos that are not labeled as manipulated. Government cybersecurity experts do more to thwart unusual ways of disrupting the voting process, such as attacks on the power grid. And election officials need to have a Plan B in the event of attacks on registration or voting systems. External and internal forces that seek to foment discord are not resting. We can't, either.

Insider influence, fear of backlash shaped company action on misinformation
Facebook created 'Project P' "" for propaganda "" in the hectic weeks after the 2016 presidential election and quickly found dozens of pages that had peddled false news reports ahead of Donald Trump's surprise victory. Nearly all were based overseas, had financial motives and displayed a clear rightward bent.
In a world of perfect neutrality, which Facebook espouses as its goal, the political tilt of the pages shouldn't have mattered. But in a videoconference between Facebook's Washington office and its Silicon Valley headquarters in December 2016, the company's most senior Republican, Joel Kaplan, voiced concerns that would become familiar to those within the company.
'We can't remove all of it because it will disproportionately affect conservatives,' said Kaplan, a former George W. Bush White House official and now the head of Facebook's Washington office, according to people familiar with the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect professional relationships.
When another Facebook staff member pushed for the entire list to be taken down on the grounds that the accounts fueled the 'fake news' that had roiled the election, Kaplan warned of the backlash from conservatives.
'They don't believe it to be fake news,' he said, arguing for time to develop guidelines that could be defended to the company's critics, including on the right.
The debate over 'Project P,' which resulted in a few of the worst pages quickly being removed while most others remained on the platform, exemplified the political dynamics that have reigned within Facebook since Trump emerged as the Republican Party's presumptive nominee to the White House in 2016. A company led mainly by Democrats in the liberal bastion of Northern California repeatedly has tilted rightward to deliver policies, hiring decisions and public gestures sought by Republicans, according to current and former employees and others who have worked closely with the company.
Trump and other party leaders have pressured Facebook by making unproven claims of bias against conservatives amid rising signs of government action on the issue, including investigations by Congress and the Justice Department. Republicans also have leveraged Facebook's fears of alienating conservative Americans to win concessions from a company whose most widely shared news content typically includes stories from Fox News and other right-leaning sources.
These sensitivities "" in conjunction with the company's long-standing resistance to acting as 'an arbiter of truth' "" have affected Facebook's responses to a range of major issues, from how to address fake news and Russian manipulation of American voters on the platform to, more recently, the advertising policies that have set the political ground rules for the 2020 election, say people privy to internal debates.
Such factors have helped shape a platform that gives politicians license to lie and that remains awash in misinformation, vulnerable to a repeat of many of the problems that marred the 2016 presidential election.
Facebook, unlike Google and Twitter, also has refused calls to restrict politicians' access to powerful ad-targeting tools "" which Trump used with particular relish four years ago "" that allow messages to be tailored to individual voters, based on characteristics Facebook has gleaned over years of tracking user behavior.
'I think Facebook is looking at their political advertising policies in explicitly partisan terms, and they're afraid of angering Republicans,' said Alex Stamos, head of the Stanford Internet Observatory, a research group, and a former Facebook chief security officer. 'The Republicans in the D.C. office see themselves as a bulwark against the liberals in California.' 
The company says its decisions are guided not by political calculations but by global policy goals of expanding connections among users and protecting them from government overreach, in line with chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's commitment to allowing speech on the social media platform to remain as unrestricted as possible.
'After 2016, we made massive investments in new teams and technology to make our products safer and to secure elections,' said company spokesman Andy Stone. 'People on both sides of the aisle continue to criticize us, but we remain committed to seeking outside perspectives and building a platform for all ideas.' 
Kaplan declined to comment for this article.
But critics "" both outside Facebook and within its ranks "" see something more akin to corporate realpolitik, a willingness to accede to political demands in an era when Republicans control most levers of power in Washington.
'Facebook does not speak Republican,' said a former employee of Facebook's Integrity Team, which was created to ensure safety and trust on the platform, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about a former employer. 'This is what they know about Republicans: Tell them 'yes' or they will hurt us.' 
In the 16 years since its birth as a website to connect students at Harvard, Facebook has emerged as perhaps the world's most far-reaching source of news and information, especially since it added the potent subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, creating a stable of globe-spanning communication tools with billions of users. Facebook's technology played a role in fomenting democratic revolutions across the Arab world and helping to rally domestic political movements such as Black Lives Matter. But the platform also was used to help fuel a genocide in Myanmar, a U.N. report concluded, and has been used to live-stream violence, including video of a massacre at a New Zealand mosque.
Facebook's power is coveted by American politicians, who know that the vast majority of U.S. voters have accounts. Trump already has spent more than $32 million on the platform for his reelection effort, while Democratic candidates, collectively, have spent more than $107 million, according to Facebook's Ad Library, one of its transparency initiatives. Andrew Bosworth, a top corporate executive considered a confidant of Zuckerberg, said in a post in December that Facebook was 'responsible for Donald Trump getting elected' in 2016 through his effective advertising campaign "" a comment that underscored the stakes of the company's policy moves.
Facebook's quest to quell conservative criticism has infused a range of decisions in recent years, say people familiar with the company's internal debates. These included whether to allow graphic images of premature babies on feeding tubes "" a prohibition that had rankled antiabortion groups "" or to include the sharply conservative Breitbart News in a list of news sources despite its history of serving, in the words of its former executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon, as the 'platform for the alt-right.' 
Breitbart spokeswoman Elizabeth Moore, citing the popularity of the news site and what she called a strong track record of accuracy, said, 'It would be an insane oversight to disenfranchise our massive audience that uses Facebook and craves our news content.' 
But its inclusion has sparked criticism among those who say the move was mainly to address Republican complaints about the company.
'I don't think they do this as a conservative company. I think they do this as a scared company,' said Jeff Jarvis, a journalism professor at the City University of New York who has worked with Facebook on several media projects.
The price has been high in terms of anger from Democrats, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), who has promised to lead efforts to break up Facebook should she win the presidency. Liberal financier George Soros, writing recently in the New York Times, called for stripping control of Facebook from Zuckerberg and accused the company of having 'an informal mutual assistance operation' with Trump.
Yet by at least one metric, Facebook's moves have succeeded "" in appeasing a disruptive, unpredictable president. Just last month in Davos, Switzerland, Trump said of Zuckerberg on CNBC, 'He's done a hell of a job.'
Power shift in Washington
Soon after Facebook's meeting on Project P, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski came to Facebook's Washington headquarters offering to advise the company on how to handle the new White House, according to people familiar with the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive internal matters.
The shifting power in Washington was a serious issue for the company. Its employees had donated just $5,171 to Trump, compared with $1.1 million to fundraising committees affiliated with Democrat Hillary Clinton, with nearly half that amount coming from two of Zuckerberg's closest confidantes, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and then-Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, according to the political analytics firm GovPredict.
But the meeting with Lewandowski sparked outrage within an office still reeling from the election. Particularly upset were several Democrats, including the director of U.S. public policy, Catlin O'Neill, a former chief of staff to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the granddaughter of a legendary Pelosi predecessor, Thomas P. 'Tip' O'Neill (D-Mass.), said people familiar with the visit and its aftermath.
Facebook decided not to retain Lewandowski, who declined to comment on the details of the visit aside from saying by text, 'Please be sure to include the facts that I have never worked for them or been paid by them "" they solicited me for a meeting and I attended.' 
But the encounter left many within the company uneasy about what Trump and his allies might do "" or perhaps worse, what he might tweet.
The company gradually implemented policies to combat false, misleading news reports through new transparency initiatives and a system of third-party fact-checkers, a move that upset some Republicans. It also adopted its first policy against 'coordinated inauthentic behavior' "" essentially using bots, fake accounts or other amplification tactics to manipulate the platform, as Russians and others had in 2016 "" and bolstered its security team to police violations.
Complaints eventually grew, however, that conservatives were being unfairly targeted by these moves and by long-standing content policies, such as the prohibition against hate speech. Moves to ban conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and right-wing media star Milo Yiannopoulos in 2019 for being 'dangerous,' for example, generated allegations of censorship by 'Big Tech' among more mainstream conservatives.
As these and other complaints against Facebook grew among Republicans, Trump often amplified them over rival social media platform Twitter, where his following tops 72 million users.
'Facebook was always anti-Trump,' he tweeted on Sept. 27, 2017, amid the scandal over Russian efforts to use social media to help elect him. The following month, he added, 'Crooked Hillary Clinton spent hundreds of millions of dollars more on Presidential Election than I did. Facebook was on her side, not mine!'
Trump leveled similar charges against other technology companies, as he did in December 2018: 'Facebook, Twitter and Google are so biased toward the Dems it is ridiculous!' But, often, Facebook bore the brunt of the president's wrath, as it did after a pair of pro-Trump social media personalities, Diamond and Silk, accused the company of censoring them after they received a warning about posting 'unsafe' content. (The company later said it had acted in error.)
'The wonderful Diamond and Silk have been treated so horribly by Facebook. They work so hard and what has been done to them is very sad - and we're looking into' it, Trump tweeted in May 2019. 'It's getting worse and worse for Conservatives on social media!'
Rising internal GOP clout
The role of helping the company maneuver through this treacherous new political landscape became a core responsibility for Kaplan, Facebook's vice president for global public policy, who had joined the company in 2011, after eight years in the Bush White House and a stint as an energy lobbyist.
The former Marine Corps officer had clerked for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and, despite supporting former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) for president, met with Trump in December 2016 after the White House expressed interest in having him head the Office of Management and Budget. Kaplan later played a key role in organizing support for Trump Supreme Court pick Brett M. Kavanaugh, a longtime Kaplan friend.
As Trump came to office, Kaplan was a Republican in a company increasingly self-conscious about its oversupply of Democrats in its top ranks. This included Sandberg, who had worked in the Clinton administration and hired numerous friends and former colleagues into Facebook "" creating a class of internal allies known informally as 'FOSS,' for Friends of Sheryl Sandberg.
Kaplan, who had dated Sandberg when they were students at Harvard, managed to be both a FOSS and one of the only Republicans in the room when major decisions got made. The combination lent him credibility when he warned, as he often did, that a looming decision might inflame perilous relations with conservatives.
The rising clout among Facebook's Republicans went beyond Kaplan. Katie Harbath, a onetime campaign aide to former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, gained increased prominence. Kaplan also dispensed with the tradition of having members of both major parties share power atop the Washington office by hiring a fellow Republican, former Federal Communications Commission chairman Kevin Martin, as his deputy "" strengthening the conservative cast of the office at its highest levels.
Kaplan proved to be adept at assuaging conservative concerns about Facebook. Even before Trump won the presidency, the company faced a crisis in May 2016 when tech publication Gizmodo published a story asserting that contractors managing Facebook's 'Trending' module were suppressing conservative stories.
Kaplan tapped a small team of Republicans, including Harbath, to organize a visit for prominent conservatives, such as political commentators Glenn Beck and Tucker Carlson, to Facebook headquarters. The meeting with Zuckerberg and Sandberg calmed the controversy "" at least for a time "" but conservatives soon would come back with other complaints.
'It's the squeaky wheels who get the grease,' said another person familiar with the company's effort to mollify conservatives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 'They were the squeaky wheels.'
As for the 'Trending' topics feature, Facebook fired the contractors described in the Gizmodo story and gave the job for determining 'Trending' topics to an algorithm. That allowed the feature to become a vehicle for spreading the false news reports that marred Facebook in the months leading up to the election. One recommended story claimed "" falsely "" that Fox News host Megyn Kelly had been fired for supporting Clinton.
Russia campaign and fallout
Security researchers at Facebook found the first signs that Russians were seeking to influence the U.S. election months before the 2016 vote, discovering accounts apparently under control of foreign military hackers.
Those initial discoveries, although shared with the FBI, were not made public. But when U.S. intelligence officials announced in January 2017 that they, too, had detected Russian interference on social media, an internal debate developed within Facebook about what to reveal publicly and when.
The result, after three months of wrangling, was a 13-page white paper in April that did not include the words 'Russia' or 'Russian.' Instead, there was this oblique reference: 'Our data does not contradict the attribution provided by the U.S. Director of National Intelligence in the report dated January 6, 2017.'
Several issues were at play in these debates, including whether Facebook's researchers had enough clear evidence to name Russia definitively, and company officials pushed to make sure the white paper was rigorous enough to be defended in the face of the expected Republican backlash. But some company employees found the resulting document incomplete, and the caution of company officials fueled complaints that they were acting in part to avoid inflaming tensions with a White House consumed with battling allegations that Russia had helped elect Trump.
'If we say Russia, it will center us in this discussion and anger the administration,' a person familiar with the political dynamics in Face book's Washington office recalled hearing.
Stone, the Facebook spokesman, said, 'The goal of the white paper was to share our findings in a straightforward manner, which is why there was broad agreement with the security team's recommendation to refer to the Intelligence Community Assessment and not name any specific nations.'
The worry about political fallout grew in subsequent months as Facebook's security researchers discovered that the Internet Research Agency, whose owner was a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, had used 470 fake accounts and pages to manipulate U.S. voters. When Facebook revealed this Russian interference in September 2017, the fears of angering the White House proved prescient.
Trump soon began tweeting about the company, and conservatives in Congress used the resulting hearings to accuse Facebook of bias against conservative voices on the platform. Such complaints grew the following year, when the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke regarding the use of sensitive Facebook data to direct campaign messaging.
Zuckerberg's visit to Capitol Hill in April 2018 to address the Cambridge Analytica scandal featured frequent allegations of bias. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) cited Facebook's warning to Diamond and Silk as exemplifying 'a pervasive pattern of political bias.' In a House hearing the next day, Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.) asked Zuckerberg, 'What is 'unsafe' about two black women supporting Donald J. Trump?'
While Zuckerberg attributed the incident to 'an enforcement error,' the next month the company announced it would conduct an audit of allegations of bias against conservatives at Facebook. Leading this inquiry was not an independent social media researcher but a prominent conservative lawyer, former senator Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.).
The resulting interim report, completed in August, catalogued numerous complaints by conservatives but offered no concrete evidence of bias or any systematic, data-based review of the question. Still, it offered two concessions: Facebook would hire more staff 'dedicated to working with right-of-center organizations and leaders.' And the company would loosen a long-standing advertising policy against graphic medical photos; the result was to allow antiabortion groups to depict premature babies reliant on feeding and other medical tubes in political messaging.
The audit and its concessions pleased many conservatives but rankled some on the other side of the political spectrum, who had begun to sense that, in their dealings with Facebook, they were on a losing streak to an organized, forceful and consistent campaign of pressure by conservatives. Civil rights leaders, for example, had been asking for an audit of racism on the platform for several years. It finally got announced the same day, in May 2018, as the conservative bias audit.
'We've been in conversation with them, in some iteration, for four years, without much success,' said Malkia Devich Cyril, a senior fellow for the activist group MediaJustice who was part of a Black Lives Matter delegation that visited Facebook in 2016. 'As individuals they might have liberal or progressive leanings, but as a company their interests are being served by conservative economic policy.' 
Fact checks and ad tools
The political stakes for Facebook became increasingly clear last summer. A major corporate initiative, a cryptocurrency called Libra, landed in Washington with a discernible thud.
'Facebook Libra's 'virtual currency' will have little standing or dependability,' Trump tweeted in July, making clear his intention to impose federal regulations on such an initiative. 'We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States Dollar!'
About the same time, the Justice Department began a broad antitrust review of major technology companies, including Facebook.
Zuckerberg "" who had lashed out at Warren over her calls to break up Facebook, telling employees in a July meeting that he would 'go to the mat and . . . fight' any such effort "" took a more conciliatory tone with Trump.
As talk of federal investigations grew in September, Zuckerberg visited the White House. Trump tweeted, 'Nice meeting with Mark Zuckerberg of @Facebook in the Oval Office today.' Included was a picture of the young tech billionaire shaking hands with the president.
Zuckerberg also hosted a group of conservatives at his home in Palo Alto, Calif., in June. One participant, longtime anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, praised the company for hiring staff specifically to work with conservatives.
'There has been what seems to be a serious effort to reach out to us,' said Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.
Two important victories for Trump and conservatives came amid this outreach by Zuckerberg.
The first was when Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president for global affairs and communications, announced in September that the company's system of third-party fact-checkers would not review claims by politicians. Although Facebook said this was merely the ratification of existing practice, the announcement provoked fury among Democrats weary from thousands of well-chronicled falsehoods, embellishments and misstatements by Trump and worried that he would exploit the loophole in the coming campaign season.
An immediate test further underscored these fears: A Trump campaign ad made claims against former vice president Joe Biden, at the time leading in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination, that independent fact-checkers called dubious. Biden's campaign demanded the ad be removed, but Facebook refused, reiterating it would not act against false statements from politicians.
Those defending the decision, inside and outside the company, pointed to the traditional leeway given to political speech in the United States and to Zuckerberg's own reluctance to curb user expression in all but the most extreme circumstances.
He said in a speech at Georgetown University in October that restricting political speech threatens 'the ability to speak freely [that] has been central in the fight for democracy worldwide.'
But critics saw yet another effort by Facebook to steer clear of Republican wrath.
'Right now Trump is president, and the company is obviously very attuned to the political winds,' said Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a Washington-based umbrella group. 'They all know [at Facebook] that the Justice Department and state attorneys general are sniffing around at regulations and litigation.' 
The second victory for conservatives came soon after, when Face book rebuffed calls to limit the ability of politicians to use advertising tools that allow the narrow targeting of individuals based on their home address, gender, education level, income, marital status, job or other characteristics. Brad Parscale, a digital adviser to Trump's 2016 campaign and now campaign manager for the reelection effort, had boasted of the power of these targeting tools and made clear his eagerness to use them again.
Some Democratic political operatives and the Democratic National Committee also expressed concern to Facebook about losing access to such cheap, effective means for reaching voters. But other prominent Democrats, as well as politically independent technology researchers, warned that what they called 'microtargeting' could threaten the sanctity of elections by undermining the accountability and transparency of political speech.
These critics warned that voters had no way to know what messages reached their friends or neighbors, giving politicians license to tailor messages based on what people wanted to hear rather than what was best for the public overall. A lie delivered to just 100 carefully targeted people on Facebook, for example, was much less likely to be caught and corrected than one delivered on a billboard or in a television ad.
Ellen L. Weintraub, a Democrat who then was chair of the Federal Election Commission, warned in a Washington Post opinion piece that such targeting had a history as 'a potent weapon for spreading disinformation and sowing discord.'
For these reasons, Google prohibited politicians from using its most powerful targeting tools. Twitter decided to ban political ads altogether. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) urged Facebook to follow the lead of these other companies 'rather than continuing to chase political advertising dollars.'
Facebook seriously considered such a move during a months-long internal debate that weighed several types of restrictions, including possibly banning political ads altogether, company officials said, pointing out that such advertising produces a very small percentage of its multibillion-dollar revenue streams while generating a disproportionate amount of headaches.
But when news leaked that Face book was considering such changes, Trump made clear his-opposition. His campaign tweeted, amid red siren emoji, 'IMPORTANT @facebook wants to take important tools away from us for 2020. Tools that help us reach more great Americans - lift voices the media - big tech choose to ignore!'
Facebook ultimately announced in January that it would increase the transparency of ad targeting ahead of the 2020 election but impose no new limits for politicians.
In a blog post, Rob Leathern, Facebook's director of product management, made clear that the company had heard the political clamor on the issue.
'Unlike Google, we have chosen not to limit targeting of these ads,' Leathern wrote. 'We considered doing so, but through extensive outreach and consultations we heard about the importance of these tools for reaching key audiences from a wide range of NGOs, non-profits, political groups and campaigns, including both Republican and Democratic committees in the US.'

LEAVING HIM IN PLACE A DIRE RISK, THEY SAY
Impeachment managers assail president's character
House prosecutors finished their opening arguments in President Trump's impeachment trial on Friday, arguing that his conduct toward Ukraine reflected a dangerous reflex toward political expediency and a lack of character that will backfire on Republicans if they do not help remove him from office.
Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and his colleagues attempted to drive this argument home Friday to sway a handful of Republican senators whose position on gathering further evidence will determine the arc and scope of the trial. Yet there were few signs that any Republican was persuaded, leaving open the matter of possible witness testimony and further dampening Democrats' already meager hopes of a conviction in the GOP-controlled Senate. 
Schiff's pointed and increasingly personal approach was an attempt to go beyond the specifics of House Democrats' case to make the broader argument that Trump is an untrustworthy president who is likely to repeatedly flout the Constitution if allowed to stay in office.
'It goes to character,' Schiff said. 'You don't realize how important character is in the highest office in the land until you don't have it.' 
The Democrats' closing statements were their final appeal to senators before the next phase of the trial: an aggressive rebuttal from Trump's lawyers that will kick off Saturday and continue in earnest on Monday.
Speaking Friday on the Senate floor "" hours after new evidence emerged of Trump's campaign to oust the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine starting in 2018 "" Schiff predicted that Trump's future behavior would vindicate Democrats' claim that he abused his power, and he warned Republicans the president, now their ally, could ultimately turn on them.
'Do you think for a moment that any of you "" no matter what your relationship with this president, no matter how close you are to this president "" do you think for a moment that if he felt it was in his interest, he wouldn't ask you to be investigated?' he asked.
The remarks concluded the House managers' case for the first article of impeachment, which charges Trump with abuse of power over allegations he withheld military aid and an Oval Office meeting from Ukraine to pressure the country's leaders into announcing investigations into Trump's political rivals. These included former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, while his father was in office. The managers spent the rest of the day detailing their case for the second article of impeachment "" obstruction of Congress, following Trump's barring the executive branch from cooperating with the House investigation. 
The Senate will reconvene Saturday at 10 a.m. for several hours of what Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow described as 'coming attractions' from his side "" a preview of the pro-Trump case before the full-scale presentation begins Monday. The timetable is aimed at garnering peak television viewership "" a priority for Trump as he faces the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history "" though Sekulow said that his side would not use its full 24-hour time allotment for defending Trump. 
'We're not going to try to run the clock out,' he said this week.
Democrats faced continued criticism from Republicans that their presentations were tedious and difficult to follow.
'I just thought yesterday was like, too much,' said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), calling the remarks repetitive and 'mind-numbing.' 'This needs to end. They've had an opportunity to make their case.'
While many Republicans echoed the view that the trial has been repetitive, every member of the Senate GOP caucus has voted against hearing from new witnesses or collecting new evidence.
It was clear when the trial resumed at 1 p.m. Friday that Schiff heeded some of Republicans' complaints: rather than speaking for hours at a time, the managers presented in shorter spurts, rotating more often and punctuating their remarks with more video clips. 
After Trump's defense concludes, mostly likely on Monday, the trial will enter a question-and-answer phase that will last for up to 16 hours. This is expected to take place Tuesday and Wednesday, followed by a debate Thursday over whether to seek testimony from witnesses. Democrats are pushing for former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to appear, while most Republicans have shot down the idea of hearing from witnesses. But they have said that if Democrats secure the votes to subpoena any of their choices, the GOP will push for Joe or Hunter Biden to appear.
Democrats need four Republicans to join them in any attempt to secure new testimony or evidence, and the senators being targeted have been careful to say that they have made no decision "" while giving no indication they are moving closer to supporting any subpoenas.
Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), one of the most closely watched Republican senators, said Friday that the House managers had 'presented us with a mountain of overwhelming evidence,' though it was unclear which way he was leaning on the question of hearing more. 
Alexander told reporters that he will make his decision on admitting witnesses and other new evidence only after the White House defense team makes its case.
'I think that question can only be answered then,' he said. 'We've been polite to the House managers, listened to them carefully, and now we're going to do the same with the president's lawyers. I think the House managers have done a good job of making their arguments. But that doesn't mean I will agree with them.'
Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) raised the prospect that a Senate trial could drag on for months if Trump administration witnesses are called, arguing that the issue of executive privilege would have to be litigated in the courts.
'This could tie up the Senate through the election and even beyond as the courts litigate these claims,' Cornyn said during an appearance on conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt's syndicated radio show. 'We'll wait and see, but right now, I'm not for extending this for months and months while claims of privilege and the like are litigated in the courts.'
The question of whether the Senate will seek more evidence was heightened Friday by a new Washington Post-ABC News poll revealing that a majority of American adults, 66 percent, support the Senate calling new witnesses to testify, as opposed to 27 percent who don't.
ABC News also reported Friday that it reviewed a recording of Trump at a private dinner telling associates that he wanted then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch gone, a reminder of the evidence yet to be uncovered about Trump's actions. 
'Get rid of her! Get her out tomorrow. I don't care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. Okay? Do it,' Trump is heard saying, according to ABC News.
Schiff challenged the Senate to call the administration's bluff on whether witnesses would be limited from testifying by executive privilege and let Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is presiding over the trial, make those calls.
Calling executive privilege 'the last refuge of the president's team to conceal the evidence from the American people,' Schiff argued that Roberts should 'decide issues of evidence and privilege' whenever witnesses or the president claim it, but that the assumption Trump will try to silence certain witnesses by claiming executive privilege should not keep the Senate from calling them to testify.
'The Senate will always have the opportunity to overrule the justice,' Schiff said to reporters, adding that 'you cannot use executive privilege to hide wrongdoing or criminality or impeachable misconduct, and that is exactly the purpose for which they seek to use-it.' 
After Roberts scolded both sides for overheated rhetoric late Tuesday night, Democrats took pains to tone down their accusations against Trump and his supporters in the Senate. 
Yet Schiff also sharpened his case on Friday, arguing that Republicans trust Trump at their own peril. 
He invoked the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) in arguing about the strategic importance of Ukraine as a U.S. ally and quoted him as saying, 'We are all Ukrainians.'
And he made a lengthy case that Trump's skepticism about the conclusions of U.S. intelligence services "" particularly about Russian interference in the 2016 election "" represents a 'coup' for Russia. 
'Has there ever been such a coup? I would submit to you that in the entire length of the Cold War, the Soviet Union had no such success. No such success,' Schiff said. 'I hope it was worth it. I hope it was worth it for the president. Because it certainly wasn't worth it for the United States.'
Trump's defenders are focused on Biden's push to oust former Ukraine prosecutor-general Viktor Shokin, who was overseeing a probe of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma and its owner at the same time that Biden's son was serving as a member of the company's board. 
Biden's actions were in line with official U.S. and European policy at the time "" a consensus that Shokin was involved in corrupt schemes and needed to be removed. 
Democrats detailed these facts on Thursday with the awareness that Trump's legal team was likely to focus on them during their defense of the president.
The president's aides and allies continued to portray the trial as a waste of time and one that is not capturing the public's attention. 
'As you've seen, the ratings keep going down every day in terms of viewers,' White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said on Fox News. 'I think that next week, we need to get this over with so we can get on with the business of the country.'
Schiff concluded his remarks Friday night with a different message as he urged senators to support hearing more evidence.
'I ask you. I implore you: Give America a fair trial,' he told senators. 'Give America a fair trial. She's worth it.'

Proposal may be made public ahead of meeting next week in Washington


President Trump on Thursday invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his challenger in upcoming elections, Benny Gantz, to Washington next week for a discussion of Trump's long-awaited Middle East peace plan.

Vice President Pence extended the invitations while in Israel, where he met with the embattled longtime Israeli leader and his lesser-known rival, and hours later Trump said he would probably release the plan as soon as next week. 
'President Trump asked me to extend an invitation to Prime Minister Netanyahu to come to the White House next week to discuss regional issues, as well as the prospect of peace here in the Holy Land,' Pence said, speaking alongside Netanyahu at the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem. 
Pence added that, at Netanyahu's urging, he extended a similar offer to Gantz to come to the White House for a preview of the plan, which was finished last year but kept under wraps amid political turmoil in Israel. No details of the package were released Thursday. 
'I think that the president is seeking to give Israel the peace and security it deserves,' Netanyahu said, adding that he 'gladly' accepted the invitation. 

Trump told reporters on Thursday that he would probably put out his peace plan ahead of the meetings Tuesday. 'Probably we'll release it a little bit prior to that,' he said. 
The president said he believed the plan could work and there would be discussions with the Palestinians about it. 
'We've spoken to them briefly. But we will speak to them in a period of time,' he said. 'And they have a lot of incentive to do it. I'm sure they maybe will react negatively at first, but it's actually very positive for them.' 
The Trump administration last year released proposals for a massive international investment effort in the Palestinian territories and elsewhere.
But the administration has held back the politically sensitive elements of the plan to avoid the appearance of interfering in Israeli elections, even as the White House took other actions seen as beneficial to Netanyahu. With Israel now preparing for its third election within a year, U.S. officials decided to release the plan and let events take their course, regional diplomats and former U.S. officials said. 

The effort led by Trump son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner began in the first months of Trump's presidency. It was undertaken in contrast to what Trump dismissed as the endless circular discussions about peace under previous administrations and as a hallmark of the new administration's business-focused approach to foreign policy.
Hopes for what has come to be known in the Middle East as Trump's 'Deal of the Century' are small. Palestinians have rejected the plan sight unseen as a sop to U.S. ally Israel, and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas was not invited to Washington.

Kushner has said the plan would include some elements that Israel will not like, despite a series of steps Trump has already taken that are widely seen to tip the scales in favor of Israel.
Palestinian leaders have refused all contact with the Trump administration since the first of those steps, the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital and the relocation of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv in 2018. 
The White House has developed the plan with almost no input from the Palestinian side of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, now in its eighth decade.
'For sure it's going to be a complete rejection of the plan,' Mahmoud al-Aloul, vice chairman of the ruling Fatah party and a possible successor to Abbas, said in a recent interview amid growing reports that the plan was soon to see daylight. 
Aloul said overtures from the administration had grown more frequent in recent weeks, including at least 10 invitations to discuss the plan delivered by European intermediaries. The Palestinians rebuffed them all, he said. 
'They want to be able to say that they have our input,' he said. 'But [Trump] is not doing this to help us, but to help his friend Netanyahu in his campaign.'
Husam Zomlot, Palestinian ambassador to Britain and former ambassador to the United States, said, 'Our position is clear: Israel must end its occupation of Palestinian land that began in 1967 including East Jerusalem, and a just resolution to the issue of refugees in accordance with international resolutions.'
Although Trump had once hoped to convene face-to-face peace talks between Israeli and Palestinian leaders, the long-delayed package of U.S. proposals is now expected to serve as a marker for any future talks, perhaps in a second Trump term. Palestinians and Trump critics also expect the administration may now pivot toward an even more pro-Israel stance, since Trump could say that Palestinians refused to discuss ideas that could bring greater prosperity and opportunity to the West Bank.

The sprawling document is meant to settle the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, offer Palestinians economic benefits and secure Israel's future. The Trump administration has refused to say whether it would offer Palestinians a sovereign state on land now occupied by Israel.
Although Trump has said he prefers the idea of Palestinian statehood, his administration has dropped public commitment to a 'two-state solution' that guided all the most recent peace efforts.
The plan is expected to propose the incorporation of large Jewish settlements in the West Bank into Israel proper and to provide for Israeli security administration of the West Bank, while giving Palestinians greater political autonomy and a potential path to sovereignty, according to diplomats who have heard Kushner and others describe it. 
The invitation to Washington comes amid political turmoil in Israel. The country has been mired in stalemate for more than a year, with two elections failing to produce a governing majority in the parliament, and a third, also considered a dead heat, scheduled for March. Gantz, the former army chief of staff, has twice brought his centrist Blue and White party to the threshold of power but fallen shy each time.
Now, Netanyahu is also fighting a recent indictment on corruption charges related to his dealings with wealthy business owners. Observers in Israel note that a trip to Washington will provide a welcome change of topic next week, just as the parliament is scheduled to take up the prime minister's request for immunity from prosecution.

Pence extended the invitations while in Israel to attend events commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp.
A spokesman for Gantz confirmed he had been invited but had yet to respond.
In a statement, Netanyahu said he looked forward to discussing with Trump 'his ideas on how to advance peace and to work closely with him to advance that goal.' The prime minister said he had suggested that Gantz also be invited because 'it's important that we do not lose this historic opportunity. With such friends in the White House, with such backing from the United States, we should get as broad a consensus as possible around the efforts to achieve security and peace, peace and security for the State of Israel.'

SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic "" The politics of this Caribbean island nation do not frequently capture the attention of the stewards of America's foreign policy, but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo phoned down last summer with a clear message. 
Dominican President Danilo Medina's supporters were pushing to change the country's constitution to allow him to run for an unprecedented third term. In a call with the president, Pompeo emphasized the importance of 'adherence to rule of law and the constitution,' according to a State Department readout.

That message was echoed a week later in person by President Trump's personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani. 
'If you want to change the constitution, change it for the future,' Giuliani told reporters during a July 2019 visit to Santo Domingo. 'Don't make it look like you're changing it for you. Don't change it for this election.' 
Giuliani was not in the Dominican Republic as Trump's representative. He was speaking as a paid consultant to an opposition presidential candidate, Luis Abinader, a businessman who had been protesting the possibility of a constitutional change allowing the incumbent to run again. 
Days later, Medina announced that he would not seek reelection.
The overlapping interests of the U.S. administration and Giuliani's paying client underscores how his decision to work as an international consultant while serving as Trump's lawyer has caused disquiet, both among foreign leaders and U.S. administration officials.
Giuliani's presence in Santo Domingo annoyed rival Dominican presidential candidates who felt Abinader was trying to buy his campaign an American seal of approval, according to candidates and their advisers. And it concerned officials in the presidential palace who scrutinized Giuliani's comments for signs he was speaking for Trump, according to a person familiar with the discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal talks.

Giuliani's visit to the Dominican Republic came around the same time that he "" with Trump's backing "" had been pressing Pompeo and U.S. diplomats to push Ukraine to announce investigations into Trump's political opponents, a gambit that led to the president's impeachment.

The State Department did not respond to multiple requests for comment. 
Giuliani did not respond directly to a question about whether he met with anyone at the State Department about his client there.
'Why in the world would you care about my work in the DR except to once again try to suggest falsely that there is some question about it?' he asked in a text message. 'Don't you have anything better to do? Whatever I did in DR was perfectly lawful and appropriate.'
The full scope of Giuliani's clientele is not known. The uncertainty about whom he represents "" and his willingness to take on foreign clients with interests before the U.S. government while working for the president "" has alarmed senior administration officials, as The Washington Post has previously reported.
In his various meetings last year with foreign and U.S. officials, Giuliani toggled between serving as Trump's emissary and representing other interests. During a sit-down in August with a top Ukrainian official to discuss the investigations Trump wanted, Giuliani advocated for a former client, the mayor of Kyiv. On that same trip, he stayed at a historic estate of a client, Venezuelan energy executive Alejandro Betancourt López "" and later met with top Justice Department officials to urge them not to charge him in a money-laundering case.
Giuliani, who says he works for Trump free, has told The Post that he is always careful to make clear he is a private lawyer for the president, not a representative of the U.S. government.
Since 2015, Giuliani has been hired by Abinader as a security consultant two times, according to Samuel Pereyra, an official in the Abinader campaign who managed the contracts.

 
His most recent contract, for $75,000, was secured last June, Pereyra said, more than a year after Giuliani joined Trump's legal team. 
For that sum, Giuliani made a two-day trip to the Dominican Republic in July, appearing with the candidate at a briefing for reporters and visiting a poor neighborhood in the capital, where he said people shouldn't have to live behind bars like prisoners.
While he was there, Giuliani also puffed cigars at his favorite Dominican cigar club and dined at the residence of the U.S. ambassador, Robin Bernstein, one of Trump's longtime Palm Beach, Fla., friends and an original member of Mar-a-Lago, according to people familiar with his activities.

Some members of Abinader's campaign team felt it was a mistake to rehire Giuliani, saying he spoke in generalities and provided little of value, and worried that the candidate had brought him aboard to get access to the president.
'I think [Abinader] wanted a direct line to Trump,' said one adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal discussions. 'For me, that's the principal reason he was hired: It's a link to the White House and the State Department.'
Abinader denied that, telling The Post in an interview that he did not hire Giuliani to curry favor with the Trump administration. The two discussed only security issues, he said.


'Corruption no mas'
The campaign caravan inched through the narrow streets of Villa Altagracia, a working-class exurb north of Santo Domingo, blasting merengue and reggaeton basslines for the dancing crowds. Abinader stood up through the sunroof of his armored SUV and blew kisses to those below. 
'Here he is, the next president of the republic!' the emcee called out last month. 
With his composed, somewhat stiff persona, Abinader is not known for his charisma with the masses. But his pro-business, law-and-order message has resonated with voters who are tired of persistent crime and allegations of corruption in a ruling party that has been in power for 20 of the past 24 years. The Dominican Republic was ranked last year in the bottom quarter of Transparency International's list of most corrupt countries in the world. 
Abinader is a wealthy businessman of Lebanese descent whose father had been a cabinet minister, a presidential candidate and the founder of a private university. His family's diverse holdings included hotels, cement plants and data processing centers, according to Abinader's advisers. 
Before Abinader's first run for president in 2016, public opinion surveys showed that Dominicans' most pressing concern was crime and violence, and his polling numbers on these topics trailed other candidates. 
Like many Dominicans, Abinader had relatives in New York City, with particularly strong connections to Queens: His grandfather ran Corona Hardware in the borough. One of his cousins, Rodolfo Fuertes, was the president of the National Supermarket Association at the time, and suggested in 2015 that Abinader's campaign might benefit from Giuliani's help, Abinader said in an interview.
 The former New York mayor was famous for reducing crime during his tenure. After leaving office, Giuliani sought to capi tal ize on that reputation, offering consulting services on security and police reform to countries around the world. 
'You have to see Giuliani, he can clean up Santo Domingo,' Abinader recalled being told in a meeting with Fuertes and others.
After being hired on a $100,000 contract, Giuliani Security and Safety produced a 38-page
report for the campaign in April 2016 that discussed crime trends and recommended several reforms of the Dominican police, Pereyra said. 
That year, during a visit to Santo Domingo, Giuliani told an audience that the solution to the country's crime problems boiled down to one thing: eliminating corruption. 
'No tolerance. Not allowed. It has to end,' Giuliani told the crowd. 'Corruption no mas.' 
Abinader lost that bid. After Trump won his White House race later that year, Giuliani invited Abinader to the inauguration, where he attended a Latino gala at the Mandarin Oriental hotel in Washington and met with Giuliani and others, Abinader said. 
Abinader decided to rehire Giuliani last June, Pereyra said. Abinader said in an interview that he valued Giuliani's counsel on security matters and the firm's advice helped him generate a security plan for the country. 
'It was a very important campaign issue,' Abinader said. 'I ended up highest in the polls in terms of fighting criminality.' 

Visit from president's lawyer
By last summer, with Giuliani's Ukrainian efforts at full steam, he made a return trip to Santo Domingo. At that point, Giuliani had been Trump's personal lawyer for nearly a year and a half. 
He also had been in contact with the secretary of state. In late March, Giuliani spoke to Pompeo by phone at least twice, according to State Department emails. In May, he sent Pompeo a packet of materials about his Ukraine research in a Manila envelope with 'The White House' written as the return address, according to documents released during the impeachment probe. 
Giuliani has said repeatedly that he did not do any lobbying related to his consulting in the Dominican Republic. In a previous interview with The Post, he described his work there and in other countries as focused only on security services.
Given his prominence, the Abinader campaign asked the U.S. Embassy if it wanted to provide security for Giuliani's visit in July. Embassy officials declined, as Giuliani was not a U.S. government employee, according to Abinader advisers.
The embassy referred questions about Giuliani's visit to the State Department, which did not respond to requests for comment. 
Abinader's team picked Giuliani up from the airport on July-16. The candidate and his aides met with Giuliani in a JW Marriott conference room for a couple of hours to discuss what Giuliani would tell the press the following day. 
'Giuliani was the frontman, the personality,' said Roberto Álvarez, a former Dominican ambassador to the Organization of American States and a foreign policy adviser to Abinader who met with Giuliani that day. 'He knows nothing about the cultural context.' 
During his visit, Giuliani had dinner with Bernstein, the U.S. ambassador, and her husband, Richard, who were Republican donors and had both sold insurance to Trump while in Palm Beach. 
One person who attended the embassy dinner with Giuliani described it as a social call, not a political gathering. The only topic of conversation this person recalled was the recent deaths of tourists at Dominican resorts, an image crisis for the government at the time. 
The morning after his arrival, Giuliani had a breakfast meeting with Dominican journalists and then gave a news conference at the JW Marriott, according to the campaign.
At that time, the constitutional question had seized Dominican politics. Critics of the proposal, including Abinader and other opponents, had staged protests and rallies to demand that the pro-Medina legislature not move forward with allowing a third term. 
'Keep the rules the way they are. Respect democracy,' Giuliani told reporters that day. He mentioned he was speaking as a 'private citizen.' 
A story in the Diario Libre newspaper about his visit referred to him as 'the lawyer for the president of the United States.' A headline that day on Dominican Today, an online news site, read: 'Giuliani jumps into Dominican Republic's reelection fray.' 
His visit was closely monitored by aides to Medina, the current president, who scrutinized Giuliani's remarks to see if he was speaking on behalf of Trump.
Abinader wanted 'to associate himself with the Trump administration and show that he is America's man,' said one senior Dominican official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. 
Abinader's rival candidates also saw Giuliani's presence as an attempt to signal an endorsement from the U.S. president. 
'It's a game of perception; they're trying to leave the impression' that 'the government of the United States favors them,' said Leonel Fernández, a former president who is running again this year. 'In the end, the Dominican voters are going to decide. They don't care whether President Trump is in favor or against.' 
Álvarez, the adviser to Abinader, denied that, saying the relationship with Giuliani was only about advice on security matters. 
 'Never did we use his contact in order to move U.S. policy,' he said.
After two days, Giuliani jetted out of Santo Domingo.
The Abinader campaign is now getting consulting advice on security issues from a former Giuliani partner, John Huvane, who left Giuliani's firm in October, officials said. Huvane did not respond to a request for comment. 
In recent polls, Abinader has held a strong lead "" more than 10-points "" over his two main rivals, including Medina's handpicked successor. The election will be held in May.

MUNICH "" Deep into President Trump's convention-busting presidency, Europeans who once found his approach to the world unbearable are grappling with the possibility that a more inward-looking America is here to stay.
A year after former vice president Joe Biden told Europe's gloomy foreign policy elite that America would bestride the globe just as soon as Democrats take back the White House, that audience is now bracing for four more years of Trump. Even should the president lose, many here watching the Democratic primaries see Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) topping the field and say that Washington's old embrace of free trade and a muscle-popping military may be a thing of the past.
'The Americans say, 'We are not the sheriff to provide security in your neighborhood,' ' French President Emmanuel Macron told attendees of the annual Munich Security Conference, a Davos of the global security elite. He prodded his fellow Europeans to do everything they could to free themselves from dependence on Washington.
A year ago, Biden pushed policymakers to hold tight. Given a choice, many Europeans would embrace him over his Democratic opponents, simply because he would be a predictable president on foreign policy after years of Trump's tweet-lashing. 
But U.S. political news is just as easy to read on the eastern side of the Atlantic, and they have watched the former vice president's struggling candidacy with concern. 
'They're all doing invocations. They're all praying for Biden. They're all of the hope that this is a parenthesis, and then we get back to normal,' a senior NATO diplomat said in an interview at the three-day conference that ended Sunday. The diplomat spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk about the private chatter at the NATO canteen.
Compared with Biden's bold promises, chastened post-impeachment Democrats were much more modest this time around about what was in store for the U.S. relationship with Europe.
'We've had a tough 20-years in foreign policy in the United States,' said Rep. Elissa Slotkin (Mich.), a moderate Democrat from a district that Trump carried in 2016, who added that few of her constituents knew the function of the NATO military alliance. What little they understood, she said, came from absorbing Trump's complaints that Europeans aren't spending enough on their own defense.
'It is not our public's job to figure out why your work is important,' Slotkin, a former CIA and Pentagon analyst, told policymakers. 'It is your job to make your work important to the average person.' 
Many European leaders were fretting about America's role in the world even before Trump took office, with many wringing their hands about President Barack Obama's pivot to Asia and his seeming disinterest "" at least until 2014, when Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula "" in investing in friendly relations with Europe.
But the unhappiness went into overdrive when Trump won the 2016 election. The president has taken a baseball bat to one European priority after another, pulling out of the Paris climate accords, zapping U.S. involvement in the Iran nuclear deal and slapping tariffs on European trade.
Still, more than three years into the Trump era, what once shocked no longer does. Diplomats know to check Trump's Twitter feed for the latest on policy. They admit, with some chagrin, that they will stay silent about behavior they would condemn by the leader of a developing country, such as pushing the courts to go after political opponents.
The one part of Europe that might be happy with Trump is in the east, where right-wing leaders in Poland and Hungary have taken heart from Trump's tacit support as they consolidated control over the courts and their opposition. Separately, countries on NATO's front line with Russia appreciate the growth in U.S. military spending on Europe during the Trump era, despite the president's grumbling about the alliance overall.
'Of course there are some countries and leaders that say another Trump administration could be a problem,' said Polish Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz. 'We don't see a problem.'
Another senior European diplomat said: 'I wouldn't say that we would all be cheering a Democratic victory. It depends on the Democrat.' The diplomat, who cited nervousness about Sanders's attitudes toward the U.S. military presence in Europe, spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid being seen as meddling in U.S. domestic politics.

In Western Europe, though, many policymakers fear that in a second term, the final guardrails on Trump "" for example, a bipartisan push by Congress to keep Trump inside NATO "" could fall away.
A Trump reelection would present 'serious challenges' for Europe, said Norbert Röttgen, a center-right Christian Democrat and the chairman of the German parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs. 'Given that it will be an unconstrained Donald Trump, we would quite likely see not just more of the same, but also an intensification.' 
And for those who have tried to console themselves that Trump's electoral college victory was a one-time fluke, a reelection would affirm that Americans saw everything Trump had to offer and chose it all again. 
'It would be qualitatively different. It would change European perceptions of America, of American democracy,' said a senior European official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear Trump would take aim at the country of any policymaker who spoke against him. 
Most European policymakers say they prefer any Democrat to another four years of Trump. But some say Sanders's success is a signal that American voters have taken a clear turn inward.
'There's little illusion that with any Democratic president, we'd go back to previous times,' said Daniela Schwarzer, the director of the German Council on Foreign Relations.
Sanders "" unlike other front-running Democrats "" appears to hold foreign policy views that could lead to a bigger divergence from Democratic Party orthodoxy in recent years. As mayor of Burlington, Vt., he promoted an anti-interventionist foreign policy. He opposed the Eastern European expansion of NATO in the 1990s, saying that it was needlessly provocative to Russia. He advocates a speedy withdrawal from the Middle East and Afghanistan, saying that the United States has no business waging endless, expensive wars there. He supports sanctions against the Kremlin for its actions in Ukraine but says he wants to dramatically slash military spending.
In Munich, one Sanders surrogate said that a Sanders foreign policy would dispense with the notion of 'the West' that tends to be the focus of European policymakers when they talk about their alliance with Washington.
'Bernie Sanders would, in the beginning, take a view of America as a multiracial, multicultural democracy,' said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a Sanders national campaign co-chair.
Unlike Trump "" and unlike Obama, Biden and other more centrist Democrats "" 'Sanders is not going to push countries to be increasing defense spending,' Khanna said.
Khanna said that the United States could cut back on military activity in the Middle East and Afghanistan to lessen burdens on NATO. 
'We would say that we want the Europeans to pay their fair share of the cost of troops in Europe to defend against invasion or attacks on the European continent,' Khanna said. 'But the entire military spending of the world potentially could be reduced by de-escalating in Afghanistan and in the Middle East and Africa in responsible ways.'
He said that although NATO 'has to have some deterrence in terms of Russia,' there was still room to prioritize diplomacy as a way of managing relations with the Kremlin rather than military might.
'There's no room for negotiation in backing off the view that the annexation of Crimea is immoral and wrong and a blatant violation of international law,' he said. 'But there is room in shaping the posture towards Russia.'
But even centrist Democrats played down the likelihood of a radical shift in U.S. foreign policy under a Sanders presidency.

'I don't think that from a Democratic perspective, there is this whole recalibration of what our foreign policy is,' said Sen. Robert Menendez (N.J.), the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 'I think it's still rooted in the very same core essence of democracy, human rights, rule of law, international organizations and working for nuclear nonproliferation.'

And he said that Congress would temper any big changes. 
'At the end of the day, you still need congressional approval for many of these things,' Menendez said.

Some Europeans, cautioning calm, point out that Sanders's policies align with those of most social democratic parties in Europe "" not radical, but rather the European center-left.
'From a European perspective, Sanders is definitely not far-left,' said Röttgen.
'We could welcome him as a member,' he joked.

President Trump on Friday endorsed a tweet comparing the top Senate Democrat to Iran, the United States' longtime adversary, suggesting neither could be trusted, as Democratic leaders criticized the White House for ordering a military strike to kill a powerful Iranian commander without congressional input.
Amid a flurry of reactions from U.S. lawmakers, Trump retweeted conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, who, in response to a headline about Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) not receiving advance notice of the military operation, wrote: 'Neither were the Iranians, and for pretty much the same reason.'
Trump made similar insinuations about Democrats' trustworthiness after the October raid that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. At that time, Trump said he didn't tell House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), a former member of the Intelligence Committee, because 'he wanted to make sure this kept secret.'
Trump ordered the U.S. drone strike that killed Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani, whom the United States regarded as a war criminal responsible for hundreds of American deaths.
Republicans and Democrats were united in calling Soleimani an enemy of the United States and a terrorist.
'This morning, Iran's master terrorist is dead,' said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in remarks on the Senate floor. 'The architect and chief engineer for the world's most active state sponsor of terrorism has been removed from the battlefield at the hand of the United States military.'
Schumer called Soleimani a 'notorious terrorist,' and added: 'No one should shed a tear over his death.'
But as Republicans celebrated what they described as Trump's decisive action, Democrats criticized the president's order to act unilaterally while expressing grave concern that this action would move the United States closer to an in trac table war with Iran. 
'No matter how good it may feel that Qasem Soleimani is no longer alive, he likely will end up being more dangerous to the United States, our troops and our allies, as a martyr than as a living, breathing military adversary,' said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).
Trump, in brief remarks Friday afternoon about the attack, said he targeted Soleimani to 'stop a war,' not to start one.
Presidents typically inform the so-called Gang of Eight "" the House speaker and minority leader, the Senate majority and minority leaders, and the chairmen and ranking minority-party members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees "" about high-level military operations.
Top Democratic leaders in Congress received no advance notification of the strike, aides said. Pelosi spoke to Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper after the attack for about 13 minutes, said an aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly.
'I'm a member of the Gang of Eight, which is typically briefed in advance of operations of this level of significance. We were not,' Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor, adding that the administration must be 'asked probing questions not from your inner and often insulated circle, but from others, particularly Congress, which forces an administration before it acts to answer very serious questions.'
It was unclear which congressional leaders were given advance notice of the strike. 
McConnell said only that he had spoken to the defense secretary and was arranging a classified briefing for all senators early next week, but he provided no details on when he first learned about the strike.
Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump ally, said Friday morning on Fox News that he was 'briefed about the potential operation when I was down in Florida' and appreciated 'being brought into the orbit.'
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) posted a photo on Instagram of himself and Trump at the president's Mar-a-Lago estate late Thursday, though it was not clear whether he, too, was briefed ahead of time.
McCarthy praised the killing of Soleimani as a 'statement to those seeking to attack America.' Trump, McCarthy said, had responded appropriately to violence by Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, including an attempt to storm the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
'In a display of resolve and strength, we struck the leader of those attacking our sovereign U.S. territories,' he said. 
Most Democrats focused their ire on Trump's unilateral action that they said could propel America into another conflict in the Middle East, yet Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) directed a more personal blow at Trump. 
'The Occupant was JUST impeached for abuse of power for political gain - now he is leading us to the brink of war because he believes it will help his re-election. We are sick of endless wars. Congress has the sole authority to declare war and we must deescalate. #NoWarWithIran,' Pressley tweeted.
Many of Trump's possible Democratic opponents in the presidential election also offered stern rebukes of Trump's handling of foreign policy. 
Calling the strike against Soleimani an assassination, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted that the United States was 'on the brink of yet another war in the Middle East.' She added: 'We're here because a reckless president, his allies, and his administration have spent years pushing us here.'
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called it a 'dangerous escalation,' and former vice president Joe Biden said in a statement that Trump 'just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox.'
In New Hampshire, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, who was an intelligence officer in Afghanistan, echoed many congressional Democrats who have wondered what the strategy is now. 'If we have learned nothing else from the Middle East, in the last 20 years, it's that taking out a bad guy is not a good idea unless you're ready for what comes next,' Buttigieg said. 
In Iowa, Sanders condemned Trump's action and emphasized his long record of opposing many U.S. military interventions abroad, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq. 
 'It gives me no pleasure to tell you at this moment we face a similar crossroads fraught with danger,' he said, adding that Trump's decision 'now puts us on the path to another war, potentially one that could be even worse than before.'

It was a sight to behold: a former vice president, two senators and a former mayor on a stage in New Hampshire a week ago, arguing over the impossible. Would Sen. Bernie Sanders deliver Medicare-for-all immediately, as he promised to do? Would doing so double the federal budget, as former vice president Joe Biden countered? Should they maybe go with Medicare-for-all-who-want-it, as former mayor Pete Buttigieg suggested? It didn't exactly roll off the tongue, but he has said it would put the United States on a 'glide path' to something he called 'a Medicare-for-all environment.' And what of the fact, raised by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, that Buttigieg tweeted a pledge two years ago to 'indubitably' support Medicare-for-all? 
Given what actually happens in the nation's capital these days, the men and women on the stage may as well have been arguing over the price of unicorn at the local market and how they'd cook it. Set against the current political backdrop, the elaborate policy debates among the candidates seeking the Democratic nomination (Will college be free for everyone, or for everyone but the rich kids? Would a tax on wealth over $50 million be a flat tax or a progressive tax?) feel increasingly delusional. 
It's not just because President Trump, an incumbent in a strong economy, stands a good chance of winning a second term. Even if one of the Democratic candidates were to beat him in November, they would become president, not emperor. As such, they'd have to deal with the Senate, an institution where fast and sweeping legislation is difficult to pass in any scenario, to say nothing of one dominated by Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Using tactics that push the limits of what's acceptable, he has transformed the chamber from the 'cooling saucer' the framers envisioned to a Sub-Zero freezer, a place where 300 bills passed by House Democrats don't even merit debate, let alone votes, even with the insurance policy of Trump's veto. 
It's healthy to debate policy, but Democrats aren't doing it in a vacuum. Research shows that contentious primaries hamper a party's performance in the general election. Candidates are bickering about blue-sky proposals "" with Sanders supporters destroying backsliders, Biden invoking segregationists to insist that legislative compromise works and Buttigieg going after Biden for his vote to invade Iraq 17 years ago "" but they're having a semantic argument. The stalemate moots their differences. The next Democratic president will be lucky to seat a Supreme Court nominee. In a climate of such vicious and total partisan obstruction, the only real issue is electability. 

Hashing out policy differences within a party can be a good and important process. A president can implement many policy changes by executive fiat, especially in the realms of immigration and law enforcement (as Trump has amply demonstrated). A president can also create change by interpreting existing law and choosing what to emphasize through Cabinet appointments and regulation. Spelling out where you stand on, say, health care in the primary race is an important signal to voters of a candidate's priorities and how she would administer the Department of Health and Human Services. 
Intra-party arguments also help generate ideas for the future. Proposals that at first seem outlandish often become orthodoxy later. 'When you read conservative magazines when they're out of power in the 1960s, they're having all kinds of arcane ideological battles about crazy things like privatizing Social Security,' says Seth Cotlar, a historian at Willamette University. 'And people are saying: 'Are you crazy? That's never going to happen!' And they're right in that they're not going to happen then. But then, in 2004, President George W. Bush proposed privatizing Social Security. If we look at politics not as what's going to happen next year but how do you build popular support and awareness for ideas, that takes a really long time.'
None of that is relevant today. McConnell was a big, beautiful wall long before Trump showed up. The man stole a Supreme Court seat from a Democratic president in 2016 under a flimsy pretext "" it would be unfair to confirm a justice in an election year, he said "" but now says openly that he wouldn't apply such logic if Trump wanted to fill a court vacancy this year. He's not going to alter his winning strategy by casting aside his stupendously successful cynicism for a President Klobuchar.
Fine, you might say. Democrats have to win the Senate and the presidency and keep the House. If they do, then they'll be justified in haggling over the intricacies of the Green New Deal. Set aside that projections show Republicans keeping their Senate majority in November. Set aside the fact that a Democratic takeover in the chamber would probably constitute just 50 blue senators plus a possible tiebreaking vote from a Democratic vice president. Even control of the chamber, political scientists say, wouldn't guarantee an easy legislative path for liberal lawmakers. 'If it's not Mitch McConnell, it's Joe Manchin,' says Dan Hopkins, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, referring to the conservative Democratic senator from West Virginia, where Trump is wildly popular. 'If it's not Joe Manchin, it's [Arizona Sen.] Kyrsten Sinema. Even if the Democrats were to take the Senate, they would be limited by their own most centrist members. Maybe they have 50 seats, but they're only going to pass what their entire caucus votes for.'
Controlling both chambers of Congress still wouldn't stop Republicans from wielding a tremendous amount of power through the filibuster, which takes 60 votes to break through. And McConnell would surely devise other creative stalling and blocking maneuvers. 'Under the last two Democratic administrations with unified government, Republicans put up more opposition than most out-of-power parties tend to be able to do,' says Princeton political scientist Frances Lee, recalling that Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama had the luxury of Democratic control of Congress in the first years of their first terms, and Republicans still managed to block much of their legislative agendas. During Clinton's first term, Republicans in the 103rd Congress thwarted a bill that would have protected striking workers from retaliation and another that would have provided some public financing for political campaigns. During Obama's first two years, the GOP blocked a measure that would have strengthened disclosure requirements for political donations; significantly weakened the Dodd-Frank regulations of the banking sector just as it was threatening to sink the entire economy; and (ironically) nixed Democrats' proposals to give tax incentives to companies that bring jobs back from overseas. Now, when polarization and partisanship are at still higher levels, Lee says, 'you could certainly expect a solid wall of opposition' from Republicans. 
What about Biden's theory that, without Trump and his divisive rhetoric, Republicans will again work across the aisle, just as they did when Biden was a jaunty young senator from Delaware? 'With Trump gone, you're going to begin to see things change,' he said last summer. 'Because these folks know better. They know this isn't what they're supposed to be doing.' Surely a moderate in the White House could find a way to get Republicans on board with, say, student loan forgiveness, right? But today, 'Republicans have no incentive to work with Democrats,' says Julia Azari, a political scientist at Marquette University. 'The 20th-century grand-coalition model is increasingly unlikely in today's environment.' Because local elections have become highly nationalized, because liberals and conservatives live in different, non-intersecting informational universes, because Republicans have become viciously good at threatening dissenters with primary challenges (or physical harm) and because the president has become such a potent and all-encompassing political and cultural symbol, there is little cause these days for senators to vote with a president of the other party. 

In other words, Democratic primary candidates and their supporters can fight all they want about pie-in-the-sky policy proposals, but they'll sooner get some roast unicorn than see Medicare-for-all enacted next year. Which is why you can vote for Sanders even if you oppose Medicare-for-all, and why Elizabeth Warren's backers can easily give their support to moderate Buttigieg even if they don't love everything he's said on the debate stage. 
The policy stakes are lower than voters believe, but the focus on them is much higher. In a 2016 study that examined the impact of divisive primaries, political scientists Alexander Fouirnaies and Andrew B. Hall found that the longer and more contentious a nominating process, the worse the party performs in November. 'Divisive primaries exert a substantial penalty on parties in the general election,' they wrote. They found that the negative effect was amplified the higher up the food chain you go: The more national and high-profile the office, the greater the eventual penalty. The most damaging kind of primary, they found, was the kind in which ideological purity is at stake. In other words, this one.
There's a possible bright spot, though, according to Princeton historian Julian Zelizer. 'Most moments of a lot of legislating happen when no one expects them to happen, and it happens in very difficult environments,' he told me. In 1961, when a naive and bright-eyed John F. Kennedy proposed a thing called Medicare, it was deemed preposterous. When Lyndon B. Johnson took over after his assassination, Congress was gridlocked on seemingly everything. But the upswell of the civil rights movement and the 1964 electoral sweep changed the equation; a year later, Medicare became law. During the first year of Obama's presidency, a financial crisis, disillusionment with Bush-era Republican policies and the dramatic election of the country's first black president gave Obama an opening to pass something as ambitious as the Affordable Care Act. Despite everything that would come later "" Merrick Garland, Obama nominees literally dying while waiting for McConnell's Senate to confirm them "" 'it was a unique set of factors that created this little window that closed pretty quickly,' Zelizer explains. 
For that little window to open at all, though, Democrats need to stop tearing each other down over the details and focus on making sure this moment doesn't completely pass them by.

For the Fox News journalist coveringthe presidential campaign, asking candidates questions can be a challenge


DES MOINES "" The day Joe Biden announced his candidacy for president, Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy showed up at the wrong place.
Having no contacts at the Biden campaign, Doocy took his cameraman and producer to Biden's house in Wilmington, Del., only to have a neighbor inform them that the former vice president wasn't home.
'I looked at Twitter and saw some other reporters tweeting that he was going to make the announcement at the train station,' Doocy recalled recently. He rushed over to the station and caught the moment.
His first question for the 2020 candidate: 'If you're the best choice for the Democrats in 2020, why didn't President Obama endorse you?'
'I asked him not to endorse,' answered Biden. Fox News hosts replayed the answer, and others mocked it, throughout the day. 
For Doocy, who is one of the reporters Fox has covering the Democrats, the story is an example of how he and his team have to be creative on the campaign trail, since none of the candidates really seem to want to talk to him.
It is also a story about the tense dance that goes on between Fox News and the Democrats, sometimes needing one another and sometimes disdaining one another.
Doocy's reporting on the 2020 race is just one chapter in the decades-long fraught tale of Fox News and the Democratic Party, one littered with the cable channel's enthusiastic embrace of the story of Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky; and its relentless depiction of the Benghazi embassy attack as a failure of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; the segments it aired questioning Barack Obama's birthplace; allowing its commentators to voice conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich; and, of course, there was the time that a then-anchor said she wanted kids to know that Santa was white not black.
All of that rolls down to Doocy, standing in a parking lot in the January cold, waiting to yell a question.
At nearly 6-foot-5, the 32-year-old stands out in what political reporters breezily call a 'gaggle,' the disorganized question-and-answer session that politicians sometimes grant reporters. Doocy's deep baritone carries, too, and sometimes that is enough, he says, to catch a candidate's attention.
Doocy has been assigned to cover the Democratic field writ large, and he was on the road for much of 2019, crisscrossing the country to report on whichever Democratic presidential candidate felt significant in the moment. He will eventually cover the party's nominee in the general election against President Trump.
Doocy's father is the longtime 'Fox - Friends' host Steve Doocy, who is tall and blond like his son. These days, when spotted together, they are sometimes mistaken for brothers. The two are close, and Peter Doocy, who was born in Washington, D.C., and raised in New Jersey, speaks glowingly of his father.
Between 2015 and 2018, Peter Doocy filled in three times for his father on weekends when the show was short-staffed. But since the midterm elections, the younger Doocy has been solely occupied with political reporting for the network. (A Fox spokeswoman says he was a registered Democrat, but currently has no party affiliation because he's covering the campaigns.) 
Peter Doocy has only ever worked at Fox News, and in the canon of Political Media Personalities, Doocy and his father can feel like they are Fox's version of Tim and Luke Russert for the Trump era.
'Where the other networks can count on somebody among the ranks nailing or landing a sit-down interview with these top-tier Democrats, for whatever reason, these candidates have decided they don't want to do sit-downs with Fox,' Doocy said at a campaign event for Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg in Des Moines, just days before the Iowa caucuses. 
'Sorry to interrupt,' said Doocy's public relations handler, who reminded him of the multiple Fox News town-hall events at which Fox News anchors such as Chris Wallace and Bret Baier have hosted Democratic candidates. 'So it's not like we don't get the candidates.'
Doocy corrected himself: 'I should have said 'some of the candidates.' . . . And so that doesn't mean that we should not try to get them.' If that means figuring out where a candidate's car is waiting for a couple hours outside an event, he'll do that. 
'Our bosses never told me, 'You need to go get Joe Biden or else we're not going to get it.' But if they're going to assign me to the Democratic field and we have the ability to be mobile, why not go try? And so we've had some luck.'


In March 2019, the Democratic National Committee announced it would exclude Fox News Channel from televising any of its candidate debates during the 2019-2020 cycle. DNC Chairman Thomas Perez cited an article in the New Yorker that outlined the network's close ties to Donald Trump as a reason for the decision.
But Fox News hasn't hosted a Democratic primary debate since 2004. The channel lost a planned debate in 2007, after its late co-founder Roger Ailes made a crack about then-Sen. Barack Obama's name, deliberately mixing it up with Osama bin Laden's. 'It is true that Barack Obama is on the move. I don't know if it's true that President Bush called [Pakistani President Pervez] Musharraf and said, 'Why can't we catch this guy?' ' Ailes said in a speech before an industry trade group that year. The DNC canceled that debate, but in 2016 Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders agreed to participate in a town-hall-style debate on Fox News moderated by chief political anchor Bret Baier. (Chris Wallace moderated a general-election presidential debate between Clinton and Trump during the 2016 race, the first time for a Fox News personality.)
In the wake of the DNC decision last year, Fox News injected the network into the primary race through a series of high-profile town hall events that several Democratic candidates agreed to participate in. Some, such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, said they would not be part of a Fox event. Warren called Fox a 'hate-for-profit racket.'
But others, including Sens. Bernie Sanders and Kirsten Gillibrand and former mayors Julián Castro and Pete Buttigieg, have participated in Fox News town halls. Sanders's event was the highest-rated town hall of the cycle, with nearly 2.6-million viewers. According to Nielsen Media Research, Fox News just marked 18-years as the country's top-rated cable news network, and whatever their objections to Fox News programming, some of the candidates want access to that audience.
Lis Smith, Buttigieg's communications director, has said that their decision to engage with Fox News's town halls derives from their belief that 'you have to reach out and go places that are uncomfortable,' in a presidential campaign. When he appeared on 'Fox News Sunday' in late January, Democratic candidate Andrew Yang told Wallace that he thought the DNC's decision not to have a primary debate on Fox News channel was 'a mistake.'
While many Democrats regularly appear on Fox News, it is indeed uncomfortable for some of them. Jennifer Palmieri, who was Hillary Clinton's communications director during her 2016 presidential run, recalled a meeting that she and campaign chair John Podesta had with Fox News executives as part of their tour of the networks to discuss concerns about Clinton coverage.
'I felt that they were still reeling from Trump winning in the primaries and that they were wavering between being dubious about him and doubling down,' she recalled in an interview. Fox News assigned a veteran national security correspondent, Jennifer Griffin, to the Clinton campaign, and Palmieri said she saw that as a 'deliberate move on their part that I welcomed, to show us they were serious.'
But overall, Palmieri said, Griffin's reports were wedged in between other programming that Palmieri said 'was atrocious. They lived off the Clinton Foundation, her emails, and they picked up every utterance Trump made about her health,' long before her bout with pneumonia caused her to collapse during a 9/11 anniversary service. Palmieri, who is currently an MSNBC contributor, said that for years, Clinton was Fox News's 'cash cow,' and that 'they less covered her than programmed her,' meaning that she was an object of derision and entertainment more than she was a news story.
Bret Baier, the host of 'Special Report With Bret Baier' and the channel's chief political anchor, defended Fox's coverage, saying: 'We are in the spotlight and we have always been. Listen, I get it. We are different from the pack, and people paint us with a broad brush, but I speak for the news shows and the election coverage and we bend over backwards to be fair.'
He said he met with Palmieri a number of times to try to get more Clinton surrogates on Fox News and always had a good relationship with her.
When Fox engages with Democrats on air, it often draws the ire of President Trump. After Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) appeared on Fox News to discuss impeachment, Trump tweeted that it was 'really pathetic how @FoxNews is trying to be so politically correct' and noted that 'Dems wouldn't even give Fox their low ratings debates,' and then asked, 'what the hell has happened to @FoxNews. Only I know! Chris Wallace and others should be on Fake News CNN or MSDNC.' Trump wrote that such coverage would be the end of the network.



Doocy got his start in journalism as a college student at Villanova. During the 2008 presidential campaign, John McCain was visiting campus soon after Hillary Clinton had been featured on the front page of the local paper drinking shots with Pennsylvania residents. Doocy took the microphone and asked McCain if he thought Clinton was 'hitting the sauce' because she was so behind in the polls. He then asked McCain if he would take a shot with him. 
Doocy's ability to crack wise and create a viral moment has served him well at Fox News. Early on, Doocy asked Biden how many times he had spoken to his son, Hunter Biden, about his business dealings. Biden shot back that he never discussed them, and then jabbed his finger toward Doocy's face and scolded him to 'ask the right questions.' Trump, not Biden, was the one who should be interrogated, Biden said.
Doocy said he was 'surprised' at Biden's reaction, which was cheered back in campaign headquarters as a sign of Biden's strength and viewed in other quarters as evidence of Doocy hitting a nerve.
'It had been a couple of days since the news had broken that Hunter Biden was somebody President Trump was talking about in the Oval Office with a foreign leader. But nobody had asked Joe Biden about that. I was expecting that he would have a prepared answer when I asked him. . . . Because I know if somebody asked my dad, 'How many times have you spoken to your son about his business dealings?,' he'd probably say 'five times a week.' So I was surprised with how enthusiastic he was. . . . That is the only time that I can remember that a candidate has had his finger in my face.'
More recently, in November, Doocy asked Biden about the child Hunter Biden fathered out of wedlock. Biden responded that it was a private matter and that he had no comment. 'But only you would ask that,' he said, his mouth stretching to a hard smile. 'You're a good man, a good man. Classy.'
While Biden can appear frustrated by the questions, his campaign has never cut off Doocy's access.
'There were people at the beginning who said you are giving this job to him just because he's Steve Doocy's son,' said Baier, 'So that was a hurdle for him, and he went way above that hurdle. He asks pointed questions, and every night, I know he will have a solid piece on the day's big events.'
Fellow correspondents on the trail note how frequently Doocy asks about Hunter Biden or John Bolton or other topics that appear suited to the Fox audience, rather than drilling into policy questions. But he creates viral moments. Doocy said that other reporters are always friendly, though 'there have definitely been times when we've shown up places and seen social gatherings we weren't invited to.' He is entirely untroubled by this.
Cherie Grzech, vice president of Fox News's Washington bureau, said that Doocy asks questions 'everybody wants to ask but is afraid to' and that he 'is very involved in asking the question of the day that will drive the political conversation.'
Because of the early-morning schedule, Steve Doocy was always at home when his son and two daughters got out of school.
'We could wait for him to wake up from his nap and then talk to him about whatever big thing was going on in the news,' Peter Doocy said. He always felt that his dad 'had the best job in the world.'
Would he want to follow his father's path to a seat on the 'Fox - Friends' couch?
'If that's something that they think I would be good at at some point, then that could be a fun thing to do. But right now, I have to worry about what exit Joe Biden is going to go out of!'

Infrastructure package, more tax cuts unlikely to pass in divided Congress 
President Trump's top economists predict the U.S. economy will not grow at a rate of 3 percent or higher this year unless Congress enacts a major infrastructure package and additional tax cuts.
Passage of legislation addressing either area appears unlikely in the run-up to the presidential election because Democrats control the House of Representatives. Instead, many economists forecast that the economy will grow around 2 percent this year.
In the annual Economic Report of the President released on Thursday, Trump's Council of Economic Advisers predicts that if the president and Congress do not make further policy changes, the U.S. economy will grow at a 2.4-percent annual pace this year and at a 2.3 percent pace in 2021. That kind of growth is well below what Trump promised and similar to what occurred under President Barack Obama.
The report is the latest acknowledgment by the Trump administration that the economy is unlikely to grow at 3 percent or faster, a goal Trump has yet to achieve in his presidency.
The economy grew 2.3 percent last year, 2.9 percent in 2018 and 2.4 percent in 2017, according to the Commerce Department.
 Trump's large tax cut and his increase in federal spending lifted growth in 2018, but it has since moderated, especially after the president escalated his trade wars. Business leaders were spooked by Trump's fondness for tariffs on goods from China and other nations and pulled back sharply on investments in factories and equipment, creating a drag on growth.
To achieve faster growth, Trump's Council of Economic Advisers says, there would need to be more deregulation, immigration reform, passage of an infrastructure plan, more trade deals, incentives to get more Americans working and permanent tax cuts for American households (the corporate tax cuts that Republicans passed at the end of 2017 are permanent, but the individual tax cuts are set to expire after 2025). Most of these policy changes require Congress's help, an unlikely scenario as long as Democrats control at least one chamber of Congress.
Many of the policy changes would also come with high price tags. Trump's economists predict that the federal deficit will top $1-trillion this year. The deficit has risen nearly 50 percent since Trump took office.
Still, growth at around 2-percent is likely to be enough to keep the economy healthy and keep businesses steadily adding jobs every month. Goldman Sachs predicts that the unemployment rate will fall this year to 3.25-percent, a level not seen in more than 65 years.
The vast majority of Americans say this is the best economy since the late 1990s. Independent voters and less-affluent voters are increasingly likely to give the economy high marks, which should help Trump as he seeks reelection.
'Growth has accelerated since the election in 2016, more than seven years into the recovery. This acceleration occurred despite monetary policies,' said Tomas Philipson, the acting head of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers.
The White House has repeatedly accused the Federal Reserve of hurting growth, although most economists say the central bank's interest rate cuts last year helped prevent a major slowdown.
Trump and top White House officials argued that the faster growth seen in 2018 would last, but many independent forecasters characterized it as a temporary sugar high from the stimulus measures. The White House also predicted a boom in business investment after the tax cuts, but that has not materialized. Business investment outside of home building shrank for much of last year.
'Initially, we saw a huge surge in investment. Once we got a renegotiation of trade agreements, we saw uncertainty in the market, and investment took a hit,' Philipson said.
Philipson predicted a jump in business investment this year, but that is likely to hinge on trade policy and better global growth. Last year brought the slowest global growth since the Great Recession, another factor making business leaders nervous. Many big banks foresee a rebound this year, but the novel coronavirus is causing a substantial drag on the Chinese economy that is spilling over to nations including Japan, South Korea and Singapore.
This latest White House economic forecast does not take into account the impact of the coronavirus.

Democratic candidates delve into conflict abroad, gender and health care in last faceoff before caucuses

DES MOINES "" A whittled-down field of Democratic presidential candidates on Tuesday focused on their shared disdain for President Trump and elaborated on a host of policy differences domestic and foreign in an Iowa presidential debate whose most animated moment turned on whether a woman could become president.
With the Democratic voting beginning in less than three weeks "" and knotted among a quartet of leading contenders "" the candidates differed over the suddenly topical decision of whether to commit troops abroad or remove them from the Middle East, their disparate views on trade deals and their starkly different proposals to remake the country's health-care industry.
Coming on the heels of President Trump's decision to kill Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the debate opened up with a relitigation of the war in Iraq, and a renewed discussion over how and whether the candidates would commit troops in the Middle East. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) committed to bringing combat troops home, while former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg pointed to his own experience in the military. Former vice president Joe Biden cast his experience in that office as invaluable, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) suggested Biden's vote in favor of the Iraq War was disqualifying.
'Joe and I listened to what Dick Cheney and George Bush and [Donald] Rumsfeld had to say,' Sanders said, speaking of the debate after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to give Bush authority to strike overseas. 'I thought they were lying. I didn't believe them for a moment. I took to the floor. I did everything I-could to prevent that war. Joe saw it differently.'
Biden, while focusing on the work he did during the Obama administration to wind down U.S. military involvement in Iraq, did not defend the vote. 
'It was a mistake to trust that they weren't going to go to war,' Biden said about the Bush administration's assurances in 2002. 'They said they were not going to go to war.'

The candidates agreed on the need to reduce the U.S. military footprint in Iraq and Afghanistan, though they differed slightly on timetables and other details. 
'No one has a solution and an endpoint. We need to get our combat troops out,' Warren said. 'They are not helping.' 
Biden and others struck a more nuanced note, arguing that Special Operations forces should remain in the region to guard against a resurgence of the Islamic State and to protect U.S. interests.
The former vice president also said he would not meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, with whom Trump met to-much-orchestrated drama but-with whom he has been unable to strike a deal on nuclear weapons. 
'No. Not now. I wouldn't meet with him without preconditions,' he said, blaming Trump for giving the North Korean legitimacy by meeting with him. 
He also noted that the leader had called him 'a rabid dog who should be beaten to death with a stick.'
'Other than that, you like him,' Sanders joked.
Gender politics, which subsumed the campaign in recent days, provided one of the sharpest exchanges of the night as Warren and Sanders clashed over whether Sanders said in a private 2018 meeting that a woman could not be elected against Trump in 2020.
Sanders denied the claim outright. 'Does anybody in their right mind believe that a woman can't be president?' Sanders said. 'I don't think anybody believes that.'
But Warren, as part of an apparent pivot to embrace her role as the highest-polling woman in the race, stuck to the claim she first made the day before the debate. 
'I disagreed,' she said of her conversation with Sanders in 2018. 'Bernie is my friend, and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie. But look, this question about whether or not a woman can be president has been raised and it's time for us to attack it head-on.'
She went on to divide the stage by gender, saying that she and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) were the only two candidates to have won all of their elections, while the men onstage had collectively lost 10 races. 
Klobuchar laughingly agreed, and later noted that she had an unbroken record of winning in areas similar to those in which Trump had defeated Hillary Clinton.
As the debate ended, Warren could be seen approaching Sanders but declining his offer of a handshake. They both appeared to be testy, Warren wringing her hands and Sanders making frequent gestures. 
The extended confrontation was remarkable, coming four years after the party selected Clinton as its first female nominee. Her loss to President Trump amid what many felt were misogynistic attacks helped energize women who came out for massive marches the day after he was inaugurated, helped fuel the election of record numbers of women to Congress and handed the House speaker's gavel back to Nancy Pelosi.
But Democratic anxiety over Trump, and whether he could defeat another woman, has been one of the looming questions over the primary contest for the-past year, asked everywhere from top party leaders to Democrats attending rallies in early states. 
Biden chimed into the discussion to argue that he alone had the longevity and the experience to knit together a coalition of the whole party. 
'I agree women can win,' Biden said, touting the number of female candidates he helped in 2018 and calling it 'the best group I've ever campaigned for in terms of competence.'
'But the real issue is who can bring the whole party together, represents all elements of the party,' he said. 'I would argue that in terms of endorsements around the country, endorsements, wherever we go, I am the one who has the broadest coalition of anyone running up here in this race.'
The debate came just 20 days before the Iowa caucuses, the results of which are likely to be pivotal in the 2020 nomination fight. 
The major Democratic candidates have gone all-in on the state, and with polls showing a multicandidate tie, with about 1-in 5 voters favoring Biden, Sanders and Buttigieg. Warren is close on their heels with 16-percent support, according to an average of two Iowa polls over the past week. 
The two other candidates on the stage, Klobuchar and the billionaire activist Tom Steyer, have been ranking in the single digits, well below the 15 percent threshold required by party rules-to acquire convention delegates. 
Steyer, who has gained ground in several new polls after a barrage of television ads, made one of his most aggressive arguments around the need to combat climate change. 
'We're going to come to the rescue of Americans who are in-trouble. But this is why climate is my number one priority,' he said. 'And I'm still shocked that I'm the only person on this stage who will say this: I would declare a state of emergency on day one.'
For several of the candidates onstage, the debate marked the final highlighted moment before the Senate impeachment trial diverts the nation's attention and demands their presence in Washington. While Warren, Sanders and Klobuchar will have to serve as jurors, Biden too 
could be roped into the proceedings; some Senate Republicans are seeking to force his son Hunter to testify about his activities in Ukraine when his father was vice president.
Biden said Tuesday night that he had no concern about his family being dragged into the Senate trial. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of either Biden, but it has been a topic the campaign has generally tried to avoid.
'It doesn't really matter whether he goes after me,' Biden said. 'I have got to be able not-only to fight but also to heal, and as president of the United States that's what I will attempt to do.'
Some of the debate reprised earlier such gatherings. For the seventh straight faceoff, the candidates cast different visions on health care, with Sanders continuing to push for Medicare-for-all, which would abolish the private health-care industry. 
'Again, I think it is much better to build on the Affordable Care Act,' Klobuchar said. 'And if you want to be practical and progressive at the same time and have a plan and not a pipe dream, you have to show how are you going to pay for it.'
Several of the candidates tried to address some of their shortcomings. 
Buttigieg responded to concerns in the party, shown in a recent Washington Post poll, that black voters do not support his campaign, even after they learn more about him.
'The black voters who know me best are supporting me,' Buttigieg said, before listing off several recent endorsements. 'The biggest mistake we can make is to take black votes for granted. And I never will.'
In the opening minutes of the debate, Sanders also tried to address the concerns that he is too divisive and wouldn't have enough appeal to a general electorate. 

'I am able to work with Republicans,' he said, citing unsuccessful legislation he co-sponsored with Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). 'I am able to bring people together to try to create a world where we solve conflicts over the negotiating table, not through military efforts.'

Alabama Republicans sent former attorney general Jeff Sessions's quest to return to the U.S. Senate into overtime Tuesday, putting him in a GOP primary runoff and on an uncertain path to victory against a political outsider.
Sessions, who spent 20 years in the Senate before joining the Trump administration in 2017, narrowly trailed former Auburn University football coach Tommy Tuberville - a result that defied several recent public polls that showed him leading Tuberville and other Republicans in the race. 
The Associated Press projected the two as advancing to the March 31 runoff.
Other Republicans, including Rep. Bradley Byrne and former state Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore, significantly trailed the leaders, leaving them on course to miss the runoff.
The race has attracted significant national attention for its importance in the battle to control the Senate - it is the GOP's best chance to wrest a seat from Democrats this year - and for Sessions's decision to enter the contest after an ignominious exit as attorney general in 2018.
Throughout the campaign, Sessions had to confront his difficult relationship with President Trump, who openly attacked him starting in 2017 when he decided to recuse himself from any role in the federal investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, paving the way for the appointment of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.
But Sessions attempted to remind voters of his early support for Trump's presidential ambitions and his role as an intellectual godfather of the anti-immigration, anti-free-trade governing agenda - even as Tuberville and Byrne cast themselves as more reliable supporters of the president.
Trump has so far remained silent on the race, and Republicans in both Alabama and Washington are speculating whether he might now get involved to block Sessions. 
""If it is a runoff, we don't know what will happen,"" Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) said this week. ""I would hope he wouldn't [get involved], but if he does, we'll see.""
Byrne took about a quarter of the vote, according to early returns. Moore, the GOP nominee in a 2017 special election in which allegations of his sexual misconduct toward young girls in the 1970s upended the race and paved the way for the surprise victory of Democrat Doug Jones, was in single digits.
The eventual Republican nominee is expected to have the upper hand over Jones in the reliably conservative state.
Meanwhile, in North Carolina, Democrats nominated a centrist favorite of national party leaders to take on GOP Sen. Thom Tillis in what promises to be a much more competitive race.
Cal Cunningham, a former state senator and Army veteran, outpolled state Sen. Erica Smith, who had campaigned on a more liberal platform that included supporting the Green New Deal climate plan.
Those views, which national leaders of both parties saw as troublesome in a swing-state general-election matchup, prompted a GOP super PAC affiliated with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to spend nearly $3 million boosting Smith's candidacy. Smith disavowed the GOP support, but Cunningham and allied groups boosted their own spending in turn - posting a combined $14 million in primary spending.
Incomplete returns showed Cunningham winning 57 percent of the vote with 99 percent of precincts reported.
The Alabama and North Carolina races were among several closely watched congressional primaries that could have significant implications for control of the Senate and the shape of each party.
Texas hosted another Senate primary of note, with five Democrats running credible campaigns for the chance to face three-term GOP Sen. John Cornyn later this year. 
Military veteran M.J. Hegar, who ran a strong but unsuccessful 2018 House campaign in a traditionally GOP district, had won the endorsement of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and appeared to qualify for a May 26 runoff. 
But it remained unclear late Tuesday which Democrat she would face: Labor organizer Cristina Tzintzún Ramirez, state Sen. Royce West and Houston City Council member Amanda Edwards were in a close contest for second place with about half of statewide precincts reported.
Also in Texas, two expensive and hotly contested House primaries tested the willingness of voters in both parties to reward pragmatism over ideological purity. 
In a South Texas district centered on the border town of Laredo, Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar faced a fierce challenge from Jessica Cisneros, a 26-year-old immigration lawyer who attracted support from key allies on the political left, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), as well as Emily's List, which backs female Democratic candidates who support abortion rights. 
The two campaigns and outside groups have combined for over $6 million in spending - an overwhelming tally for a largely rural, heavily Latino district - and Cisneros's challenge has caught the attention of other veteran incumbents who are facing more-liberal primary opponents.
With about a third of precincts reporting, Cuellar held a 10-point lead, and while a spokesman, Colin Strother, declared the campaign ""cautiously optimistic,"" he did not declare victory Tuesday.
Another intraparty challenge rocked a district 400 miles north, this one targeting GOP Rep. Kay Granger, a former Fort Worth mayor who has risen to become the top Republican on the House Appropriations Committee. Her handling of that role drew attacks from businessman Chris Putnam, who found common cause with the Club for Growth, the fiscally conservative national activist group that invested more than $1 million to oust Granger.
Granger, who won Trump's endorsement, was headed toward a roughly 20-point victory with 85 percent of precincts tallied Tuesday.
Trump's endorsement appeared to have less of an effect in another notable Texas House race: Former White House physician Ronny L. Jackson, backed by Trump, was in a distant second place with about one-third of precincts in the Panhandle-based 13th Congressional District reporting. He trailed cattle industry lobbyist Josh Winegarner, who has the backing of retiring Rep. Mac Thornberry (R). The two could meet in a May 26 runoff.
Several key House races in California were likely to remain unsettled Tuesday night - and the results could remain uncertain for weeks as state authorities continue counting mailed ballots that had to be postmarked by primary day. 
Among the highest-profile races was a special election in the 25th Congressional District north of Los Angeles to replace Democratic Rep. Katie Hill, who resigned last year after admitting to having a sexual relationship with a campaign aide.
Key Democratic groups coalesced behind Christy Smith, a member of the State Assembly, but she faced a liberal challenger in activist Cenk Uygur, as well as strong Republican competition from former congressman Steve Knight and businessman Mike Garcia - one of whom is expected to compete in a May 12 runoff against Smith.
Also running, but not expected to advance, is George Papadopoulos - a volunteer on the 2016 Trump campaign who became a key figure in the probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election and later pleaded guilty to making false statements to federal agents.
 In California's 50th Congressional District, north of San Diego, former Republican congressman Darrell Issa is hoping to return to the House two years after retiring in a neighboring district. He has been locked in a heated and nasty race with former San Diego City Council member Carl DeMaio for a spot in a likely runoff against Democrat Ammar Campa-Najjar, who fell short in his 2018 bid to unseat GOP Rep. Duncan D. Hunter. 
Hunter resigned from the House in January after admitting to a federal campaign finance felony. 
Other notable California contests include a couple of probable 2018 rematches: In the Central Valley's 10th District, former GOP representative David Valadao is hoping to reclaim the seat he held for three terms from Democratic Rep. TJ Cox. And in Orange County, former state legislator Young Kim is making a second attempt to beat Democratic Rep. Gil Cisneros after losing one of 2018's closest House races.
In California, the top two vote-getters advance to the general election, no matter what party.

President's tweet follows years-long feud with the senator, his nemesis
For a famously mild-mannered man whose worst cuss words are G-rated throwbacks like ""golly,"" Mitt Romney has a way of getting under President Trump's skin.
This time, the Republican senator from Utah did it by announcing a bit of good news amid the welter of scary developments during the pandemic: He has tested negative for the coronavirus.
""This is really great news! I am so happy I can barely speak,"" Trump tweeted Wednesday morning. ""He may have been a terrible presidential candidate and an even worse U.S. Senator, but he is a RINO, and I like him a lot!"" 
Beyond Trump's sarcasm about the health of the fellow Republican he considers a nemesis, the president succinctly referenced some of his biggest beefs with Romney. 

l He has disdain for Romney over losing the presidential election, handing Barack Obama a second term. If there is anyone who is a bigger thorn in the president's side than Romney, it's Obama. ""He blew it,"" Trump once said of Romney's candidacy.

l Trump remains furious that Romney was the lone Republican senator to vote to convict him on an impeachment count this year, although this was a mild outburst on that subject. Previously, Trump has called Romney ""a disgrace"" over the vote. Also ""a bad guy,"" a ""jealous, angry person,"" a ""pompous ass"" and a ""lowlife.""

l The insult ""RINO,"" or ""Republican In Name Only,"" was meant to dismiss one of the president's few prominent Republican detractors as a Democratic sympathizer.
The comment also underscored a defining aspect of Trump's presidency, even during a national crisis when he is being called on to unite the nation - he holds a grudge and very rarely forgets any real or perceived slight.
A spokeswoman for Romney said Wednesday that the senator declined to comment on the president's tweet. 
Romney said Tuesday that he plans to remain in quarantine for the 14 days, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""as the test does not rule out the onset of symptoms"" later on. 
Romney announced Sunday that he was entering quarantine because he had been in close contact with Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) in the days before Paul announced a positive test result.
Trump tweeted support for Paul, who was widely criticized for remaining at the Capitol while potentially contagious, but he greeted news of Romney's quarantine with what sounded like a wisecrack.
""Romney's in isolation?"" Trump said during an exchange with a reporter on Sunday. ""Gee, that's too bad. Go ahead.""
""Do I detect sarcasm there, sir?"" the reporter asked.
""No, none whatsoever,"" Trump replied.
The bad blood between Trump and Romney dates at least to 2012, when Trump said the election was Republicans' to lose and then blamed Romney for doing just that. Trump had endorsed Romney after changing his own party registration to Republican.
Romney shrugged off the critique, but his low opinion of Trump seemed to harden.
By March 2016, when Trump's own long-shot presidential run had become a juggernaut, some moderate Republicans urged Romney to run again. Instead, Romney threw his support to Trump rivals and delivered a damning assessment of Trump's fitness for office.
""Think of Donald Trump's personal qualities. The bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, the absurd third-grade theatrics,"" Romney said.
Speaking in his home state of Utah, Romney condemned Trump as crass, bombastic, ill-informed and, perhaps most insulting to the New York real estate mogul, a business failure who ""inherited his business, he didn't create it.""
""And whatever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there's Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks and Trump Mortgage,"" Romney said, listing off several Trump-branded flops. ""A business genius he is not.""
Trump dismissed it all as sour grapes from a ""loser"" and rubbed Romney's nose in it as more and more Republicans threw in with Trump. 
Romney eventually endorsed Trump, and congratulated his victory. Both men suggested all was forgiven when Romney tried out for a job as Trump's first secretary of state. 
Trump's public show of auditioning and then rejecting Romney seemed to many to be the outsider president-elect delivering the comeuppance he thought Romney the insider deserved.
Nonetheless, Trump warmly endorsed Romney for his 2018 Senate run, marking their second and perhaps final reconciliation. By 2019, Trump was regularly denouncing Romney as a party traitor, telling audiences that Democrats ""don't have a Mitt Romney in their midst.""
Romney had telegraphed his impeachment vote, which he called a matter of conscience.
He invoked his Mormon faith and the Constitution as he called the decision the hardest of his political life. 
""The president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust,"" Romney said Feb. 5 as he announced his vote. 
Romney said he knew he would be ""vehemently denounced"" for the vote, including from Trump himself.
Indeed, Trump has complained about Romney ever since. Speaking to the Conservative Political Action Conference on Feb. 29, Trump held out the senator from Utah as a turncoat. 
""The Republicans stuck together, except Romney, of course,"" Trump said, egging on a round of boos from the audience. ""You know, Romney. Lowlife. Lowlife."" 
Romney has now eclipsed the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) as the object of an intraparty presidential grudge. Trump considered McCain a heretic for his 2017 vote on health care and insulted the long-serving Republican even as McCain faced death from brain cancer.
Part of what Trump seems to find galling in both men was a reputation for heroism or rectitude that has eluded Trump himself, said professor Claire Finkelstein, director of the University of Pennsylvania Law School's Center for Ethics and the Rule of Law.
""Mitt Romney has been a vocal spokesman for ethical conduct while in office, but also has been a model of that kind of conduct. It is part of Trump's attack on values to try and degrade any individual who demonstrates that kind of leadership,"" at what Trump sees as his own expense, Finkelstein said.
Trump said admiration for McCain's service in the Vietnam War was misplaced because McCain had been captured by the North Vietnamese. Trump said he prefers ""heroes who don't get captured.""
Trump drew predictable tut-tutting Wednesday, with critics on Twitter calling his treatment of Romney's test results insensitive and small. Some comments noted that Romney's wife, Ann Romney, is at greater risk from the virus because she has multiple sclerosis.
""While Mitt Romney is self-quarantined in the middle of a pandemic, Trump hurls public insults at him,"" tweeted former federal prosecutor and CNN commentator Renato Mariotti. ""That's not just beneath the office of the presidency. It's beneath the basic standard for how any of us should treat other human beings.""
Finkelstein said Trump is missing an opportunity to earn the kind of plaudits he seems to resent when applied to Romney.
Trump could ""unify the country and engage in a kind of presidential moment"" by wishing Romney well.
""He would have had a moment there to unify the country around this crisis and to show his moral leadership in doing so.""

Former national security adviser willing to testify in impeachment trial 
John Bolton scrambled Senate Republicans' impeachment strategy on Monday, declaring his willingness to testify and upping the pressure on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his party to summon the former national security adviser as a witness in President Trump's trial.
Bolton last fall rebuffed House impeachment investigators' entreaties to testify about his concerns about Trump's demands that Ukraine investigate his political rivals as the administration delayed military aid. Bolton's surprise announcement complicated the political calculus for McConnell's no-witness strategy and appeared to increase the likelihood of additional testimony that could embarrass the president.
'Since my testimony is once again at issue, I have had to resolve the serious competing issues as best I could, based on careful consideration and study,' Bolton said. 'I have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify.'
The announcement was a major boost for congressional Democrats, who have delayed transmission of the articles of impeachment for over two weeks while seeking guarantees about the scope of the trial, including witnesses. Democrats have pressed for testimony from Bolton, as well as acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and several other of the president's men. 
At least one Senate Republican, Mitt Romney (Utah), agreed Monday that it was imperative that Bolton testify, while Democrats insisted that Republicans' refusal to allow him to tell his story would be tantamount to a 'coverup.'
Bolton has firsthand knowledge of internal White House deliberations, and according to testimony in the House probe, he reacted angrily to Trump's pressure on Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, now a 2020 candidate, and a debunked theory about Ukraine interfering in the 2016 election. 
 The Bolton announcement came as lawmakers returned to Washington from a two-week congressional recess, with leaders still at loggerheads over the parameters of the impeachment trial. 
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has been holding the two charges "" abuse of power and obstruction of Congress "" in hopes of strengthening Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer's hand in negotiating with McConnell for witnesses. Bolton's statement seemed to create a shift in leverage in Democrats' favor.
'Will the United States Senate conduct a fair impeachment trial of the president of the United States? Will we search for all of the facts, or will we look for a coverup, a sham trial, on one of the most important powers the Founding Fathers gave the American people?' Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the Senate floor. 
McConnell (R-Ky.), for his part, made clear that once the articles are transmitted to the Senate, he will move ahead on the first phase of the trial "" opening arguments "" without a decision on witnesses. 
'That was good enough for President Clinton, so it ought to be good enough for President Trump,' McConnell said in remarks on the Senate floor, citing the impeachment trial 21 years ago. 'Fair is fair.'
Two moderate Senate Republicans "" Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) "" have said they're open to hearing from witnesses. And Romney threw his support behind calling Bolton, increasing the likelihood that moderates may force McConnell's hand eventually.
'I would like to be able to hear from John Bolton,' the 2012 GOP presidential nominee told reporters. 'What the process is to make that happen, I don't have an answer for you. The leaders are trying to negotiate that process right now. . . . What's important is that we hear from him.'
Still, the same centrist Republican senators signaled that they were willing to start the trial without a deal for Bolton's testimony, keeping McConnell in firm control for now as he works to delay any decision on additional witnesses until after House Democrats present their case and the president's defense team rebuts it. 
'There are a number of witnesses that may well be appropriate for the stage three, of which he would certainly be one,' Collins said of Bolton. But she also added: 'It's very difficult to decide [witnesses] until we go through the first two stages.'
When Bolton emerged as a potential witness in the fall, he indicated that he was willing to defy the White House and testify in the House impeachment inquiry "" but only if issued a subpoena and if a federal court cleared the way. His statement Monday that he would participate in the proceedings without a court decision marked a shift in his position.
The Bolton development comes just days after McConnell used the holiday break to persuade Trump to back a quick, no-witness trial. The president, known for his scorched-earth approach, had wanted to use the proceedings to go after Biden. 
But McConnell, according to aides who were not authorized to speak publicly, explained that if Trump called his own witnesses, Democrats would insist on theirs. 'Mutual assured destruction,' he called it.
The major question for McConnell is whether he can hold the line "" particularly after Bolton said he's ready to tell his story. A subpoena requires a simple majority of 51 votes, and Democrats would need just four Republicans to break ranks.
Bolton's testimony could be damaging to Trump politically, according to a person close to him who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations. People familiar with Bolton's tenure at the National Security Council expect him to corroborate other impeachment witnesses' testimony that he was aghast that U.S. military aid was being held back as the president and his allies pressured Ukraine to open politically advantageous probes, according to people familiar with his views.
 In recent months, Bolton has confided to friends that he was deeply troubled by his time at the White House and the president's behavior, but he has declined to offer many details, the person said, adding that Bolton's support for Trump's hard line on Iran would not influence any possible testimony.
'Those are different issues. One doesn't affect the other,' the person said. 
Still, other Bolton associates have privately said that he wants a future in Republican politics and does not want to be seen as a turncoat on Trump or someone who is trying to ingratiate himself with the president's critics. They noted, for instance, that his statement Monday came from his political action committee's office as an example of how he's trying to build out his operation even as he deals with legal issues.
Additionally, people close to him note that Bolton also has an expansive view of presidential power. As a result, it is unclear whether he would testify that he believes Trump overstepped his constitutional authority in his dealings with Ukraine.
Democrats have sought Bolton's testimony for months, particularly after former National Security Council aides told impeachment investigators of his concerns regarding Trump's conduct toward Ukraine. Russian affairs director Fiona Hill testified that Bolton exploded in frustration after a White House meeting July 10 in which Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, pressed Ukrainian officials to open investigations into Biden and the 2016 campaign. 
Bolton, Hill said, equated the discussions with a 'drug deal' "" and told her to immediately report it to John Eisenberg, the top lawyer for the National Security Council. 
Additionally, William B. Taylor Jr., then the acting ambassador to Ukraine, testified that Bolton was 'very sympathetic' when he expressed concerns to the then-national security adviser that military aid to Ukraine was being leveraged for political favors. Bolton recommended that Taylor send a 'first person' cable to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to document the issue. And Taylor later heard from other State Department officials that Bolton was working to get the aid to Ukraine. 
Senate Republicans appeared divided on the possibility of hearing from Bolton. 
Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.), who is close to McConnell, told Guy Benson, political editor for conservative Townhall.com, that Bolton's testimony could be 'helpful to the president' and that he'd like to know more about what he'd say. Other Republicans, including Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), suggested that the Senate should consider only the evidence gathered in the House, thereby precluding Bolton.
'I just don't think we're under any obligation to consider anything outside the record of what was created for the articles they sent us,' Rubio told reporters.
Democratic officials last week predicted Pelosi would deliver the articles to the Senate as soon as this week, though the speaker has kept her plans close and her office has refused to detail her timeline.
 Sen. Josh Hawley (Mo.) and several other Republicans introduced a resolution Monday to dismiss the impeachment articles without a trial since Pelosi has yet to deliver the documents, though it appears unlikely to get a vote.-

Rep. Joe Kennedy called fellow Democrat Edward J. Markey a 'good senator' who has made significant contributions to Massachusetts and the nation, but the congressman insisted Tuesday that he should replace the incumbent in the U.S. Senate.
In their first televised debate, the two were in agreement on a range of issues, including ensuring a pathway to citizenship for immigrants, a more equitable criminal justice system, fighting climate change and support for Medicare-for-all. They both said President Trump represents an existential threat and must be replaced by a Democrat in November.
But Kennedy, 39, argued that the nation was in a crisis in the Trump era and that simply voting the 'right way' was insufficient. He said the next U.S. senator to represent Massachusetts must leverage 'every ounce of power' for major change.
'For this election, this time around, everything we care about is on the line,' Kennedy said, expressing support for ending the Senate filibuster and doing away with the electoral college. 
Markey, 73, who served in the House before Kennedy was born, focused on his record and work with the newest members of Congress. He twice mentioned joining forces with Rep.-Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on the Green New Deal, the manifesto that calls for cutting greenhouse-gas emissions to net zero over 10 years, and guaranteeing jobs for all. 
'I have led and delivered for the people of Massachusetts,' Markey said. 
Although officially running against each other, Markey and Kennedy often sounded more like they were campaigning against Trump and the Republican-led Senate. 
Kennedy, serving his fourth term in Congress, lashed out at the president for the actions he has taken against immigrants. 
'The way this administration has gone about tarnishing the immigrant community is one of the most abhorrent things I've seen over the course of my time in office,' Kennedy said before slipping in a reminder of his own immigrant family members, who rose to the highest levels of government in the United States.
Markey, a second-term senator, highlighted his legislative accomplishments despite the Republican hold on the Senate, including funding for research on Alzheimer's disease and gun-control legislation.
He spoke of his success in securing $25-million in research money to study gun violence in last year's bipartisan spending bill to fund the government. He also talked in personal terms about helping his father care for his mother as she battled Alzheimer's, as well as the importance of battling Trump's policies against immigrants.
'We have to fight Donald Trump every single step of the way,' Markey said. 'Take him to court. Not cooperate. This is fundamentally a challenge to who we are as Bostonians.'
 Both men spoke of their records and their liberal efforts "" supporting action against climate change, limiting U.S. troops in the Middle East, providing more affordable housing and redressing centuries of government-supported racism.
But they both kept coming back to the fight against Trump and his agenda as their top priority, and trying to sell themselves as the best positioned to lead that fight. 
Kennedy highlighted his youthful energy and passion, sounding near tears at some points, and emphasized the importance of wielding the power of a Senate seat against the president. Markey tried to overcome the public impression of a policy wonk lacking in fight. 
'I fight. I win. I have fought, I have led and I have delivered,' he said to the media after the hour-long debate, televised on WGBH public television and radio across the state. 
Neither man stumbled in the wide-ranging, open-format discussion that covered everything from a local fight over a natural gas compressor to America's health-care system.
Some members of the studio audience said both men had their moments. They did not seem convinced by either one but said they now want to study up and learn more about them before the Sept.-1 primary. Jaquell Sneed, 28, of the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, said she still wants to know 'who's going to make it happen.'
Because of the state's Democratic leanings, whoever wins the primary is likely to win the Senate seat in November, several political scientists and strategists said.
Kennedy is a fourth-generation politician with a famous political name that belonged to a president, senators, former congressmen and other politicians. He has served in the House since 2012, when Rep. Barney Frank decided not to seek reelection. 
Markey has been in the Senate since 2013, when longtime senator and 2004 Democratic presidential nominee John F. Kerry stepped down to become secretary of state. Before that, Markey had served as a congressman for 37 years. 
 Kennedy's challenge to the incumbent is rare, especially in light of their near-mirror-image voting records and policies. The congressman has one advantage "" greater name recognition than the sitting senator. 'Most people think this is a race and that [Kennedy] can win,' said Joe Trippi, a Democratic strategist.
Kennedy announced his candidacy in September, proclaiming 'now is not the time for waiting.' He has made nearly 300 campaign stops across the state since entering the race and held 11 town halls in January alone. 
On fundraising, Kennedy has the edge, with $5.5-million cash on hand to Markey's $4.6-million. 
'It's really a choice based on personality and sense of who is going to represent Massachusetts going forward in a way that counters President Trump,' said Jeffrey M. Berry, a political science professor at Tufts University in Medford, Mass.
Kennedy's challenge will be articulating why voters should support him for Senate when the state already has a Democratic senator with a similar record, Berry said.
To be competitive, Markey has to use the campaign to raise his profile, said Shannon Jenkins, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth. Voters, Jenkins said, don't 'dislike Markey, they just don't know him.' 
Age is likely to be a big factor in the race, though exactly how remains unclear. Markey has drawn support from some younger voters who appreciate his long-standing work to protect the climate. But Kennedy has also drawn support from older voters, who may fondly remember when his great-uncle was president and when his grandfather represented New York in the Senate and then served as U.S. attorney general.
'The legend is that no Kennedy has lost an election in Massachusetts in 130-years,' said John Cluverius, an assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell.
As the younger candidate, Kennedy also may have an advantage by being seen as the candidate of change. He already has strong support from the LGBTQ community, as well as 19-labor unions.

Meeting seen as way for Ukraine's president to put turmoil behind him


KYIV, Ukraine "" Ukraine's precarious location "" on the friction point between Russian authoritarianism and Western democracy "" makes attention from the United States critical to politicians here. Meetings and even photo opportunities with American VIPs are invested with huge significance.
For the Ukrainian president, the holy grail is a White House meeting.
For many lower-ranking officials, just getting a selfie with an influential American is political gold, seen as 'the epitome of success,' as one former Ukrainian intelligence official put it recently.
With Secretary of State Mike Pompeo due to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Friday, Ukraine's leadership is looking for a signal on its standing with President Trump.
Trump told officials in an Oval Office meeting last May, shortly after Zelensky's election victory, that Ukrainians 'are all corrupt, they are all terrible people' who 'tried to take me down,' according to testimony from Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, during House impeachment hearings.
Getting past the Trump problem is crucial for Zelensky, a former television comedian who ran for president on a platform of dealing with Ukraine's enduring problem of corrosive corruption and ending a war with Russian-backed separatists in the eastern region of Donbas.
But the signs for Ukraine are worrying.
Volker has not been replaced since his resignation in September. There has been no new U.S. ambassador appointed to replace Marie Yovanovitch, who was recalled by Trump last spring. And a disquieting silence has descended over U.S.-Ukraine relations amid the Senate impeachment trial over Trump's attempts to pressure Zelensky to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
Another bad sign came last week. An NPR journalist, Mary Louise Kelly, said that Pompeo, furious that she asked him about Ukraine and Yovanovitch in an interview, berated her, asking whether she thought Americans cared about Ukraine.
Volker was involved in negotiations with Zelensky aide Andriy Yermak last summer for the Ukrainian president to announce the investigation Trump wanted in return for a White House meeting, according text messages released during the impeachment process.
Volker on Tuesday called on Pompeo to announce the date for a White House meeting at Friday's gathering.
'Pompeo's visit to Ukraine is an important opportunity to finally make that a reality,' he wrote in Foreign Policy, arguing that Zelensky offered the best hope for Ukraine to fight corruption, implement reform and act as a bulwark against Russian aggression.
Yermak told Time magazine in December that a White House meeting would send a message that Zelensky's new leadership had already achieved a lot.
Ukraine is seen as a crucial counterweight to Russian power in the region. It is desperately reliant on U.S. military aid, facing on ongoing war against Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine and still reeling from the loss of the strategic Crimean Peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014.

Ukraine's political elite has been deeply frustrated at the derailment of U.S.-Ukraine relations by the impeachment hearings.
Even if Pompeo does deliver Zelensky a White House meeting, as Volker suggested, attention will inevitably turn to whether Zelensky offered something helpful to Trump in return.
Zelensky has repeatedly denied that he felt any pressure from Trump to announce the inquiry the U.S. president wanted when the two spoke on the phone on July 25 "" the phone call that helped stir the impeachment.
'There is no doubt that this visit has a significant political and psychological component that is linked to the U.S. impeachment trial,' said Makar Taran, a specialist on U.S. studies at the National Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv.
Despite his hopes for a White House meeting, Zelensky cannot afford to be pulled deeper into U.S. politics in a U.S. election year, said political analyst Taras Semenyuk of the KyivStratPro think tank.
'The president of the United States has stooped from his legal obligations to the level of standard profit-for-profit arrangements,' Semenyuk said. 'It's Trump's logic, benefit in return for benefit. I will give you military help and you will give me incriminating evidence on Biden.'
'Zelensky will not publicly help Trump in the elections, because it would entail very unpleasant consequences for his ratings and Ukraine's ratings in general,' he added.

Zelensky's main task is a possible reset in U.S.-Ukraine relations without wading into American politics, said Andriy Buzarov, a foreign policy expert on the public council of the Ukraine Ministry of Foreign Affairs, an advisory body.
'Zelensky and his team will do everything possible to avoid getting involved in the internal political strife of the United States on one side or the other,' Buzarov said. 'Zelensky has two clear tasks "" to get continued United States support for Ukraine, no matter who is president of the United States or Ukraine, and to minimize the involvement of the Zelensky team in the internal political disputes of the United States.'
He said the U.S. impeachment drama had damaged Washington's standing in Ukraine.
'All the issues related to the impeachment and the politicization of U.S.-Ukraine relations has undermined the image of the U.S. president and the United States in Ukraine.'

Each side in the trial sees his House testimony as vital to its case 

Brussels "" As his name surfaced again and again this week during the start of the impeachment trial of President Trump, Gordon Sondland carried on here, almost 4,000 miles away, as if nothing unusual was underway.
Trump's ambassador to the European Union held meetings with the E.U. official in charge of emergency management. He hosted the Korean ambassador at the U.S. mission. And, he sat with the E.U.'s Brexit negotiator. Sondland had hoped that by staying quiet and going about his business that he could stay 'out of the spotlight' of the impeachment drama unfolding at the U.S. Capitol, according to a close associate. 
But that spotlight was unavoidable as the colorful character at the center of the House impeachment probe reemerged this week as one of the most important figures in the Senate trial to determine whether Trump will remain in office. The House Democrats prosecuting the case and the White House lawyers defending the president have cast Sondland as their side's 'critical witness.' Together, the two have invoked Sondland's name more than 200 times since Monday in legal briefs and statements on the Senate floor.
House Democrats "" who are still unable to question officials in the president's inner circle, such as former national security adviser John Bolton "" remain dependent on Sondland's November testimony to establish Trump's motive and intent when he withheld aid and a coveted White House invitation last year from Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's new president.
Sondland, a business executive who gave $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee and liked to tout his relationship with the president, testified before the House that Trump had conditioned a White House meeting on Zelensky's announcing investigations, including one that could have been used to damage 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden. 'Was there a quid pro quo?' Sondland testified. 'The answer is yes.'
On the question of withholding aid, Sondland testified that he had come to believe that the administration was also tying almost $400-million of security assistance for Ukraine to the sought-after investigations. It added up, Sondland said, like 'two plus two equals four.'
But the president's legal team has pointed to Sondland's testimony as evidence of the opposite of what House Democrats contend, arguing that he also told lawmakers that Trump denied that he wanted any 'quid pro quo' with regard to Ukraine.
'House Democrats' critical witness "" Sondland "" actually destroys their case,' Trump's lawyers wrote in a brief filed Monday.
Trump's team isn't planning to end its case there concerning Sondland, according to a senior White House official. Trump's attorneys are also preparing to impugn his credibility as the trial unfolds, saying his testimony before the House showed Sondland has a tendency to portray his uninformed opinions and presumptions as fact, which in the case of Ukraine became an echo chamber.
'So many roads come into and out of Sondland,' said the official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ambassador's role in the trial. 'Any fair-minded observer, if you looked at what the House developed in its proceedings, so much of what was claimed turned out to be Sondland had said, or insinuated, or believed, or surmised, that had been picked up and passed around by others.'
Against the spectacle of the president's legal team undermining a sitting U.S. ambassador, Sondland remains Trump's man in Europe.
And Sondland, for his part, is still playing along, holding on to his post in Brussels with a cheerful tenacity, according to nine associates and diplomats who have interacted with him in recent months. They say Sondland's gamble appears to be that if he carries on, he might survive long enough to recast his brief and so far scandal-ridden record as ambassador, a role the longtime hotelier hoped would serve as a distinguished capstone to his successful career in business.
But it is unclear how long he will be kept on the job once the impeachment trial is over.
Trump has not spoken with Sondland in the two months since the explosive testimony, according to two senior U.S. officials. The two last saw each other at the White House on Oct. 2 for the Finnish president's visit.
The decision for Trump and Sondland not to speak since the ambassador's testimony in November might go both ways. Two acquaintances of Sondland's said they left discussions with him in recent months understanding that Sondland had stopped calling the White House on advice of his attorneys, perhaps to avoid any perception of witness tampering.
His D.C.-based attorney, Robert Luskin, said he and his client would decline to comment. Sondland's testimony, he said, 'will speak for itself.'
Sondland's severed tie to the White House has diminished the ambassador's swagger, but it's not gone, several associates said.
Sondland has continued to press Europeans to be tougher on Iranian leadership and to impose sanctions. As the two sides fight over trade, he has pushed Trump's protectionist agenda. And as Britain finalizes its preparations to split from the E.U. next week, he has met with leaders on both sides to advocate for U.S. interests.
Some critics even say Sondland has found his stride.
'I think he's found his feet,' said Radoslaw Sikorski, the head of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with the United States, who hosted Sondland at a meeting last week. 'He has in the last year found a way of forcefully arguing for American interests and point of view without giving offense.'
Sikorski, a vocal Trump critic, said that for him and his peers, Sondland still was their main channel to Washington. 'He is the U.S. ambassador, and as long he is, we assume he represents the president and the State Department,' Sikorski said. 'He is well-briefed, and states it like it is.'
Others in Europe are still trying to determine Sondland's standing.
'I don't know how strong he really is in the U.S. right now because of the impeachment trial,' said Rasmus Andersen, a German member of the European Parliament who pressed Sondland about the U.S. political turmoil at the closed-door meeting with E.U. lawmakers last week.
Sikorski said that Sondland responded that 'he wasn't at liberty to discuss it.' As chair of the meeting, Sikorski said, he had moved the conversation along, since he saw impeachment as an internal U.S. matter.
One clear development since November is that Sondland's involvement in a matter outside the E.U. "" Ukraine policy "" has all but ended, said current and former U.S. officials. 
Sondland previously loomed large over U.S.-Ukraine relations, a fact that accounts for his central role in the impeachment trial. 
In July, on a visit to Kyiv, Sondland told a Ukrainian broadcaster that Trump had given him 'special assignments including Ukraine.' 
Text messages and emails revealed in the impeachment investigation, as well as subsequently, through public records lawsuits, show that in that period, Sondland was pressing Zelensky and his aides to announce investigations into Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company where Joe Biden's son Hunter previously held a board position, as well as into a widely discredited theory that some in Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to help Democrats.
The difference between how House Democrats and Trump's defense team plan to present Sondland and the significance of his testimony was on full display Wednesday as Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the lead impeachment manager, in his opening statement discussed the ambassador's role and called for Trump to be removed from office.
Schiff played a video of Sondland's November testimony before the House in which the ambassador described carrying out what he understood to be Trump's wishes.
'I know that members of this committee frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a quid pro quo?' Sondland said. 'As I testified previously with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.'
But Schiff then largely treated Sondland as a hostile witness, describing him as a foot soldier in Trump's pressure campaign against Ukraine. 
Schiff also made clear that House Democrats no longer trust that Sondland was truthful about a key conversation he claimed to have had with Trump.
Sondland has maintained that in a Sept. 9 phone call, Trump told him verbatim that he wanted 'no quid pro quo' with Ukraine. Trump has held up Sondland's depictions of the call as exculpatory. 
But The Washington Post reported in November that there is no corroborating evidence such a call took place. The White House has not located a record in its switchboard logs of a call between Trump and Sondland that day, even though it has records of other calls between the two described in impeachment testimony. Also, the call would have occurred in an unusual period, between 12:47 a.m. and 5:19 a.m. in Washington.
On Wednesday, Schiff represented that the president actually used the no-quid-pro-quo phrase days earlier, on Sept. 7, during a call that had a very different thrust. In that call, Trump made clear that he in fact did want Zelensky to personally announce investigations into Trump's political opponents, according to diplomats who spoke with Sondland at the time.
Schiff argued that the phrase was an unusual one for the president to throw out in conversation, and noted it occurred days after the White House was alerted to a whistleblower complaint detailing just such a scheme.
'Hello, Mr. President. How are you today?' Schiff said. 'No quid pro quo.'
He added: 'It's the kind of thing that comes up in a conversation, if you're trying to put your alibi out there.'

Health-care law set to remain in place at least through Nov. elections
The Supreme Court on Tuesday denied a motion to fast-track a challenge to the Affordable Care Act so that it could be considered this term.
Without comment, the justices turned down a motion by the House of Representatives and Democratic-led states to expedite review of a decision last month by a panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. The panel struck down the law's mandate that individuals buy health insurance but sent-back to a lower court the question of whether the rest of-the statute can stand without it.
But the lower courts have kept the Affordable Care Act in place as appeals continue, and a practical effect of the Supreme Court's action is that it will stay that way at least through the November elections. Democrats have made health care and defense of Obamacare a key point in the campaign.
The House had told the Supreme Court that the 5th Circuit decision 'poses a severe, immediate, and ongoing threat to the orderly operation of health-care markets throughout the country, casts considerable doubt over whether millions of individuals will continue to be able to afford vitally important care, and leaves-a critical sector of the nation's economy in unacceptable limbo.'
The House and Democratic states were eager to get the issue before the Supreme Court because the majority that has upheld the ACA in two previous Supreme Court challenges remains.
President Trump's solicitor general, Noel Francisco, replied that the 5th Circuit decision simply preserved the status quo until a lower court could look more closely at which parts of the law should survive. He said it would be premature for the high court to intervene.
'The Fifth Circuit's decision itself does not warrant immediate review because it did not definitively resolve any question of practical consequence,' Francisco wrote.

In 2018, U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor agreed with Texas and other red states that because Congress had reduced to zero the tax penalty for not complying with the ACA's individual mandate to have health insurance, the mandate was unconstitutional. He then ruled that the entire act must fall, although he stayed his decision, and the ACA remains in effect.
In December, a divided panel of the 5th Circuit agreed that the mandate was unconstitutional but sent the case back to O'Connor for a more rigorous examination of whether parts of the law should remain in place.
Such an examination would probably take months and push a final Supreme Court decision on the issue far into the future, and certainly past this year's elections.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said the court 'sided' with Republicans.
'Today's disappointing decision by the Supreme Court only prolongs and worsens the uncertainty and fear that Republicans' anti-health care agenda is inflicting on American families,' Pelosi said in a statement, adding that 'the Trump Administration and its GOP allies have engaged in an outrageous sabotage campaign to systematically destroy protections for the millions of Americans with pre-existing conditions as well as every last benefit and protection provided by the Affordable Care Act.'
New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose state was one of those asking the Supreme Court to take immediate action, said: 'We are still urging the court to hear arguments next term. Day after day, President Trump makes false statements, sends misleading tweets, and spouts outright lies about Obamacare and the many protections the law has provided to millions across the country.'

In letter to Barr, Nadler calls events at Justice 'deeply troubling'
The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee asked Attorney General William P. Barr on Friday to allow the four career prosecutors who quit the criminal case against President Trump's friend Roger Stone to testify before lawmakers as part of a wide-ranging inquiry into possible White House interference at the Justice Department.
In a letter to Barr, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) wrote that recent events at the Justice Department - including leadership's unusual intervention to reduce career prosecutors' sentencing recommendation for Stone - have been ""deeply troubling"" and requested that Barr turn over communications between the White House and the Justice Department on several politically sensitive cases.
Nadler also asked that Barr make available for testimony or interviews 15 different current and former officials involved in the matters, including the four career prosecutors who until recently handled the Stone case and all the U.S. attorneys across the country that the Justice Department has recently tapped for special assignments of interest to Trump.
Barr is scheduled to testify before the Judiciary Committee on March 31, and Nadler asked for a response to his letter by March 13.
The Justice Department is generally resistant to providing Congress with White House communications, which could be protected by executive privilege, or with information about ongoing investigations - making it unlikely Nadler will get much, if any, of what he is seeking. The chairman's request for testimony from low-level line prosecutors, who are not politically appointed, also is unusual and could be met with resistance even within his own party.
A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Nadler conceded in his letter that the Trump administration's position has been that ""the Department typically does not provide information regarding ongoing matters,"" but he cited recent precedents that show the Justice Department has not always taken that tack.
For example, he wrote, when the Judiciary Committee examined the FBI's investigation of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server, as well as the FBI's 2016 opening of an investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign, ""the Justice Department made available nearly one million pages of documents, including classified materials, memos describing interactions with President Trump, and electronic communications authorizing investigations into Russian election interference.""
Nadler noted that the department also made available 15 current and former Justice Department and FBI employees for interviews, including career officials, for those legislative inquiries.
Barr has faced intense criticism since he intervened in the Stone case this month - after Trump tweeted about the matter - to reduce the seven-to-nine-year sentencing recommendation that career prosecutors had made to a judge. The move prompted the four prosecutors - Jonathan Kravis, Aaron S.J. Zelinsky, Adam C. Jed and Michael J. Marando - to quit the case, with Kravis leaving government entirely. In an open letter, more than 2,000 former Justice Department officials soon called on Barr to resign.
Stone, who was convicted of lying to Congress as it sought to investigate possible coordination between Trump's campaign and Russia, was ultimately sentenced to three years and four months in prison.
Barr has said he chose to intervene before Trump's tweet, and in an ABC News interview, he openly rebuked the president for speaking publicly about Justice Department criminal cases. Barr told ABC News that Trump's comments made it ""impossible for me to do my job."" 
His Justice Department is resisting Stone's bid for a new trial based on allegations that the jury forewoman was biased against Trump, even though Trump has endorsed Stone's claims publicly. On Friday, a federal judge unsealed a filing in Washington indicating federal prosecutors had called Stone's request for a new trial ""frivolous"" and alleged his defense attorneys were trying to publicly promote ""a conspiracy-laden narrative"" to undermine the verdict.
The net effect has been harmful to morale in the department. Many career officials already had viewed Barr - and his predecessor, Jeff Sessions - warily for appointing outside U.S. attorneys to carry out tasks that would seemingly be of political benefit to Trump.
For example, Barr assigned U.S. Attorney John Durham in Connecticut to investigate how the FBI initiated its 2016 probe into Trump's campaign and tapped U.S. Attorney Scott W. Brady in Pittsburgh to take information from Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, about what Giuliani sees as wrongdoing by former vice president Joe Biden and his family in Ukraine. In the wake of the Stone sentencing, it was revealed that Barr had also tapped Jeff Jensen, the U.S. attorney in St. Louis, to review and ""assist"" prosecutors handling the case against Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
Nadler's letter called for all of those U.S. attorneys - and several others involved in similar matters - to be made available to testify.

White House lawyers are gearing up for a scorched-earth defense of President Trump in the impeachment trial, mounting a politically charged case aimed more at swaying American voters than GOP senators "" and damaging Trump's possible 2020 opponent, Joe Biden.
 Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, and Jay Sekulow, Trump's personal attorney, plan to use their time in the trial to target the former vice president and his son Hunter, according to multiple GOP officials familiar with the strategy. Trump's allies believe that if they can argue that the president had a plausible reason for requesting the Biden investigation in Ukraine, they can both defend him against the impeachment charges and gain the added bonus of undercutting a political adversary. 
The strategy "" aimed squarely at muddying the waters surrounding the two impeachment articles of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress "" carries potential risk. Some congressional Republicans have encouraged the White House to prioritize a line-by-line rebuttal of the Democrats' case, ensuring that wary moderates are provided enough cover to vote for Trump's acquittal. It is unclear whether going after a former colleague will sway that core constituency, protecting moderates from possible political blowback at home "" though a senior administration official made clear that Trump's legal team would try to do both.
The official, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter frankly.
The Biden campaign condemned the strategy.
'Donald Trump is so terrified of facing Joe Biden that he became the only president in American history to attempt to coerce a foreign nation into lying about a political rival,' spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement. 'Even members of his own administration "" including his former top envoy to Ukraine "" have refuted the conspiracy theory that he tried to force Ukraine to spread to bail out his struggling reelection campaign.' 
The offensive will mark the first time lawmakers or the public have heard a full-throated White House defense. The president's attorneys rejected the House invitation to participate in the last phase of the impeachment inquiry, making their presentation "" expected Saturday and Monday "" the team's first major turn in the spotlight. 
Until now, the White House has struggled to address why Trump froze military aid to Ukraine and repeatedly postponed a promised White House meeting with newly elected President Volodymyr Zelensky while pressing for investigations of the Bidens and an unfounded conspiracy theory about Ukraine interfering in the 2016 election. The White House also has had difficulty explaining why Trump's personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani was the point person on policy toward the Eastern European nation. 
In October, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney openly admitted that a quid pro quo occurred, telling reporters to 'get over it' "" though he later walked back the comments. 
Trump is eager for his team to take the stage and has been trying to strategically time it to maximize TV viewership. He has told allies that while he's fine with the defense beginning its presentation Saturday for a few hours starting at 10 a.m. "" in part because he hopes it will drive discussions on Sunday morning talk shows "" he prefers the bulk of their arguments to happen Monday when more Americans will be watching television, according to White House officials who were not authorized to speak publicly. 
'After having been treated unbelievably unfairly in the House, and then having to endure hour after hour of lies, fraud - deception by Shifty Schiff, Cryin' Chuck Schumer - their crew, looks like my lawyers will be forced to start on Saturday, which is called Death Valley in T.V.,' Trump tweeted Friday morning. 
The emerging strategy comes as the White House has heard conflicting advice from Republicans eager to share their opinion on the best rebuttal. In recent weeks, there has been a quiet, behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign by both GOP senators and Trump's House allies on his defense team, creating confusion among Republicans about which strategy the White House will adopt.
The deliberations occasionally have been marked by intense discussions, including debates about whether to push a process-focused case against Democrats or to take on each of their points and accusations individually, according to senators and congressional aides familiar with the talks. Over the past 24 hours, the debate has focused more on how much time should be dedicated to going after the Bidens. 
Those divergent views were on full display in the Capitol this week. Rep. Lee Zeldin, a New York Republican advising Trump's defense team, told reporters that Trump's lawyers needed to re-litigate what is considered a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election to help Hillary Clinton "" and, therefore, justified Trump pushing Ukraine to investigate the matter. But some Senate Republicans, including No. 2 leader John Thune (S.D.), want the White House to avoid what they consider a baseless conspiracy theory. 
'I think the intelligence community has very conclusively determined that it was Russia "" and not Ukraine "" that interfered in the 2016 election, so . . . I guess that's not a direction I would have them go,' Thune said.
Other Senate Republicans, including Trump ally Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), have publicly pushed back on a key White House legal team talking point: that the charges against the president do not constitute a crime and therefore his actions are not impeachable. 
Trump himself actively recruited lawyer and TV commentator Alan Dershowitz at a Mar-a-Lago buffet to make that very argument "" then sought out Dershowitz's wife to help persuade him to do it. 'He wants me to make the argument that the case does not meet the grounds for impeachment,' said Dershowitz. 'He knows that I feel very strongly about constitutional issues.'
Democrats, meanwhile, have been bracing for this moment, anxious about the Trump team getting 24 hours without any interruptions and pushback from impeachment managers. That concern only grew after Trump's lawyers uttered several inaccuracies on the Senate floor Tuesday, including a claim that House Republicans were not allowed to question witnesses during closed-door depositions. They could, and they did.
Democrats want to ensure that the Trump team doesn't get the last word, in part by using some of the allotted 16 hours of questions and answers to correct any misstatements. 
'I'm concerned about their deceptive and misleading statements,' said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), promising that Democrats would 'ask questions that are, in effect, an invitation to set the record straight.'
Democrats have been anticipating that the defense would shift attention from Trump's alleged misconduct to focus on the Bidens. That, in part, is what drove House managers to devote a considerable portion of their Thursday presentation to a preemptive rebuttal on those points, arguing that several Republicans and Europeans had supported Biden's efforts to push out corrupt former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin. 
Trump and Republicans have accused Biden "" without evidence "" of ousting Shokin because the prosecutor was investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that employed Hunter Biden on its board while the elder Biden was vice president. But former U.S. and Ukrainian officials have said the prosecutor's investigation of Burisma had been dormant, and many had hoped that the change in prosecutors backed by Biden and others would lead to more aggressive anti-corruption investigations. Republicans also have pointed to concerns about the appearance of a conflict of interest, which were expressed by some of the Democrats' top witnesses in the impeachment inquiry.
'The House managers sort of drove a knife through the heart of those false arguments ahead of time . . . and I think that will help make the case,' Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters Thursday. 
Not all Republicans are eager about a singular focus on the former vice president. In an unusual role-reversal, Trump's most aggressive House allies have urged the legal team to focus on trying to undercut the Democrats' timeline and arguments.
'You can't talk about corruption broadly without talking about Burisma and Hunter Biden's involvement,' said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who also is assisting the defense team. 'That being said, I think the vast majority of this emphasis is on what were the components that led the president to ultimately release the aid.' 
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and his top attorney on the House Oversight Committee, Steve Castor, both of whom participated in the House investigation, have been working with the Trump team to try to highlight what they see as weak spots in the impeachment case.
As the impeachment managers showed clips of Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland confirming a quid pro quo, Jordan has pushed for the team to counter by highlighting Sondland's changing statements as well as his own admission that he never heard such a directive from Trump.
'Remember, Sondland is the guy who had to amend his testimony, the guy who had to clarify his testimony, is the guy they rely on the most?' Jordan said.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) has been on the other side of the argument, working closely with the White House and meeting with Trump's legal team as recently as Thursday evening to encourage them to go hard on Hunter Biden's Burisma position. 
'Focus on what matters, which is the substance,' he said on Hugh Hewitt's radio show Friday morning, summarizing his advice to Trump's team. 'And I told them, 'Look, nothing matters more than the facts on Burisma.' . . . Lay out substantive, factual reasons why investigating Burisma, the president had a responsibility to do so.'
Senate Republicans said they have been eager to hear what Trump's team has to say "" in part because they don't know what line of attack it will take. Privately, some Republican senators have groused in recent days that the Trump team is 'everywhere but nowhere,' as one described the dynamic, speaking on the condition anonymity to give a frank assessment.
'They are on TV and at the Capitol yelling at the Democrats, but I'm not really sure what the whole range of the argument is. Are you?' the GOP senator asked, adding that the frustration was shared by other Republicans.

with GOP backing, president emboldened 
Critics see an assault on Justice Dept. independence

President Trump is testing the rule of law one week after his acquittal in his Senate impeachment trial, seeking to bend the executive branch into an instrument for his personal and political vendetta against perceived enemies.
And Trump "" simmering with rage, fixated on exacting revenge against those he feels betrayed him and insulated by a compliant Republican Party "" is increasingly comfortable doing so to the point of feeling untouchable, according to the president's advisers and allies.
In the span of 48 hours this week, the president has sought to protect his friends and punish his foes, even at the risk of compromising the Justice Department's independence and integrity "" a stance that his defenders see as entirely justified.
Trump complained publicly about federal prosecutors' recommended prison sentence for one of his longtime friends and political advisers, Roger Stone. After senior Justice Department officials then overruled prosecutors to lighten Stone's recommended sentence, the president congratulated Attorney General William P. Barr for 'taking charge' with an extraordinary intervention.
Next Trump sought to intimidate the federal judge in the Stone case, badgering her on Twitter for previous rulings, and attacked the four prosecutors who withdrew from the case in apparent protest of the Justice Department's intervention. Then Trump floated the possibility of a presidential pardon for Stone, who was convicted by a jury in November of tampering with a witness and lying to Congress.
The president has openly encouraged his Justice Department to retaliate against a quartet of former FBI officials who long have been targets of his ire for their involvement in the Russia probe.
'Where's [James] Comey?' Trump bellowed Wednesday in a stream-of-consciousness diatribe from the Oval Office. 'What's happening to [Andrew] McCabe? What's happening to Lisa and "" to Pete Strzok and Lisa Page? What's happening with them? It was a whole setup, it was a disgrace for our country, and everyone knows it, too, everyone.'

For months now, Trump has been enraged that these FBI officials have not been charged with crimes. And he has vented at length privately in recent weeks that James A. Wolfe, a former aide to the Senate Intelligence Committee, received a prison sentence of two months for lying to FBI agents about his contact with reporters during a federal leak investigation "" a criticism the president repeatedly publicly on Wednesday.
Some of Trump's top aides have counseled him against speaking out on legal matters, warning him that doing so could wrongly influence proceedings because officials at the Justice Department or elsewhere would then know they needed to please him or risk his wrath. Trump has often responded, 'I have a right to say whatever I want,' according to a former senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal conversations. 
'He knows exactly what he's doing,' this official explained. 'He knows that he has more power than anyone else in the government "" and when he tweets, everyone has to listen to him.'
A second former senior official, former chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, said of Trump, 'He is mad and he should be mad. The Democrats and the media wasted three years of the nation's time on a witch hunt. Now he understands how to use the full powers of the presidency. The pearl-clutchers better get used to it.'
Trump insisted Wednesday that he did nothing improper in the Stone case. 'I didn't speak to them, by the way, just so you understand,' the president told reporters, referring to Justice Department officials. 'They saw the horribleness.'
Barr's defenders said he would always do what he thinks is right, regardless of pressure from the president, and noted that his department declined to charge Comey after an inspector general referral, despite what Trump might have wanted.
Kerri Kupec, a Justice Department spokeswoman, said department leaders had decided to reverse career prosecutors' recommendation in the Stone case before Trump's public statement on the matter, and that there had been no discussions between the White House and the Justice Department in the two days beforehand.

Still, a chorus of former U.S. attorneys and former Justice Department leaders condemned Trump for what they consider improper political pressure in a criminal prosecution.
'I've never seen so many prosecutors, including those who aren't political or those who haven't been following this situation closely, go to red alert so quickly,' said Joyce White Vance, a former U.S. attorney in the Obama administration. 'The reason is this: If a president can meddle in a criminal case to help a friend, then there's nothing that keeps him from meddling to harm someone he thinks is his enemy. That means that a president is fully above the law in the most dangerous kind of way. This is how democracies die.'
On Capitol Hill, Democrats, too, cried foul. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) called for emergency hearings and an investigation by the Justice Department's inspector general, saying the president's handling of the Stone case was 'Third World behavior, not American behavior.'
'We are witnessing a crisis in the rule of law in America unlike one we have ever seen before,' Schumer said in a floor speech Wednesday morning.
But for members of Trump's party, this was no break-the-glass moment. Congressional Republicans evinced little distress, and some excused the president's conduct entirely.
'It doesn't bother me at all, as long as the judge has the final decision,' said Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), a former Senate Judiciary Committee chairman who sharply criticized the administration of President Barack Obama over alleged politicization of the Justice Department.

There is a precedent of at least one Senate Republican trying to contain Trump's handling of the Justice Department. In 2018, shortly after the president removed Jeff Sessions as attorney general, then-Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he would not vote for any more of Trump's judicial nominees until the Senate voted on a bill to protect special counsel Robert S. Mueller III from being fired.
Flake's effort failed, however. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) blocked a vote on the bill "" and Flake, now retired, expects any similar gambit to put restraints on the president to face a similar fate.
'It should be a big moment for Republicans who have argued against this textbook concentration of power for years, whether it's dealing with our government or autocratic governments abroad,' said Flake, a Trump critic. 'But I don't see it. There is so much fatigue, in terms of challenging the president.' 
During an election year, few lawmakers are willing to offer even minor criticism of their own party's president and risk alienating GOP base voters, veteran Republican operatives said.
'It's one of those things where these lines have never been crossed in this way "" that's the way responsible administrations act,' said Brendan Buck, a longtime adviser to former House speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.). 'But you'll end up seeing Republicans saying he has the authority to do it, even if they know it's not necessarily within the bounds of what should be done.'
'It's like bad weather. Nothing more, nothing less,' said one Republican congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly explain the thinking of top GOP lawmakers. 'What do you expect? We're in year four of this. It just happens.'

Former U.S. attorney Chuck Rosenberg, who has served in both Democratic and Republican administrations, said, 'This president is not going to change. We need adults to step up and check his behavior. There was a demonstrated lack of spine recently in the United States Senate. Maybe they have a breaking point and maybe they don't. One of the things that people said about this Congress is that they've lost their authority. That's not true. They've just chosen not to exercise it.'
If Senate Republicans who voted to acquit Trump thought he might be chastened or show contrition after his impeachment, they were proved wrong this week. Asked what lesson he learned from impeachment, the president told reporters Wednesday, 'That the Democrats are crooked "" they've got a lot of crooked things going "" that they're vicious, that they shouldn't have brought impeachment.'
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) said Wednesday that the president must 'play no role whatsoever when it comes to sentencing recommendations' "" and said she planned to call the White House to discuss the Stone matter. Collins added that Trump 'should not have commented' and that she wished he 'would not tweet.'



Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the lone Republican to vote to convict the president, told reporters, 'I hope the Justice Department is independent of politics, and any indication that that's not the case would obviously be a real problem.' 
The intervention on behalf of Stone is not the only action this week causing alarm among Democrats. Trump also trashed Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who was abruptly dismissed last week from the National Security Council, and encouraged military leaders to discipline the decorated combat veteran in part because of his testimony about Trump's conduct with Ukraine in the House impeachment inquiry.
In addition, Trump on Tuesday withdrew the nomination of former U.S. attorney Jessie K. Liu to serve as undersecretary of the Treasury Department for terrorism and financial crimes after being lobbied by critics of her prosecutions. Liu oversaw several high-profile cases in the nation's capital, including ones inherited from special counsel Mueller and involving former Trump advisers Michael Flynn, Rick Gates and Stone.

Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) said Wednesday that Trump was 'on a retribution tour.'
'It's just one thing after another,' said Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, where Liu had been set to testify Thursday at her confirmation hearing. 'The president clearly feels he's unleashed. And [Republicans] all said he learned his lesson "" the lesson he learned is he can get away with whatever he wants.'

President Trump on Friday endorsed a tweet comparing the top Senate Democrat to Iran, the United States' longtime adversary, suggesting neither could be trusted, as Democratic leaders criticized the White House for ordering a military strike to kill a powerful Iranian commander without congressional input.
Amid a flurry of reactions from U.S. lawmakers, Trump retweeted conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, who, in response to a headline about Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) not receiving advance notice of the military operation, wrote: 'Neither were the Iranians, and for pretty much the same reason.'
Trump made similar insinuations about Democrats' trustworthiness after the October raid that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. At that time, Trump said he didn't tell House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), a former member of the Intelligence Committee, because 'he wanted to make sure this kept secret.'
Trump ordered the U.S. drone strike that killed Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani, whom the United States regarded as a war criminal responsible for hundreds of American deaths.
Republicans and Democrats were united in calling Soleimani an enemy of the United States and a terrorist.
'This morning, Iran's master terrorist is dead,' said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in remarks on the Senate floor. 'The architect and chief engineer for the world's most active state sponsor of terrorism has been removed from the battlefield at the hand of the United States military.'
Schumer called Soleimani a 'notorious terrorist,' and added: 'No one should shed a tear over his death.'
But as Republicans celebrated what they described as Trump's decisive action, Democrats criticized the president's order to act unilaterally while expressing grave concern that this action would move the United States closer to an in trac table war with Iran. 
'No matter how good it may feel that Qasem Soleimani is no longer alive, he likely will end up being more dangerous to the United States, our troops and our allies, as a martyr than as a living, breathing military adversary,' said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).
Trump, in brief remarks Friday afternoon about the attack, said he targeted Soleimani to 'stop a war,' not to start one.
Presidents typically inform the so-called Gang of Eight "" the House speaker and minority leader, the Senate majority and minority leaders, and the chairmen and ranking minority-party members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees "" about high-level military operations.
Top Democratic leaders in Congress received no advance notification of the strike, aides said. Pelosi spoke to Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper after the attack for about 13 minutes, said an aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly.
'I'm a member of the Gang of Eight, which is typically briefed in advance of operations of this level of significance. We were not,' Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor, adding that the administration must be 'asked probing questions not from your inner and often insulated circle, but from others, particularly Congress, which forces an administration before it acts to answer very serious questions.'
It was unclear which congressional leaders were given advance notice of the strike. 
McConnell said only that he had spoken to the defense secretary and was arranging a classified briefing for all senators early next week, but he provided no details on when he first learned about the strike.
Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump ally, said Friday morning on Fox News that he was 'briefed about the potential operation when I was down in Florida' and appreciated 'being brought into the orbit.'
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) posted a photo on Instagram of himself and Trump at the president's Mar-a-Lago estate late Thursday, though it was not clear whether he, too, was briefed ahead of time.
McCarthy praised the killing of Soleimani as a 'statement to those seeking to attack America.' Trump, McCarthy said, had responded appropriately to violence by Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, including an attempt to storm the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
'In a display of resolve and strength, we struck the leader of those attacking our sovereign U.S. territories,' he said. 
Most Democrats focused their ire on Trump's unilateral action that they said could propel America into another conflict in the Middle East, yet Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) directed a more personal blow at Trump. 
'The Occupant was JUST impeached for abuse of power for political gain - now he is leading us to the brink of war because he believes it will help his re-election. We are sick of endless wars. Congress has the sole authority to declare war and we must deescalate. #NoWarWithIran,' Pressley tweeted.
Many of Trump's possible Democratic opponents in the presidential election also offered stern rebukes of Trump's handling of foreign policy. 
Calling the strike against Soleimani an assassination, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted that the United States was 'on the brink of yet another war in the Middle East.' She added: 'We're here because a reckless president, his allies, and his administration have spent years pushing us here.'
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called it a 'dangerous escalation,' and former vice president Joe Biden said in a statement that Trump 'just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox.'
In New Hampshire, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, who was an intelligence officer in Afghanistan, echoed many congressional Democrats who have wondered what the strategy is now. 'If we have learned nothing else from the Middle East, in the last 20 years, it's that taking out a bad guy is not a good idea unless you're ready for what comes next,' Buttigieg said. 
In Iowa, Sanders condemned Trump's action and emphasized his long record of opposing many U.S. military interventions abroad, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq. 
 'It gives me no pleasure to tell you at this moment we face a similar crossroads fraught with danger,' he said, adding that Trump's decision 'now puts us on the path to another war, potentially one that could be even worse than before.'

Meeting was vital to credibility of Venezuelan opposition leader 
President Trump met with Juan Guaido on Wednesday for the first time, ending weeks of speculation that he would snub the man the United States and dozens of other countries recognize as the legitimate president of Venezuela.
As he arrived at the White House, Guaido joined Trump in giving a thumbs up for the cameras before the two moved inside. Neither spoke, and a scheduled opportunity for reporters to ask questions as the two sat down in the Oval Office was canceled by Trump press officials without explanation.
The timing was awkward "" moments after Republican Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) announced he would vote to convict Trump of abuse of power, and just two hours before the Senate acquittal verdict almost entirely along party lines.
But the fact that the meeting took place, following Guaido's appearance as Trump's guest at Tuesday night's State of the Union address, may have been enough to serve their shared goal of demonstrating administration support for Guaido's interim government.
Guaido received a standing ovation from House and Senate members during the highly partisan address, one of the few instances of bipartisan applause during the president's speech. Pointing to him in the House gallery, where he was seated near first lady Melania Trump, the president called Guaido 'a very brave man' and 'the true and legitimate president of Venezuela.'

Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Trump said, 'is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people. But Maduro's grip on tyranny will be smashed and broken.'
The United States was the first country to recognize Guaido, the elected leader of the country's legislative assembly, as Venezuela's legitimate president after accusing Maduro of corruption and electoral fraud. 
Yet it has now been more than a year since Trump promised that he would 'use the full weight of United States economic and diplomatic power' to drive Maduro from office. Despite U.S. efforts to starve his government of resources with sanctions and the recognition of Guaido by about 60 countries, Maduro remains.
Trump's public interest in the issue has waned, and he has mentioned the young opposition figure less and less frequently as the months have gone by. The president's apparent ambivalence has hurt Guaido's credibility at home, where public dissatisfaction with the anti-Maduro opposition is rising.
A new flurry of fretting in pro-Guaido circles in Venezuela and abroad arose with perceived brushoffs by Trump over the past two weeks. Trump and Guaido both appeared at an economic forum in Davos, Switzerland, without a meeting, and Trump opted to play golf in Palm Beach on Saturday rather than attend Guaido's public rally in nearby Miami.
Had he returned to Venezuela without seeing Trump, 'everyone would [have questioned] Guaido's leadership,' said Dimitris Pantoulas, a Caracas-based political analyst. The majority of the opposition are placing their hopes 'primarily on the support the United States can give,' he said.
All sides sought to portray Guaido's red-carpet treatment in Washington as evidence that Trump had stepped up and offered him the full backing he needed to lessen fears of arrest, or worse, upon his return. His clandestine departure from Venezuela last month for support-seeking stops in Europe and North and South America violated a travel ban imposed by Maduro. 
'Any harm that may be caused on Juan Guaido . . . will have very significant consequences,' a senior administration official told reporters Wednesday, speaking on a government-imposed condition of anonymity. 'So, therefore, they should tread very carefully in that regards.'
The official suggested that a stepped-up anti-Maduro message would be more than just words. 
'We are dedicated to an acceleration of our policy to continue moving in the direction of maximum pressure,' the official said. 'The president has given direction to his Cabinet to do so. . . . You will see some impactful measures within the next 30 days, which will be very important and further crippling on the [Maduro] regime.' 
In remarks at a forum Wednesday, White House national security adviser Robert C. O'Brien suggested that the administration may seek additional sanctions against Russia and Rosneft, its state-controlled oil company, which have kept the Maduro government afloat amid sanctions.
'We're letting the Russians and we're letting the company know that their support . . . is not a good business decision but it's also immoral,' O'Brien said. 'So I think you're going to see some action, either voluntarily from the company, or the U.S. will likely take action in the near future on that issue.'
In Caracas, Maduro responded to Guaido's appearances in Washington with vitriol.
'In Venezuela the president isn't designated by the president of the United States "" the people elect the president. Enough with your extreme obsession!' Maduro said on state television. 'If today they would do a survey in the U.S., I am sure that 70% would support the Bolivarian Revolution,' Maduro said.
'Yesterday Donald Trump talked about crushing and breaking Venezuela. Never, nobody crushes Venezuela,' he said.
On the streets of the Venezuelan capital, however, where social media videos of the congressional applause during Trump's speech went viral, there were clear signs of relief from Guaido's supporters.
'Many people have had to swallow their words and even erase their teasing tweets because they believed Guaido couldn't meet with Trump,' said Gynette Martinez, 55, a lawyer shopping for vegetables in a market in eastern Caracas. 'And look, he accomplished much more than that. He got a standing ovation in front of the entire American capital. For me, that says a lot.'
Following the 45-minute White House meeting, Guaido's team posted a Twitter blitz of photos of him with Trump. 
Yet Guaido is returning to a complex situation that his international tour alone is unlikely to turn around. Although he met with European leaders in Davos, he has yet to receive the concrete pledges he needs from them to follow the United States in taking a tougher line on Maduro.
In recent weeks, Maduro's government has also sought to unseat Guaido as the legislative assembly chief "" a position on which his recognition by the United States and others as the legitimate president is based.
Guaido is also facing defectors within his own ranks, and a movement divided over the way forward, with some embracing Maduro's call for new parliamentary elections but not the new presidential vote that Guaido and the United States have demanded.

pAID LEAVE, RAISES CAP YEAR OF ENMITY 
Some take heart; others doubt a change of it
 It started as one of the worst years for federal employees in recent memory, as President Trump's demands for billions of dollars for a border wall led to a historic partial shutdown of the government that stretched for 35 jittery days.
It ended on a high note, as the president signed off on 12 weeks of paid leave for new parents, a generous raise and a midweek vacation day before Christmas against the recommendation of his own staff "" and as he issued an exuberant letter of thanks to 'Our Incredible Federal Workforce.'
In between, the 2.1 million civil servants who work in the government were whipsawed by a president who attacked the bureaucracy, railed against career officials who testified in the impeachment inquiry, rebuked weather forecasters over their hurricane predictions and disparaged FBI officials for their handling of the Russia investigation.
The bread-and-butter benefits that followed, after many employees felt under siege by their president, underscore Trump's unorthodox relationship with the permanent workforce that keeps the sprawling federal presence operating around the clock.
Many of Trump's top aides have long been openly hostile toward a bureaucracy they view as wasteful and too big. But Trump's actions, in the view of both supporters and critics, often hinge less on ideology than on his gut "" and what works for him politically. His recent moves also have given hope to some federal workers that he has learned their value.
'I think it's overall creating a positive buzz in my office,' John Milan Sebik, a claims specialist for the Social Security Administration in Jersey City, said of his co-workers' reaction to the year-end surprises. 'They're happy. They're actually shocked.'
Sebik, 48, said the enthusiasm that 'things might be turning for us' is tempered by uncertainty over what could come next and frustration with the decision of a new commissioner to cancel telework for 12,000 employees. The hard feelings from that decision run deep, he said.
'Trump put a cherry and icing on the cake. The cake is still burnt,' Sebik said.
Federal workers have often served as a vehicle for Trump to advance his own interests in the moment, critics say, and as leverage in the president's standoffs with opponents. 
'Like everything else he does, it's transactional,' said Rick Tyler, a Republican strategist and MSNBC political analyst who has been a sharp critic of Trump. He compared the president's approach to that of a callous chief executive who views his employees as 'expendable or exploitable.'
The government, of course, works differently from a private company. 'All of these people work for the American public,' Tyler said.
Asked how Trump reconciles his year-end boost to the workforce with his attacks on some career rank-and-file employees, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said some federal workers have shown bias against the president.
'The President appreciates the dedication, sacrifice, and hard work of federal employees found across this great country,' Gidley said in a statement. 'Unfortunately, there is evidence that shows some federal workers . . . used their power to try and stop the duly elected president's agenda, and undermine his Presidency "" that's not only despicable selfish behavior, it's a dangerous threat to our republic.'
Trump struck a deal with House Democrats weeks ago to pass a defense bill that gives federal employees their biggest victory in nearly 30 years, the costly parental leave benefit viewed by many of his top advisers as a momentous concession. The president, however, saw a rare opportunity to win approval for a pet project, his proposed sixth branch of the military dubbed the Space Force, ahead of the 2020 election.

Democrats achieved their goal of a significant raise for the workforce in budget negotiations, in exchange for White House priorities that included border wall funding. The result was a 3.1-percent federal pay hike starting in January, greater than any raises in the Obama era, when the recession led to a three-year freeze.
Trump took credit for both changes in his year-end letter to federal employees, citing a campaign promise 'to deliver Paid Family Leave to workers across the nation' and his victory overcoming 'partisan gridlock' to deliver parental leave and a raise.
Such credit-taking would not be possible, though, without the House takeover by worker-friendly Democrats who forced the president to the negotiating table, said Democratic Rep. Gerald E. Connolly, whose Northern Virginia district includes tens of thousands of federal workers.
'The fact that these things got done were despite his efforts, not because of them,' Connolly said.
He co-sponsored legislation months ago to give the workforce a 3.6 percent raise, and Democrats have pressed for paid family leave for years.
Federal employee unions are united in cheering the unexpected pocketbook wins but unforgiving of other White House actions against them. Those include an accelerating crackdown on union activity, a rollback of telework at many agencies and the relocation of hundreds of employees in the Agriculture Department out of Washington to the Midwest.
When nearly half of the staff at the Agriculture Department's economic research offices quit rather than relocate, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney joked that the administration had found 'a wonderful way to streamline government.'
'Most of them are looking at Trump's letter and saying, 'You're writing us this letter, but look at what's happened throughout the year,' ' said Andrew Huddleston, spokesman for the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union.
Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents about 150,000 employees, recalled that as employees went unpaid during a shutdown over Congress's refusal to fund $5.7-billion for Trump's border wall, Trump allowed a pay freeze for 2019 to take effect. Pressure from unions and lawmakers in Congress eventually overturned it.
'If the question is how the administration has treated federal employees in their workplace, I think the answer is clear,' Reardon said in a statement.
At the same time, Trump's actions have complicated conservatives' goals to shrink government and hold employees accountable. After an 18-month effort by top budget officials to dissolve the Office of Personnel Management and parcel out its functions to other offices, the president reversed course late this fall after watching a local government program showing that the plan was ill-conceived and had little support in Congress.
He told aides that breaking up the agency would bring him poor reviews. In a split second, stability returned to a workplace whose employees had been convulsed by uncertainty.
Other Trump actions have contradicted the policies of his own administration. As the union representing Border Patrol agents finalized a new contract this fall, Trump urged his U.S. Customs and Border Protection commissioner to agree to fund 74 new union positions pulling agents from their jobs to focus on labor matters full time.
The agreement was startling, not just because the White House has called the flow of undocumented immigrants at the U.S. southern border a national security crisis requiring maximum staffing, but because the administration is systematically wiping out full-time union work, called 'official time,' across the rest of the government. 
The Washington Post reported this month that some current and former administration officials viewed the contract as a reward to the head of the Border Patrol union, a vocal supporter of Trump's border policies.
Trump's predecessors used uneven rhetoric about government employees. Barack Obama promised to 'make government cool again' and attract millennials. But he offended some as he tried to sell his health-care plan by assuring Americans that 'I don't want government bureaucrats meddling in your health care.'
After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, the government's national security apparatus ballooned under George W. Bush, with entire new agencies born. His administration also tried to weaken employee unions, re imagining a merit-based personnel system for the Navy, but the project petered out.
Bill Clinton, declaring that 'the era of big government is over,' oversaw the largest reduction in the size of the workforce in modern history, a shift still felt today in personnel offices and other areas. 
Trump allies say his commitment to downsizing government does not translate to an antipathy toward its employees.
'The president and conservatives in general have a goal to shrink the workforce, which is too large and too bloated,' said Wesley Denton, former acting chief of staff at the White House budget office, 'but that doesn't dim his affection and appreciation for those who are doing their jobs.'
Denton and other conservatives describe Trump's battle with the unions that represent the majority of the workforce as one seeking to enable high performers to flourish while weeding out poor performers.
'Trump is beating the union bosses and telling them, 'You can't protect bad apples who don't show up for work,' ' anti-tax activist Grover Norquist said.
Norquist called Trump's decision to close the government Tuesday to give employees the day off with pay "" against the advice of personnel agency officials who said a midweek Dec. 24 holiday would set a costly precedent "" a reward to 'the vast center that's just doing their jobs.'
'He's speaking to the middle-income, working-class people in the government.'
Trump, meanwhile, has personally targeted other employees who have been caught up in the investigations surrounding his presidency.
There was the bashing of FBI agents involved in the Russia inquiry "" some by name "" whom Trump called 'scum' a few weeks ago at a campaign rally in Hershey, Pa. He was condemning them over the rationale for wiretapping a former campaign adviser.
There was the forecast he turned political in September as he dug in on groundless claims of a hurricane threat to Alabama and then pressed top aides, including his commerce secretary, to intervene with a federal scientific agency and rebuke the forecasters who contradicted him. 
There was the castigating of the anonymous whistleblower and career officials who testified publicly in the impeachment investigation as 'rogue bureaucrats of the deep state' for their narrative of his campaign to press Ukraine for political favors.
Trump this fall did praise the work of intelligence agents as he announced the death in October of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

G
overnment-wide surveys suggest that while federal workers' morale has taken a nosedive in some agencies, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Agriculture, Education and State departments, it has risen at others, including Veterans Affairs and the Defense Department.
The employees' political views largely mirror the nationwide electorate. Close to 450,000 federal workers live in the 12 traditional swing states, from Pennsylvania to Wisconsin to Colorado, that could help decide the election.
As for what federal employees can expect from the Trump administration in 2020, 'there isn't so much a strategy,' said Donald Kettl, a public affairs professor at the University of Texas at Austin, 'as there is a strategy that changes depending on how's he's feeling on any given day.'

'I've completed more promises than I've made.' 


"" President Trump, during a campaign rally in Toledo, Jan. 9, 2020


When The Fact Checker unveiled its Trump Promise Tracker in December 2016, we received a phone call from an anxious incoming White House official who demanded: 'Where did you get this list?'
We got it from the president.
With President Trump nearing the end of his third year in office, it's time for an update "" and a reality check. Contrary to what he tells his fans, the president has broken more key promises than he has kept. With our latest update, Trump has broken about 43-percent of 60-key promises "" and kept about 35-percent. He settled for a compromise on 12-percent.
During the 2016 campaign, Trump made more than 280-promises, though many were contradictory or just uttered in a single campaign event. So that posed a conundrum: What would be a good list of promises to track that Trump was really serious about? We did not think it would be fair to rate a promise that might have been tossed out without much serious discussion by the candidate and his staff.
But Trump did issue a specific plan "" what he called the 'Contract with the American Voter.' He even put his distinctive signature on it and invited supporters to sign their own copies. That plan listed 60-promises, some of which he said he would fulfill on the day he took the oath of office. Others, he said, would be implemented or launched in his first 100-days.
Of course, no one really expected him to meet those timelines. But this list seemed so specific "" and official "" that we decided it represented the ideal platform to measure Trump's promises, even though it was perhaps a bit light on foreign policy.
Since the Fact Checker was relaunched in 2011, we had missed the start of President Barack Obama's term, and so it was too late to track his 2008 promises. By reference, PolitiFact's 'Obameter' tracked 533 campaign promises and found that he kept 48-percent, broke 24 percent and compromised on 27 percent.
Here's a quick assessment of some of Trump's most significant promises. The full list can be found at wapo.st/TrumpPromiseTracker.
Kept

Announce the U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Trump did this on his third day in office.

Announce the U.S. intention to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement or withdraw from the deal. A few months after taking office, Trump tweeted that he had spoken to the presidents of Mexico and Canada about renegotiating NAFTA. 'I agreed, subject to the fact that if we do not reach a fair deal for all, we will then terminate NAFTA,' he wrote. This appears to fulfill his promise to announce this threat. Eventually, the administration negotiated an updated version of the trade pact, relabeled the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

Provide veterans with the ability to receive public Department of Veterans Affairs treatment or see the private doctor of their choice. In 2018, Trump signed the bipartisan VA Mission Act, which expanded access for veterans to VA-funded care in the private sector. (This built on a law passed under Obama.) Rules established under the law took effect in 2019, with VA paying veterans to see non-VA doctors if they have to wait longer than 20-days or drive more than 30-minutes for primary or mental health care at a VA facility. For specialty care, they can see private doctors at VA expense if they have to wait longer than 28-days or drive more than an hour to see a VA provider.

Direct the treasury secretary to label China a currency manipulator. This was a promise broken at first "" and then suddenly kept. On April-12, 2017, Trump announced that he would not label China a currency manipulator "" something he had pledged to do on his first day in office. Trump told the Wall Street Journal that he had changed his mind because China was not currently manipulating its currency, though that was already apparent during the election season. But then, on Aug.-5, 2019, he tweeted that China was manipulating its currency after the yuan fell below seven to the dollar, following Trump's announcement of additional tariffs. The Treasury Department applied the largely symbolic label a few hours later. (Last week, Trump dropped the designation ahead of a trade-deal signing, but we will note this as a promise kept.)

Require that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated. There are various ways one could try to count whether this promise has been achieved, not all of which would support the administration, but there is little doubt that the president has attacked regulations. To achieve this ratio, the administration does not tally only 'economically significant' items but includes minor deregulatory actions, such as allowing the importation of fresh pomelo fruit from Thailand and deregulation of the pine shoot beetle.

Change visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying. Trump, in a 2019 presidential memo, declared visa overstay rates 'unacceptably high' and called them a 'widespread problem.' On the basis of a Department of Homeland Security report, he instructed federal agencies to consider action against countries that have business and tourism travelers "" using the popular B1 and B2 visas "" who overstay in the United States at a rate higher than 10-percent. (Twenty countries have overstay rates higher than 10-percent, according to the DHS report. Except for Syria and Nigeria, these countries accounted for fewer than 1,000 overstayers each.)

Broken

Make Mexico reimburse the United States for the full cost of a border wall. In a phone conversation with Mexico's president on Jan.-27, 2017, a transcript of which was provided to The Washington Post and published Aug.-3, Trump indicated that he would not fulfill this promise but would not say so publicly, because it would hurt him politically. He pressed his Mexican counterpart to not raise the issue or suggest that he would not pursue his promise. 'You cannot say that to the press,' Trump said, according to the transcript. 'The press is going to go with that, and I cannot live with that.' Since that conversation, Trump has rarely raised the issue and made no move to force compliance by Mexico. Instead, he has seized billions of dollars from previously approved military construction projects and redirected the money to fund his border barrier. At a campaign rally on Tuesday, Trump asserted that 'Mexico's paying for the wall, you know that, you will see that,' but this remains one of his biggest broken promises.

Expand the economy 4 percent a year. In 2017, the gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.3-percent, well short of Trump's promised target. In 2018, the GDP grew at an annual rate of 2.9-percent, still far short of Trump's 4-percent goal. For 2019, analysts estimate that the GDP grew 2.2 or 2.3-percent. Unless something dramatic happens in 2020 "" the consensus is that annual growth will be 1.9-percent "" Trump will never meet his goal, and so this is a promise broken. He never even achieved the goal on a quarterly basis.

Fully repeal and replace Obamacare. Trump's promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act backfired spectacularly in his first year in office, and the backlash over repeal votes taken by Republicans helped Democrats retake control of the House in the midterm elections. Trump had made other promises on health care, including letting states manage Medicaid funds and allowing for the purchase of health insurance across state lines, that also failed to be realized.

Reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three and, likewise, greatly simplify tax forms. The tax bill signed into law by Trump left the number of tax brackets at seven and added complexity. Trump regularly touts the tax-cut bill, but it also failed to meet several other specific pledges, such as ensuring that the largest tax reductions were for the middle class and allowing Americans to deduct child care and elder care from their taxes.

Make sure the $1 trillion infrastructure plan will be revenue-neutral. Trump has made no progress on advancing an infrastructure bill, let alone one that is revenue-neutral.

End Common Core. In Trump's first three years, no serious action has been taken on this promise. (He ordered only a review of the federal government's education-related regulations to assess whether they unlawfully interfere with state and local decision-making.) As of Dec.-30, 39 states are implementing Common Core or a revised version of it, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Compromises

Cancel visas to countries that won't take back criminal immigrants in the United States illegally. Trump was slow to act on this pledge. In September 2017, the Trump administration announced visa restrictions against four relatively small countries "" Cambodia, Eritrea, Guinea and Sierra Leone, followed by Myanmar and Laos in 2018 and Ghana and Pakistan in 2019. He has not targeted China, one of the biggest offenders, but eight of the 10 countries that have faced such sanctions have been named during the Trump administration. Given that Trump suggested during the campaign that he would target all countries, this will be considered a compromise.

Lower the business tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent. On April-26, 2017, Trump unveiled a plan that would cut corporate taxes from 35-percent to 15-percent. But the conference report on the tax bill approved by House and Senate negotiators made the rate 21-percent. That's still a big cut, but less than what Trump had promised.

In White House ceremonies and raucous campaign rallies, President Trump has celebrated a pair of 'America First' trade deals he says will end the unfair treatment of American workers.
'Unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises. We did our job,' he said during his State of the Union address on Feb. 4, referring to new trade deals with Canada, China and Mexico. '. . . Our strategy has worked.'
The new deals rewrite the trade rules Trump says were responsible for 'the catastrophe' that struck U.S. manufacturing over the past quarter-century. Yet with fresh tariffs this month on European aircraft and products such as steel nails and aluminum vehicle bumpers, it's clear that the high-profile accords have not completed the president's planned overhaul of U.S. trade relations.
In fact, they are just the start.
Even as Trump celebrated hard-won gains in negotiations with the nation's largest trading partners, he laid the groundwork for more tariffs, more challenges to long-standing trade norms and more disruption to global commercial flows in the months ahead.
'There's a lot still to come. I think they believe they have a playbook that works,' said Michael Smart, managing director at Rock Creek Global Advisors. 'There's been a lot of talk about how confident Trump is following his acquittal on impeachment. If you look specifically at the trade ledger, he feels he's right on track.'
In the past four weeks, the president expanded his March 2018 steel and aluminum tariffs to cover products made from those materials, an implicit acknowledgment that his original approach to curbing a flood of imported industrial metals hadn't worked.
He authorized the Commerce Department to begin imposing tariffs on U.S. trading partners that allegedly use undervalued currencies to subsidize exports. And he considered withdrawing the United States from a global agreement on government procurement, alarming foreign allies.
These actions come as Trump sparred with his next trade war target, the European Union, a longtime U.S. ally that he says treats American businesses even worse than China does, and mulled additional deals with India, Kenya and Britain. On Feb. 14, Trump fired a new shot in a long-running dispute about Europe's subsidies for aircraft-maker Airbus, increasing a 10-percent tariff on European planes to 15-percent.
Robert E. Lighthizer, his chief trade negotiator, issued a 174-page report blasting the World Trade Organization's appellate body for 'chronically' violating its own rules and undermining U.S. rights. U.S. officials are also considering a frontal assault on WTO limits on the tariffs that the United States can charge other nations.
The flurry of activity is evidence that despite two years of intense bargaining with multiple countries and whiplash-inducing tariff threats, the president still has a lengthy to-do list on trade.
'Prior to the election, it's probably a mix of stirring the pot and claiming credit,' said Dean Pinkert, senior counsel at Hughes Hubbard - Reed and a former commissioner with the International Trade Commission.
The president's 'America First' stance has toggled between adversarial and accommodating when it comes to China. On Tuesday, he intervened to quash a Commerce Department plan to restrict the export to China of aircraft engines produced by CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric and Safran SA of France.
'I have seen some of the regulations being circulated, including those being contemplated by Congress, and they are ridiculous,' Trump wrote in a midmorning tweetstorm. 'I want to make it EASY to do business with the United States, not difficult.'
Trump, who dismissed the national security worries cited by supporters of the export ban as an 'excuse,' tweeted after he made it clear in a phone call with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper that he wanted the export licenses for the engines approved, according to a person familiar with the matter, who was not authorized to talk to the press and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Still, Trump and his team remain determined to upend the patterns of global trade that emerged after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. In a Feb. 6 speech in Britain, Ross complained that before Trump took office, globalization had 'gotten out of control,' citing as an example the fact that 'it takes 200 suppliers in 43 countries on six continents to make an iPhone.'
Rebalancing global trade so that the United States produces more, and countries such as Germany consume more, is the goal for a president who considers the chronic U.S. merchandise trade deficit a sign of economic weakness.
Speaking in Oxford, Ross suggested that new digital production technologies associated with the 'Fourth Industrial Revolution' could redistribute the production of goods such as textiles and apparel away from developing countries to those with advanced economies, such as the United States.
Those U.S. industries have been in a long-term decline as low-wage foreign rivals have gobbled up market share.
The president's renewed activism means that the business community's hopes for an end to trade-related uncertainty will be disappointed. In a seven-country survey of 1,770 executives for TMF Group, a London-based professional services firm, 39 percent said 'trade wars' were their key concern this year. That was the highest share that any issue received.
'You can no longer assume a relatively benign global trade regime. You have to factor in tariffs,' said Mark Weil, TMF's global chief executive. 'They can be changed extremely quickly. That's just the new reality.'
Trade issues are expected to be at the center of the president's reelection effort, and this month's State of the Union address previewed his central themes.
'Unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that I decided to run for president,' he told a joint session of Congress.
Trump's handling of trade negotiations represents a sharp break with the bipartisan consensus of the past several decades. He prefers negotiating with U.S. trading partners one at a time rather than in larger groups. To gain leverage in those talks, he has wielded tariffs to a greater degree than any U.S. president since the 1930s.
Trump, who frames his policies as designed to benefit workers rather than 'the financial elite,' was rewarded with labor union support for the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), his replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement.
His supporters feel vindicated, and not just by his achievements at the negotiating table. The U.S. economy is in its 11th consecutive year of growth, its longest such run, and the unemployment rate is near a half-century low.
'He had a theory we would get more leverage by using tariffs. He implemented the theory, and he was right,' said Stephen Vaughn, a former general counsel in the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR). 'He said we could do this and it wouldn't have a dramatically harmful effect on the U.S. economy, and he was right about that.'
Ross, in his recent speech, said the president's tariff threats were responsible for the China and USMCA agreements, as well as smaller deals with Japan and South Korea. Yet, rather than serve as a temporary negotiating tool, the vast majority of the tariffs Trump imposed on Chinese products remain in place.
Ross also called the $887-billion deficit between the value of American exports and the larger total of goods imported into the United States in 2018 'unsustainable.' (He spoke before the government released updated figures showing that the gap had narrowed slightly in 2019, to $852-billion.)
The United States runs such deficits with 97 trading partners, although only five "" China, Japan, Mexico, Vietnam and the European Union "" account for 92-percent of the total, he said.
Still, the president's future trade initiatives may confront even tougher obstacles. His Jan. 24 decision to extend tariffs to downstream products made of steel and aluminum already has drawn a legal challenge from a U.S. importer facing an unexpected multimillion-dollar import tab.
In a Feb. 4 complaint to the U.S. Court of International Trade, PrimeSource Building Products of Irving, Tex., argued that the president's extension of his steel and aluminum tariffs was 'unlawful and unconstitutional' and should be blocked.
Trump's action came 638 days after his authority to do so expired, according to the company's complaint. The distributor of building materials said the Commerce Department also had violated the law by not giving notice of the new tariffs or holding a public hearing on the matter.
Chief Judge Timothy C. Stanceu last week barred U.S. customs officials from imposing the new duties on PrimeSource after the company and the government agreed to a temporary cease-fire while the legal challenge proceeds.
A crowded calendar means the president also is unlikely to make progress on major new agreements. Implementing the 'phase one' China deal, including promised Chinese purchases of U.S. products, will preoccupy U.S. and Chinese negotiators for months. That will slow progress toward a second, more ambitious deal, which the president has acknowledged might be delayed until after the November election.
Likewise, initial talks with the European Union have advanced at a glacial pace, and most analysts expect only a partial deal, if that, before November. The president has complained about European barriers to U.S. automobile and farm goods.
'Europe has been treating us very badly,' Trump told almost three dozen governors at the White House on Feb. 10. '. . . They have barriers that are incredible.'
With less than nine months until Election Day, Trump will probably refrain from imposing significant tariffs that could damage the economy, several analysts said. That means his oft-repeated threats to impose tariffs on imported European automobiles are unlikely to be carried out.

TRIGGER FOR TRUMP IMPEACHMENT TRIAL
Dispute over new witnesses still to be resolved
The House will take a historic vote Wednesday on sending two articles of impeachment to the Senate and approving the team of lawmakers who will prosecute President Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors, triggering only the third trial of an American president.
The roll call will come nearly four weeks after a bitterly divided House charged Trump with abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for pressuring Ukraine to launch investigations that would benefit him politically. It will end a political standoff between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) but set the stage for an intense partisan fight in the heat of an election year.
Pelosi informed her Democratic caucus Tuesday morning of the upcoming vote after holding the articles for weeks in hopes of extracting concessions from McConnell on calling new witnesses as part of a Senate trial. McConnell refused "" but the issue is still very much front and center for moderate Senate Republicans balancing party loyalty with difficult reelection battles.
'The American people deserve the truth, and the Constitution demands a trial,' Pelosi said, announcing the vote in a statement. '. . .-The president and the Senators will be held accountable.'
Hours later, the chairs of four House committees released a cache of text messages and documents provided by an associate of Rudolph W. Giuliani, Trump's personal attorney, that revealed new details about his efforts to seek damaging information about Democrats from sources in Ukraine.
'There cannot be a full and fair trial in the Senate without the documents that President Trump is refusing to provide to Congress,' the chairs of the House Intelligence, Oversight and Reform, Judiciary, and Foreign Affairs committees said in a joint statement.
Wednesday's vote sets in motion a ceremonial handoff between chambers, as House impeachment managers physically carry the articles across the Rotunda in a high-profile procession. 
McConnell said Tuesday, however, that opening arguments are unlikely to begin for another week. He sketched out initial steps this week, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. sworn in as the presiding officer and all 100 senators, who will serve as jurors, also sworn in. Then, the Senate will break for the four-day Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend, pushing any debate on rules governing the trial into next week.
While Pelosi didn't announce her prosecution team Tuesday, many senior Democrats expect her to tap House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) and a few others close to the investigation to make the case, closing out weeks of behind-the-scenes lobbying for the starring role in the trial.
'There's a lot of people "" I mean, Adam and Jerry foremost among them "" who have all of the facts at their fingertips, and they're ready to go today,' said Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.). 'I mean, Adam Schiff could present the case this afternoon. So could Jerry.'
The late start complicates Republicans' plan to vote to acquit Trump before the Feb. 4 State of the Union address.
'You know, as I recall, President Clinton gave his State of the Union in the middle of that process, and I would expect "" no reason to believe that same thing wouldn't happen,' said Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.).
The GOP was hoping Trump could use the annual address to pronounce himself exonerated, but now the trial could easily extend past that date, prompting some Republicans, including Rep. Jim Banks (Ind.), to float the idea of postponing the speech.
The timing also raises the prospect of impeachment spilling into the New Hampshire Democratic primary on Feb. 11. Senators running for the presidential nomination, including Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), will soon find themselves stuck in the Senate chamber, unable to campaign "" a situation already complicating any plans ahead of the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses.
For now, how the trial will proceed depends on about half a dozen centrist Senate Republicans and whether they will buck their leadership and side with Democrats on summoning witnesses such as John Bolton. The former national security adviser likened Trump's pressure on Ukraine to a 'drug deal,' according to sworn testimony from a former deputy, Fiona Hill.
The White House stonewalled House investigators, repeatedly blocking witnesses and documents requested in the months-long impeachment probe. While Senate Republican leaders have favored a no-witness strategy, some moderates up for reelection in swing or Democratic states, including Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), are eager to show independence from the party in seeking a credible, robust trial.
Should four Senate Republicans agree on the need to hear more evidence, Democrats could force the issue. Preemptively, Senate Republicans have warned Democrats that should they prevail on securing testimony from witnesses such as Bolton or acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Trump's team will be sure to call its own witnesses, possibly even Hunter Biden, the former vice president's son who was on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.
Trump pressured Ukraine to investigate his potential 2020 rival, Joe Biden, and Hunter Biden.
On Tuesday, McConnell met with a small group of Senate Republicans, including Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.), who told the leader that as long as Democrats insisted on calling witnesses, Republicans should do the same, casting it as 'witness reciprocity,' according to two Republican officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly. McConnell was receptive to Cruz's argument, according to the officials. Cruz spoke about his proposal, and the possibility of seeking Hunter Biden's testimony if Democrats push for Bolton to appear, with others at the weekly GOP lunch.
Politico first reported on the meeting.
After the lunch, McConnell told reporters, 'When you get to that issue, I can't imagine that only the witnesses that our Democratic colleagues would want to call would be called,' McConnell said Tuesday.
Senate Republicans have been coalescing around an argument that it was the House's duty "" not the Senate's "" to question firsthand witnesses who spoke to Trump about Ukraine. The White House repeatedly rejected impeachment investigators' summonses for members of Trump's inner circle, but House Democrats declined to appeal to the courts to force the matter, citing the slow litigation process.
In a floor speech Tuesday, McConnell argued that congressional investigators took 14 months to look into Watergate before President Richard Nixon's resignation and accused Pelosi of trying to short-circuit the process. 'They pulled the plug early because the facts were never the point; the point was to check a political box,' McConnell said.
The push for witnesses also complicates Democrats' internal dynamics. If impeachment managers argue during the trial that they need more evidence and additional witnesses, that could undermine their case that the facts are clear and that Trump should be removed from office.


Those 'two things cannot both be true,' McConnell said. 'House Democrats' case cannot simultaneously be so robust that it was enough to impeach in the first place . . . but also so weak that the Senate needs to go fishing.' 
House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) said Tuesday that the two aren't mutually exclusive. 'We've made our case,' he said. 'But I think the case can be amplified.' 
In addition, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) argued that the House's case was already 'overwhelming' in support of Trump's removal but that there was no harm in pushing for more.
'The case is already there "" these witnesses and documents simply add to it,' he said. 
Not every Democrat agrees. Several warned on Tuesday that it could be a mistake for the prosecutors themselves to focus on the need for additional evidence "" and said they should instead rely on outside political pressure to make that case.
'Witnesses can buttress the case, can maybe convince people with additional testimony as to the accuracy and validation of what we presented to them. But they're not essential,' said Rep. Gerald E. Connolly (D-Va.).
Multiple Democrats, however, compared the House impeachment to a grand jury indictment "" one that presents sufficient but not complete evidence for a conviction "" and said it would be appropriate to push for additional witnesses.
'It's hard to imagine how you decide this case and decide whether or not the president should be convicted of these very serious charges before us without evidence being presented by way of witnesses and documents,' said Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.). 'I think obviously the impeachment managers will make that case.'
The debate over witnesses unfolds as Republicans confronted one internal dispute. Senate Republicans have rebuffed Trump's weekend demand that their chamber move immediately to dismiss charges against him rather than hold a trial. 
'Little or no sentiment in our conference for a motion to dismiss,' McConnell told reporters.
He has argued privately to the president that there would not be enough votes to dismiss the case, which could create embarrassing optics for him, according to one individual close to the senator who was not authorized to speak publicly and so spoke on the condition of anonymity.

STOCKTON, Calif. "" Mike Bloomberg's rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination clamor that the White House is not for sale "" not even for a buyer worth $60-billion. On the debate stage as well as the campaign trail, they castigate him as an out-of-touch plutocrat unfairly injecting hundreds of millions of dollars into the political system to manipulate democracy.
Yet here in Stockton, a central California crossroads where low-wage warehouse workers feel left out of the economic boom and the bustling immigrant community has been under siege by President Trump's crackdown, voters have a different take on Bloomberg's wealth.
Many Democrats here said they didn't know that much about the former New York mayor until he started popping up on television in recent weeks. But after an unprecedented advertising blitz in the run-up to the March-3 Super Tuesday contests "" when California's primary will be the biggest prize of all "" they have begun repeating Bloomberg's slogan: 'Mike will get it done.'
Lynn Silva, 66, a retired special-education instructor for incarcerated adults, is a lifelong Democrat. The Trump era has made her so anxious and so worried for the country that she can no longer stand to listen to the television when the president is speaking. Her list of favorites to run against him is long and ever-changing, but she is starting to conclude that Bloomberg, hardly her first choice to be the Democratic standard-bearer, may be 'the ultimate candidate' for a coldly calculated reason: He has the money to win.
'I don't care that he's a billionaire trying to buy the election,' she said. 'If that's what it takes to beat Trump, that's fine. I loved [Sen. Kamala D. Harris], but look at her: Out. I loved [Sen.] Cory Booker, but look at him: Out. No money.'
'These aren't regular times,' Silva added. 'We've got to get Trump out. That's the bottom line.'
Bloomberg is banking, literally, on Democratic voters across California and throughout the nation arriving at a similar conclusion. He hopes they will look past this week's feeble debate performance, ignore his history as a Republican and tune out the allegations of misogyny and racial insensitivities in his past "" deciding that the imperative to defeat Trump is so great that they can persuade themselves to love the multibillionaire simply because he's a multibillionaire.

Bloomberg, who founded a media and information company that bears his name, is worth an estimated $60 billion and has pledged to spend whatever it takes to win. He has been a candidate for just three months, but his campaign has reported spending a staggering $464-million through Feb.-1 "" $259-million of that on television advertising. 
Bloomberg's candidacy is challenging the adage in politics that buying your way into office is a net negative. Instead, Bloomberg is pitching his wealth as one of his greatest assets.
'I'm a philanthropist who didn't inherit his money but made his money, and I'm spending that money to get rid of Donald Trump, the worst president we have ever had,' Bloomberg said in Wednesday night's debate. 'And if I can get that done, it will be a great contribution to America and to my kids.'
The other Democratic candidates ascribed darker motives to Bloomberg. Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., said Bloomberg 'thinks he can buy this election.'
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) blasted Bloomberg for embodying 'a corrupt political system' and warned that 'real change never takes place from the top on down, never takes place from an oligarchy controlled by billionaires.'
And Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) likened Bloomberg to Trump, warning that 'Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.'
Yet here in California, where recent polls show Sanders leading the field and Bloomberg rising into contention, one likely primary voter after another said they were warming to the former New York mayor. 
As he was getting off work at a shopping mall in Stockton, Michael Rabago, 25, said that he wants more than anything to deny Trump a second term "" and that Bloomberg's billions make him the guy to do it.
'Money buys votes, and I just hope Trump doesn't win again,' Rabago said. 'I think it's going to take a rich guy to beat Trump. I personally want Bernie to win, but money is everything. That's sad to say, but that's how it is. I always see Bloomberg's commercials on TV: 'Mike for 2020.' '

Faidrian Smith, 49, said she has decided to vote for Bloomberg for a simple reason: 'If you don't have the money to fight him, Trump is going to win the election. Period.'
Smith, who is black and works as a driver for a food-delivery service, said as she dashed into a restaurant here to pick up a customer's order that she feels a personal imperative to defeat Trump.
'He's made racism so blunt and in-your-face now, and we have to change that,' Smith said. 'I'm not saying Mike Bloomberg should buy the election. But money helps. It makes him stronger.'
Bloomberg's wealth was a turnoff for some other voters here. Diana Gatewood, 61, a retired special-needs care worker, said: 'He's trying to buy our votes. It does take money to make the world go around, but just because he's a billionaire doesn't mean he's doing right by people.'
Gatewood said she has not decided whom to vote for in the March-3 primary, but she's leaning toward Sanders, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Tom Steyer, another billionaire who is self-funding his campaign but has had far more limited success than Bloomberg. 
Synthia, 57, a retired parole officer who declined to provide her last name for fear of political retribution, acknowledged that Bloomberg's billions would prove helpful in the general election but said she was disinclined to vote for him. 
'How does he help the people "" the underdogs, the working-class, the blue-collar?' she asked. 'I think he's playing a political game. . . . We're not pawns in a game. We're people with lives. At the end of the day, we go home to our bills and our stressors, and these billionaires go home to their rich lives.'

Bloomberg has a prominent and enthusiastic champion here in Michael Tubbs, Stockton's dynamic young black mayor and a self-described liberal Democrat.
Tubbs, 29, was elected mayor on the same night in 2016 that Trump was elected president, and he quickly began to fully comprehend what Trump's presidency meant for his city of about 311,000.
In his first few months as mayor, Tubbs said, he spent most of his time not on crime or roads or other typical municipal matters, but on immigration "" specifically, trying to reassure his constituents, roughly one-third of whom are foreign-born, that despite the president's rhetoric and the harsh crackdown on illegal immigration that he authorized, they would continue to have sanctuary in Stockton.
'Donald Trump is literally an existential threat,' Tubbs said. 'Their way of life, their way of being, their way of interacting in the community has been changed by his presidency, and the top priority has to be to get him out.'
Tubbs described Stockton as a microcosm of America, a diverse melting pot in which 45-percent of residents are white and the median household income is just $51,000, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. The city is a transportation and logistics hub, meaning many jobs here pay low wages, at least relative to Silicon Valley and California's other booming metropolises. 
Tubbs is a sort-of Bloomberg protege. He graduated from a Harvard University mayoral training program that Bloomberg funds and said he tries to model his use of data in running Stockton's municipal affairs after Bloomberg's administration in New York. 
As he considered which candidate to support for president, Tubbs first gravitated toward Harris, one of his home state's Democratic senators. But once she was out of the race, he eyed Bloomberg, who agreed to make Stockton his first stop in California as a candidate.
Since Bloomberg's visit here in December, Tubbs has been an evangelist for his candidacy, explaining to his working- and middle-class constituents why they should put their faith in a Manhattan billionaire.
'I tell people, 'Beating Donald Trump is the top priority,' ' Tubbs said. 'Donald Trump and the Republican Party are playing to win.' By nominating one of the other candidates, Tubbs argued, Democrats would be 'unilaterally disarming' in the face of Trump's campaign war chest.
'You can't beat Donald Trump with no money,' Tubbs said. 'It's just not happening. You're going to have to have the resources to compete and also to build up the infrastructure in states so that something like Donald Trump doesn't happen again, and Bloomberg has shown a willingness to do that.'

Democrats are seizing on the spread of the coronavirus to emphasize what they see as a major vulnerability for President Trump on an issue voters consistently rank as a top concern: health care. 
Republican efforts to undo the Affordable Care Act, including a current Supreme Court case, were already central to Democratic argument that Trump is sabotaging the health system, and they contend that the spread of a mystifying global pandemic only strengthens that case.
""How could it be that when we spend so much more than what other countries are spending, we have millions of people who may be dealing with the virus but they cannot go to the doctor because they can't afford it?"" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said Friday. ""What this crisis is beginning to teach us is that we are only as safe as the least insured person in America.""
Trump, who has spent recent weeks meeting with executives from the health-care industry, has struggled with the issue since Republicans in 2017 failed to repeal the ACA, falling short on a repeated campaign promise. Instead, the effort boosted the popularity of the ACA, also known as Obamacare, and Democrats notched major victories in the 2018 midterms by criticizing the GOP on health care.
Last week, former president Barack Obama released a video message to supporters highlighting the upcoming 10-year anniversary of the ACA, saying that Republicans are still seeking ways ""rip away the care that millions of Americans rely on.""
The number and proportion of Americans without health insurance grew in 2018 for the first time in a decade, according to the most recent census figures. The figures showed that the uninsured rate increased to 8.5 percent from 7.9 percent the year before. More than 27.5 million U.S. residents lack coverage. 
Many critiques of Trump's handling of the outbreak have focused on competence. As Democrats turn to health care, they are zeroing in on issues such as the Trump administration's decision to allow the sale of cheaper insurance policies that provide less coverage, saying it gave Americans more choice.
But Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) said at a recent committee hearing that such policies are not required to cover tests or vaccines, which makes it ""much harder for people to get the care they need to keep this crisis under control.""
The White House disagrees, pointing to moves by the administration that encourage insurance companies to provide free coronavirus testing. On Friday, Trump gave his support to bipartisan House legislation that provides free coronavirus testing for uninsured people.
Trump claimed credit for the provision, though it was pushed by Democrats who have long criticized his administration for not doing enough to protect the uninsured. ""This Bill will follow my direction for free CoronaVirus tests,"" Trump tweeted on Friday. 
During a news conference in the White House Rose Garden, Trump also said his administration was working with Google to build a screening website for Americans looking for information about testing. Still, within hours, several discrepancies emerged between the White House and Google versions of what the site will be able to do, where it will do it and when.
Both Sanders and former vice president Joe Biden, the major contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, have been making regular statements on the outbreak, seeking to contrast their approach with Trump's. Sanders in particular says that the pandemic demonstrates the need for Medicare-for-all, his universal coverage plan, under which testing and vaccines would be free.
Biden, for his part, touts ACA's success in increasing coverage and has promised to add a government-run ""public option"" that Americans could sign up for if they want.



Trump has blasted Sanders's Medicare-for-all plan as unworkable and overly expensive, and his campaign says Biden's less ambitious plan would also raise costs for taxpayers. Trump's allies, meanwhile, have been touting the president's record on health care in recent weeks, citing efforts to increase funding for opioid treatment and actions to increase transparency in medical billing.
""President Trump offers the American public lower costs, more choice, and better care, along with ensuring care for Americans with preexisting conditions,"" campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said in a lengthy statement highlighting Trump's record.
White House spokesman Judd Deere added that Democrats are pushing ""radical plans"" that would take health care away from millions of Americans. 
""Under the previous administration, Americans saw their premiums skyrocket, and it was the Trump administration that stabilized the market, giving consumers certainty,"" Deere said.
But Democrats see a vulnerability. At a campaign rally in St. Louis on Monday, Sanders seized on Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar's reluctance to promise that a coronavirus vaccine would be available to the public at an affordable price.
Sanders did not mention Azar by name, but he noted that ""Trump's people"" have said they can't guarantee the vaccine's affordability, prompting boos from the crowd.
""I mean, this is how sick the system is. So let me tell you, [when I'm] elected president, everybody in this country will get that vaccine absolutely free,"" Sanders said to cheers.
Azar said in a letter to Congress that the government would work with the private sector to ensure that the vaccine is affordable.
As the Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments in the ACA lawsuit, Trump has opted not to release a replacement health-care proposal should the law be thrown out. He has said he would put forward comprehensive health-care legislation only after the upcoming election, and only if Republicans regain full control of Congress. A final ruling from the Supreme Court could come next year.
That follows a dramatic turnaround in the politics of health care. After the enactment of the ACA in 2010, Republicans regularly denounced it as government overreach, pledging to overturn it at the earliest opportunity.
But when Republicans won unified control of the government in 2016, they were unable to come up with a replacement or muster the votes to repeal the health law. Instead, as more Americans became alarmed at the notion of losing the ACA, its popularity increased.
Now the administration's shaky handling of the coronavirus outbreak is further alarming some Republicans, given that pollsters regularly find health care at the top of voters's concerns.
In response, the president and his team have been trying to reassure the public, holding regular news conferences on the outbreak. ""Anyone who wants a test can get a test,"" Trump said earlier this month, though that was later contradicted by other officials. 
The lack of adequate testing kits, a problem acknowledged by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, reflects the flawed response by the Trump administration, said Ben Sommers, a doctor who teaches at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Trump's attempts to weaken the ACA will make it harder for people to access the tests once they become widely available, he said. 
""People have to come forward and get tested,"" Sommers said. ""Getting referred by seeing doctors or nurses who say, 'Yep, this is a patient who is at risk and needs to be tested' - that doesn't happen when someone is scared to get health care because they can't afford it.""
A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Human Services said the decision on whether to charge for coronavirus testing will be made by the states. People without insurance can receive care at community health centers at a reduced cost or free, the spokesperson said.
Congress and the administration, as well as the states, have spent weeks grappling with how the uninsured will get treatment amid the coronavirus outbreak. Some Republicans have joined Democrats in calling for the government to provide not only free coronavirus testing but also treatment for the uninsured. 
""You can look at it as socialized medicine,"" Rep. Ted Yoho (R-Fla.) told digital news site HuffPost earlier this month. ""But in the face of an outbreak, a pandemic, what's your options?""
Trump has publicly complained about how his record on health care is viewed by voters. At a March 5 town hall in Pennsylvania, he answered a question about health care by saying his accomplishments had not gotten their due. 
""It's a great question and very important - health care,"" he said. ""And I think it's probably the thing that I'm most disappointed that I haven't been able to say what a good job we've done. I haven't been able to sell what a great job we've done.""
During a meeting last week with insurance executives, Trump used his televised remarks to talk about his efforts to help the cruise industry and airline industry. He spoke only briefly about health care.

President Trump's legal team offered a startling defense Wednesday as senators debated his fate in the impeachment trial, arguing that presidents could do nearly anything so long as they believe their reelection is in the public interest.
The assertion from Alan Dershowitz, one of the attorneys representing the president, seemed to take GOP senators by surprise, and few were willing to embrace his argument. At the same time, Republican lawmakers were sounding increasingly confident about defeating a vote expected Friday over calling new witnesses in the trial, an issue that has consumed the Senate for the past several days.
Dershowitz made his comments as the Senate launched into a question-and-answer session in the second week of the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history. Following a model established during President Bill Clinton's impeachment, senators wrote their questions on slips of paper that Senate pages passed to Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is presiding over the trial. Roberts then read the questions out loud from the dais, glancing over his glasses as he addressed the queries either to the White House defense team or the seven House Democratic impeachment managers.
Dershowitz's remarks came in response to a question from Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) about quid pro quos, one of the offenses Trump is alleged to have committed. Democrats impeached Trump last month on a charge of abuse of power, alleging he withheld military aid and a White House visit from Ukraine until Kyiv announced investigations into his political opponents, and also charged him with obstruction of Congress.
'If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment,' asserted Dershowitz.
The law professor went on to say that if a president were to tell a foreign leader he was going to withhold funds unless his foreign counterpart built a hotel with his name on it and gave him a million-dollar kickback, 'That's an easy case. That's purely corrupt and in the purely private interest.'
'But a complex middle case is: 'I want to be elected. I think I'm a great president. I think I'm the greatest president there ever was. And if I'm not elected, the national interest will suffer greatly,' ' Dershowitz said. 'That cannot be an impeachable offense.'
Dershowitz's argument Wednesday extended a line of reasoning he had advanced earlier this week, when he contended that even if proved, the charges against Trump would not constitute impeachable offenses. Some GOP senators were quick to latch on to that earlier argument, especially in the wake of leaks from an unpublished book by former national security adviser John Bolton directly linking Trump to the conditioning of security assistance to Ukraine. Bolton wrote about a conversation in which Trump discussed delaying the aid until Ukraine announced politically charged investigations, including into former vice president Joe Biden, a front-runner for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and his son Hunter.
But Dershowitz's new and more expansive line of defense left some Republicans uncertain how to respond, while infuriating Democrats.
'I couldn't comment on that because I'm not a constitutional lawyer,' said Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.). He also insisted that he put stock in Dershowitz's argument 'only in the context of how it applies to the Ukraine, which has had corruption, and that the Bidens were there with an argument that you can't say they had their hands clean.'
Earlier this week, Braun praised Dershowitz for giving senators a framework through which to look at all questions about the impeachability of presidential actions. On Wednesday, a few moments after insisting he only put stock in Dershowitz insofar as it related to Ukraine, he repeated that Dershowitz 'gave everyone a framework within which to look at' questions of impeachability.
Meanwhile, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) slowly separated himself from a defense of Dershowitz "" before slipping away from the conversation entirely.
'I think when you conflate all the issues, you can kind of, to a point when you're asking a question in a silo, which is inconsistent with what we just heard today,' Scott said. 'So I want to separate myself from that part of the conversation because ultimately, I think the premise itself is flawed and I don't want to agree with that necessarily.'
Multiple Democrats, including Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), skewered Dershowitz's argument to the point of mockery.
'His argument was beyond absurd. I thought he made absolutely no sense "" because he essentially said that if President Trump believes his election is for the good of the American people that he could do whatever he wants,' Gillibrand said. 'He is wrong, and I think he's made a laughable argument that undermines the president's case.'
The claims in Bolton's book, due out in March, go to the heart of Democrats' impeachment charges against Trump.
But while prosecuting their case in the House, Democrats had no firsthand witnesses, leading Republicans to dismiss much of their case as hearsay. Bolton could provide that firsthand evidence, and the revelations from his manuscript Sunday set off heated debate among Senate Republicans over whether to call him as a witness.
A few moderate Republicans have indicated they want to hear from Bolton, leading Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to privately caution colleagues Tuesday that he might not have the votes to shut down a motion expected Friday to call for new witnesses. Only four Republicans would need to defect and join Democrats in order for a vote to call witnesses to succeed.
McConnell wants to avoid calling additional witnesses, since it could extend the contentious proceedings into unpredictable territory. But by Wednesday, leading Republicans were sounding more confident. Trump is set to deliver his State of the Union address Feb. 4, and Republicans would like to have the impeachment trial behind them by that point.
'My sense is we will get there,' said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.), a key McConnell ally.
'I'm pretty confident that people will say we heard from the 17 witnesses in the House and saw all the documents they generated,' Cornyn added. 'I don't know what any additional witnesses would add, other than prolonging the trial and leading to a months-long battle over executive privilege.'
For his part, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) sounded glum about the prospect of getting additional witnesses.
'The president and Mitch McConnell put huge pressure on these folks,' Schumer told reporters during a break in the proceedings. 'So I hope we can get witnesses and documents. It's an uphill fight. Is it more likely than not? Probably no. But is it a decent, good chance? Yes.'
Republicans have insisted that if witnesses were allowed, they would insist on calling their own, such as the Bidens. But an initial vote on allowing witnesses would have to be followed by additional votes on which ones to call, and most Democrats insist they won't agree to witnesses for the White House.
Either way, Trump remains highly likely to be acquitted by the Senate in the end, as a two-thirds vote would be required to convict him.
Wednesday's question-and-answer session provided a window into the thinking of some members of the Senate, who have had to remain silently in their seats throughout the proceedings, instead of talking at length during occasional appearances in the Senate chamber, which is their usual practice.
At one point late Wednesday afternoon, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) tried to ask a fact-finding question that would get into the president's motive in delaying the military aide to Ukraine: Before that issue arose last summer, had Trump ever mentioned the Bidens in relation to corruption to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's predecessor?
Deputy White House Counsel Patrick Philbin declined to answer, saying he would only answer questions that were related to issues in the record that House investigators had assembled.
House Democratic impeachment managers repeatedly made the point that if senators want more direct information, all they need to do is call Bolton to testify.
'The Senate can get to the truth by calling witnesses,' said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.).
Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) drafted a question that would name the anonymous whistleblower whose complaint about Trump's Ukraine dealings triggered the impeachment inquiry, but Roberts has declined to read it, according to two officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.
But many of the questions submitted by senators "" more than 80 of them by the time the proceedings neared 10 p.m. "" simply appeared designed to allow one side or the other to repeat points they have made over the past week and a half, as first the House managers and then the White House team presented their cases. There have been 16 hours total allotted for questions, eight for each side, and the questioning picks up again Thursday.
Meanwhile Wednesday, away from the Senate chamber, representatives for Bolton disputed claims by the White House that his book contained classified information that could prevent its publication. And former attorney general Jeff Sessions, a frequent and public target of Trump's ire while he served in the administration, picked a fight with Bolton, declaring that he himself had chosen not to write a book because 'I don't believe it is the honorable thing to do.'

White House lawyers are gearing up for a scorched-earth defense of President Trump in the impeachment trial, mounting a politically charged case aimed more at swaying American voters than GOP senators "" and damaging Trump's possible 2020 opponent, Joe Biden.
 Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, and Jay Sekulow, Trump's personal attorney, plan to use their time in the trial to target the former vice president and his son, Hunter, according to multiple GOP officials familiar with the strategy. Trump's allies believe that if they can argue that the president had a plausible reason for requesting the Biden investigation in Ukraine, they can both defend him against the impeachment charges and gain the added bonus of undercutting a political adversary. 
The strategy "" aimed squarely at muddying the waters surrounding the two impeachment articles of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress "" carries potential risk. Some congressional Republicans have encouraged the White House to prioritize a line-by-line rebuttal of the Democrats' case, ensuring that wary moderates are provided enough cover to vote for Trump's acquittal. It is unclear whether going after a former colleague will sway that core constituency, protecting moderates from possible political blowback at home "" though a senior administration official made clear that Trump's legal team would try to do both.
The official, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter frankly.
The offensive will mark the first time lawmakers or the public have heard a full-throated White House defense. The president's attorneys rejected the House invitation to participate in the last phase of the impeachment inquiry, making their presentation "" expected Saturday and Monday "" the team's first major turn in the spotlight. 
Until now, the White House has struggled to address why Trump froze military aid to Ukraine and repeatedly postponed a promised White House meeting with newly elected President Volodymyr Zelensky while pressing for investigations of the Bidens and an unfounded conspiracy theory about Ukraine interfering in the 2016 election. The White House also has had difficulty explaining why Trump's personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani was the point person on policy toward the Eastern European nation. 
In October, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney openly admitted that a quid pro quo occurred, telling reporters to 'get over it' "" though he later walked back the comments. 
Trump is eager for his team to take the stage and has been trying to strategically time it to maximize TV viewership. He has told allies that while he's fine with the defense beginning its presentation Saturday for a few hours starting at 10 a.m. "" in part because he hopes it will drive discussions on Sunday morning talk shows "" he prefers the bulk of their arguments to happen Monday when more Americans will be watching television, according to White House officials who were not authorized to speak publicly. 
'After having been treated unbelievably unfairly in the House, and then having to endure hour after hour of lies, fraud - deception by Shifty Schiff, Cryin' Chuck Schumer - their crew, looks like my lawyers will be forced to start on Saturday, which is called Death Valley in T.V.,' Trump tweeted Friday morning. 
The emerging strategy comes as the White House has heard conflicting advice from Republicans eager to share their opinion on the best rebuttal. In recent weeks, there has been a quiet, behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign by both GOP senators and Trump's House allies on his defense team, creating confusion among Republicans about which strategy the White House will adopt.
The deliberations occasionally have been marked by intense discussions, including debates about whether to push a process-focused case against Democrats or to take on each of their points and accusations individually, according to senators and congressional aides familiar with the talks. Over the past 24 hours, the debate has focused more on how much time should be dedicated to going after the Bidens. 
Those divergent views were on full display in the Capitol this week. Rep. Lee Zeldin, a New York Republican advising Trump's defense team, told reporters that Trump's lawyers needed to re-litigate what is considered a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election to help Hillary Clinton "" and, therefore, justified Trump pushing Ukraine to investigate the matter. But some Senate Republicans, including No. 2 leader John Thune (S.D.), want the White House to avoid what they consider a baseless conspiracy theory. 
'I think the intelligence community has very conclusively determined that it was Russia "" and not Ukraine "" that interfered in the 2016 election, so … I guess that's not a direction I would have them go,' Thune said.
Other Senate Republicans, including Trump ally Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), have publicly pushed back on a key White House legal team talking point: that the charges against the president do not constitute a crime and therefore his actions are not impeachable. 
Trump himself actively recruited lawyer and TV commentator Alan Dershowitz at a Mar-a-Lago buffet to make that very argument "" then sought out Dershowitz's wife to help persuade him to do it. 'He wants me to make the argument that the case does not meet the grounds for impeachment,' said Dershowitz. 'He knows that I feel very strongly about constitutional issues.'
Democrats, meanwhile, have been bracing for this moment, anxious about the Trump team getting 24 hours without any interruptions and pushback from impeachment managers. That concern only grew after Trump's lawyers uttered several inaccuracies on the Senate floor Tuesday, including a claim that House Republicans were not allowed to question witnesses during closed-door depositions. They could, and they did.
Democrats want to ensure that the Trump team doesn't get the last word, in part by using some of the allotted 16 hours of questions and answers to correct any misstatements. 
'I'm concerned about their deceptive and misleading statements,' said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), promising that Democrats would 'ask questions that are, in effect, an invitation to set the record straight.'
Democrats have been anticipating that the defense would shift attention from Trump's alleged misconduct to focus on the Bidens. That, in part, is what drove House managers to devote a considerable portion of their Thursday presentation to a preemptive rebuttal on those points, arguing that several Republicans and Europeans had supported Biden's efforts to push out corrupt former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin. 
Trump and Republicans have accused Biden "" without proof "" of ousting Shokin because the prosecutor was investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that employed Hunter Biden on its board while the elder Biden was vice president. Republicans also have pointed to concerns about the appearance of a conflict of interest, which were expressed by some of the Democrats' top witnesses in the impeachment inquiry.
'The House managers sort of drove a knife through the heart of those false arguments ahead of time … and I think that will help make the case,' Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters Thursday. 
Not all Republicans are eager about a singular focus on the former vice president. In an unusual role-reversal, Trump's most aggressive House allies have urged the legal team to focus on trying to undercut the Democrats' timeline and arguments.
'You can't talk about corruption broadly without talking about Burisma and Hunter Biden's involvement,' said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who also is assisting the defense team. 'That being said, I think the vast majority of this emphasis is on what were the components that led the president to ultimately release the aid.' 
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and his top attorney on the House Oversight Committee, Steve Castor, both of whom participated in the House investigation, have been working with the Trump team to try to highlight what they see as weak spots in the impeachment case.
As the impeachment managers showed clips of Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland confirming a quid pro quo, Jordan has pushed for the team to counter by highlighting Sondland's changing statements as well as his own admission that he never heard such a directive from Trump.
'Remember, Sondland is the guy who had to amend his testimony, the guy who had to clarify his testimony, is the guy they rely on the most?' Jordan said.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) has been on the other side of the argument, working closely with the White House and meeting with Trump's legal team as recently as Thursday evening to encourage them to go hard on Hunter Biden's Burisma position. 
'Focus on what matters, which is the substance,' he said on Hugh Hewitt's radio show Friday morning, summarizing his advice to Trump's team. 'And I told them, 'Look, nothing matters more than the facts on Burisma.' . . . Lay out substantive, factual reasons why investigating Burisma, the president had a responsibility to do so.'
Senate Republicans said they have been eager to hear what Trump's team has to say "" in part because they don't know what line of attack it will take. Privately, some Republican senators have groused in recent days that the Trump team is 'everywhere but nowhere,' as one described the dynamic, speaking on the condition anonymity to give a frank assessment.
'They are on TV and at the Capitol yelling at the Democrats, but I'm not really sure what the whole range of the argument is. Are you?' the GOP senator asked, adding that the frustration was shared by other Republicans.

As the Democratic primary contest moves from the chaos of the Iowa caucuses to New Hampshire, one truth about the 2020 presidential race remains clear: Small donors are ascendant. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who leads in Granite State polls, announced Thursday that he'd raised $25 million in January from more than 648,000 people. In this election cycle, the top five Democratic candidates have raised about $171 million from small donors, led by Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), each of whom procured more than 60 percent of their funds from that source. Small donations "" those under $200 "" are now the single largest source of funding in the presidential campaign, the culmination of a trend that has reshaped American politics at all levels.
The Internet has made it almost frictionless for candidates to solicit small contributions "" and they're rolling in. President Trump, without a major primary challenger, has still raised $44 million (55 percent of his contributions) from small donors. The Democratic Party amplified the importance of such donations by making the number of small donors a candidate attracted one of two criteria "" standing in the polls was the other "" for determining who could participate in its debates.
In recent years, commentators have hailed the emerging power of small donors in romantic and grandiose terms. Harvard's Larry Lessig has proclaimed small-donor funding nothing less than a way to 'reclaim' our republic; in the American Prospect, Mark Schmitt celebrated 'the revolutionary potential of small-donor democracy'; and the nonprofit Every Voice asserted that small donations 'put everyday Americans back at the center of our government.'
Previously, many reformers concerned about the role of big money in politics pressed for publicly financed elections, the mechanism by which many other countries "" as well as states including Arizona, Connecticut and Maine "" fund their elections. In these 'clean election' systems, candidates receive public funds in return for agreeing to limit their spending and private fundraising. But instead of seeking to extend such programs to congressional races (and reviving the all-but-defunct one for presidential candidates), reformers are now trumpeting small-donor 'matching programs.' The first bill introduced in the post-2018 Democratic House would provide $6 in public funds to candidates for every $1 they raise from small donors (up to a certain amount, determined by a complex formula). 'The transformative power of a small donor matching program would be profound,' the Brennan Center for Justice has declared.
But there has been too little public debate about the effects of dramatically increasing the impact of small donations. In particular, empirical studies suggest that online fundraising is prone to the same polarizing dynamics and viral spirals we see in online political discourse generally. The candidates who thrive on small-donor financing are those who generate the most social media attention, often because they come from the ideological poles of the parties. Small-donor matching programs are thus not politically neutral: They disfavor moderates and empower the ideological extremes. Before reformers race to abandon more traditional forms of public financing, we need to weigh carefully these polarizing effects against the 'democratizing' aspect of small donations.
The small-donor phenomenon is quite recent. In presidential elections, Howard Dean's 2004 insurgent campaign first seized upon the Internet's fundraising potential. Barack Obama then convincingly drove home the emerging power of small donors in 2008, raising 24 percent of his funds from them (a figure he enhanced in 2012, with 28 percent). Indeed, Obama's success with online fundraising motivated him to become the first major-party nominee to reject public financing, an option available for presidential elections since the early 1970s; that move freed him to spend more money than the public program would have permitted. Once Obama did that, all subsequent nominees did, too, effectively destroying what had already devolved into an anemically funded program. Far and away the most successful small-donor presidential candidate so far, however, was Donald Trump in 2016: He raised 69 percent of his individual contributions from small donors (three times as much as Hillary Clinton), for a total of $239 million.
Small donors have played a significant role in House and Senate races for even less time. Congressional candidates nearly doubled their share of funds from small donors from 2016 to 2018 "" to 12 percent for House contenders and 22 percent for Senate candidates. In the 2018 midterms, Democrats won the small-donor race (thanks in part to the online platform ActBlue, through which donors can contribute to all candidates), but Republicans are racing to catch up (they now have the similar WinRed).
The problem with romanticizing small-donor matching policies is that they bump up against the fundamental logic of American political participation: Those who take part most actively tend to be more ideologically extreme than those who participate less. It is not 'everyday Americans' and 'ordinary citizens' on whose choices public small-donor matching programs would turn; it is that subset who are so engaged with politics that they undertake more intensive action.
Academic studies show that individual donors cluster at the 'very liberal' or 'very conservative' poles of the ideological spectrum, with few in the middle. The distribution of non-donors is more even across the spectrum: Forty five percent of non-donors describe themselves as moderates, compared with 16 percent of donors. Unlike many business groups, which traditionally have contributed across the political spectrum to buy access, most individual donors give for ideological reasons. And small donors are at least as ideologically extreme as other individual donors "" perhaps more so.
Research also shows that more ideologically extreme legislators raise a greater proportion of their money from individual donors than other candidates. Indeed, while close races typically attract more funds, one recent study of House elections from 2006 to 2010 found that the effect of an incumbent's extremism on small-donor support was three times as great as the tightness of the race. These findings should not be surprising: They echo the history of pre-Internet, direct-mail fundraising appeals to small donors, when more extreme language unleashed the most money and more ideologically extreme candidates did the best. And money from outside a district is likely to be even more polarized than local funds; nonetheless, the bill passed last year in the House would provide its 6 to 1 match no matter where the money comes from. (The House bill isn't even really confined to small donors: One person could spread $5,000 over 25 candidates, for example, and have that matched with $30,000 in public money, so long as they gave no more than $200 to any one candidate.)
Two of the earliest winners in the small-donor game were Reps. Allen West (R-Fla.) and Michele Bachmann (R-Minn.), among the more inflammatory "" and hence most visible "" Republicans in recent memory. (Bachmann once called for a 'penetrating exposé' on whether members of Congress were 'pro-America or anti-America,' while West observed that 'if Joseph Goebbels was around, he'd be very proud of the Democrat Party.') In the 2010 House elections, Bachmann raised more from small donors than all 48 moderate 'Blue Dog' Democratic incumbents combined. In 2018's House races, the winning candidates who raised the highest percentage of their funds from small donors included Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who regularly defended President Trump on cable, raising his profile; Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.), who received massive media coverage after he was shot at a congressional baseball team practice; and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who challenged a Democratic incumbent and is now a leader of the House Democrats' progressive wing.
In the current presidential race, the seven Democrats who raised the greatest share of their money from small donors through the third quarter of 2019 were, in order: Sanders, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, former housing secretary Julián Castro, Warren, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), the self-help author Marianne Williamson and former congressman Beto O'Rourke (Tex.). The list skews toward the progressive wing of the party and toward people whose national followings defy conventional categorization, and noticeably excludes the numerous moderate senators and governors who threw their hats into the ring. It hints at the kinds of candidates who would be rewarded by a small-donation matching program. One of the moderate candidates who failed to catch on, Sen. Michael F. Bennet (Colo.), accurately observed of online fundraising: 'The more extreme you are, the more rewarded you are.'
To be sure, the Internet makes it easier for candidates and small donors to find each other, enabling broader participation and producing a somewhat more egalitarian finance system than one driven solely by bigger donors. But traditional public financing achieves most of these benefits without the downsides. Such financing faces its own challenges "" particularly, ensuring that the size of public grants keeps up with the costs of campaigns (which is where the funding program for presidential elections failed miserably). But before abandoning that alternative too quickly, it is worth keeping in mind that traditional public financing dollars are politically agnostic: They do not reward virality or depend on a candidate's most engaged supporters.
To call attention to the political dynamics of matching small donations is not to take a stance on whether voters should embrace the center or the wings of their parties. But small-donor-based campaign finance policies implicitly do take a position on that issue "" whether their proponents recognize it or not.

The Justice Department must release to congressional Democrats secret grand jury evidence lawmakers are seeking in ongoing investigations into President Trump, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled Tuesday.

The divided ruling, which can be appealed, is a victory for Democratic lawmakers in one of a set of separation-of-powers lawsuits filed before the House voted to impeach President Trump in December and before the Senate acquitted him in February.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit upheld a lower court order that gives Congress access to certain secret material from Robert S. Mueller III's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
The 2-to-1 decision is unlikely to be the final word and does not mean the redacted material from Mueller's final report will be immediately turned over to Congress. The ruling can be appealed to the full court or to the Supreme Court.
Judge Judith W. Rogers found the House in its impeachment investigation was legally engaged in a judicial process that exempts Congress from secrecy rules that typically shield grand jury materials from disclosure. Grand jury records, she noted, are court records - not Justice Department records - and have historically been released to Congress in the course of impeachment investigations involving three federal judges and two presidents.
""Where the Department is legally barred from handing over grand jury materials without court authorization, judicial restraint does not empower Congress; it impedes it,"" wrote Rogers, who was joined by Judge Thomas B. Griffith.
Judge Neomi Rao, dissented, saying the House Judiciary Committee lacks legal grounds to ask the court to enforce a subpoena for the grand jury materials. Rao would have returned the case to District Court to determine whether the committee can still show its ""inquiry is preliminary to an impeachment proceeding and that it has a 'particularized need' for disclosure.""
The Justice Department is reviewing the decision, spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement: ""This important appeals court decision upholds the House's long-standing right to obtain grand jury information pursuant to the House's impeachment power and makes clear that the release of grand jury information is the decision of the federal judiciary - not the Administration."" 
The appeals court was reviewing an earlier ruling from Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell. Justice Department lawyers had urged the appeals court to stay out of a political dispute between Congress and the Trump administration, and said exemptions allowing disclosure in certain cases do not apply to an impeachment proceeding.
Justice Department lawyers suggested a previous Watergate-era ruling affirming that grand-jury materials could be shared with the House during the investigation of President Richard Nixon had been wrongly decided.
But the court majority disagreed, finding that secrecy concerns do not outweigh the House's need to review the material and its investigative powers.
The House Judiciary Committee's ""need for the grand jury materials remains unchanged. The Committee has repeatedly stated that if the grand jury materials reveal new evidence of impeachable offenses, the Committee may recommend new articles of impeachment,"" Rogers wrote in a 26-page opinion.
""Courts must take care not to second-guess the manner in which the House plans to proceed with its impeachment investigation or interfere with the House's sole power of impeachment,"" wrote Rogers, a nominee of former president Bill Clinton.
The committee's lawsuit was filed in July 2019 before the formal start of the impeachment inquiry centered on Trump's alleged effort to pressure Ukraine to investigate former vice president Joe Biden, a potential 2020 political rival. But House lawyers told the court that lawmakers are still trying to determine whether Trump lied in written responses to Mueller's investigators.
Lawmakers said they need access to redacted and underlying materials from Mueller's report to try to establish a pattern of the president's conduct.
Griffith, nominated by former president George W. Bush, wrote separately Tuesday to take issue with the dissent from Rao, a recent Trump nominee.
Griffith authored the D.C. Circuit's divided opinion last week finding the court was not authorized to resolve a separate dispute between the White House and House Democrats over a congressional subpoena for Trump's former counsel Donald McGahn.
In his concurring opinion Tuesday, Griffith wrote, ""As gatekeepers of grand jury information, we cannot sit this one out. The House isn't seeking our help in eliciting executive-branch testimony or documents. Instead, it's seeking access to grand jury records whose disclosure the district court, by both tradition and law, controls. … Although I agree with the dissent that we have an independent obligation to assure ourselves of our jurisdiction,"" Griffith wrote. ""we need not chase jurisdictional phantoms.""

President seeks stay after defamation suit by writer who claims he raped her 

NEW YORK - President Trump wants the benefit of asserting constitutional immunity when he is sued personally even as he files lawsuits against others, undermining his defense in the defamation case brought by a journalist who accused him of raping her years ago, the woman's attorneys argued in court Wednesday.
Trump's personal attorneys asked the judge overseeing E. Jean Carroll's civil case to delay the proceedings, noting that a state appellate court here in Manhattan imposed a stay in another defamation lawsuit brought by former ""Apprentice"" contestant Summer Zervos, who in 2016 accused Trump of sexually assaulting her several years before. 
Trump has denied both women's allegations.
The stay in Zervos's case halts those proceedings until the state's highest court can rule on the presidential immunity question Trump has raised, under the theory that a sitting president cannot face civil or criminal charges in state courts. 
Carroll's legal team has called attention to a lawsuit Trump's campaign brought against the New York Times, claiming libel in an opinion piece about the president's dealings with Russia. The suit was filed Feb. 26, the day before Trump attorneys first asked the court in writing to postpone Carroll's case. Trump's campaign has since sued The Washington Post over two opinion articles discussing Russia's election interference.
Carroll attorney Roberta Kaplan told Justice Verna Saunders that Trump cannot have it both ways - arguing immunity when he is defending a case and then suing
his critics in the media who aim to hold him accountable. 
""That kind of cherry-picking, your honor, is an intolerable abuse of the process,"" Kaplan said. "". . . It belies any contention, any reasonable explanation, that there could be some sort of undue burden on Donald Trump by having to defend this action.""
Carroll's account of being raped more than two decades ago was published in her 2019 book, ""What Do We Need Men For?: A Modest Proposal."" In the memoir, she alleges Trump assaulted her in the dressing room of a Bergdorf Goodman department store on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue. 
Carroll sued Trump in October, accusing him of defamation after Trump called her a liar. The lawsuit, filed in New York State Supreme Court, says that ""Trump lashed out with a series of false and defamatory statements"" and that he ""denied the rape."" 
""But there was more: He also denied ever having met Carroll or even knowing who she was,"" Carroll's civil complaint says. Carroll's legal team says she was harmed personally and professionally by the president's public statements. 
Trump attorney Christine Montenegro argued that the president would ""suffer irreparable harm"" should the Carroll case go forward ""without the benefit of meaningful appellate review.""
She also argued that it was Trump's political campaign - not Trump himself - that has sued the media. 
Kaplan said it was ""obviously absurd"" that Trump did not know his campaign was going to begin a legal battle with the New York Times.
Kaplan proposed a compromise to pausing the case, offering to hold off on seeking a DNA sample from Trump or from taking his deposition while the document-sharing process known as discovery gets underway. Most of the documents would be coming from Carroll's side, she said. 
Carroll hopes to search for DNA on the dress she said she was wearing when she was attacked. Her attorney said the garment is now in safekeeping for use if testing goes forward.
Saunders did not rule on the petition by Trump's team and did not say when she expected to have a decision. Trump's attorney said the appeals court's decision in the Zervos case could come within months, while Kaplan countered that the panel may not even hear arguments until later this year.
""I'm filing this lawsuit not just for myself but for every woman in America who has been grabbed, groped, harassed, sexually assaulted and has spoken up and still has been disgraced, shamed or fired, which happened in my case,"" Carroll told reporters after the proceeding.
Carroll has said previously that Elle magazine dropped her as a columnist after Trump challenged her allegations.

TEL AVIV "" Benny Gantz has packed a full political career into a single tumultuous year. A political neophyte when he jumped into Israel's electoral dogfight in late 2018, he has battled the country's longest-serving leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to a stalemate over the course of two elections.
 Now, as the sides slug their way to a third election in less than a year on March 2, political observers say the nonstop campaign has made the former army general an even more formidable opponent.
 'Sometimes growing so fast makes it challenging, but I wake up every morning very happy with what I am doing because I am serving the cause that I set out to do when I joined politics,' Gantz said in a rare interview.
 A sense of optimism infuses his headquarters, a three-floor operation filled with Tel Aviv hipsters, spare Ikea furniture and playpens for three babies born to staff members since the campaign began. Even after two general elections failed to produce a clear winner and the Israeli public grew increasingly apathetic, those working for Gantz's Blue and White party appear energized.
 That could reflect the fact that the party has an edge in the polls, which put Blue and White ahead of Netanyahu's ruling Likud party in the final weeks. That appears to continue an upward trend since the first election last April, when, as a newly formed party, Blue and White came in a close second behind Likud. By September, it had pulled ahead by some 40,000 votes.
Party staffers also say their calm confidence comes from Gantz himself, an imposing but soft-spoken former army chief of staff "" who received reporters Thursday as he relaxed in an armchair wearing a black sweater, black jeans and black boots.
 'We are like a start-up, adding in other companies very quickly,' said Gantz, reflecting on the process of bringing other parties under the Blue and White umbrella. 'We scaled up very fast, which was a challenge.'
Although he was unable to unseat Netanyahu in the previous elections "" in part because of Israel's coalition-based parliamentary system "" Gantz is now widely viewed as a viable successor to the longtime prime minister.
'Blue and White are definitely improving,' said Anshel Pfeffer, a journalist at Haaretz newspaper and author of 'Bibi: The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu.' 
 'There is less factionalism in the party, and the [leadership] is working well,' Pfeffer said. 'This is their third election campaign, and the last 12 months of campaigning has knitted them all closer together.'
 'Bibi has also helped sharpen their agenda by being so relentless,' said Pfeffer, using Netanyahu's nickname and citing his frequent attacks on political and legal opponents. 'They now make very clear that they are about one thing: getting rid of Bibi.'
 The party's overriding message is that Israel should come before all else "" before ideology, religion and individual needs. It is a dig at Netanyahu, who has been indicted in three criminal cases involving allegations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Gantz has said that his party and Likud could have formed a unity government if the prime minister had stepped aside.
On the campaign trail, Gantz has called for mending the rifts in Israeli society and in the interview for ensuring that the country is 'Jewish, democratic, well-secured, economically prosperous and morally right.'
'As a Jewish people, we must combine strength with morality,' Gantz said in the interview. 'Especially in the Middle East, if you have morality without strength, then you will end up being kicked. If you have strength without morality, then you enter very dangerous areas of extremism.' 
During a year of campaigning, he has become the target of frequent attacks by his opponents, who mocked his unpolished early television interviews and called him soft.
'There is no prize without a price,' he said, brushing aside the attacks. He has largely refrained from hitting back.
 His muted tone, in a political environment where jeering insults are the norm, has drawn criticism. Many see Gantz as too deferential, too passive to take on Israel's many troubles.
 Michael Biton, a Blue and White member of parliament, acknowledged the trials Israel faces, including security threats, economic inequality and social tensions, but said Gantz's growth during the campaign shows he is ready to take them on.
 'He has built the best team possible to respond to Israel's security challenges and proven that he knows how to connect people,' Biton said. 'That is the most important skill of a prime minister.'
 Yair Lapid, a former journalist and senior figure in Blue and White, said the rigors of a long campaign have made Gantz a more mature candidate. 'Three campaigns in a row are difficult circumstances,' Lapid said. 'This has never happened before in this democracy.'
Gantz appears to have grown savvier over the past year.
 Two weeks ago, Vice President Pence invited Gantz to the White House for the unveiling of President Trump's long-anticipated peace plan and said it had been Netanyahu's suggestion that his rival attend. Many political observers saw it as a trap that would showcase Netanyahu's diplomatic prowess and highlight Gantz's lack of experience on the international stage. After days of media speculation that he would turn down Trump's invitation, Gantz surprised his rivals and analysts by announcing he had secured a separate meeting with the president. He would be briefed on the plan one day ahead of Netanyahu. 
 His meeting with Trump lasted half an hour longer than scheduled, and Gantz was happy with his initial visit to the White House. 
Gantz says he generally supports the White House plan, which was rejected by the Palestinian leadership. He has said it reflects fundamental security principles laid out in his party's platform and, in his opinion, offers a basis for a future Middle East accord based on reality on the ground. 
 'I think what makes the peace plan so unique and important is that it looks at the conflict from a reality-based perspective and not from an illusionary perspective,' Gantz said. 'It is very practical, talking about what can be done.'
 He said he believes that both Israelis and Palestinians need new leadership and dismisses comments by some Palestinians that he is no different than Netanyahu.
Some of Netanyahu's right-wing allies have pushed for the immediate annexation of parts of the West Bank that Trump's plan says should remain under Israeli sovereignty. But Gantz has made clear that such steps must wait "" at least until after the March 2 vote.
 'I think we all need to strategically digest the plan, discuss it, think about it, but first finish with this election,' he said. 'Once I will have established a government, I'll make it a priority to promote this plan.'

Racine says $1 million booking at president's hotel violated nonprofit status 
D.C. Attorney General Karl A. Racine sued President Trump's inaugural committee and business Wednesday, alleging that the committee violated its nonprofit status by spending more than $1-million to book a ballroom at Trump's D.C. hotel that its staff knew was overpriced and that it barely used. 
During the lead-up to Trump's January 2017 inauguration, the committee booked the Trump International Hotel ballroom for $175,000 a day, plus more than $300,000 in food and beverage costs, over the objections of its own event planner.
The committee was formed to organize the events around the inauguration, but Racine alleges it instead 'abandoned this purpose and violated District law when it wasted approximately $1-million of charitable funds in overpayment for the use of event space at the Trump hotel.'
'These charges were unreasonable and improperly served to enrich' Trump's business, the complaint reads. He alleges that Trump and his daughter Ivanka Trump were probably aware of the charges, based on documents Racine subpoenaed from the committee and the Trump Organization.
D.C. law requires that nonprofit organizations not operate for the purpose of generating profits for private individuals. In the civil suit, Racine (D) asked for an order from D.C. Superior Court directing that the money be returned and given to charities promoting civic engagement. 
In an email, a spokesman for the Presidential Inaugural Committee said: 'The facts will show that the PIC operated in compliance with the law and this suit is without merit. . . . Despite the PIC's cooperation with his office's investigation, the DC AG did not coordinate with the PIC's legal counsel to interview a single former PIC employee or staff member nor discussed with counsel any particular concerns about the PIC's full compliance with the law. In fact, the PIC has received no outreach from the DC AG since last summer.' 
-In response to previous inquiries about spending by the committee, its chairman, Thomas J. Barrack Jr., issued a statement saying that the inauguration and the more than 20 related events 'were executed in elegance and seamless excellence without incident or interruption, befitting the legacy and tradition that has preceded us.'
The Trump Organization issued a statement Wednesday calling the lawsuit 'an attempt to regulate what discounts it believes the hotel should have provided' and 'a clear PR stunt.'
'The rates charged by the hotel were completely in line with what anyone else would have been charged for an unprecedented event of this enormous magnitude and were reflective of the fact that hotel had just recently opened, possessed superior facilities and was centrally located on Pennsylvania Avenue,' the company said.
The company also released an email from Ivanka Trump to Trump hotel executives saying that the company should charge a 'fair market rate.' 
Racine's lawsuit specifically targets a $1 million deal made between the committee and the Trump Organization for the ballroom during four days around the inaugural, which he alleges was a knowing waste of the nonprofit's resources to benefit the Trumps. Racine has litigated against other nonprofit groups in the past, including charter schools and the organization managing the Howard Theatre. 
Documents submitted with the 18-page complaint show discussions between Trump's company and his inaugural committee, ending in a deal that Racine argues is such a waste of the committee's funds that it violates the law and the organization's mission 'to further the common good and welfare' of American citizens 'by supporting the activities surrounding the 2017 Presidential inauguration.'
Hotel management emailed the committee in November 2016 saying an eight-day package of meeting rooms, food and drinks would cost $3.6-million "" an enormous number even by the standards of luxury hotels during the inauguration. 
Rick Gates, a lobbyist and the committee's deputy chairman, then emailed Ivanka Trump to say that cost 'seems quite high compared to other properties' and said he worried it would generate negative publicity. Ivanka Trump, then an executive at her father's business, responded to say she had directed the hotel's general manager to speak with Gates directly. (Gates was later sentenced to 45 days in jail plus three years probation for conspiracy and lying to the FBI as part of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.)-
After hotel management agreed to charge $175,000 per day for meeting space and to charge separately for food and beverage, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a friend of first lady Melania Trump who had previously produced the Met gala and New York's Fashion Week, expressed alarm, writing that other properties had been offered to the committee at little or no cost. She warned that one of the committee's two planned events at the hotel was for the Trump family and that 'when this is audited it will become public knowledge.' 
Wolkoff said the meeting space should cost a maximum of $85,000 per day. Even that was pricey-compared with offers from other hotels. The committee separately received free meeting space from the Fairmont hotel near Georgetown after booking a large block of rooms and agreeing to spend at least $46,000 on food and drinks, according to the documents. 
The committee also received two meeting rooms at no cost from the W Hotel near the White House after booking a block of guest rooms and agreeing to spend at least $75,000 on food and drinks.
There is disagreement about how many guest rooms the committee booked at the Trump hotel, a figure that hotels often use to determine whether to offer discounted meeting space. Racine's staff said they determined the committee booked up to 80 percent of the rooms the week of the inaugural. Trump Organization attorney Alan Garten said that the committee paid for 5 or 6-percent of the hotel's rooms at most. 'Not only was there never any room block but in the end the PIC was only responsible for a nominal number of rooms,' he said. Neither side provided evidence to support their claims. 
The lawsuit is the second brought by Racine over Trump's business practices. In the other, Racine and Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh (D) allege that Trump violates the Constitution's foreign 'emoluments' clause by doing business with foreign governments. 
The Trump inaugural committee raised a record-shattering $107 million, more than double the largest haul for any other incoming president. Trump broke with the practice of most recent inaugural committees and placed no limits on corporate or individual donors, leading more than 45 individuals and companies to donate at least $1-million each.
In the three years since, negative revelations about the committee's work have emerged. Federal prosecutors in New York are pursuing a criminal investigation related to donations and spending by the committee and have issued their own subpoenas. 
Wolkoff was criticized also after the committee directed $26-million to her 12-person firm, though all but $1.62-million of that was reportedly routed to subcontractors. 
Although Trump and his children weren't managers of the committee, they have since run into trouble for misuse of charitable funds when a judge ordered Trump to pay $2-million in damages for using funds from his foundation for his own benefit. Trump agreed to close the organization. 
The documents appear to show that Wolkoff planned to raise the issue of the hotel prices with the president-elect. On Dec. 16, 2016, according to her task list, Wolkoff had a meeting scheduled with Trump at which the 'cost of ALL EVENTS at Trump Hotel' was on the agenda. 
The cost of the ballroom was raised at least two other times by committee officials, according to the documents. 
The hotel had earlier booked another group, the Presidential Inaugural Prayer Breakfast, for the morning of the inauguration "" meaning the ballroom was double-booked. Correspondence between the committee and hotel management appears to show that committee staff expected a $70,000 discount since the room was unavailable for half that day, but ended up paying full freight anyhow. (The prayer breakfast was booked before Trump's victory for $5,000.)
Gates later discussed with hotel management the possibility of canceling a Friday night event he originally thought would host 1,250 people. 
He wrote to Ivanka Trump to say: 'There will be an after party at the [Trump hotel] following the inaugural balls on Friday. DJT is not expected to attend but was more for you, Don and Eric,' referring to the president and his adult sons. Racine cites this as misuse of charitable funds to benefit the Trump family. 
The cost for the ballroom at the Trump hotel never came down. Trump's company is now trying to sell its lease to the hotel. Initial bids are due Thursday for the property.

How many candidates are still in this for the Democrats?

Even longtime campaign reporters have to pause and silently count on their fingers whenever the question comes up. As of this writing, a dozen Democrats are still running for president.

Not all of them will be on every state's ballot. For example, billionaire Mike Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York, entered the race in November, and immediately said he would skip the early nominating states to focus on Super Tuesday states and beyond "" to the grumbling of some voters and party officials in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.
Is President Trump guaranteed to be the Republican nominee?
With all due respect to Republican challengers such as Joe Walsh and Bill Weld, President Trump will almost certainly be the Republican presidential nominee.
Some states, including Arizona, Nevada and South Carolina, have canceled their GOP primaries or caucuses, citing an opportunity to save taxpayer money in the face of, they say, an inevitable Trump win. Of course, with Trump's impeachment trial underway in the Senate, there's always a chance that the Republican nominee could end up being someone other than Trump.
What about third-party candidates?

How much time do you have?

On the Democratic side, what are the story lines we should be watching as the voting begins? Why pay attention to Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire and South Carolina "" four states without a lot of delegates?
The ultimate 'story line,' of course, is which Democratic candidate emerges from the primary with the majority of the party's 3,979 pledged delegates, making him or her the party's nominee to challenge Trump in this fall's general election.
It's true that the four early-nominating states account for only 155 delegates, or less than 4-percent of the total. But traditionally, a win in Iowa "" the first state to caucus, on Feb. 3 "" can turbocharge a campaign and convince nervous voters that a particular candidate is electable.
Having a strong showing in Iowa has been a clear priority for some Democrats, such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.); Pete Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Ind.; and businessman Andrew Yang. Others, including former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) have tried to play down the importance of Iowa and New Hampshire, focusing in turn on a longer-haul national race. Bloomberg, as mentioned earlier, is skipping the first four nominating states entirely. 
What is Super Tuesday, and what should we be looking for on that day? Are there other days with large numbers of delegates at stake?
'Super Tuesday' "" Tuesday, March 3 "" is the day that 14 states will vote in Democratic primaries, and 1,357 of the pledged delegates are up for grabs. That makes up one-third of the total available pledged delegates, and it has the potential to shift the race.
The Super Tuesday states include Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia. American Samoa will also hold a Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday, while some Democrats living abroad will be able to vote starting March 3.
There are other dates on which multiple states vote and large numbers of delegates are at stake, but none has as catchy a nickname.
On Tuesday, March 10, 352 delegates will be up for grabs from Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington.
On Tuesday, March 17, Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio will vote, awarding 577 delegates.
And on Tuesday, April 28, voters in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island will decide how 663 delegates are divvied up.
How long will it all last? Is it possible that we will not know who the Democratic nominee is when the convention begins? What are 'superdelegates,' and do they still exist after 2016?
Democratic primaries in states and U.S. territories will stretch into early summer; the last one will be held in the U.S. Virgin Islands on June 6, when seven delegates will be awarded. Presumably the Democratic nominee "" the person with a clear majority of pledged delegates "" will be clear by then. Or clearer, at least.
Or not clear at all! It is possible, especially if few candidates drop out along the way, that no one will have more than half of the pledged delegates by the time the Democratic National Convention is held in mid-July.
In that case, myriad scenarios could play out: For instance, on the first vote, pledged delegates "" who can technically vote for whomever they want "" could align themselves differently from their statewide distribution numbers, perhaps based on behind-the-scenes dealmaking between the campaigns.

There will still be 'superdelegates' "" mostly party insiders "" who can vote at the Democratic convention, but under new Democratic National Committee rules, they will do so only if a second round of ballots is required.
How long will the process last? Well, technically, the beauty of living in a democracy means that the next election cycle is never far away. 
We'll do this all again in four years.
