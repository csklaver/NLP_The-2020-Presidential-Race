Facebook Inc. is banning
videos that have been manipulated using advanced tools
, though it won't remove most doctored content, as the social-media giant tries to combat disinformation without stifling speech.
But as with many efforts by social-media companies to address content on their sites that is widely seen as problematic, Facebook's move swiftly drew criticism for not going far enough and having too many loopholes.
The policy unveiled Monday by Monika Bickert, Facebook's vice president for global policy management, is the company's most concrete step to fight the spread of so-called deepfakes on its platform.
Deepfakes are images or videos that have been manipulated through the use of sophisticated machine-learning algorithms, making it nearly impossible to differentiate between what is real and what isn't.
""While these videos are still rare on the internet, they present a significant challenge for our industry and society as their use increases,"" Ms. Bickert said in a blog post.
Facebook said it would remove or label misleading videos that had been edited or manipulated in ways that would not be apparent to the average person. That would include removing videos in which artificial intelligence tools are used to change statements made by the subject of the video or replacing or superimposing content.
Social-media companies have come under increased pressure to stamp out false or misleading content on their sites ahead of this year's American presidential election.
Late last year, Alphabet Inc.'s Google updated its political advertisement policy and said it would
prohibit the use of deepfakes
in political and other ads. In November, Twitter said it was considering identifying manipulated photos, videos and audio shared on its platform.
Facebook's move could also expose it to new controversy. It said its policy banning deepfakes ""does not extend to content that is parody or satire, or video that has been edited solely to omit or change the order of words."" That could put the company in the position of having to decide which videos are satirical, which aren't and where to draw the line on what doctored content will be taken down.
Henry Ajder, head of research analysis at cybersecurity startup Deeptrace, said deepfakes aren't expected to be a big problem ahead of the election because the technology to make them hasn't advanced enough. ""That's why some people think Facebook is focused on the long-term problem while neglecting to tackle the problem that's right here right now.""
Facebook has already been trying to walk a thin line on other content moderation issues ahead of this year's presidential election. The company, unlike some rivals, has said it
wouldn't block political advertisements even if they contain inaccurate information
. That policy drew criticism from some politicians, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic contender for the White House. Facebook later said it would ban ads if they encouraged violence.
A Facebook spokeswoman said the company's ban of deepfake videos will apply to political ads and they will be removed.
The new policy also
marks the latest front
in Facebook's battle against those who use artificial intelligence to spread messages on its site. Last month, the company took down hundreds of fake accounts that used AI-generated photos to pass them off as real.

In addition to Facebook's latest policy on deepfakes, which generally rely on AI tools to mask that the content is fake, the company also will continue to screen for other misleading content. It will also review videos that have been altered using less sophisticated methods and place limits on such posts.
The Facebook ban wouldn't have applied to an altered video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. That video of a speech by Mrs. Pelosi—widely shared on social media last year—was slowed down and altered in tone, making her appear to slur her words. Facebook said the video didn't qualify as a deepfake because it used regular editing, though the company still limited its distribution because of the manipulation.
Hany Farid, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley called Facebook's announcement ""a positive step,"" though one, he said, that was also too narrow. ""Why focus only on deepfakes and not the broader issue of intentionally misleading videos?"" he said, pointing to Facebook's decision not to remove the altered video involving Ms. Pelosi and a similar one about former Vice President Joe Biden. ""These misleading videos were created using low-tech methods and did not rely on AI-based techniques, but were at least as misleading as a deepfake video of a leader purporting to say something that they didn't.""
Facebook's Ms. Bickert, in the blog post, said, ""If we simply removed all manipulated videos flagged by fact-checkers as false, the videos would still be available elsewhere on the internet or social-media ecosystem. By leaving them up and labeling them as false, we're providing people with important information and context.""

DES MOINES, Iowa -- An election debacle unfolded Monday night as the Iowa Democratic Party failed to report the results of the state's presidential caucuses, saying it had found ""inconsistencies in the reporting"" as the nation awaited the outcome of the first nominating contest.
""In addition to the tech systems being used to tabulate results, we are also using photos of results and a paper trail to validate that all results match and ensure that we have confidence and accuracy in the numbers we report,"" said Mandy McClure, the state party's spokeswoman.
She said a mobile app used to record and report results from each caucus site ""did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion. The underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.""
The campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden wrote in a letter to the state party that ""acute failures are occurring statewide"" in the reporting system.
""We believe that the campaigns deserve full explanations and relevant information regarding the methods of quality control you are employing, and an opportunity to respond, before any official results are released,"" wrote Dana Remus, general counsel for Mr. Biden's campaign.
The caucuses kicked off Democrats' quest to find a challenger to President Trump in November's general election, formally opening a primary campaign that showed no signs of wrapping up quickly.
With the results still unknown, the candidates took to stages scattered around Iowa's capital to declare their own version of success.
""I imagine, have a strong feeling, that at some point, the results will be announced,"" said Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. ""And when those results are announced, I have a good feeling we're going to be doing very, very well here in Iowa.""
Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota told her supporters they are ""punching above their weight.""
""Even in a crowded field of candidates, even during the well-earned impeachment hearing of Donald J. Trump, which had me bolted to my Senate desk for the last two weeks, we kept fighting,"" she said. ""And you kept fighting for me.""
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called the race ""too close to call"" during her speech, but said she was confident the final Iowa results would show her in a strong position. Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., also gave a speech rallying his supporters.
The top candidates had campaign war chests large enough to sustain them through February, including New Hampshire's primary on Feb. 11.
Shortly before 11 p.m. EST -- with no results reported -- the Iowa Democratic Party said it experienced a delay ""due to quality checks"" and the need to report three data sets for the first time. At the same time on caucus night in 2016, the main candidates, Mr. Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, were neck and neck with 90% of precincts reporting.
With the results still unknown, the candidates took to stages scattered around Iowa's capital to declare their own version of success.
The reporting was complicated in this year's caucuses by additional data being released. For the first time -- in response to calls for greater transparency -- the state party was to release the raw total for votes from both rounds of voting, along with the traditional share of delegates won.
On Monday, some precinct leaders struggled to transmit caucus results, according to people familiar with the situation, both via a mobile app and by a backup telephone system.
Two caucus organizers said before the gatherings started that they had heard about issues with downloading or logging into the app, meaning they would likely need to call in their results over a secure phone line that had been set up as a backup plan.
About two-thirds of those attending the caucuses said they preferred a nominee who is more likely to win in November rather than a candidate who shares their positions on key issues, according to early data from entrance polling reported by NBC News.
The early data pointed to a generational divide, with Mr. Sanders getting support from about half of caucus-goers who were 17 to 29 years old, while Mr. Biden was supported by almost 4 in 10 participants 65 or older.
A self-described democratic socialist, Mr. Sanders has recently shown strength in national polls. That has triggered concerns among centrist Democrats who worry Mr. Trump would use Mr. Sanders's political identity to damage the party's prospects in Midwestern battleground states that helped decide the 2016 election.
Mrs. Clinton defeated Mr. Sanders by a razor-thin margin in the 2016 Iowa caucuses, but then he pivoted to a resounding victory in New Hampshire. If Mr. Sanders shows strength in the first few state contests over more moderate candidates like Messrs. Biden and Buttigieg, it would almost certainly add fuel to the candidacy of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire, is skipping any serious competition for the first four states holding nominating contests, a strategy no successful candidate has pursued in the modern era.
He is instead focusing his fortune on states with primaries and caucuses in March, a month when about 60% of the delegates to the national convention are in play. And he has already spent lavishly, devoting more than $300 million to the campaign.
His prospects in the Democratic nominating race likely rest on whether Mr. Biden is doing well or struggling to compete after the first several contests, as well as whether another moderate like Mr. Buttigieg or Ms. Klobuchar has moved into contention by the end of February.
The large size of the Democratic field -- still at close to a dozen -- has complicated the party's hopes of coalescing around a nominee more quickly than in 2016.

To understand the power of Iowa and New Hampshire to reshape the presidential field and change the perceptions of voters who weigh in later, consider the career of Democratic strategist Joe Trippi.
In 1984, Mr. Trippi guided Walter Mondale to a lopsided victory in Iowa's caucuses, a 32-point margin over the closest competitor. He was rewarded with some time off.
""Go on vacation. Get some sun,"" Mr. Trippi recalls being instructed by a confident Mr. Mondale, the former vice president. ""You'll get your assignment for another state later.""
The vacation lasted just a few days before Mr. Trippi was called back for emergency help. Rather than clearing Mr. Mondale's path, Iowa had essentially narrowed an eight-person field into a two-man race, boosting second-place finisher Gary Hart to victory in New Hampshire as the candidate of a new generation. Mr. Mondale would clinch the nomination but was bedeviled by Mr. Hart through the primaries.
In 2004, Iowa stung Mr. Trippi again. Riding high into Iowa as chairman of Howard Dean's campaign, Mr. Trippi found his top-polling candidate upended after a surprise victory by then-Sen. John Kerry. Mr. Kerry went on to win New Hampshire and never looked back.
Iowa's slingshot likely has lost some of its power this year because of the
vote-counting snafu
in the Democratic caucus that meant no candidate could claim a clear, election-night victory or star turn in the media.
The mishap
means that the state's role in holding the leadoff nominating contest is now in doubt.
Still, the state has already introduced narratives that are shaping the Democratic race, and along with New Hampshire, which votes Tuesday, is likely to play its traditional role of reshaping the candidate field.
Among other outcomes, Iowa has confirmed the challenges facing
former Vice President Joe Biden
, who placed fourth in nearly complete caucus results, while elevating a once little-known
mayor from a midsize city, Pete Buttigieg,
into one of the top two finishers.
""Mayor Buttigieg is a far stronger candidate today in New Hampshire than he was just two days ago,'' before Iowa held its caucuses, said Bill McInturff, a Republican pollster and veteran of GOP primary contests.
Mike Bloomberg's attempt to cut a path to the nomination without the early-voting states, if successful, could diminish the power of those states in the future. Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor, is skipping the first four nominating contests and
running a high-spending campaign
elsewhere.
Still, Iowa and New Hampshire are likely this year to affect the primary process in two important ways.
One role the states can play is to erase doubts about a candidate. Iowa did that in the 2008 caucuses, when Democrats backed Barack Obama and showed that an overwhelmingly white state would support an African-American candidate for president.
Iowa voters may be playing a similar role this year in elevating a gay man, Mr. Buttigieg. ""Is America ready for a gay president? Seeing him win or a close second in Iowa would help get over those doubts,'' Mr. Trippi said.
A second role the early states play is to create a new frame through which voters see the candidate field, sometimes as newcomer versus veteran, or a centrist against someone on the party's ideological edges.
Several Republican races have set the frame as an establishment-backed candidate facing a populist, social conservative. In 2012, Iowa helped to narrow the field essentially to Mitt Romney, the venture capitalist and former Massachusetts governor, against former Sen. Rick Santorum, who appealed to evangelical Christian and working-class Republicans. Republican Sen. John McCain and former Gov. Mike Huckabee filled similar roles in 2008.
If current trends hold, many voters could see this year's Democratic primary as a choice between a centrist and a more ideologically driven candidate—possibly Mr. Buttigieg against
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders
, one of the most ardent liberals. The two were top finishers in Iowa.
The verdicts from Iowa and New Hampshire have influence in part because they arrive just as voters nationwide are starting to think through their choices. Mr. McInturff noted that in this month's Wall Street Journal/NBC News national poll, conducted before the Iowa caucuses, more than half of Democratic primary voters said they were less than certain to support their current top choice for nominee, compared with 45% who said they had made a final decision about their favored candidate.
The finding suggests that voters can be swayed by the results from the earliest contests. ""Absolutely, winning creates a different filter and focus,'' Mr. McInturff said. ""The ripple is powerful, especially if it is an unexpected result. Whether it's temporary or sustained—that depends on the candidate.''
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Which candidate do you expect to get a boost at the New Hampshire primary? Why? Join the conversation below.
Recent developments could alter the role of the earliest states in the process. Some could potentially enhance their power, and others could diminish it.
One is the rise of online fundraising, which Elaine Kamarck, a veteran Democratic Party official and strategist, says has amplified the bounce that winners can receive from the earliest contests.
""In the old days, if you were excited about someone who won the Iowa caucuses, you'd have to get out your checkbook, find the address of the campaign, write a check and put it in an envelope,'' said Ms. Kamarck, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ""Now, the money can come really, really quickly.''
Even if Mr. Bloomberg wins the nomination while bypassing the states that vote first, some candidates are sure to want to compete in the earliest states to build name recognition and sway voters in later contests.
""In a primary, each race builds upon the next race,'' said Ms. Kamarck. ""It's being branded as a loser that makes people move and go look for another candidate…People want to be with winners. The horse-race aspect of the elections affects not just the media but affects the voters.''

WASHINGTON—Joe Biden's emergence as the 2020 Democratic
presidential front-runner
is widely cast as a victory for moderates over progressives. But the former vice president's platform also shows how far left the party's center on economic policy has moved in recent years.
On taxes, health care, climate change and labor rights, Mr. Biden proposes a significantly bigger government role than Hillary Clinton did during her 2016 presidential bid and what the Obama-Biden ticket advocated during their two White House campaigns.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
If the former vice president is less moderate than it might seem, does that undermine or help his electability argument? Join the conversation below.
Ideological gaps still divide Democrats, as highlighted by the lingering primary contest between Mr. Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders,
his chief remaining rival
. Mr. Sanders's sweeping plans carry a total 10-year price-tag of about $50 trillion—more than eight times Mr. Biden's agenda.
Still, Mr. Biden proposes tax and spending increases equivalent to 1.5% of U.S. gross domestic product, more than double the level Mrs. Clinton advocated four years ago, and higher than the budget blueprints from the end of President Obama's term, according to a recent study by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.
""What's being called moderate now would have been the far left eight years ago,"" says Matthew Chingos, an education expert at the Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank.
Mr. Biden's proposals fall well short of the debt cancellation and four-year tuition-free college plans of Mr. Sanders and former candidate Elizabeth Warren. But ""the levels of new federal spending for education proposed by the Biden campaign are well above what Democratic candidates proposed four, eight, or 12 years ago,"" Mr. Chingos adds, citing Mr. Biden's plans to double college Pell grants for low-income students and triple funding for low-income public schools.
On Sunday, in a bid to win over voters favoring Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, the Biden campaign said he was endorsing two policies similar to ones those candidates have advocated. He sweetened his higher education plan to make four-year public colleges tuition free for some families—albeit only those making less than $125,000 a year, not everyone. And Mr. Biden vowed to make it easier for Americans to file for bankruptcy protection from creditors, softening a position he had taken as a senator to toughen the process. Bankruptcy law has been the subject of a long-running argument between Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren.
""Sen. Sanders and I both agree…health care should be a right, not a privilege,"" Mr. Biden said in the Sunday night debate between the two men, asserting that their similarities outweighed their differences. ""We disagree on the detail of how we do it, but we don't disagree on the principle.""
President Trump is making the Democrats' leftward shift a theme of his re-election effort. ""There will be no 'moderate' Democrat on the ballot in 2020,"" his campaign said in a statement issued after Mr. Biden's
early March resurgence
. ""Bernie Sanders is the intellectual thought leader of the Democrat Party, and…every Democrat followed his lead, including Joe Biden.""
Rather than denying the charge of liberalism, some Biden aides embrace it. ""The vice president is proposing the most progressive agenda since the Great Society,"" says Stef Feldman, the campaign policy director, asserting that many of his proposals ""are dramatically to the left of traditional Democratic policy platforms.""
It is a bet that voters have grown more accepting of an activist government, as polls show heightened financial anxiety for many Americans on issues such as health care, housing and child care even amid a record-long economic boom.
Health care illustrates the party's shift. Mr. Biden's plan, to make Medicare available to any American who wants it, costs a fraction of Mr. Sanders's ""Medicare for All"" program replacing all private insurance.
But the Biden proposal is more ambitious than Mrs. Clinton's 2016 health plan. His would cost the government as much as $1.3 trillion, net, over 10 years, compared with $250 billion for hers, according to analyses by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
And the Biden plan goes beyond what Barack Obama envisioned in what ultimately became the Affordable Care Act. Among other differences, Mr. Biden would allow workers with employer coverage to buy into a government health-care plan—a concept neither Mr. Obama nor Mrs. Clinton raised.
""That's a huge deal,"" said Larry Levitt, executive vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. He estimated that would mean millions more ""low-and-modest-income workers could get substantial health-care cost relief.""
On climate change, Mr. Biden, along with most of the two dozen Democrats who ran for president this cycle, has called for eliminating carbon emissions by 2050, compared with the 80% reduction that was the party consensus four years ago.
Neither Mr. Biden nor Mr. Sanders has emphasized a carbon tax, a once-popular idea among Democrats, and one that still draws support from economists in both parties. ""The left has moved against a carbon price pretty intensely,"" now preferring ""industrial policy over market-based approaches,"" said Leah Stokes, a political scientist at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies environmental politics.

Debate Moments That Mattered

Low-income housing advocates lavish praise on Mr. Biden's platform, starting with his declaration that ""housing should be a right, not a privilege""—a striking position that, they say, no Democratic presidential nominee has taken in recent memory. To support that goal, the candidate would make Section 8 vouchers for low-income renters an entitlement, a contrast with the current system, which limits availability based on funding, creating yearslong waiting lists.
The Biden plan ""is a sea change from what we've seen from past presidential candidates,"" said Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. ""To the extent that housing was even talked about, it was almost always related to middle-class homeownership.""
In one of their biggest fights, Mr. Sanders regularly invokes Mr. Biden's flirtation earlier in his political career with cutting Social Security benefits to preserve the program's long-term solvency. In his current campaign, Mr. Biden has gone in the opposite direction. He proposes tax increases to shore up existing benefits, and would expand payments for certain recipients.
For the past two decades, Democrats either avoided talking about Social Security, or gingerly suggested ways to keep it from going bust. ""The idea of increasing benefits is new in presidential politics,"" said Marc Goldwein, senior vice president at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
Mr. Biden's open touting of tax increases is also ""a reflection of changing times,"" said Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center. ""The last candidate to really do this was Walter Mondale,"" he said, referring to the 1984 Democratic nominee who lost to Ronald Reagan in a landslide. ""Given what happened to him, it is no surprise that Democrats have been reluctant to do so ever since.""
In part, Mr. Biden and other Democrats see raising taxes now as mainly undoing Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts, meaning levels would largely go back to the Obama years, not higher.
But Mr. Biden is also venturing beyond recent Democratic tax plans, calculating that voter concern with inequality makes taxing the rich more politically palatable. While he has eschewed the wealth-tax proposals from Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, the former vice president has floated new ways to extract more from the wealthiest households, by changing how capital gains are taxed.
There are pillars of the progressive agenda Mr. Biden hasn't yet fully adopted. A theme of Ms. Warren's campaign was an attack on corporate power, including plans to break up big tech and big banks and toughen Wall Street regulation. Mr. Biden has so far touched only vaguely on those issues, if at all.
Many liberal activists say they are still disappointed with the prospect of a Biden nomination. ""It would very much be a setback,"" says Sabeel Rahman, president of Demos, a liberal think tank and advocacy group that has worked with the Sanders and Warren campaigns.
But Mr. Rahman does see the Biden platform as progress for his own agenda, adding: ""Biden may not be a liberal champion of these ideas, but he's having to adopt them in order to be credible with the new center of gravity in the economic policy world.""

AUTO INDUSTRY PLEADS for delay in North American trade-deal implementation due to
coronavirus pandemic
. Now that Canada has ratified the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the Trump administration is eager to see the pact enter into force as soon as possible. President Trump wants to tout the impact of the new agreement, which will replace Nafta, in the 2020 election campaign. But the auto industry wants its new regulations delayed until next year.
""When you add to that the Covid-19 crisis, this is really beyond understanding that the administration is trying to do this,"" Ann Wilson, senior vice president at the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, told the Journal's William Mauldin. ""If you force us to try to comply by June 1, we will not comply, and tariffs will be unnecessarily paid."" If cars and auto parts don't follow a raft of new rules—including regulations designed to ensure that much of a car is built with high-wage labor—then companies will have to pay tariffs when those vehicles or components cross the Mexican or Canadian border. Those border crossings were tightened this week because of the pandemic, but not in a way that should affect commercial trade.
The auto industry has a powerful Republican ally on its side: Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said he believes
the industry has ""a good argument""
for a delay. Supply chains are badly disrupted because of the pandemic, and numerous auto makers including Honda, Ford and General Motors are closing their North American factories as the virus spreads.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Should the new North American trade deal be delayed until the coronavirus crisis is under control? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
HOUSE REPUBLICANS' campaign organization urges its candidates to ""exercise increased sensitivity"" while campaigning during the coronavirus outbreak. An internal memo this week accused Democrats of politicizing the crisis and cable news networks of allowing attacks to go ""largely unchecked,"" seemingly a reference to Sunday's Democratic presidential debate. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders and other
Democrats have been critical of congressional Republicans
and the Trump administration's approach to the crisis.
The memo from the National Republican Congressional Committee encouraged candidates to continue fundraising, but not to connect it to the crisis. Their advice to candidates to ""ask yourself if your press release or snarky comment are in poor taste"" raised the most hackles from Democrats who have been on the receiving end of the NRCC's attacks. In recent months, those have included putting the name of an African-American congresswoman from Georgia on a ""For Sale"" sign and placing ""moving boxes"" outside House Democrats' offices following the impeachment vote, prompting a U.S. Capitol Police investigation.
FBI SUSPENDS the use of electronic Freedom of Information Act requests during the pandemic and instead recommends using the postal service to send in paper FOIAs. The move was criticized by journalists and some former Justice Department officials as basically the opposite of what the policy should be during a pandemic. The move came amid existing tensions between Justice and transparency advocates after a department spokeswoman blamed
""litigation brought by some savvy frequent requesters""
for strains on resources and delays in the department's FOIA office.
TULSI GABBARD has

Gabbard, who is not seeking re-election to her Hawaii congressional seat, introduced a resolution last week to provide $1,000 a month to American adults during the pandemic, a cause that has caught fire with Republicans and Democrats alike. Gabbard has sent out numerous tweets and videos promoting the plan: ""Glad to see @TomCottonAR @MittRomney @AOC & others joining my efforts,"" she tweeted on Tuesday.
CONSERVATIVE ECONOMISTS and some business groups scold bipartisan
fiscal stimulus proposals
to deal with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, worrying they could have permanent consequences. Economist Arthur Laffer, commentator Stephen Moore and businessman Steve Forbes put out a statement decrying proposals to ""expand welfare and other income redistribution benefits like paid leave and unemployment benefits that will inhibit growth and discourage work."" The conservative Club for Growth urged members of Congress
to vote against the coronavirus legislation
that passed the House last week for similar reasons. Their opinion was mostly ignored, with the legislation passing 363-40. Trump said he instructed Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia to propose regulations to ensure the legislation doesn't hurt small businesses.
LOBBYISTS RALLY to support their favorite D.C. restaurants. Lyndon Boozer, a telecommunications sector lobbyist, started an online fundraiser with other K Street and Capitol Hill fixtures
to support the staff of Bobby Van's Grill
, which like other restaurants is closed during the pandemic. ""It's a familiar watering hole for us,"" Boozer said. ""We have to come together so these establishments survive."" The fund had raised around $7,000 as of midday Thursday, far exceeding the initial $2,000 goal. Other lobbyists and trade association executives have encouraged their friends and associates to order delivery from other Washington establishment hot spots, including mid-Atlantic fare favorite Equinox.

New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker has ended his presidential campaign after his message framed around unity and political healing failed to catch on with voters.
Mr. Booker, a former mayor of Newark, had long lagged behind the leading Democratic candidates in national polls, and he failed to qualify for two consecutive Democratic primary debates, including Tuesday's debate in Iowa.
""It's with a full heart that I share this news—I've made the decision to suspend my campaign for president,"" Mr. Booker said in an email to supporters on Monday. ""Our campaign has reached the point where we need more money to scale up and continue building a campaign that can win—money we don't have, and money that is harder to raise because I won't be on the next debate stage and because the urgent business of impeachment will rightly be keeping me in Washington.""
Mr. Booker informed senior staff over the weekend of his decision to withdraw from the presidential race, a campaign aide said. The senator shared the news with the rest of his team in an all-staff conference call Monday morning, which he joined from his campaign headquarters in Newark, the aide said.
Mr. Booker, 50, first rose to political prominence in 2002, when his unsuccessful bid to become mayor of Newark was chronicled in the Academy Award-nominated documentary film ""Street Fight."" He was elected to the post in 2006 and built a reputation as a hands-on politician, including by running into a burning building to save a neighbor and rescuing a dog from the cold.
In 2013, following a special election to succeed the late Sen. Frank Lautenberg, Mr. Booker became the first African-American elected to the Senate since Barack Obama nearly a decade earlier. He was handily re-elected to a full six-year term in the 2014 election. In announcing the end of his presidential bid, Mr. Booker's campaign said he would seek re-election to the Senate.

California Sen. Kamala Harris Is Dropping Out of Presidential Race

Mr. Booker, who was running to be the nation's second black president,
launched his campaign
last February, on the first day of Black History Month, with an emphasis on civil rights. The senator was one of three black candidates to have been in this year's historically diverse Democratic field. California Sen. Kamala Harris
ended her campaign
in December, while former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick
kicked off a last-minute bid
for the Democratic nomination in November.
Mr. Booker has decried the lack of diversity among the remaining candidates in the field, given the party's large contingent of black and Latino voters.
""I hear this from voters—black and white, Latino and white: There's a sense of just frustration that you're excluding people from a debate stage because they don't have the money that often billionaires do to get on those stages,"" Mr. Booker said earlier this month in an interview with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell.
Tuesday's debate in Iowa will feature six white candidates. Mr. Patrick has struggled to break through with voters after launching his bid late, and entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who is Asian-American, didn't qualify for the January debate.
Bakari Sellers, a Democratic strategist and former adviser to Ms. Harris's campaign, said he believed non-white candidates were being marginalized in part because voters were being led to believe they can't defeat President Trump.
""I fault the times that we're living in, where Democratic voters have been conditioned that somehow it will take a palatable white man to woo disenchanted white voters and win the White House,"" he said. ""We've forgotten the lessons that Barack Obama has taught us.""
Mr. Booker, like Mr. Obama, became well-known on the national stage for his soaring oratory and optimistic tone. But he struggled to gain traction in the Democratic primary, where his pitch—less rooted in ideology than in a desire to unite a divided nation—failed to animate voters.
Share Your Thoughts
How could Democrats encourage more diversity in the presidential field? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Booker's corporate connections—spanning from Wall Street to Silicon Valley, coupled with a more moderate record—also invited skepticism from the party's progressive wing. Although Mr. Booker played an influential role in crafting criminal-justice legislation on Capitol Hill, his legislative resume was otherwise lacking in signature accomplishments.
During Democratic presidential debates, Mr. Booker stood out for delivering punchy and offbeat one-liners that were often directed at former Vice President Joe Biden as they sparred over issues like criminal justice and racial profiling.
In July, Mr. Booker rebuked Mr. Biden for having supported tough-on-crime laws in the 1990s. ""Mr. Vice President, there's a saying in my community: You're dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don't even know the flavor,"" he said. At another debate, in November, Mr. Booker rejected Mr. Biden's logic for opposing marijuana legalization, telling the former vice president: ""I thought you might have been high when you said it.""
But while such confrontations created viral moments on social media, they fell short in advancing Mr. Booker's campaign.
Mr. Booker was open about his campaign struggles, making several urgent appeals for donations and warning that he would be
forced to bow out of the race if supporters didn't give money
.
Mr. Booker's departure leaves 12 Democrats vying to challenge President Trump in November.

Bernie Sanders says he is running a positive presidential campaign, but some of his aides and supporters are testing those boundaries.
""You didn't see me say a word about any other candidate tonight,"" the Vermont senator said Saturday to a voter who asked him how to avoid Democratic infighting.
On Monday, Mr. Sanders's surrogate Zephyr Teachout, a Fordham University law professor who ran for New York governor in 2014, wrote
an op-ed
for the Guardian, a U.K. newspaper, accusing former Vice President Joe Biden of having ""a big corruption problem"" because he holds fundraisers. Political surrogates are prominent supporters who aim to boost support for the candidate.

Biden and Sanders Fight Over Social Security
(Jan. 18, 2020)
Mr. Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have sworn off big-donor events, which many candidates hold, and rely on small-dollar donations. David Sirota, a top aide to Mr. Sanders, included a link to the op-ed in a campaign newsletter.
Mr. Sanders apologized for the piece in an interview with CBS News Monday: ""It is absolutely not my view that Joe is corrupt in any way. And I'm sorry that that op-ed appeared.""
""Thanks for acknowledging this, Bernie. These kinds of attacks have no place in this primary. Let's all keep our focus on making Donald Trump a one-term president,"" Mr. Biden
tweeted in response
.
Mr. Biden told Iowa's Channel 13 news on Tuesday that Mr. Sanders
had also apologized
to him in person.
It wasn't the first time Mr. Sanders's supporters and surrogates—who have long felt they are fighting the Democratic establishment—have deviated from his preferred handling of his opponents for the party's presidential nomination. As Iowa's leadoff caucuses approach, campaigns are increasingly trading barbs, potentially at the risk of alienating voters whose support they might need to win the nomination.
""Bernie has been clear of what kind of campaign he wants to run, and he's been very vocal about it,"" an aide to Mr. Sanders said, citing his apology for the op-ed and a memo he sent out at the start of his campaign urging surrogates ""to engage respectfully with our Democratic opponents.""
Still, his team has bickered with other Democratic campaigns recently. On Saturday, some of Mr. Sanders's aides criticized Mr. Biden for his stance on Social Security, bringing up a speech he made in 1995 in which he called for freezing ""all government spending, including Social Security."" Mr. Sanders's research director, Tyson Brody, added scissor emojis to Mr. Biden's name in a tweet. Mr. Brody
also tweeted
that a stop sign and scissors meant he didn't want a nominee who supported Social Security cuts.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do Bernie Sanders's supporters affect your impression of him? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
The Biden campaign also criticized a video clip tweeted earlier in the month by a top Sanders adviser that appeared to show Mr. Biden saying that going after Social Security and Medicare was ""the only way you can find room to pay for"" tax cuts. The Biden campaign said he was mocking a Republican leader at the time.
On Tuesday, the fight pulled in the candidates themselves when Mr. Biden released a digital ad
defending his record
on Social Security and vowing to expand it as president. The ad also accused Mr. Sanders's campaign of releasing ""a barrage of negative ads on Joe Biden"" and ""not telling the truth.""
In response, Mr. Sanders released an audio clip that included Mr. Biden talking about his repeated attempts to freeze Social Security and other programs as part of a halt on federal spending.
""Let's be honest, Joe. One of us fought for decades to cut Social Security, and one of us didn't. But don't take it from me. Take it from you,"" Mr. Sanders tweeted with a
link to the video
.
Mr. Sanders's campaign also was reported to have given volunteers talking points that said Ms. Warren wasn't bringing new people into the party, a spat that escalated when Ms. Warren said Mr. Sanders had told her during a 2018 meeting that a woman couldn't beat President Trump. Mr. Sanders didn't dispute that the talking points had been suggested and has denied the account of his discussion with Ms. Warren.
The dispute prompted online backlash against Ms. Warren.
Over a four-day period, more than 25,000 tweets and retweets used snake emojis or the word ""snake"" in reference to Ms. Warren and more than 105,000 tweets or retweets included the hashtag #NeverWarren, according to Plasticity, a social media intelligence company. Some of the tweets came from people who identified themselves as supporters of Mr. Sanders.
Both candidates have
tried to move on
, and in response to questions about the online attacks against Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders's campaign pointed to a tweet from his wife Jane O'Meara Sanders.
""The @BernieSanders campaign is about unifying people across our country—not dividing them up by race, ethnicity or gender. Forget those who are trying to divide us, focus on building the progressive movement & be positive to succeed!#MenWomenUnited,"" she wrote.
Still, some supporters on both sides are angry. Some Warren supporters say the incident brought back memories of sexism toward Hillary Clinton during her race against Mr. Sanders in 2016. Mr. Sanders disavowed any such comments at the time.
""It's disgusting. Look, we don't want that crap,"" Mr. Sanders said in a 2016 CNN interview. ""Anybody who is supporting me that is doing the sexist things is—we don't want them. I don't want that. That is not what this campaign is about.""
Mrs. Clinton, in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter published Tuesday, wasn't ready to let Mr. Sanders or his team off the hook.
""It's not only him, it's the culture around him. It's his leadership team. It's his prominent supporters. It's his online Bernie Bros and their relentless attacks on lots of his competitors, particularly the women,"" Mrs. Clinton was quoted as saying. ""And I really hope people are paying attention to that because it should be worrisome that he has permitted this culture.""
Kelly Dietrich, the founder of the National Democratic Training Committee, which doesn't endorse a candidate, said the actions of Mr. Sanders's staff and supporters could influence undecided primary voters. He said if Mr. Sanders is the nominee, it would be unlikely to hurt him because Democrats want to beat Mr. Trump.
""This kind of stuff doesn't help, but I also don't think it is that large of a factor in most voters' thinking,"" he said. ""They may not line up and be all in 125% with big smiles on their faces, but we're going to work and do whatever needs to be done this election.""

WASHINGTON -- Taking a victory lap a day after he was acquitted in the Senate impeachment trial, President Trump said he ""went through hell"" during what he deemed a politically driven investigation and called top Democrats ""very evil and sick people"" for seeking his removal from office.
Before an audience of aides and Republican allies, Mr. Trump offered freewheeling remarks from the East Room of the White House on Thursday. Speaking for just over an hour, he characterized the event as a celebration, while taking swings at political rivals who he alleged have been targeting him since he took office.
""We've been going through this now for over three years. It was evil, it was corrupt, it was dirty cops, it was leakers and liars, and this should never, ever happen to another president, ever,"" Mr. Trump said.
Holding up a copy of a newspaper with the headline ""Trump Acquitted,"" he quipped: ""It's the only good headline I've had in the Washington Post.""
He reiterated his stance that he did nothing improper regarding Ukraine, and called former special counsel Robert Mueller's earlier probe into possible ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia ""all bullshit.""
The remarks came one day after the Republican-led Senate acquitted Mr. Trump on two articles of impeachment stemming from his efforts to press Ukraine to announce investigations that would benefit him politically in this year's election, including a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate.
Mr. Trump's comments about Democratic leaders also came on the heels of his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, when he didn't shake the hand offered by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), and she ripped up her copy of his address at its conclusion.
""He is impeached forever, no matter what he says or the headlines he wanted to carry around,"" Mrs. Pelosi said in remarks to reporters on Thursday. She added that Mr. Trump was ""never getting rid of that scar.""
Mrs. Pelosi also defended tearing up the speech, calling the address ""a manifesto of mistruths"" and her action necessary to ""get the attention of the American people.""
The combative comments from Mr. Trump on Thursday and the vigorous response from Mrs. Pelosi made clear that the rancorous political climate between Democrats and Republicans will continue even with impeachment over.
Republicans cheered Mr. Trump's acquittal in the Senate and have called his impeachment part of a three-year effort to delegitimize the 2016 election and remove the president from office nine months before Democrats face him again at the ballot box.
Democrats said Mr. Trump's acquittal amounted to a defeat for the institution of Congress, and they warned that leaving Mr. Trump in office would free him to try to cheat again in this year's election.
In his White House event, the mood was triumphant, with guests slapping each other on the back. The crowd gave Mr. Trump more than a half-dozen standing ovations. He thanked various supporters in the room by name, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). Mr. Trump also thanked his Senate impeachment legal team.
He didn't mention personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, whose efforts in Ukraine were at the center of the impeachment. Mr. Giuliani wasn't in attendance.
Mr. Trump also continued his criticism of Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah), who was the lone Republican to vote to convict the president on the first article of impeachment. Without naming him, Mr. Trump said there were ""some that used religion as a crutch"" and called him a failed presidential candidate.
Mr. Romney, the 2012 GOP candidate against President Obama, said Wednesday that he was a very religious person and reached an ""inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded"" that he vote to convict Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump took two tacks toward Democrats in his White House speech. He called for bipartisanship, citing infrastructure and drug prices as areas of common interest. If Republicans and Democrats work together, ""what we can do is incredible,"" he said.
But he also continued to question the goodwill of Democrats. Earlier, in remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast, Mr. Trump appeared to reference Mrs. Pelosi, saying he doesn't like ""people who say, 'I pray for you,' when they know that's not so.""
Mrs. Pelosi, who was seated near the lectern, clapped as he entered the room. Later, she told reporters that she did pray for Mr. Trump, while criticizing his actions in office as ""so off the track of our Constitution, our values, our country.""
Mr. Trump's appearance at the breakfast marked the fourth year he has addressed the annual gathering, which is hosted by members of Congress and has been running since 1953.
Before Mr. Trump spoke, there was a keynote address from Arthur Brooks, former president of the American Enterprise Institute, who urged the audience to rise above the divided political climate.
Mr. Trump, known for his combative style, acknowledged the message when he took the lectern, but said: ""Arthur, I don't know if I agree with you.""

Michael Bloomberg said he would transfer $18 million from his presidential campaign to the Democratic National Committee, boosting the party's operations instead of forming his own super PAC.
The investment is aimed at strengthening the DNC's battleground program, which includes 12 states and is run in coordination with the state party committees. Mr. Bloomberg also has offered to transfer the ownership of many of his field offices to state party committees, according to a Democratic official, who said the former New York City mayor's contributions would help speed up their hiring for positions in organizing, data and operations.
The multimillion-dollar boost to the party's field-organizing program could serve as a major asset to the Democratic nominee. Former Vice President Joe Biden is leading the delegate count and has struggled to amass a large campaign war chest. Sen. Bernie Sanders is still in the race, but Mr. Biden's campaign is preparing to expand his staff for the general election, while grappling with the new realities of campaigning during the coronavirus pandemic.
President Trump's team has built a large campaign organization and is planning an extensive operation of field organizers and digital outreach to voters. Mr. Trump and the Republican National Committee had more than $225 million in the bank at the end of February.
After launching his White House bid in late November, Mr. Bloomberg committed to keeping his staff on the payroll and field offices open in at least six competitive general-election states, even if he wasn't the party's nominee.
The billionaire dropped out after giving his own campaign more than $935 million, an unprecedented amount in just 100 days, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission on Friday that show his spending through the end of February. He earned only 61 delegates on Super Tuesday, meaning he spent at least $15.3 million for each delegate.
Since he exited the race, Mr. Bloomberg's advisers had been working on a way to absorb his campaign operations into an outside entity that would boost Mr. Biden.
""While we considered creating our own independent entity to support the nominee and hold the President accountable, this race is too important to have many competing groups with good intentions but that are not coordinated and united in strategy and execution,"" Mr. Bloomberg wrote in a memo to DNC Chairman Tom Perez.

Jane Cline has been bombarded by political texts from different Democratic 2020 presidential campaigns. She doesn't recall signing up for any of them.
Americans, particularly in early nominating and battleground states, are already receiving millions of texts from Democratic and Republican political campaigns, with fundraising messages and calls to action regularly lighting up their smartphone screens.
Ms. Cline, a 58-year-old retiree, hasn't responded to any of the messages she's received out of fear she will just get more. ""I don't like them,"" she said in January at an Ames, Iowa, event for Joe Biden ahead of the state's caucuses. ""I guess it's just replacing the telemarketer on the phone.""
Political texts have grown increasingly important as some campaigns pulled back from digital advertising after certain technology platforms such as Twitter and Google changed their policies. The text messages capture voter attention more effectively than emails, mailers or calls, advocacy groups and campaign organizers say.
Many campaigns scrape data, including voter registration files, event attendee lists or survey respondent records for reams of phone numbers that belong to individuals likely to be interested in their messages, whether or not those people have explicitly agreed to receive texts. In late January, the Democratic National Committee said it purchased tens of millions of cellphone numbers to better reach voters.
Within the complex plumbing that delivers those political text messages, however, texting service providers, wireless carriers and consumer advocates are divided over what permission, if any, is necessary, to ping a voter. There are no federal guidelines clarifying whether these messages require consumer consent.
In the 2018 midterm election, Democratic campaigns and politically adjacent organizations sent 350 million text messages through the two largest left-leaning political texting companies, Hustle and GetThru, according to an analysis by progressive nonprofit Tech for Campaigns.
President Trump's re-election campaign has been reaching out to people through texts and is expected to send hundreds of millions of messages leading up to the November election, people familiar with the efforts said.
Democratic presidential contenders, including those who have dropped out of the race, have already sent at least tens of millions of texts, campaign aides said. Michael Bloomberg's campaign is
hiring workers in California
to post on social media and send text messages to their friends about him, The Wall Street Journal has reported.
Political texting firms serving presidential campaigns have for months built strategies to reach voters or potential supporters through what they describe as peer-to-peer texting, in which messages are sent manually to individual voters. Those messages are usually sent by volunteers or political staffers holding smartphones, and at times by workers at desktop computers hired by campaigns to broaden their reach.
Many of the messages are prewritten, though certain details like names can be customized. They typically focus on organizing supporters, asking for money or sharing event information. As it gets closer to the election, they will turn toward getting out the vote.
""This isn't Nike trying to sell people shoes or Ray-Ban trying to sell people sunglasses,"" said Daniel Souweine, founder and chief executive GetThru, which is working with Democratic campaigns. ""This is political campaigns of all stripes reaching out, up and down the ballot.""
At the heart of the brewing conflict is whether political text messages are, in fact, peer-to-peer messages, or if they involve automation that makes them subject to a telephone consumer protection law that requires explicit consent from recipients and can lead to stiff financial penalties for violations.
Political campaigns and the technology firms that help them distribute messages say text messages are peer-to-peer because a human manually hits send. Consumer advocates say many political texts rely on systems that can be used to make robocalls and are therefore subject to the federal law.
Verizon Communications Inc. asks political campaigns to use a text message distribution system that requires consumer consent. Verizon says messages sent through other channels risk getting flagged as spam. ""We're trying to make sure that text messaging doesn't go the way of out-of-control robocalling,"" said Tamara Preiss, vice president of federal regulatory affairs at Verizon.
AT&T Inc., meanwhile, doesn't want to risk blocking political messages. The carrier is working on a special code for political messages—""classification Q""—that would let them all go through, people familiar with the matter said. A spokesman for the carrier referred queries to the CTIA industry group, whose best practices state political organizations should secure consumers' consent before they start sending messages.
Matt Gerst, vice president of regulatory affairs at the CTIA, said it wants to balance emerging communications channels with consumer protection. ""Our experiences with robocalling and emailing led us to this place,"" he said.
Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google allow most mobile phone users to filter spam texts.
Autodialed texts aren't allowed without prior express consent, according to the Federal Communications Commission. But the federal telecommunications regulator and Congress have stopped short of defining what constitutes an auto-dialer. Courts have issued differing opinions on the matter.
An FCC spokesman said the agency is still reviewing whether peer-to-peer messages are subject to the federal law governing contact with mobile phones.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Should candidates have to get permission from voters before sending them political text messages? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
California in January started requiring more disclosure in text messages, including whether they are sent from paid staff.
RumbleUp, which works with Republican and center-right political campaigns and advocacy groups, added to its platform an explainer of the rule and a template with proper disclosures for text messages sent to California area codes, said Thomas Peters, who leads the texting firm. It is in the process of adding one for relevant ZIP Codes.
Before Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) suspended his presidential bid, his campaign sent millions of texts through a mix of staffers and more than 100 volunteers, often to build supporters and donors, said Kim Hall, who ran the texting effort.
Ms. Hall said the Booker campaign used a combination of video training, a handbook and a quiz to make sure staffers and volunteers understood how to use Hustle, a left-leaning political texting platform. ""We're highlighting really big concepts that they needed to know,"" she said. ""Every platform has constraints you have to operate in.""
Florida resident Shehan Wijesinha sued pro-life group Susan B. Anthony List Inc. in July 2018 after he received a text message from the organization about President Trump's Supreme Court selection. Mr. Wijesinha said in the suit that he hadn't provided the group with consent and reached a class-action settlement with the group.
A spokeswoman for Susan B. Anthony List said the organization denied wrongdoing and settled to avoid expensive and drawn-out litigation. It agreed to pay $5 to each member of the settlement class who submitted timely and valid claims with a cap of around $1 million, and said it received $20,055 in claims.
Political texting firms have made some changes to their messages to avoid being blocked. For instance, some say they avoid including links in the first text because they've noticed over the last year that carriers tend to filter or flag those messages.
""It's kind of a cat-and-mouse game with them right now,"" said Jaimey Sexton, a board member at trade body the American Association of Political Consultants.
How to Make Them Stop
* Replying STOP to a text indicates to legitimate businesses that you no longer wish to receive their messages, but it can also indicate to scammers that they've reached a working number.
* Forward messages to the Spam Reporting Service by typing ""7726"" or ""SPAM""
* Block the sending number using options provided by your operating system like iOS. On iPhones, for example, tap the info button at the top of the message screen, tap the number and select ""Block this Caller."" On Android, tap the three dots or ""more"" option at the top of a message and tap details, followed by ""block and report spam""
* Android and iOS systems both offer new call-blocking options that you can access through the phone's settings menus.
* Some Android phones allow spam filtering. Go to ""spam protection""

BURLINGTON, Vt. -- Sen. Bernie Sanders's hopes of securing the Democratic presidential nomination rely on an unlikely path that would require him to top or tie Joe Biden in states he lost in his 2016 bid, a tough proposition as his momentum wanes.
Mr. Sanders indicated Wednesday that he plans to stay in the race and participate in Sunday's Democratic debate in Phoenix, despite losing four of the six states that held nominating contests Tuesday.
""I very much look forward to the debate in Arizona with my friend Joe Biden,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""Donald Trump must be defeated. . . .On Sunday night, in the first one-on-one debate of this campaign, the American people will have the opportunity to see which candidate is best positioned to accomplish that goal.""
But his path to the nomination has grown so difficult that big-money Democratic groups that remained neutral for much of the race have now declared Mr. Biden, a former vice president, the likely nominee. In a speech Tuesday night in Philadelphia, Mr. Biden was already looking ahead to a general election against the Republican Mr. Trump, thanking Mr. Sanders and his supporters ""for their tireless energy and their passion.""
Mr. Sanders's loss in Michigan -- the biggest delegate prize of the night and a state he won in the 2016 primaries -- was a particularly hard-hitting blow because Mr. Sanders has argued that he is the best candidate to beat Mr. Trump in Midwestern states.
The Vermont senator and his campaign are hoping that a strong performance during Sunday's debate, which will take place without a live audience because of coronavirus concerns, will help save his floundering campaign.
""The dynamic of a one-on-one debate is much different than the dynamic of a one-on-10,"" spokesman Mike Casca said. ""We feel that the senator will have enough room in a two-hour debate with one other candidate to really strongly lay out the case for why his agenda is one that can be done.""
Even with a stellar debate performance, aides to Mr. Sanders acknowledge his chances of being the Democratic nominee are slim following Tuesday night's walloping. Next Tuesday, they are hoping for a victory in Arizona, where roughly one-third of the population is Hispanic, a demographic with which the senator has expanded his support this cycle. But Mr. Sanders lost the state by 18 points in 2016, and recent polling has shown Mr. Biden ahead.
Aides are also hoping for strong performances, if not outright wins, in Ohio and Illinois. Mr. Sanders lost Ohio by 14 points and Illinois by 2 points in 2016. One poll released this year in Illinois had Mr. Sanders ahead of a still-fractured field. Ohio hasn't had Democratic primary polling this year.
The result in Michigan appears to bode ill for Mr. Sanders in those nearby states. In the days leading up to the vote in Michigan, Mr. Sanders all but camped out in the state and moved key aides in. He increased his criticism of Mr. Biden for supporting trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Biden, however, won by 16.5 points.
Mr. Sanders's aides acknowledge that Florida, which offers the most pledged delegates of the states voting next week and which he lost by 32 points four years ago, will be difficult. The self-described democratic socialist has praised parts of Fidel Castro's legacy, while condemning the oppressive actions of the Cuban dictator, which hasn't gone over well with Florida's large Cuban population.
Mr. Sanders's aides, however, point out that California, the largest prize in the entire nominating contest, went for him on March 3 and results are still being tallied, meaning the senator will likely gain more delegates from that primary. Colorado, another state Mr. Sanders won, is also still tabulating results.
Mr. Sanders has said he would support Mr. Biden if the former vice president is the Democratic nominee.

WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court agreed to once again decide the fate of the Affordable Care Act, but it likely won't do so before the 2020 presidential election.
The court on Monday announced it would consider an appeal by a group of Democratic-led states that are defending the 2010 health-care overhaul legislation, a signature achievement for President Obama. The ACA is under legal attack from a group of Republican states, which found a new tactic for challenging the law in 2018—based on a provision requiring Americans to buy health insurance or pay a penalty—after the Supreme Court previously preserved the ACA in decisions
in 2012
and
in 2015
.
The high court
isn't placing the case on an accelerated schedule
, meaning the justices won't get to it before their summer break. Instead, the case will be scheduled for the court's next term, which begins in October 2020 and runs through the following June.
The timing means the decision is unlikely to come before Election Day, leaving the ACA in legal limbo. The slower timeline also means the Trump administration won't necessarily be forced to grapple with U.S. health-care policy before voters go to the polls.
In weighing the case, the justices could rule on the viability of every provision of the sweeping law. In addition to the mandate that most people carry health insurance, the ACA barred insurers from denying coverage—or charging more—to people with existing health conditions. It also allowed young adults to stay on their parents' plans until they turned 26 and expanded the availability of Medicaid coverage for limited-income Americans.
The ACA contains hundreds of other provisions, including ones that require contraception coverage and federally recommended vaccines to be covered at no cost, and that mandate nutritional labeling on restaurant menus and vending machines.
The New Orleans-based Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in December that
the individual insurance mandate, a central feature of the ACA, was unconstitutional
.
The ruling avoided saying whether the rest of the sprawling health law could remain in force without the mandate. The appeals court instead ordered the Texas judge who first heard the case to reconsider
his decision that no part of the ACA remained valid
.
The health law remains in effect during the litigation. President Trump has pledged to roll it back and has long promised to release his own health plan. His administration isn't defending the law in court and instead is siding with the challengers in the case.
Republican plaintiffs, led by the state of Texas, found an opening to challenge the law anew after Congress in 2017 reduced the insurance-mandate penalty to $0. The change came as part of
a broad tax-overhaul package
passed by a GOP Congress and signed by Mr. Trump.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said, ""Without the individual mandate, the entire law becomes unsupportable. The federal government cannot order private citizens to purchase subpar insurance that they don't want, and I look forward to finally settling the matter before the U.S. Supreme Court.""
Lower courts agreed with that argument. Congress's taxing power was central to the majority opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts in 2012 to uphold the insurance mandate.
The law's supporters say it doesn't make sense that the mandate would suddenly become unconstitutional now that it is less burdensome.

The same five justices that upheld the ACA in 2012 remain on the court.
California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who leads a coalition of 20 states and Washington, D.C. defending the ACA, said he was pleased with the high court's decision to hear their appeal. ""As Texas and the Trump administration fight to disrupt our health-care system and the coverage that millions rely upon, we look forward to making our case in defense of the ACA,"" he said. ""American lives depend upon it.""
White House officials have said they won't release any health-care contingency plan this year in case the law is struck down. They have said the makeup of Congress could change after 2020 elections, and lawmakers could revisit an ACA replacement then.
The litigation has created continued uncertainty for health-care markets and anxiety over the possible ramifications from a case that could jeopardize health coverage for more than 20 million people.
Supreme Court oral arguments will take place in the fall, likely before election day. A decision could take several months after that. The timing of the case could escalate Democrats' attacks on Mr. Trump over health care. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg have all criticized the president as a threat to health coverage and the ACA, and a number have cited the administration's support for the lawsuit as evidence.
The Justice Department, which is representing the Trump administration in court, declined to comment.
Many of the coverage gains under the ACA have come from the law's expansion of the Medicaid program. State budgets would be thrown into turmoil if the ACA is terminated, because federal funds pay for most of the Medicaid expansion, as well as subsidies for roughly nine million people who buy their own insurance on the health law's exchanges. The federal government spent about $63 billion for Medicaid expansion in 2018, and states lack the funding to make up the difference.

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg faced a barrage of attacks as he joined Democrats for the first time in a
fiery presidential debate
that saw every candidate on stage launching shots at one another.
Within minutes of the start of the ninth debate of this election cycle, held in Las Vegas just three days before Nevada's caucuses, Mr. Bloomberg began facing criticism from nearly a half-dozen rivals for his record on criminal justice. The other candidates also brought up his prior comments about women in an effort to cast the New York billionaire as no different than President Trump.
""I'd like to talk about who we're running against—a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians, and no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump, I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg,"" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said. ""Democrats are not going to win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, of harassing women, and of supporting racist policies like red-lining and stop-and-frisk.""
The attacks on Mr. Bloomberg came as the billionaire, who launched his candidacy in November and has run a torrent of advertising, has gained traction in national polls. Having bypassed all the early states, he has focused on the March 3 Super Tuesday contests and is hoping to
roil a largely unsettled race
that has Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in a
double-digit lead
in national polling but no one yet to emerge as decisive front-runner among the centrist candidates.
In response to the criticism of him, Mr. Bloomberg apologized for the stop-and-frisk policing practice—in which police officers were given wide latitude to stop people whom they suspected of criminal behavior and which mainly affected racial minorities—saying it ""got out of control"" and is one thing he was embarrassed about from his time as mayor. A federal judge ruled in 2013 that the policy was carried out in an unconstitutional manner.
That response proved insufficient for Mr. Bloomberg's opponents. ""It's not whether he apologized or not, it's the policy,"" said former Vice President Joe Biden, a longtime front-runner who has slipped in polls just as Mr. Bloomberg has risen. ""The policy was abhorrent. And it was…a violation of every right people have.""
Ms. Warren, who was looking for a breakout moment after failing to collect any delegates in New Hampshire, came out swinging in a debate that saw her land several punches and demonstrate a rare willingness to confront her opponents over health care and other issues.
Mr. Bloomberg wasn't alone in facing the heat. Rifts quickly ripped open between Mr. Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, the
top delegate-earners in the race so far
, after their strong showings in Iowa and
New Hampshire
. Mr. Buttigieg, until recently the mayor of South Bend, Ind., warned that a two-person race between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bloomberg would feature ""the two most polarizing figures on this stage.""
""We've got to wake up as a party,"" he said. ""Let's put forward someone who's actually a Democrat,"" he said, a dig at Mr. Bloomberg, a former Republican, and Mr. Sanders, who was elected as an independent but caucuses with Democrats in the Senate.
Mr. Sanders responded by saying: ""If speaking to the needs and the pain of a long-neglected working class is polarizing, I think you got the wrong word.""
Refusing to back down, Mr. Buttigieg brought up a feud between the Vermont senator's supporters and a powerful Nevada culinary union in Nevada over his signature Medicare for All proposal. The union complained it had been harassed by Mr. Sanders's supporters online after arguing his proposal for health care would be less generous than health benefits for which they had bargained.
Mr. Sanders disavowed any of his supporters who attacked the union, saying: ""If there are a few people who make ugly remarks, who attack trade union leaders, I disown those people. They are not part of our movement.""
Mr. Sanders's polling lead has stirred increasing
concern among establishment Democrats
who believe a more centrist candidate could be stronger in the general election. There has been less polling in Nevada than in Iowa and New Hampshire, but pre-caucus surveys show Mr. Sanders ahead.
Mr. Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist, dismissed a new
Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll
showing that a majority of voters were uncomfortable with a socialist candidate for president. He pointed out that the same poll showed him leading the Democratic field.
Tensions also rose between Mr. Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who are competing for the party's center lane and who engaged in a series of testy, often personal exchanges.
After Ms. Klobuchar pushed for a comprehensive immigration overhaul, Mr. Buttigieg interjected to attack her record, including her vote in 2007 to make English the official language of the U.S.
""You voted to confirm the head of Customs and Border Protection under Trump, who was one of the architects of the family-separation policy. You voted to make English the national language,"" Mr. Buttigieg said. ""Do you know the message that sends?""
""I wish everyone was as perfect as you, Pete,"" Ms. Klobuchar retorted. ""In fact, I have opposed and not supported two-thirds of the Trump judges. So get your numbers right.""
The two also sparred over Ms. Klobuchar's inability to name the president of Mexico during a recent interview. Mr. Buttigieg, a 38-year-old who Ms. Klobuchar has said lacks the experience to be president, said it was troubling that the lawmaker was ""not able to speak to literally the first thing about the politics of the country to our south.""
""Are you trying to say that I'm dumb? Are you mocking me here, Pete?"" Ms. Klobuchar responded. ""I don't think that that momentary forgetfulness actually reflects what I know about Mexico and how much I care about it.""
Ms. Klobuchar, who was standing next to Mr. Buttigieg, walked off the stage after the debate without shaking his hand.
Still, Mr. Bloomberg, who has poured more than $400 million into his campaign and been accused by the rest of the field of trying to buy the election, took the most hits. In addition to his policies during his dozen years as mayor, Mr. Bloomberg weathered attacks from his rivals over accusations that his financial-data and media company was a hostile workplace for women.
He dismissed calls from his opponents to release from nondisclosure agreements women who have sued his company and said Mr. Bloomberg made crude remarks to them or otherwise alleged discrimination. He played down the claims: ""None of them accuse me of doing anything, other than maybe they didn't like a joke I told.""
""We're not going to end these agreements because they were made consensually,"" Mr. Bloomberg added, prompting groans from the crowd. ""They have every right to expect that they will stay private.""
Ms. Warren flatly rejected Mr. Bloomberg's response regarding nondisclosure agreements.
""I hope you heard his defense: 'I've been nice to some women.' That just doesn't cut it,"" she said.
Wednesday's debate, which aired on Comcast Corp.'s NBC News and MSNBC, drew 19.7 million viewers, making it the highest-rated Democratic debate ever, according to Nielsen data. The previous audience record for a Democratic debate
was set on June 27, 2019
, at the start of the primary season, and drew 18.1 million viewers.
The most-watched primary debate ever featured the top 10 GOP hopefuls of the 2016 presidential race and was seen by 24 million viewers on Fox News.

OXON HILL, Md.—The impeachment of President Trump motivated her to fly up from Texas, but after a half day at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Cathie Broten was convinced a more sinister force is in play.
""It's like Custer's Last Stand: the Republicans vs. the socialists,"" said Ms. Broten, 70 years old, wearing a pin reading, ""Kiss me, I'm a capitalist.""
Mr. Trump, greeted by wild applause as he took the CPAC stage on Saturday afternoon, sought to portray Democrats as seeking policies that would turn the U.S. into a ""large-scale Venezuela.""
""But we will never let them do that,"" he said. Mr. Trump trash-talked the Democratic presidential candidates, at one point ducking down to mock Michael Bloomberg's height.
He acknowledged the rise of Sen. Bernie Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist, as the front-runner for the party's nomination. He asked the crowd to cheer to indicate which candidate he should compete against in November, either Mr. Sanders or former Vice President Joe Biden.
By the cheers, the crowd seemed itching for the ideological showdown that is the official theme of the four-day CPAC conference: America vs. Socialism. ""We'll probably end up with Crazy Bernie,"" Mr. Trump said.
The event's theme shows how Republicans plan to frame the November election, with or without Mr. Sanders as the nominee. Repeatedly, speakers portrayed the Democrats' agenda on health care, the environment, college tuition and other issues as an attempt to radically transform America.
""Donald Trump and his allies are getting a little bit nervous about facing Sen. Sanders in a general election, and they're all quickly realizing that the only way to attack someone who spent his entire life standing with the working class is to lie,"" said Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca.
Amid the ""crazy Bernie"" and communist Cuba references at CPAC were warnings about being overconfident.
""Get your laughs out of the way and get the mockery out of the way and then get deathly serious,"" said the young conservative activist Charlie Kirk. ""Because we should not do what the left did in 2016 and dismiss an outsider populist candidate from thinking that person can't win the White House.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How can President Trump's relationship with CPAC benefit him during the 2020 election season? Join the conversation below.
When Mr. Trump spoke at CPAC in 2011, saying he might run for president the following year, many in the Republican establishment laughed it off as a publicity grab. He skipped it in 2016 while some conservatives still fought to prevent his march to the nomination.
This year showed how Mr. Trump commands the GOP, injecting his own sense of grievance and fight. The mere mention of Mitt Romney, the party's 2012 nominee who
voted earlier this month in the Senate to convict Mr. Trump
on one article of impeachment, brought boos. Conference-goers stuffed ballot boxes to judge the ""phoniest"" conservative, picking from a list of other Republicans who have criticized Mr. Trump.
Before noon on Thursday, attendees had sat through four panels focused on ""the coup,"" with speakers dismissing the impeachment and other investigations into Mr. Trump as the work of Democrats and a bureaucratic deep state.
""They're never going to stop,"" said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio. ""They tried to overturn the will of 63 million Americans—all of us who voted for President Trump.""
Democrats hit back at claims like Mr. Jordan's, calling it ""the oldest trick in the GOP playbook.""
""Republicans are trying to distract because they know they can't win on the issues. In 2017, 2018 and 2019 Democrats won on a message of expanding access to health care,"" said Daniel Wessel, a Democratic National Committee spokesman.
In addition to panels, actors Dean Cain and Kristy Swanson performed a dramatic reading of anti-Trump text messages between former FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, favorite targets of Mr. Trump in his complaints about the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The CPAC gathering in past years was animated by Ron Paul-style libertarians; now it is dominated by Trump loyalists in red MAGA hats as the president continues to redefine the GOP on foreign policy and trade. There was little mention of the ballooning national debt.
For some, it was a venue to apologize for being wrong about Mr. Trump in 2016.
""Look, I was late to the Trump train,"" said Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. ""I was about as late as one can be. I had my doubts about whether he was a conservative. I had my doubts about whether he was electable."" But Mr. Lee said the president has followed through on his promises, including moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, slashing regulations and nominating conservative judges.
Vice President Mike Pence ticked off those accomplishments and the strong economy and
declared victory over the impeachment
. ""President Donald Trump was acquitted forever,"" he said to wild cheers. Like others, Mr. Pence acknowledged the appeal of Mr. Sanders's policy proposals to young people in particular and said Republicans must engage them and explain the differences between ""freedom and socialism.""
""We definitely need to a better job of reaching young people and address their concerns,"" said Alexander Bowles, 18, of St. Louis, who said Mr. Trump also should moderate the way he speaks to avoid losing more suburban voters.
Outside the ballroom, people who have become celebrities in the Trump era were flocked by fans. Biceps poking from a black T-shirt, the Fox News regular Dan Bongino posed for selfies. Nigel Farage, one of Brexit's most-visible architects, was greeted with applause as he rode down an escalator holding a wooden doll depicting Mr. Trump.
Vendors sold Trump hats, towels, T-shirts and pins. A red-white-and-blue hammock with the word ""Deplorable"" was being offered at 10% off the $499 price tag with an extra 10% discount for anyone from a battleground state.

The Democratic debate Friday in New Hampshire comes on the heels of
the debacle in Iowa
, where results from the party's caucuses were delayed because of technical mishaps.
Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders emerged
leading the Democratic pack
, while former Vice President Joe Biden had a
disappointing showing
. The race has moved to New Hampshire for the first-in-the-nation primary on Tuesday, where polling shows Mr. Sanders poised to make another strong finish.
What time is the New Hampshire debate?
The debate, which will be held at St. Anselm College in Manchester, is scheduled to start at 8 p.m. Eastern time and is expected to run about three hours. ABC is working with WMUR-TV and Apple News for this one; it is's the eighth debate of this election cycle.
Who is participating?
Seven candidates have qualified (one more than last month's debate in Iowa): Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, billionaire activist Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang.
To appear on stage, candidates were required to get 5% in four national polls approved by the Democratic National Committee or 7% in two polls in New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina. They also had to demonstrate that they received contributions from 225,000 unique donors, including 1,000 unique donors per state in at least 20 states, U.S. territories, or Washington, D.C. Also, any candidate allocated at least one pledged delegate to the Democratic National Convention based on the results of the Iowa caucuses will qualify.
What's next for the candidates in February?
The New Hampshire primary is Feb. 11, the Nevada caucuses are Feb. 22 and the South Carolina primary is Feb. 29.
There are two more Democratic debates this month: one Feb. 19 in Nevada and one Feb. 25 in South Carolina.

WASHINGTON—Former national security adviser John Bolton said he would testify in a Senate impeachment trial if subpoenaed, potentially lining up a central witness to President Trump's pressure on Ukraine to investigate a political rival and jolting a process that has bogged down in procedural disputes.
Mr. Bolton's Monday statement adds pressure on Republicans to call the former official who has conveyed that he has new information about the White House's Ukraine policy that could shed light on the investigation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) hasn't committed to calling witnesses in the impeachment trial, and the White House has objected to new testimony.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What impact do you think John Bolton's testimony would have in the Senate impeachment trial? Join the conversation below.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) has held off on sending the
approved articles of impeachment
to the Senate pending more clarity on the rules of the Senate trial, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has demanded the Senate subpoena documents and testimony from the White House.
It would take a simple majority of the Senate's 100 senators to approve any new witnesses, meaning four Republicans would be needed if all 47 Democrats backed new testimony.
""Since my testimony is once again at issue, I have had to resolve the serious competing issues as best I could, based on careful consideration and study. I have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify,""
Mr. Bolton said in a statement.
He noted that he had weighed Mr. Trump's objection to his testimony against Congress's request that he testify about the White House's Ukraine policy.

[Read John Bolton's statement here]

The Democratic-led House
approved abuse-of-power and obstruction-of-Congress articles
in December alleging that the president abused his office and tried to enlist a foreign power to help him in this year's election. The chamber had sought Mr. Bolton's testimony but moved forward with articles of impeachment
when he resisted testifying.

Mr. McConnell said Monday that Democrats are ""toying"" with the impeachment process and reiterated his position that requests for witnesses should be addressed after the trial begins, as during former President Clinton's impeachment.
""That was good enough for President Clinton, so it ought to be good enough for President Trump. Fair is fair,"" he said on the Senate floor.
New witness material was used in the Clinton impeachment, after approval by the Senate. On Monday, Republicans seemed wary about introducing new information for this case.
""Our inquiry should be limited to whatever evidence or testimony they used when they voted on the articles of impeachment,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.). ""If the House thinks there's additional testimony and so forth then they could take the item up again.""
Mr. Trump has said he did nothing wrong, tweeting on Monday that the impeachment process was a ""con game by the Dems to help with the Election!""

Former Russia Adviser Testifies She Was Alarmed About Ukraine Pressure
(Oct. 14)
Mr. Bolton, according to testimony from other witnesses in the House impeachment investigation,
was alarmed at a parallel Ukraine policy
overseen by Mr. Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani aimed at pressuring Kyiv to investigate 2016 election interference and the family of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Mr. Bolton referred to the matter as a ""drug deal,"" according to the
testimony of Fiona Hill
, who had been Mr. Bolton's top Eurasia specialist.
Mr. Bolton, whom
Mr. Trump fired in September
after nearly a year and a half on the job, ""was personally involved in many of the events, meetings, and conversations""
about the Ukraine matter
""as well as many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far,"" Mr. Bolton's attorney Charles Cooper wrote to the House's general counsel, Douglas Letter, in November.
Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) said he would be open to hearing from Mr. Bolton, anticipating he might vindicate the president.
""My suspicion is that he would be a good witness for the president, from the standpoint of saying that what the president has been impeached for is a difference over how to conduct foreign policy,"" he said.
Mr. Schumer has called for hearing from three new witnesses besides Mr. Bolton: acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney; Mr. Mulvaney's aide Robert Blair; and Office of Management and Budget official Michael Duffey.
Mr. Bolton's acknowledgment of the Senate's power to compel him to appear sidesteps a brewing conflict between the branches of government over their rights and privileges in the impeachment proceedings. Precedent on whether a president can invoke legal privilege over documents or testimony in an impeachment process, particularly a Senate trial, is scant.
In 1974, the Nixon Justice Department concluded that ""a constitutional confrontation of the highest magnitude would ensue"" if a president tried to withhold information or testimony from the Congress in an impeachment trial by claiming executive privilege over the objection of the Senate.
Mr. McConnell hasn't ruled out hearing from witnesses. Over the break, two Senate Republicans—
Lisa Murkowski of Alaska
and
Susan Collins of Maine
—indicated they would bring an independent mind-set to a trial, suggesting that witnesses could be called if enough Republicans vote for motions by Democrats to subpoena witnesses or documents.
In the House impeachment testimony, witnesses described Mr. Bolton as hostile to the Ukraine pressure campaign. According to witnesses, Mr. Bolton abruptly ended a July 10 White House meeting with Ukrainian government officials after U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland linked a meeting between Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and Mr. Trump to Ukraine's willingness to announced investigations that Mr. Trump sought.
During the House probe, Mr. Bolton maintained that he wouldn't appear voluntarily in that investigation. If a judge were to determine he doesn't have immunity from being forced to testify, he would likely have no choice but to comply with a subpoena, a person familiar with his thinking said last year.
In his statement Monday explaining his decision, Mr. Bolton said he believed he had run out of time on seeking a judicial ruling. ""It now falls to the Senate to fulfill its Constitutional obligation to try impeachments, and it does not appear possible that a final judicial resolution of the still-unanswered Constitutional questions can be obtained before the Senate acts.""

New Hampshire voters will turn out for the first-in-the-nation primary, days after the chaotic Iowa caucuses, which were marred by several days of delay in reporting the full results.
Here is a guide to the race and our planned coverage.
When is the New Hampshire primary?
Polls open at various times Tuesday morning, starting with Dixville Notch at midnight. Most close at 7 p.m. or 8 p.m., depending on the location. The Associated Press could project a winner soon after 8 p.m., or it could take longer if the race is close. In 2016, the winners of the Democratic and Republican primaries were announced right after the final polls closed.
Why is New Hampshire important?
New Hampshire is the second nominating contest but the first traditional primary. It has a history of dramatic results, even though the winner often doesn't go on to clinch the nomination. Famously, Bill Clinton finished second there in 1992 and declared himself the ""comeback kid,"" and he eventually defeated George H.W. Bush in the general election. Also, thanks to the problems counting votes in Iowa's caucuses, New Hampshire is set up to become the first race to declare a clear winner the night of the voting.
Speaking of Iowa, what's the latest?
The result is still in dispute. The Iowa Democratic Party released updated totals that showed former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg projected to win 14 delegates to July's national convention in Milwaukee, while Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont would get 12. Mr. Sanders, who won the raw vote, has
requested a partial recanvassing
.
Who is leading in the New Hampshire polls?
Messrs. Sanders and Buttigieg are leading the pack in recent state polls. But third place will also be closely watched, with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar fighting to stay among the front runners.
Three key things to watch for:
Voting process. Any signs of problems at the polls, or issues tabulating results, and the Democrats will suffer another black eye. Party officials are promising no Iowa-like surprises.
Sorting out the field. Another strong showing from Messrs. Buttigieg and Sanders could pay off in fundraising and momentum ahead of the Nevada and South Carolina races later this month, and Super Tuesday at the start of March.
Showing strength. Ms. Klobuchar has shown momentum in recent weeks, and she would celebrate a third-place finish. But Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden, who came into the 2020 race with much greater name recognition, will want to elbow her out.

LAS VEGAS—Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg joins the Democratic debate stage
for the first time
Wednesday in a gathering that falls just three
days before the Nevada caucuses
.
The debate comes at a crucial time for the
presidential candidates
, as former Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren seek to revive struggling campaigns following poor showings in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders,

who leads in national polling
, and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., are hoping to break away from the rest of the field after they finished at the top in both Iowa and New Hampshire. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar defied expectations with a third-place finish in New Hampshire but needs to continue gaining momentum.
The two-hour debate, hosted by NBC News, MSNBC, Noticias Telemundo and the Nevada Independent, will take place Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET.
Here's what we're watching:
How will Bloomberg do?
Mr. Bloomberg didn't qualify for the previous Democratic debates, but his rise in national polling means he made the stage in Las Vegas under new rules by the
Democratic National Committee.

Because of his late entry into the race, Mr. Bloomberg isn't competing in Nevada or the other states that vote in February. He has poured more than $400 million into states that vote March 3 and later.

Mr. Bloomberg could have
spicy exchanges with the other Democrats
. Over the weekend, Mr. Sanders said that choosing the former New York mayor as the party's nominee would leave Democrats unenthusiastic in November's general election because Mr. Bloomberg had ""pursued, advocated for and enacted racist policies like stop-and-frisk, which caused communities of color in his city to live in fear.""
Mr. Sanders was referring to the practice in which
police officers in New York were given broad authority
to stop and search people whom they suspected of criminal behavior.
Mr. Bloomberg could also face criticism for an ad airing in Super Tuesday states that
connects him to Barack Obama
, despite his criticism of the former president when he was in office.
Can Biden and Warren get the spotlight back?
At various points, Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren were each at the top of national and early-state polls. But the pair missed longtime expectations to do well in both Iowa and New Hampshire. Those states are mostly white, while Nevada and South Carolina are more diverse. Mr. Biden recently told donors he was confident he would place first or second in Nevada and win in South Carolina.
Ms. Warren has been arguing that she is the candidate who can unify the moderate and progressive wings of the Democratic Party, and she has leaned into being one of just two women left who is a major candidate for president.
Will the leaders spar?
Many of the Democratic debates so far have focused on fissures around issues such as Medicare for All and free college. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg, the two leaders so far in the delegate hunt, represent the divide between progressives and moderates in the party.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Which Democratic candidates have the most to lose and the most to gain in the debate? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Buttigieg and other
centrist Democrats
have proposed incremental changes to the health-care and education systems, arguing that an overhaul of the economy is unrealistic and expensive. Meanwhile, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren argue that modest changes aren't enough.
Mr. Sanders could also face questions about whether his self-identification as a Democratic socialist could hurt the party down-ballot if he is the nominee to take on President Trump.
Can Klobuchar find her New Hampshire magic?
Ms. Klobuchar appeared to benefit from her performance in last week's debate in New Hampshire, held just days before the primary. According to exit polls, five in six of those who voted for her said the
debate was a factor in their final decision
.
Ms. Klobuchar also announced
she had raised $12 million in a little over a week after the debate

Sanders Leads Democratic Field, Poll Finds

She will be looking to repeat those feats in Nevada, a challenge in a state where she has spent less time and where the caucus process rewards on-the-ground organizing.
How will Nevada's most powerful union factor in?
The Culinary Workers Union has declined to endorse a candidate but clashed with Mr. Sanders's supporters over the health-care plan he and Ms. Warren support.
The leadership of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which represents 60,000 hospitality workers in Las Vegas and Reno, recently distributed a flier that said Medicare for All would ""end Culinary Healthcare."" Such a proposal would move all Americans from private insurance to health coverage paid for by the government, and unions have worried that such benefits would end up being less generous than they now enjoy.
The union subsequently said it was being ""viciously attacked"" by Mr. Sanders's supporters for opposing his signature policy. Mr. Sanders has disavowed the attacks.

Private-equity executives are lining up behind their favored presidential candidates, with support ranging from Donald Trump to moderate Democrats, based on an analysis of campaign-finance records.
Employees of private-equity and investment firms spent more than $41 million on 2020 races for the White House and Congress through Feb. 3, somewhat favoring Democrats over Republicans overall, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, located in Washington.
Most of this money
has gone
to House and Senate candidates, party committees and outside groups. But many of the industry's big names have taken sides in the presidential race.
Among Democratic presidential candidates, former Vice President Joe Biden, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar have received the most money from employees of private-equity and investment firms, excluding candidates who have dropped out, according to the CRP. Mr. Biden received about $443,000, Mr. Buttigieg $345,000 and Ms. Klobuchar $155,000.
President Trump ranks fourth among those still in the presidential hunt, with about $62,000 in contributions to his campaign, CRP data show. However, private-equity executives have given much more to political-action committees supporting Mr. Trump, Federal Election Commission records show.
Blackstone Group Inc. founder and Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman has given more than $350,000 to the Trump Victory PAC, based on FEC records. Meanwhile, firm President Jon Gray has backed numerous Democratic presidential aspirants, including Messrs. Biden and Buttigieg, with donations of $2,800, the maximum an individual can give to a candidate in each election. Mr. Gray and Blackstone Vice Chairman Hamilton James have also contributed to Ms. Klobuchar's campaign.
Blackstone declined to comment.
Bain Capital leads all firms in political spending by employees, with contributions totaling about $3.6 million, CRP data show. While widely associated with former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who co-founded the firm, Bain Capital's employees have almost exclusively backed Democrats in 2020.
Josh Bekenstein, the firm's co-chairman, spent more than $2 million and co-managing partner Jonathan Lavine spent about $750,000 in support of Democrats by the end of 2019, based on FEC records. Both have backed Mr. Biden as well as Democrats who have dropped out, including Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor who led the firm's impact-investing arm before launching his unsuccessful presidential run.
Bain Capital declined to comment.
Aside from Blackstone and Bain Capital, many leaders of the largest private-equity firms have mostly stayed on the sidelines of the presidential race.
Apollo Global Management co-founders Leon Black, Josh Harris and Marc Rowan haven't given to any candidates still in the presidential race, FEC records show. In total, Apollo, the second-largest firm by assets under management, ranks 12th among private-equity and investment firms in employee spending on the 2020 elections, CRP data show.
KKR & Co. co-chairmen and co-CEOs Henry Kravis and George Roberts have spent more than $60,000 combined, favoring Republican Senate and House candidates, but haven't backed any presidential aspirants. KKR doesn't rank among the top 20 firms in employee spending, CRP data show.
Carlyle Group co-founders William Conway, Daniel D'Aniello and David Rubenstein haven't given to candidates for any office this cycle, according to FEC records. However, managing director James Attwood has given more than $500,000 to Democrats, including $2,800 contributions to Mr. Biden and to other candidates who have since dropped out, according to FEC records.
Employees of smaller firms have in many cases outspent the giants. Insight Partners and Centerbridge Partners are both among the top private-equity and investment firms ranked by employee spending on 2020 races, with each firm's employees contributing about $1 million through Feb. 3, according to the CRP. Both firms' employees have almost exclusively supported Democrats.
Centerbridge co-founder Mark Gallogly, who served as an adviser to the Obama administration, has spent more than $500,000 on 2020 races in total, and has backed Mr. Biden and Ms. Klobuchar, among other presidential aspirants.
At Insight, which manages more than $20 billion, the largest spenders are Managing Directors Richard Wells and Jeff Horing, who have both backed Mr. Buttigieg, according to FEC records.
Centerbridge and Insight declined to comment.
Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren have received very little support from employees of private equity and investment firms: about $15,000 and $38,000, respectively, CRP data show. Both have sharply criticized the industry's practices.
Their candidacies have sparked worries for many private-equity investors, said Brett Palmer, president of the Small Business Investor Alliance, a trade group that represents investors in small businesses.
""A whole lot of people have lost the ability to be shocked after the last election and this election so far, and are just hoping that whoever comes out is pro-small business,"" Mr. Palmer said.

Former Vice President Joe Biden has had a fast comeback. Now, his digital operation is trying to catch up.
His presidential campaign is bulking up its digital infrastructure, anticipating it will be necessary to compete with President Trump in the general election and spurred by a nationwide quarantine forcing the Democratic front-runner to find new ways to reach voters.
Mr. Biden's operation is looking to bring on new staff with expertise in digital advertising, social-media content and programming, people familiar with the matter said. It is also in talks with technology vendors about how to best boost its virtual and digital engagement with supporters, volunteers and donors, they said.
""It's a strange way to do an event, I know. We're all getting used to it,"" Mr. Biden said Friday evening during a virtual fundraiser with New Jersey donors. ""But, this is going to last for a little while. This isn't going to go away in a couple weeks.""
Mr. Biden's campaign has been
looking to expand
since he became the Democratic front-runner this month, including hiring Jen O'Malley Dillon as campaign manager. But the campaign's operations have been shaken up by the spread of the novel coronavirus, and Mr. Biden has scrapped in-person events and told staff to work from home.
The former vice president, like other candidates dealing with the pandemic, has held online events, including a live streamed town hall with voters in Illinois, a telephone town hall with supporters in three states and addresses from his home state of Delaware.
Mr. Biden said Friday during a conference call with reporters that his aides were taking steps to allow him to conduct frequent broadcasts from his Wilmington home and a nearby campaign office and to take questions from reporters.
""I want to be in daily or at least significant contact with the American people,"" Mr. Biden said.
Mr. Biden's digital team had fewer than a dozen people before it began adding staff, people familiar with the matter said. The campaign acknowledged it was smaller than most other Democratic presidential campaigns during the early primary voting, and the coronavirus has prompted it to speed its hiring for digital-focused roles.
Its finances have also changed. Mr. Biden's campaign for several quarters raised less than competitors. He raised $18 million in February, according to a Federal Election Commission filing, but his campaign has said it has raised more than $35 million so far in March as Mr. Biden cemented his front-runner status and
others dropped out of the race
.
""Campaigns still have to do the work of raising money and reaching out to voters and helping people see a path forward that's different from what they see today. And they have to do that really differently than what they've been planning to do,"" said Betsy Hoover, co-founder of Higher Ground Labs, a left-leaning political tech incubator, and the online organizing director for President Obama's 2012 campaign.
The Biden campaign has talked with tech vendors as it evaluates
digital platforms to connect
with its volunteers, donors or supporters in lieu of in-person events, people familiar with the talks said. It is hoping to mostly use other companies' platforms since the campaign doesn't have time to build new customized tools, the people said. ""They're looking at anything and everything,"" one of the people involved in the talks said.
The campaign is also trying to reach different types of voters, especially younger people, as it shifts toward competing in the general election, people familiar with the talks said.
During the first
live-streamed town hall
on March 13, there were audio and technical difficulties as Mr. Biden fielded questions. ""I'm sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections,"" he said, speaking into an iPhone.
The Biden campaign said it would scale-up production of digital content and experiment with methods to reach and engage voters. It also pointed to successful virtual phone and text banks during Super Tuesday and
primaries later in March where Mr. Biden clinched big victories.

Some of the campaign's most widely shared moments online involve situations where Mr. Biden has shown empathy. The campaign pointed to clips showing Mr. Biden giving a 6-year-old his lapel pin several years ago and another in which he took a selfie with a supporter in an elevator in January.
Biden campaign digital director Rob Flaherty, who joined the team in December, wrote an email to supporters Wednesday asking for their ideas on how to best engage online.
""A lot more people are at home and spending their time online than usual. So the digital parts of our campaign—the work you and I do to share the VP's message online—matters more than ever,"" according to the email.

WASHINGTON—As former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders square off for a third straight Tuesday of big primary contests, the coronavirus pandemic is increasingly pulling the attention of Americans away from the Democratic presidential race and causing uncertainty around voting.
An Ohio court on Monday evening rejected Republican Gov. Mike DeWine's request to postpone the state's Tuesday primary. But the primary was still thrust into chaos as Mr. DeWine declared late Monday that the state's top health official will order polls closed Tuesday as part of a health emergency.
""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" Mr. DeWine tweeted hours after a judge ruled in favor of the primary taking place as planned.
Those developments came as Georgia, Louisiana and Kentucky, which had been set to hold primaries in the coming weeks,
postponed the contests
.
Three other states set to hold primaries Tuesday—Arizona, Florida and Illinois—appeared to be going forward as planned, but each state moved some polling places away from nursing homes and other vulnerable sites.
On Monday, the Florida Democratic Party called on Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to release an updated statewide list of polling sites and said party workers had begun calling and texting more than 126,700 voters who, by their estimate, live in an affected precinct and haven't yet voted.
Asked if the state planned to release a comprehensive list, a spokesman for the Florida Department of State said that voters should check with their local election supervisors.
In Illinois, the Board of Elections said the state is proceeding with Tuesday's primary as scheduled despite an order from Gov. J.B. Pritzker requiring that all restaurants and bars close for dine-in customers for a period of two weeks.
The board's spokesman said early voting has been encouraged and local election authorities have received guidance for coronavirus safety in their polling places.
""Primary voting typically is a swift transaction that can be done at a safe distance from other voters,"" Matt Dietrich, the spokesman, said in a statement.
Across the country, voters are likely to see several precautionary measures, such as frequently cleaned voting machines, hand sanitizer and more breaks for poll workers to wash their hands.
Mr. Biden is strongly favored in the states scheduled to vote Tuesday and could further cement his path to the nomination if he scores big victories over Mr. Sanders, whose aides acknowledged the senator faces an uphill battle. In 2016, Mr. Sanders lost all of those states to Hillary Clinton.
The coronavirus pandemic has drastically altered the shape of the campaigns, with strict guidance against large gatherings nationwide.
Messrs. Biden and Sanders have both relied on digital events since last Tuesday, when both candidates canceled election-night rallies in the midst of escalating concern over the growing number of cases in the U.S.
Mr. Biden said during a tele-town hall on Monday evening that it was an ""anxious time"" for families dealing with the crisis and that some of those worries involved Tuesday's primaries.
""I'm sure a lot of you are likely concerned about voting tomorrow, whether or not it's safe,"" Mr. Biden said in a call with voters from Arizona, Florida and Illinois. ""You know, voting is at the very heart of who we are as a democracy, no more important duty for us as America, but there is also no more important duty for our leaders than ensuring everyone's safety and security.""
Mr. Biden said his campaign would follow the guidelines offered by state public health officials on how to best ensure populations ""are looked after while encouraging participation in our democracy."" He also pointed to some of the precautions states were taking to mitigate the risk, such as asking voters to maintain a distance while waiting in line and having poll workers wipe down voting machines in between the casting of ballots.
Mr. Sanders held his own online event Monday evening, in which he called for the country to come together during the coronavirus crisis.
""I would say that at this unbelievably difficult moment where so many people are very, very nervous, and appropriately so, this is a time when we must come together and understand that it's not me, and it's not you, it is us,"" Mr. Sanders said in what his campaign billed as a virtual rally. ""We are all in this together literally in the sense that if I have the virus then you're in trouble, and if you have the virus, then I'm in trouble.""
The virus loomed Sunday over the first one-on-one debate of the primary season, which Mr. Biden entered with a commanding lead over Mr. Sanders in both national polls and the overall delegate race. Both candidates were pressed on how they would handle the crisis as president—and what preventive measures the men, both in their late 70s, are taking to stay healthy.
Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders both condemned President Trump's handling of the crisis during the debate, which took place without a live audience and was broadcast from CNN's Washington studio. The Trump administration has been criticized for sending mixed messages about the urgency of the coronavirus pandemic and for delays facing people seeking testing for the virus.
Mr. Biden's aides emphasized in recent days that Mr. Trump's response to the coronavirus bolstered the former vice president's case that he can win the presidency on a message of restoring stability to the U.S. government.
Mr. Biden, who is leading Mr. Sanders by more than 150 delegates to the Democratic National Convention, where the nominee will be chosen, has been trying to unite the party behind his presidential bid. Leading up to the debate Sunday, Mr. Biden made a bid for liberal support by endorsing a student loan proposal championed by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and moving closer to Mr. Sanders on college affordability by saying he
would eliminate tuition for public colleges and universities
for students whose families earn less than $125,000.
He also pledged during the debate to name a woman as his running mate if he is the nominee, after some Democrats lamented that their diverse presidential field had narrowed to two white men. Mr. Sanders said he would ""in all likelihood"" do the same.
Aides to Mr. Sanders have acknowledged that his path to the nomination has significantly narrowed following a series of losses in primaries over the past few weeks.
Of the states voting Tuesday, aides said Mr. Sanders's best chance of notching a victory is in Arizona, where roughly one-third of the population is Hispanic. Although Mr. Sanders has led among Hispanic voters this cycle, a Monmouth University poll for Arizona released Monday still had Mr. Sanders
20 percentage points behind Mr. Biden in the state overall
.
Aides to Mr. Sanders also believe that Florida —Tuesday's largest delegate prize—is likely to go to Mr. Biden, whose lead in the state has ranged from 36 to 55 percentage points in surveys over the past month.
Mr. Sanders's praise for Fidel Castro's literacy program has prompted criticism in Latino-heavy Florida, where generations of Cubans sought refuge from the Caribbean nation's Communist government. During Sunday night's debate, Mr. Sanders said he has always ""opposed authoritarianism"" but reiterated his comments on the late Mr. Castro's literacy record.
Mr. Sanders also sought to draw a contrast with Mr. Biden on a litany of issues ranging from climate change to health care to trade. The sharp differences exposed potential roadblocks for Mr. Biden as he moves to unite the party and bring Mr. Sanders's supporters into his camp.
""He's making it hard for me right now,"" Mr. Biden said of Mr. Sanders after a lengthy exchange over their records. ""I was trying to give him credit for some things, and he won't even take the credit.""

WASHINGTON—Voters heading to the polls in some Super Tuesday states will be met by workers wearing medical gloves and check-in tables decorated with Purell bottles, as the
coronavirus outbreak
collides with the presidential campaign.
John Gardner, an election official in a county just outside Sacramento said his office recently ordered about 350 large jugs of hand sanitizer from Costo to make poll workers and voters feel at ease during California's primary.
Across the county's roughly 100 polling places, medical gloves have been distributed to poll workers—a new practice there. As per usual, disinfecting wipes will be used to clean voting machines, he said.
Mr. Gardner's team also added an extra curbside voting location where people can either drop off ballots or have a ballot brought to them by a poll worker.
""If you're not wanting to be in a public space with a bunch of people, you can just stay in your car and flick the ballot out,"" said Mr. Gardner, assistant registrar of voters in Solano County, Calif.
At least 43 people have been diagnosed with the novel infection within the U.S., not including repatriated Americans. But the outbreak has only recently begun to prompt adjustments on the campaign trail, as candidates continued jetting around the country and holding rallies ahead of Super Tuesday, when 14 states will weigh in on the Democratic nominating process.
In California and other Super Tuesday states, millions of people have already voted by mail. In Colorado, only 5% of voters are expected to vote in person, according to election officials there.
Jocelyn Bucaro, the director of elections in Denver, said that more people have called to inquire about how to change their vote, such as if they cast a mail-in ballot for someone who recently dropped out, than with questions about voting during the coronavirus outbreak.
""That's the advantage of our model. It provides a lot more flexibility even in situations like this, even with a public-health issue,"" Ms. Bucaro said. She also said that voters—if they are feeling sick, or are concerned about being in public and contracting the virus—can request an emergency ballot and receive a link ""within minutes"" to vote electronically.
""If you're sick, stay home,"" she said.
In the Austin, Texas, area, some election judges and poll workers failed to show up to their posts, telling county elections officials they were fearful of coronavirus, according to a statement from Travis County Clerk Dana DeBeauvoir.
""Super Tuesday got off to a rocky start due to multiple no-shows,"" the clerk said. ""To the extent that the Elections Office was given a reason, it seems people were fearful of the coronavirus.""
The office began using its own personnel to fill in as emergency recruits. Most locations were staffed as of 10 a.m., but some were still reporting long wait times. The county clerk's office noted that many poll workers are older people, considered a vulnerable population for the virus.
The candidates themselves, however, appear to be campaigning as normal. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont still holds his large rallies, including with 13,000 people in Boston last week. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts hasn't canceled her famous ""selfie lines,"" in which she shakes hands with hundreds of voters after events.
President Trump said Monday that he is not concerned about holding rallies either. ""I think it's very safe,"" he told reporters at the White House.
""These were set up a long time ago,"" he added of the rallies.
Caroline Gottfredson, 18, said she thought about coronavirus before attending Mr. Sanders's rally in Salt Lake City Monday but figured, ""If we're going to get sick, we're going to sick.""
There are no public conversations under way regarding how the outbreak could affect the Democratic or Republican conventions in July and August, but such mass gatherings could become questionable if the virus situation continues to get worse.
The bipartisan lobbying firm of Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen & Thomas in Washington took note in a memo to clients this week of how the virus may affect the presidential campaign. Besides Mr. Trump, it made mention of Mr. Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
""Large live events (rallies, fundraisers, conventions, in-person voting) could be replaced by virtual campaigning,"" the memo said. ""This helps candidates who self-fund (Bloomberg), small-dollar fundraisers (Sanders, Trump) and run strong digital campaigns (Trump, Sanders, Bloomberg).""
Republican National Convention officials said Monday that they are monitoring the situation. That Republican convention, which is expected to attract about 50,000 people, is scheduled to be held in late August in Charlotte, N.C.
The Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, also expected to attract roughly 50,000 attendees, is scheduled to be held in mid-July. Local officials have estimated the event will bring about $200 million in economic activity to the area, so any hiccups would have major financial ramifications.
So far, there has not been any deep discussion of worst-case-scenario planning by local tourism officials. ""We have not had conversations about it thus far,"" said Kristin Settle, spokeswoman for Visit Milwaukee, the region's convention and visitors bureau.
Convention Chief Executive Joe Solmonese said in a statement that the team would be in touch with local, state and federal health authorities. ""We will continue to monitor this developing situation closely and follow the guidance of the CDC and state and local health officials in the days and weeks ahead,"" he said.
The coronavirus has given candidates a chance to bring health care, which many Democratic primary voters say is their No. 1 policy issue, to the forefront. Candidates such as Mr. Bloomberg—who bought three minutes of TV airtime Sunday evening to give a presidential-style address on the topic—are calling for a White House office of global health security to be restored. The Obama-era office was eliminated by Mr. Trump.
Ms. Warren, who didn't gain traction during the first month of voting and is looking for a boost, used a speech in Houston to make the case that her financial background could help steer the nation through any economic crisis caused by a wider outbreak.
Jeffery Wang, a television writer based in Los Angeles, said he considered coronavirus concerns before driving about 45 minutes to Monterey Park, Calif., for a Warren rally. Some attendees waiting in line carried antibacterial hand sanitizer. A taco truck set up near the rally had a large antibacterial hand sanitizer pump that people waiting for food regularly used.
Mr. Wang said he decided that, regarding the Warren rally, ""If she's not worried about it, I'm not.""

NASHUA, N.H. -- Democrats in search of a centrist nominee to challenge President Trump are increasingly worried after contests in Iowa and New Hampshire consolidated liberal support behind Bernie Sanders and divided the larger moderate vote among multiple candidates.
The party's center lane is crowded with the rising former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Vice President Joe Biden. Looming in the March 3 Super Tuesday states and beyond is former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, buoyed by campaign spending that dwarfs all his opponents combined.
With no clear centrist front-runner, vulnerable freshman Democrats in Congress are texting each other anxiously, a Biden-allied fundraiser warns of a ""doomsday scenario"" and party strategists fret about what mixed early-state turnout means for November.
Predictions about which candidates are the most electable and which will prevail through a long primary season have proven unreliable in the past, particularly at this early stage of the process, before voting in the diverse states of South Carolina and Nevada. Barack Obama faced intraparty doubts in 2008, as did Mr. Trump in 2016.
With multiple contenders vowing to stay in the race, party leaders are yet again bracing for the likelihood of a protracted fight for the nomination that may not be settled by the time of the July convention in Milwaukee.
Adding to some Democrats' worries is the president's acquittal from impeachment and his strength among his most fervent supporters, as evidenced by the more than 11,000 who turned out for his Monday night rally in Manchester, N.H., a larger crowd than any assembled by a Democrat campaigning in the state.
""There is one thing that's universal, and that is anxiety,"" said Rufus Gifford, who served as finance director for President Obama's re-election campaign and has contributed to several campaigns.
The fear among some Democrats is predicated on the idea that Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist, would struggle to defeat Mr. Trump in November. Mr. Sanders and his supporters believe the party could unite around him if he is the nominee and that he could energize young voters and those in crucial Rust Belt states who swung to the GOP in 2016.
The Sanders campaign disputed the notion he would hurt Democrats in swing districts, noting that candidates in states that will be crucial in 2020 had requested his help during 2018 midterms.
Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg, a 38-year-old newcomer to the national scene, essentially tied in Iowa and finished one-two in New Hampshire. Ms. Warren has faded in the first two contests but is pressing forward, while Ms. Klobuchar, the No. 3 finisher in New Hampshire, is eyeing delegates when her home state of Minnesota votes on March 3.
If Mr. Biden has a strong showing in South Carolina and Nevada, he could regain lost momentum and potentially persuade wavering Democrats to stick with him through subsequent states.
Mr. Bloomberg meanwhile has poured more than $350 million of his fortune into a series of March states, including California, Texas and North Carolina.
Philip Levine, a former mayor of Miami Beach, Fla., who supports Mr. Bloomberg, said in an interview he received ""an avalanche"" of phone calls and emails Wednesday from donors asking how they could help, and from elected officials, whom he didn't name, asking his advice on ""how to tactfully retract"" their endorsements of Mr. Biden and shift their support to Mr. Bloomberg.
Some Democratic donors say privately there will be a lot of pressure for Mr. Biden to get out after South Carolina if he performs poorly there.
""We are going to compete in Super Tuesday states,"" said Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a Biden campaign co-chairman. ""Bloomberg is spending an awful lot of money, but he's also not had his turn in the barrel. He has not been on the debate stage. He's untested.""
Larry Rasky, who leads a pro-Biden super PAC called Unite the Country, sought to rally Biden donors in a fundraising memo Sunday by telling them that if they hedge their bets on Mr. Biden because of Mr. Bloomberg, they could be creating a ""doomsday scenario.""
""The Sanders-Warren wing of the Party is ready for the Bloomberg fight. Democrats cannot afford a split Convention. Do you really think the Sanders voters wing will support Mike Bloomberg? Do you think all the camps who have busted their butts and played by the rules will happily sign on"" to Mr. Bloomberg's campaign, he wrote.
The party's attempt to present itself as a steady, competent alternative to Mr. Trump has been marred by the chaotic Iowa caucuses, where more than a week later Mr. Sanders narrowly trails Mr. Buttigieg in state delegates, but Mr. Sanders leads in the popular vote. Both candidates have requested a recanvassing of certain precincts.
Party strategists are watching early-state turnout closely for clues about whether Democrats are energized to vote.
More than 176,000 people participated in the Iowa Democratic caucuses this year, a slight increase from four years ago but well behind the nearly 240,000 who caucused in 2008. New Hampshire was a brighter spot: Turnout reached about 297,000 voters in the Democratic primary, compared with about 255,000 in 2016 and nearly 290,000 in 2008.
""Everything is splintered,"" said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist and former adviser to West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. ""And it just shows that voters aren't falling in love with any of these candidates, and that's a problem.""
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has conducted focus groups in early-voting states and general-election battlegrounds, said she has been struck by ""the duality of who you like and who you think can beat Trump. And they're not necessarily the same thing.""
In a sign of Democrats' interest in finding an alternative to Mr. Biden, some moderate House Democrats have embraced Mr. Bloomberg, including Reps. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Haley Stevens of Michigan and Scott Peters of California. On Wednesday, two African-American members of Congress, Reps. Lucy McBath (D., Ga.) and Gregory Meeks (D., N.Y.) said they were backing Mr. Bloomberg.
Rep. Stephanie Murphy, the chairwoman of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition caucus, said Mr. Sanders wouldn't be able to win over swing voters, and if he becomes the party's nominee, he could put the new House majority at risk. ""For many moderate districts and Trump-won districts, Bernie Sanders at the top of the ticket would create headwinds for house members running for re-election,"" she said.
Former Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, said in a tweet Tuesday that ""Sanders is just as polarizing as Trump AND he'll ruin our economy."" Mr. Sanders's campaign manager tweeted back: ""This is what panic from the Wall Street elite looks and sounds like.""
For most of the campaign, Mr. Biden has presented himself as the candidate best able to win states narrowly carried by Mr. Trump, including his boyhood state of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.
Polls indicate that Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar both have struggled to appeal to African-American voters. Mr. Bloomberg apologized for a second time Tuesday amid a fresh round of criticism for his support of stop-and-frisk policing in New York City.
Mr. Sanders has argued that Democrats must nominate someone who can generate enthusiasm and mobilize young people and infrequent voters who were turned off by their choices in the 2016 election. The senator has arguably the best ability to command large crowds, evidenced by more than 7,500 people who showed up for a primary eve rally and concert at the University of New Hampshire.
In the last week, Mr. Sanders has taken the lead in the RealClearPolitics average of national Democratic primary polls, after Mr. Biden had led for months.

Jane Cline has been bombarded by political texts from different Democratic 2020 presidential campaigns. She doesn't recall signing up for any of them.
Americans, particularly in early nominating and battleground states, are already receiving millions of texts from Democratic and Republican political campaigns, with fundraising messages and calls to action regularly lighting up their smartphone screens.
Ms. Cline, a 58-year-old retiree, hasn't responded to any of the messages she's received out of fear she will just get more. ""I don't like them,"" she said in January at an Ames, Iowa, event for Joe Biden ahead of the state's caucuses. ""I guess it's just replacing the telemarketer on the phone.""
Political texts have grown increasingly important as some campaigns pulled back from digital advertising after certain technology platforms such as Twitter and Google changed their policies. The text messages capture voter attention more effectively than emails, mailers or calls, advocacy groups and campaign organizers say.
Many campaigns scrape data, including voter registration files, event attendee lists or survey respondent records for reams of phone numbers that belong to individuals likely to be interested in their messages, whether or not those people have explicitly agreed to receive texts. In late January, the Democratic National Committee said it purchased tens of millions of cellphone numbers to better reach voters.
Within the complex plumbing that delivers those political text messages, however, texting service providers, wireless carriers and consumer advocates are divided over what permission, if any, is necessary, to ping a voter. There are no federal guidelines clarifying whether these messages require consent.
In the 2018 midterm election, Democratic campaigns and politically adjacent organizations sent 350 million text messages through the two largest left-leaning political texting companies, Hustle and GetThru, according to an analysis by progressive nonprofit Tech for Campaigns.
President Trump's re-election campaign has been reaching out to people through texts and is expected to send hundreds of millions of messages leading up to the November election, people familiar with the efforts said.
Democratic presidential contenders, including those who have dropped out of the race, have already sent at least tens of millions of texts, campaign aides said. Michael Bloomberg's campaign is hiring workers in California to post on social media and send text messages to their friends about him, The Wall Street Journal has reported.
Political texting firms serving presidential campaigns have for months built strategies to reach voters or potential supporters through what they describe as peer-to-peer texting, in which messages are sent manually to individual voters. Those messages are usually sent by volunteers or political staffers holding smartphones, and at times by workers at desktop computers hired by campaigns to broaden their reach.
Many messages are prewritten, though certain details like names can be customized. They typically focus on organizing supporters, asking for money or sharing event information. As it gets closer to the election, they will turn toward getting out the vote.
""This isn't Nike trying to sell people shoes or Ray-Ban trying to sell people sunglasses,"" said Daniel Souweine, founder and chief executive GetThru, which is working with Democratic campaigns. ""This is political campaigns of all stripes reaching out, up and down the ballot.""
At the heart of the brewing conflict is whether political text messages are, in fact, peer-to-peer messages, or if they involve automation that makes them subject to a telephone consumer protection law that requires explicit consent from recipients and can lead to stiff financial penalties for violations.
Political campaigns and the technology firms that help them distribute messages say text messages are peer-to-peer because a human manually hits send. Consumer advocates say many political texts rely on systems that can be used to make robocalls and are therefore subject to the federal law.
Verizon Communications Inc. asks political campaigns to use a text message distribution system that requires consumer consent. Verizon says messages sent through other channels risk getting flagged as spam. ""We're trying to make sure that text messaging doesn't go the way of out-of-control robocalling,"" said Tamara Preiss, vice president of federal regulatory affairs.
AT&T Inc. doesn't want to risk blocking political messages. The carrier is working on a code that would let them all go through, people familiar with the matter said. A spokesman for the carrier referred queries to the CTIA industry group, whose best practices state political organizations should secure consumers' consent before they start sending messages.
Matt Gerst, vice president of regulatory affairs at the CTIA, said it wants to balance emerging communications channels with consumer protection. ""Our experiences with robocalling and emailing led us to this place,"" he said.
Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google allow most mobile phone users to filter spam texts.
Autodialed texts aren't allowed without prior express consent, according to the Federal Communications Commission. But the regulator and Congress have stopped short of defining what constitutes an auto-dialer. Courts have issued differing opinions on the matter.
An FCC spokesman said the agency is still reviewing whether peer-to-peer messages are subject to the federal law governing contact with mobile phones.
California in January started requiring more disclosure in text messages, including whether they are sent from paid staff.
RumbleUp, which works with Republican and center-right political campaigns and groups, added to its platform an explainer of the rule and a template with proper disclosures for text messages sent to California area codes, said Thomas Peters, who leads the texting firm. It is in the process of adding one for relevant ZIP Codes.
Florida resident Shehan Wijesinha sued antiabortion group Susan B. Anthony List Inc. in July 2018 after he received a text message from the organization about President Trump's Supreme Court selection. Mr. Wijesinha said he hadn't provided the group with consent and reached a class-action settlement with the group.
A spokeswoman for Susan B. Anthony List said the organization denied wrongdoing and settled to avoid expensive and drawn-out litigation. It agreed to pay $5 to each member of the settlement class who submitted timely and valid claims with a cap of around $1 million, and said it received $20,055 in claims.

WASHINGTON -- Senators wavering on calling new witnesses in President Trump's impeachment trial hinted Wednesday at the factors they were considering, as Republican leaders tried to persuade lawmakers to bring the proceedings to a close later this week without fresh testimony.
After several days of opening arguments by each side that offered little give-and-take, Wednesday's session brought an opportunity for senators to direct questions at Mr. Trump's legal team and Democratic House members, who are serving as prosecutors in the trial. Mr. Trump's lawyers portrayed Democrats' case for impeachment as politically motivated and well short of the bar needed to remove a president from office. The Democratic lawmakers said they were trying to block Mr. Trump from cheating to win this year's election and argued that Republican senators were holding Mr. Trump to an unusually low standard.
Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was pushing Republicans to defeat a vote to bring in new witnesses and information, while Democrats argued that a fair trial would include additional evidence, including testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton. While Mr. McConnell (R., Ky.) had said a day earlier that he didn't yet have the votes to block more witnesses, Republican leaders suggested Wednesday they would eventually get there. Democratic leaders in the Senate said procuring additional testimony would be an uphill battle. The Senate is expected to vote Friday on whether to call for witnesses.
In one notable exchange, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- two Republican senators who have said they are debating siding with Democrats on calling new witnesses -- asked a question that is central to the impeachment case: whether the White House had any record of Mr. Trump's trying to end corruption in Ukraine before former Vice President Joe Biden entered the Democratic presidential race last spring. The president has said an overall concern with Ukraine corruption was behind his call to announce an investigation of Mr. Biden while he was freezing nearly $400 million in aid to the country.
In response to the two senators' questions, which were read aloud by Chief Justice John Roberts, deputy White House counsel Pat Philbin said he had no such record of a previous concern with corruption by Mr. Trump. But he said the Republican president had developed concerns about Mr. Biden and his son Hunter after his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, had been pushing for Ukraine to investigate the former vice president in January 2019. Mr. Biden started his campaign in April. ""The president . . . gets information from Rudy Giuliani,"" Mr. Philbin said.
Mr. Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart in July to investigate the elder Mr. Biden's actions in Ukraine as vice president while his son served on the board of a gas company there.
Mr. Bolton in a forthcoming book wrote that the president told him in August that he was holding up the aid until Ukraine agreed to the investigations he was seeking. The aid to Ukraine was released in September amid a bipartisan uproar in Congress.
Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the chamber's Democratic leader, asked the House lawmakers, who are essentially acting as prosecutors in the trial, if there could be a fair trial without calling Mr. Bolton.
""The short answer to that question is no,"" Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, responded. He told lawmakers not to wait for the book, which is due to be published in March.
In tweets Wednesday, Mr. Trump, who has denied making any connection between Ukraine aid and investigating the Bidens, urged Republicans to reject calling witnesses and called Mr. Bolton's yet unpublished book ""nasty & untrue."" The White House's National Security Council said Wednesday that it told Mr. Bolton's lawyer last week that Mr. Bolton's manuscript contained ""significant amounts"" of classified information and couldn't be published in its current form.
In response, Chuck Cooper, Mr. Bolton's lawyer, said he sought immediate guidance last week on whether the NSC deemed classified any of the material in the chapter related to Ukraine, though he said he didn't believe that information ""could reasonably be considered classified."" Mr. Cooper said he didn't get a response to his email.
Sens. Collins, Murkowski and Mitt Romney (R., Utah), another juror who has said he is open to new testimony, asked the president's lawyers how the Senate should view a situation in which Mr. Trump might have more than one reason to withhold aid from Ukraine.
""All elected officials, to some extent, have in mind how their conduct, how their decisions, their policy decisions, will affect the next election,"" Mr. Philbin replied. He said that ""can't be a basis for removing a president from office.""
In a departure from what the Trump team has previously argued, Alan Dershowitz offered a new theory: that because Mr. Trump believes his re-election is in the public interest, even if he had political motivations in pressing Ukraine to open an investigation into the Bidens, it wouldn't be impeachable.
""Every public official that I know believes that his election is in the public interest,"" Mr. Dershowitz said.
Mr. Schiff shot back that if President Obama, a Democrat, had asked Russia to investigate Mr. Romney, his 2012 opponent, the Senate would have found it impeachable. ""All quid pro quos are fine, it's carte blanche? Is that really what we're prepared to say?"" Mr. Schiff said.
The question-and-answer portion of the trial will continue on Thursday.
Republican leaders on Wednesday worked to dissuade Republicans from joining Democrats on seeking subpoenas for Mr. Bolton or others who may have close knowledge of the Ukraine pressure campaign. Mr. McConnell met Wednesday morning with Ms. Murkowski, who had earlier said that she was curious about what Mr. Bolton had to say. After the meeting, Ms. Murkowski declined to discuss witnesses or her meeting.
Republicans sought to project confidence on Wednesday. ""I'm optimistic,"" Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the Republican whip, said of defeating the motion to bring in new witnesses.
The House last fall had sought Mr. Bolton's testimony but declined to subpoena him because of Democrats' wish to move quickly and not get bogged down in court fights.

The coronavirus pandemic
has upended daily life for millions of people stuck in their homes. Yet one American tradition continues: politicians asking for money.
To comply with health guidelines urging
social distancing
, candidates have scrapped in-person events and ramped up their digital and telephone fundraising efforts, more than a dozen people involved in campaigns, fundraising and digital organizing said.
Campaigns and state parties are also scrambling to arrange virtual fundraising events, using teleconferences or digital tools such as Zoom, people familiar with the discussions said. But those are largely untested strategies, and using them effectively is a work in progress.
Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden had planned to hold a virtual fundraiser over Zoom this past week but delayed it until the week ahead. The former vice president is also spending more time calling potential donors to try to offset the cancellation of in-person fundraisers, people familiar with the strategy said.
""We're not going to stop fundraising or campaigning, by any means,"" said TJ Ducklo, a spokesman for Mr. Biden's campaign. ""But this is a national crisis, and we are sensitive to that in how we do our fundraising.""
President Trump's campaign, which held its last fundraising event on March 9 near Orlando, Fla., just as the scope of the public health crisis was setting in, has switched to all-digital fundraising for now.
""Our unmatched data and digital operation make us uniquely equipped to sustain a digital fundraising operation,"" said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for Mr. Trump's campaign.
Some political technology vendors are speeding up the development of new applications to connect better with donors virtually. CallTime.AI, which makes a product connecting people from different areas onto the same fundraising call, has seen active usage rise 15% during the past week and a burst of new potential clients, said Andrew Blumenfeld, co-founder of parent company Dreambase.
Political candidates and groups say that no matter how awkward it is to continue raising money as the world battles a pandemic, they see no other choice. The presidential candidates and related party and other groups spend more than $2 billion in a typical presidential election cycle, and Election Day is less than eight months out.
""It's critical to be raising money right now in these very difficult times with the virus,"" said Marc Nathanson, a longtime Democratic donor who is also a member of the finance committees for the Democratic National Committee and the Biden campaign. Mr. Nathanson said that for people who are able to give, it is ""very, very important—and we have to not let our guard down in the ultimate goal in defeating Donald Trump.""
It is too soon to tell how much the public health crisis will cause campaigns to shift their financial resources. Right now most voter registration and door-knocking efforts, and everything from roundtables to arena rallies, have been suspended. People involved in planning Democratic fundraisers said they haven't scheduled events into May, given the uncertainty.
That could mean some candidates shift more money into television and digital advertising, along with boosting marketing emails, seeing those as trusted ways to reach voters. Meanwhile, large and small campaigns—including Senate, House, gubernatorial and local candidates—are in touch with political tech start-ups, hoping that using existing vendor platforms will be faster than trying to build them from scratch, said Betsy Hoover, co-founder of left-leaning political tech incubator Higher Ground Labs.
The clearest way to keep raising money during the uncertainty is online, and candidates in both parties have established payment processing portals, including ActBlue for Democrats and WinRed for Republicans.
But some of the most recent solicitations can seem jarringly like a time capsule from pre-virus days:
""We set a HUGE goal to hit before tomorrow night,"" a Monday text message from Mr. Biden's campaign says.
Subject lines of Trump campaign emails this week included: ""A hand-signed hat for YOU"" and ""Promises Made. Promises Kept.""

Do you plan to give to a political campaign amid coronavirus concerns? Join the conversation below.
Erin Hill, executive director of ActBlue, said any political entity raising money in this environment would be wise to acknowledge that the public is distracted and then make the case for why it needs money.
""The thing that has made email programs successful is authenticity,"" she said. ""You can't not acknowledge what is going on. It's all about grappling with this together and being honest about what you're thinking.""
Ms. Hill declined to give details about whether contributions through ActBlue have slowed. She said that fewer campaigns are soliciting political contributions right now, but that when they do ask, people are still giving.
For example, Sen. Bernie Sanders's campaign said it raised $2 million on Sunday as he and Mr. Biden debated. Mr. Biden's campaign said that it had raised more than $35 million so far in March, its best month yet. On Tuesday, Mr. Sanders held a virtual address on coronavirus, with options to donate at the top of the screen.
Later in the week, however, some dispatches from the Sanders and Biden campaigns didn't include donation links. Instead, they offered a link for people to sign their names in support of efforts intended to combat the effects of coronavirus.
WinRed President Gerrit Lansing said its donations are flat to up, compared with prior weeks. The online portal just became available in the past year, giving Republicans a way to try to match the Democrats' widespread adoption of ActBlue, which was founded more than 15 years ago.
Mr. Lansing added that in the past six months, some Republican campaigns urged donors to sign up to make automatic monthly contributions. ""This builds predictability and resiliency into any campaign's online fundraising, so they're better prepared during an unpredictable situation like this,"" he said.
The timing of the crisis hits Mr. Biden at a particularly tough moment, because it coincides with his essentially locking up the Democratic nomination and, for the first time, being in a position to command big audiences at fundraisers. Mr. Biden's campaign said it would make virtual fundraisers open to reporters, as it has with its in-person events.

Mr. Trump, who faced no serious primary challenge and mathematically locked up the Republican nomination this week, has a significant cash advantage. His campaign had more than $92 million in the bank at the end of January, the most recent Federal Election Commission reports showed.
Mr. Trump's campaign also provided a vivid illustration of why in-person fundraisers are now out of the question. Two people tested positive for coronavirus after attending events at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort the weekend of March 7, including at least one fundraiser. Other attendees isolated themselves as a precaution.
Mr. Trump also attended the March 9 fundraiser in Florida that included Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, who has been isolated with flu-like symptoms in recent days but said she tested negative for coronavirus. Mr. Trump also said he has tested negative for coronavirus.

Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said this week that he plans to use the 11th Democratic debate to press front-runner Joe Biden on a series of liberal policy issues.
Mr. Sanders acknowledged Wednesday, after a set of losses in
key primaries the night before
that he was losing what he called the ""debate over electability"" to Mr. Biden. But he said if the former vice president hopes to win over his liberal supporters, he needs to sell them on his plans for health care, student loan debt and more.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you expect Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders to set themselves apart from one another in this debate? Join the conversation below.
Here are five of the questions Mr. Sanders said he planned to ask and a comparison of what the two Democrats have said on each issue in past debates.
Health care and Medicare for All: ""What are you going to do to end the absurdity of the United States of America being the only major country on earth where health care is not a human right? Are you really going to veto a Medicare for All bill, if it is passed in Congress?""
Biden in Feb. 7 debate: ""My proposal gives you a choice. You're gonna be covered. You have Medicare if you want it, you turn up, we're gonna restore all the cuts that they made in Obamacare. We're gonna reduce drug prices, reduce prescription prices, reduce copays, etc. And it costs a lot of money, it costs $750 billion over 10 years…Bernie's plan costs double, double what the taxpayers are paying for every single program we spend on in the United States of America.""
Sanders in Dec. 19 debate: ""When the American people understand that Medicare for All expands Medicare to cover home health care, dental care, eyeglasses in hearing aids and does it add a cost far, far lower than what some of my opponents are talking about, you know what? We are going to have the American people behind us. We will have Congress behind us.""
Medical costs and debt: ""What are you going to do for the 500,000 people who go bankrupt in our country because of medically related debt? And what are you going to do for the working people of this country and small-business people who are paying on average 20 percent to health care?""
Biden in Jan. 14 debate: ""The proposal I lay out does in fact limit drug costs. It sets up—allows all of the drug companies to—excuse me, it allows you to—Medicare to negotiate with drug companies for the price. It sets a system whereby you cannot raise the price of a drug beyond the cost of medical inflation and, by the way, there is mental health parity that I called for in the Obamacare expanded with the Biden option.""
Sanders in Jan. 14 debate: ""We are spending twice as much per capita on health care as do the people of any other country. Look, we have talked about health care for all in this country for over 100 years. Now is the time to take on the greed and corruption of the health-care industry, of the drug companies and finally provide health care to all through a Medicare for All single-payer program. It won't be easy, but that is what we have to do.""
Income inequality: ""What are you going to do to end the absurdity of billionaires buying elections and the three wealthiest people in America owning more wealth than the bottom half of our people?""
Biden in June 27 debate: ""Look, Donald Trump has put us in a horrible situation. We do have enormous income inequality, and one thing I agree honestly can make massive cuts in the $1.6 trillion in tax loopholes out there, and I would be going about eliminating Donald Trump's tax cuts for the wealthy.""
Sanders in Feb. 19 debate: ""We have a wealth tax...We are going to raise it in a progressive way which deals with income and wealth inequality and makes certain, finally, that health care in this country is a human right, not a privilege.""
College Affordability and Student Debt: ""What are you going to do to make sure that all of our people can go to college or trade school regardless of their income? And what are you going to do about the millions of people who are struggling with outrageous levels of student debt?""
Biden in June 27 debate: ""That's why there should be free community college, cutting in half the cost of college. That's why we should be in the position where we do not have anyone have to pay back the student debt when they get out, they're making less than $25,000 a year. Their debt is frozen. No interest payment until they get beyond that. We can't put people in a position where they aren't able to go on and move on.""
Sanders in Dec. 19 debate: ""We need to make public colleges and universities tuition-free, and by taxing billionaires and by taxing Wall Street, we will cancel all student debt in this country.""
Climate change and energy: ""How are you going to respond to the scientists who tell us we have seven or eight years remaining to transform our energy system before irreparable harm takes place to this planet because of the ravages of climate change?""
Biden in Jan. 14 debate: ""Look, what we have to do is we have to act right away. And the way we act right away is immediately, if I'm elected president, I will reinstate all the mileage standards that existed in our administration, which were taken down. That's 12 billion gallons of gasoline, barrels of gasoline to be saved immediately.""
Sanders in Feb. 19 debate: ""This is an existential threat. You know what that means, Chuck? That means we are fighting for the future of this planet. And the Green New Deal that I support, by the way, will create up to 20 million good paying jobs as we move our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.""
Mass incarceration: ""At a time when we have more people in jail than communist China, a nation four times our size, what are you going to do to end mass incarceration and a racist criminal justice system?""
Biden in Sept. 12 debate: ""We should be talking about rehabilitation. Nobody should be in jail for a nonviolent crime. When we were in the White House, we released 36,000 people from the federal prison system. Nobody should be in jail for a drug problem. They should be going directly to a rehabilitation. We build more rehabilitation centers, not prisons. We—I'm the guy that put in the drug courts to divert people from the criminal justice system. And so, we have to change the whole way we look at this. When we put people in prison, we have to equip them when they get out.""
Sanders in Feb. 7 debate: ""We invest in our young people, in jobs and education, not more jails and incarceration. We end the war on drugs, which has disproportionately impacted African-Americans, Latinos and Native Americans. We end private prisons and detention centers in America.""

AUTO INDUSTRY PLEADS for delay in North American trade-deal implementation due to coronavirus pandemic. Now that Canada has ratified the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the Trump administration is eager to see the pact enter into force as soon as possible. President Trump wants to tout the impact of the new agreement, which will replace Nafta, in the 2020 election campaign. But the auto industry wants its new regulations delayed until next year.
""When you add to that the Covid-19 crisis, this is really beyond understanding that the administration is trying to do this,"" Ann Wilson, senior vice president at the Motor & Equipment Manufacturers Association, told the Journal's William Mauldin. ""If you force us to try to comply by June 1, we will not comply, and tariffs will be unnecessarily paid.""
If cars and auto parts don't follow a raft of new rules -- including regulations designed to ensure that much of a car is built with high-wage labor -- then companies will have to pay tariffs when those vehicles or components cross the Mexican or Canadian border. Those border crossings were tightened this week because of the pandemic, but not in a way that should affect commercial trade.
The auto industry has a powerful Republican ally on its side: Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said he believes the industry has ""a good argument"" for a delay. Supply chains are badly disrupted because of the pandemic, and numerous auto makers are closing their North American factories.
HOUSE REPUBLICANS' campaign organization urges its candidates to ""exercise increased sensitivity"" while campaigning during the coronavirus outbreak. An internal memo this week accused Democrats of politicizing the crisis and cable-news networks of allowing attacks to go ""largely unchecked,"" seemingly a reference to Sunday's Democratic presidential debate. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders and other Democrats have been critical of congressional Republicans and the Trump administration's approach to the crisis.
The memo from the National Republican Congressional Committee encouraged candidates to continue fundraising, but not to connect it to the crisis. Their advice to candidates to ""ask yourself if your press release or snarky comment are in poor taste"" raised the most hackles from Democrats who have been on the receiving end of the NRCC's attacks. In recent months, those have included putting the name of an African-American congresswoman from Georgia on a ""For Sale"" sign and placing ""moving boxes"" outside House Democrats' offices following the impeachment vote, prompting a U.S. Capitol Police probe.
TULSI GABBARD has ended her presidential campaign, but she has a new cause to promote: universal basic income, which had been the signature proposal of fellow campaign dropout Andrew Yang. Gabbard, who isn't seeking re-election to her Hawaii congressional seat, introduced a resolution last week to provide $1,000 a month to American adults during the pandemic, a cause that has caught fire with Republicans and Democrats alike. Gabbard has sent out numerous tweets and videos promoting the plan: ""Glad to see @TomCottonAR @MittRomney @AOC & others joining my efforts,"" she tweeted on Tuesday.
CONSERVATIVE ECONOMISTS and some business groups scold bipartisan fiscal-stimulus proposals to deal with the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, worrying they could have permanent consequences. Economist Arthur Laffer, commentator Stephen Moore and businessman Steve Forbes put out a statement decrying proposals to ""expand welfare and other income redistribution benefits like paid leave and unemployment benefits that will inhibit growth and discourage work."" The conservative Club for Growth urged members of Congress to vote against the coronavirus legislation that passed the House last week for similar reasons. Their opinion was mostly ignored, with the legislation passing 363-40.
LOBBYISTS RALLY to support their favorite D.C. restaurants. Lyndon Boozer, a telecommunications sector lobbyist, started an online fundraiser with other K Street and Capitol Hill fixtures to support the staff of Bobby Van's Grill, which like other restaurants is closed during the pandemic. ""It's a familiar watering hole for us,"" Boozer said. ""We have to come together so these establishments survive."" The fund had raised about $7,000 as of midday Thursday, far exceeding the initial $2,000 goal. Other lobbyists and trade association executives have encouraged their friends and associates to order delivery from other Washington-establishment hot spots, including mid-Atlantic fare favorite Equinox.
MINOR MEMOS: National Cannabis Festival at Washington's RFK stadium postponed until September because of coronavirus. . . . Former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger films public-service coronavirus video with pet pony Whiskey and donkey Lulu encouraging people to stay home. . . . Twitter uses a photo of deceased author Philip Roth instead of Biden in its election coverage.

The
Democratic primary race
has divided voters into two clear coalitions, one backing Sen. Bernie Sanders's call for
revolutionary change
and one drawn to the quieter tone and more incremental policies proposed by former Vice President Joe Biden.

Super Tuesday
supplied one surprising reason that Mr. Biden's coalition, so far, is the larger one: President Trump, a force from outside the Democratic Party, is helping to change the
Democratic electorate
, making it more friendly to Mr. Biden's style of politics.
The shift in voting patterns has emerged from exit polls as well as ballots cast by nearly 14 million Americans in 16 Democratic primaries and three caucuses. Voters surged to the polls this week in the affluent suburbs outside big cities—among them Nashville, Houston, Richmond, Va., and Washington, D.C.—producing a voter pool that was
more moderate in its politics
than in 2016 and more supportive of Mr. Biden than his main opponent.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you think voters are firmly fixed in one political party or do people cross party lines in their voting choices? Join the conversation below.
Mixed in among the Democrats were voters such as Paige McIntosh of Fairfax County, Va., a lifelong Republican who cast the first Democratic primary ballot of her life. Her vote was both an embrace of Mr. Biden and a rejection of Mr. Trump. ""I want someone moderate to vote for. I'm desperate for someone moderate to vote for,"" said Ms. McIntosh, 48, who owns a landscaping business. ""I worry about the tenor in this country, where it's very, very divisive.""
The changes Mr. Trump brought to the Republican Party have been powerful in the political marketplace, giving the GOP the White House and protecting its Senate majority. Reading the Tuesday election results, political analysts found evidence that they had also changed the Democrats.

With his assertive style and focus on the ""forgotten"" men and women with weakened economic prospects, ""the president accelerated the migration of upscale, suburban moderates into the Democratic Party and accelerated the migration of the white, working-class to the Republican fold,"" said David Wasserman, a political analyst at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.
The result, as seen in Mr. Biden's victories in 10 of 14 states on Tuesday, was counterintuitive for a party whose candidates are pushing policies to the left of those of the Obama administration. When it comes to how voters view themselves, ""the Democratic Party is less progressive than it was in 2016, not more,"" Mr. Wasserman said.
Exit polls in many states found a shift away from the party's ideological edge, as more primary voters identified as moderate or conservative than in 2016, and fewer called themselves liberal. The share of moderate and conservative voters rose by 15 percentage points in Virginia, 6 points in Massachusetts, by three in Tennessee and Alabama and two in Texas—all states that Mr. Biden won. In addition to feelings about Mr. Trump, the lack of a competitive GOP primary may have prompted some moderate or conservative voters to participate in the Democratic primary. If so, that could suggest that while the pool of voters in Democratic primaries has become more moderate, the party retains a significant core of liberal members.
Mr. Trump agrees that voters are changing affiliation, but he sees movement to the GOP. ""The insanity of the Democratic Party is why millions of registered Democrat voters are joining our movement. They are joining our great Republican Party,"" the president said late last month at a rally in South Carolina, where he criticized Democratic proposals to toughen gun regulations, relax immigration laws and replace private insurance with Medicare for All.
If patterns hold and some Republicans remain open to crossing party lines, the shift could have big implications for November. Democrats could have a larger pool of voters to appeal to as Mr. Trump tries to poach voters from core Democratic groups, such as African-Americans, Hispanics and working-class, white voters, who were once a pillar of the Democratic Party.
Exit polls from Super Tuesday and earlier contests showed that Mr. Sanders retained much of his coalition from 2016 of young voters and those calling themselves ""very liberal."" The returns also showed that he had added an important new group: Hispanic voters.
Excluding California due to its partial results, the Super Tuesday county that gave Mr. Sanders his largest vote margin was Saguache County, Colo., a rural community with a large Hispanic population, a poverty rate above the national average and household incomes well below the national median. The five counties in which Mr. Sanders improved most over his 2016 vote totals were all heavily Hispanic counties in Texas, near the border with Mexico.
Jennifer Allen, a Latina voter in San Antonio, said the Democratic Party had failed her, and she was ready for Mr. Sanders's plans for government to take a more active role in helping people navigate the economy. A hairdresser who owns her own business, Ms. Allen, 51, said that she had never had health insurance and was stuck with a $15,000 tab for a kidney stone two years ago, which she said was sent to a collections agency, even though she had paid off two-thirds of the bill.
His policies would touch ""everything that would affect my life personally,'' she said.
Mr. Sanders's coalition also has large shares of younger voters, as in 2016, when he carried 71% of Democratic primary voters under age 30, exit polls showed. On Tuesday, three of the five counties that gave Mr. Sanders his biggest vote share, outside of California, were college communities in Colorado and North Carolina.
In Minneapolis, 29-year-old Esther Park said her parents were carrying high medical debt, ""which Bernie will be planning on eliminating."" And she is carrying student debt, which Mr. Sanders would cancel. ""That's been preventing me from living my life to the fullest right now,"" she said.
In contrast to Mr. Sanders's coalition, the five counties that gave Mr. Biden their biggest margins were all largely African-American communities in Virginia and Alabama, where he took 75% of the vote. Black voters have been a core part of his constituency, like that of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic primary.
Mr. Biden's coalition also includes voters in affluent suburbs. Many that showed big upticks in Super Tuesday voting had backed Sens. Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz over Mr. Trump in the 2016 GOP primaries. Then in 2018, they were part of the suburban wave that helped flip enough seats to give Democrats a majority in the U.S. House.
Though the number of party switchers is thought to be only a small share of the Democratic voter pool, analysts said this showed that at least some of the Democratic votes this week were coming from disaffected Republicans and independents. ""The Democratic Party, in terms of who is in it now, is not as liberal as before in the sense that you have a lot of former Republicans who are now Democrats,"" said Doug Sosnik, a longtime strategist and White House aide to President Bill Clinton. ""These are people who disproportionately are female, have higher education and live in suburban areas.""
Mr. Sanders, asked Friday about Mr. Biden's expansion of the electorate with suburban voters, said: ""We're doing the best that we can…this is a unique campaign in the modern history of this country.""
Outside Washington, D.C., turnout rose 75% in populous Fairfax County, Va., one of the nation's wealthiest. Like Ms. McIntosh, Republican Deb Schrag, a Fairfax County resident, cast her first-ever vote in a Democratic primary, backing Mr. Biden. ""He has a calming effect. He's not impetuous,"" she said.
Ms. Schrag, 55, who runs a surgery center, said she has been a lifelong member of the GOP and served as public-relations chairman of the college Republicans while a student at Virginia Tech.
In many cases, the Democratic Party can't count on long-term support from Tuesday's crossover votes. Ms. McIntosh and Ms. Schrag said they were not fully in the Democratic fold and might vote for Republican candidates down-ballot. ""Absolutely,"" said Ms. McIntosh, ""with pleasure.""

Ukrainian authorities opened a criminal probe into whether the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was put under surveillance by American citizens, as text messages made public this week suggest, before she was removed from her post last year.
The messages about Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch were among materials involving an associate of Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's lawyer,
released by House Democrats
as part of the impeachment probe into the president. Those messages and prime-time television interviews by the associate, Lev Parnas, reverberated in Washington on Thursday as the Senate opened the impeachment trial.
Democrats began weighing whether to call Mr. Parnas as a witness either in the Senate trial or in another proceeding, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) describing him as a credible witness.

Trump Impeachment Trial Begins

Republicans, meanwhile, worked to challenge that notion, noting Mr. Parnas's arrest in October on charges of campaign-finance violations, to which he pleaded not guilty.
Mr. Parnas assisted Mr. Giuliani as he sought to pressure Ukraine to undertake investigations that would politically benefit Mr. Trump—an effort that helped set off the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Trump has called the inquiry a politically motivated hoax.
In an interview Wednesday with MSNBC, Mr. Parnas tied Mr. Trump to his efforts to get Ukrainian officials to open probes into alleged election interference and into Democrat Joe Biden and his son.
Ukrainian authorities said Thursday they were investigating possible surveillance of Ms. Yovanovitch. Text messages released by Democrats showed Robert F. Hyde, a Trump backer and Republican congressional candidate in Connecticut, telling Mr. Parnas he was monitoring the ambassador's movements.

What could the Ukraine probe uncover that hasn't been disclosed in previous investigations? Join the conversation below.
Ukraine's Interior Ministry said it would ""investigate whether there were any violations of Ukrainian and international laws…or [if it was] just bravado and fake talk in an informal conversation between two U.S. citizens.""
""Ukraine cannot ignore such illegal activities on its territory,"" the ministry said.
The ministry appealed for the U.S. to cooperate with the probe. The State Department didn't respond to a request for comment and the Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment.
FBI personnel visited Mr. Hyde's Connecticut home and business on Thursday, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The texts Mr. Hyde sent to Mr. Parnas in the spring of 2019 included such messages as: ""they will let me know when she's on the move,"" ""They are willing to help if we/you would like to pay a price"" and ""Guess you can do anything in Ukraine with money.""
Mr. Hyde later texted, ""if you want her out they need to make contact with security forces.""
Mr. Hyde has said he was never in Kyiv and denied he was monitoring the ambassador. In an interview Wednesday with Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. television host Eric Bolling, Mr. Hyde was asked if he ever ""had eyes on Marie Yovanovitch.""
""Absolutely not, are you kidding me?"" he responded. ""I'm a little landscaper from f—ing Connecticut. Come on."" He added: ""I thought we were playing.""
The text messages and interviews by Mr. Parnas, coming just as the House turned over the articles of impeachment to the Senate, brought renewed attention to the Soviet-born businessman and his ties to Trump supporters.
Mr. Trump on Thursday reiterated that he didn't know Mr. Parnas ""at all"" and said they had taken photos together at fundraisers. ""Perhaps he's a fine man, perhaps he's not,"" the president said. ""I don't believe I've ever spoken to him.""
Joseph Bondy, a lawyer for Mr. Parnas, responded by tweeting a video of Mr. Parnas standing with the president at an event at Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in 2017.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), who led the impeachment inquiry and is a manager—or prosecutor—in the Senate trial, said Mr. Parnas was being evaluated as a potential witness. His TV interviews and other documents ""shed additional insights"" into the pressure exerted on Ukraine and the involvement of members of the Trump administration, Mr. Schiff said.
Republicans questioned Mr. Parnas's significance and integrity. ""If I had ever heard of him before yesterday, I'm not aware of it. This is the indicted guy, right?"" Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.) said.
Aside from the campaign finance charges, Mr. Parnas has also been accused of lying about his income and assets and his business dealings are being investigated.
Also included in the new materials Democrats released this week was a letter Mr. Giuliani wrote last spring to Ukraine's then-President-elect, Volodymyr Zelensky, seeking a meeting. In the letter
he said he was writing
""in my capacity as personal counsel to President Trump and with his knowledge and consent."" The meeting didn't take place.
Mr. Trump said Thursday that he didn't know about Mr. Giuliani's correspondence, ""but if he wrote a letter it wouldn't have been a big deal.""
Beyond their relevance to the impeachment, the messages to Mr. Parnas about Ms. Yovanovitch also renewed concerns among some Democrats about her treatment by the State Department.
Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sent a letter on Wednesday to the State Department seeking information on whether officials there knew of the alleged surveillance of Ms. Yovanovitch and what efforts were taken to ensure her safety and that of other U.S. diplomats.
Mr. Trump ordered Ms. Yovanovitch removed from her post in late April, exercising a presidential prerogative to remove ambassadors at will. Ms. Yovanovitch told House investigators that she was alarmed the State Department didn't support her in the face of a smear campaign by Mr. Giuliani and others seeking to get her removed. Mr. Giuliani has said he told Mr. Trump that Ms. Yovanovitch displayed an anti-Trump bias, which she has denied.
Earlier this week, Ms. Yovanovitch's lawyer called for an investigation into whether her movements were being tracked, calling the text messages ""disturbing.""
Ukrainian authorities said they were also probing a cybersecurity firm's report that
Russia's military hacked into Burisma Holdings
, the Ukrainian gas company that became a focus of Mr. Trump's impeachment because former Vice President Joe Biden's son served on its board.
The Kremlin didn't respond to a request for comment Thursday. The Russian Embassy in Washington didn't respond to a request for comment on the allegations on Monday, when media reports about the hack were first published.

WASHINGTON—No rallies. No handshakes. No in-person fundraisers. And a whole lot of uncertainty.
The coronavirus pandemic
has fundamentally altered
the 2020 presidential race, forcing Democratic presidential campaigns to prepare for weeks of out-of-the-box appeals to voters, a reliance on digital events and a major adjustment to the national shutdown of daily life.
The
spread of the virus
, which has closed schools and workplaces and roiled financial markets, prompted
Louisiana to postpone
its April 4 primary until June 20. The decision announced Friday coincided with the campaigns of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders curtailing, for the foreseeable future, the kind of retail politics that has marked every modern White House campaign.
""In the annals of U.S. history, the 2020 presidential campaign and coronavirus crisis will be deeply intertwined,"" said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. ""You're not going to be able to extract one from the other.""
Mr. Biden, the former vice president and front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, planned to conduct his first ""virtual town hall"" with supporters in Illinois Friday in what his team expects to be a ""reimagining"" of events aimed at maintaining his momentum. It followed decisions by his campaign to scrap public events this week in Ohio, Florida and Illinois.
Mr. Sanders said Friday in a live streamed speech in Burlington, Vt., that the virus had significantly affected his campaign, preventing him from holding his signature large rallies. ""It has radically changed our campaign,"" the Vermont senator said.
Mr. Sanders said the campaign's ""internet capabilities"" and broad social media following were an asset. But he acknowledged: ""We are in the process of thinking this through.""
President Trump has canceled some events and doesn't have his next major campaign rally scheduled. He isn't facing serious opposition to winning the Republican nomination to seek re-election in November.
The Trump reelection campaign said Friday evening it would build on its existing digital tools and would train new volunteers using call-from-home applications next week.
Mr. Sanders said he hadn't been tested for the virus and hadn't displayed any symptoms. He called upon Mr. Trump—who had contact recently with a Brazilian official who tested positive for the virus—to get tested and to release the results publicly.
The virus has disrupted the Democratic campaign as Mr. Biden has built a delegate lead of 878-725 over Mr. Sanders, according to a Wall Street Journal delegate tracker, giving the former vice president an inside track to the party's nomination.
The campaigns are preparing for primaries Tuesday in four states: Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. Georgia's primary is planned for March 24.
Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders will appear in Sunday's
11th presidential debate
, which was moved from Phoenix to Washington, D.C., because of the virus. The debate will be held at CNN's studios near the U.S. Capitol without a live audience.
Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders are shuttering their headquarters and asking staff to work from home. Mr. Biden has been based at his home in Wilmington, Del., since Wednesday and addressed the pandemic Thursday at a hotel near his home. Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, has remained at his home in Burlington in recent days but plans to stay at his Washington, D.C., home after Sunday's debate to work in the Senate, said his wife, Jane O'Meara Sanders.
The campaigns are no longer conducting door-to-door canvassing. Mr. Biden's campaign said in a memo Thursday that it would organize voters through ""phone-banking, text messaging, virtual events, other distributed organizing models.""
Digital organizing firm Mobilize, which is used by both Messrs. Biden and Sanders, has seen an increase in events moving virtual from in-person, said Alfred Johnson, the firm's chief executive and co-founder.
In-person events typically account for three-quarters of activities. But Mr. Johnson said that 85% of volunteer or supporter sign-ups on Friday have been tied to virtual events, such as phone banking or virtual town halls.
The candidates haven't held in-person campaign events with voters since Tuesday.
The virus has also scrambled the work of voter registration. Quentin James, president of Collective Future, a group focused on registering black voters, said he has put hiring field staffers on hold. The group, which recently received $2 million from billionaire former presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg, had planned on using digital platforms to register voters, but the outbreak prompted it to focus its strategy solely around that, Mr. James said.
Traditional fundraising has been drastically changed, with Mr. Biden's campaign shifting to ""virtual fundraisers."" The campaign canceled in-person events that had been scheduled for Chicago, Miami Beach, Fla., and New York in the next week.
Donors who had planned to attend a fundraiser on Monday at the Miami Beach home of Alexander and Tiffany Heckler, for example, received an email telling them that Mr. Biden wanted to hold a conference call to thank them and ""answer some questions from the group.""

Mr. Sanders doesn't hold large fundraisers, preferring instead to focus on raising money online from small donors. That tactic and digital marketing are taking on more prominent roles in the campaigns. But political consultants said campaigns needed to be mindful of how they raise money.
""Even though there are candidates and organizations that are still fundraising, we want to be careful of our phrasing so that we're being sensitive to the situation, not increasing anxiety or causing misunderstandings, and also not being tone deaf,"" said Loren Merchan, a partner at the political firm Authentic Campaigns, which worked on California Sen. Kamala Harris's presidential bid.
Said Ms. Merchan: ""We've really never seen anything like this in the era of digital.""
Mr. Brinkley, the presidential historian, said the focus on the virus would likely elevate public health as a campaign issue, along with Mr. Trump's handling of the crisis.
But he said it may also change the nature of retail politics, at least for now.
""The days of kissing babies and shaking hands are over for a while,"" he said.

Sen. Bernie Sanders spent more than he raised in the final three months of 2019, and a super PAC backing former Vice President Joe Biden landed a million-dollar donation at the end of the year.
As the Democratic presidential candidates prepare for Monday's Iowa caucuses, they are filing their campaign finance disclosures for the fourth quarter of 2019 with the Federal Election Commission.
Although most candidates already said how much they raised from October through December, the reports will show how quickly they burned through money, how big a role small donors are playing and other details.
Other political committees, such as super PACs, Senate and House campaigns and party groups, also will file FEC reports Friday. The paperwork is due by midnight.
Here's what we know so far:
MONEY TO BURN
Mr. Sanders spent about $50 million in the final three months of last year and had about $18 million in the bank as of Dec. 31, according to his disclosure. His spending exceeded the $34.3 million he brought in during the quarter, the majority of it from donors who gave $200 or less.
Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator who
gained ground nationally on Mr. Biden
in a new Wall Street Journal/NBC poll, has spent more on Iowa ads than any other candidate except billionaire self-funder Tom Steyer, reports from ad tracker Kantar/CMAG show.
BACKING BIDEN
Mr. Biden is the only top-polling Democratic presidential candidate whose close associates have formed a super PAC to help him.
Unite the Country reported raising about $3.8 million in the second half of last year, according to its FEC filing. Billionaire California real-estate broker George Marcus gave $1 million at the end of December, making him the super PAC's top donor. In October, Mr. Marcus co-hosted a fundraiser for the Biden campaign in Palo Alto, Calif. Super PACs aren't allowed to coordinate their spending with the campaign they are supporting and can accept donations of any size.
Other major donors included Alan Leventhal, chief executive of Boston real-estate investment firm Beacon Capital Partners, and Joe Kiani, the founder of a California medical technology company, who each contributed $250,000. The PAC for the International Association of Firefighters, which endorsed Mr. Biden, gave $100,000.
In a statement ahead of its filing, Unite the Country said it has raised nearly $4 million this month from donors who will be disclosed in its next filing, due Feb. 20.
The group said it has so far spent about $6 million on
advertising and research in Iowa
alone. That gave Mr. Biden a boost on the airwaves over the past two months, keeping him competitive with his rivals and allowing him to devote his own resources elsewhere.
THE DROPOUTS
New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker had about $4 million in cash on hand just two weeks before he ended his presidential bid on Jan. 13, according to his year-end fundraising report. That was about the same amount he had in the bank at the start of the fourth quarter. He raised and spent $6.5 million in the final months of his campaign.
Montana Gov. Steve Bullock dropped out of the race at the beginning of December, and his campaign's FEC report shows he had raised just over $1 million in his final few months. He had $122,762 in the bank as of the end of December, the report shows. Mr. Bullock's gubernatorial term ends next year, and he said he isn't seeking the state's Senate seat, which is up for election this cycle.
John Delaney, a former Maryland congressman who announced his long-shot presidential bid in July 2017 and
ended it Friday
, lent or gave his campaign about $1 million in the final three months of last year, his FEC report shows. In all, he put at least $15 million of his own money toward his bid.
SENATE COMMITTEES
The chief Republican Senate political committee raised almost $68 million last year, about $5 million more than its Democratic counterpart, according to their FEC filings.
Democrats need to gain at least three seats—while holding on to seats in challenging places such as Alabama and winning the presidency—to win control of the chamber. Each committee raised about $7 million in December alone, the reports show.
The National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee had about $20 million in available cash as of the end of last year, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee had nearly $19 million.

WASHINGTON—President Trump has had two major national audiences in the past five days, and both times he aimed a message at African-Americans, a group that overwhelmingly disapproves of the job he is doing but could help decide whether he gets to keep it.
During the Super Bowl, Mr. Trump's campaign spent millions of dollars on a commercial featuring an African-American woman who had a drug sentence commuted by the president. ""Politicians talk about criminal-justice reform,"" the ad said. ""President Trump got it done.""
At the State of the Union, Mr. Trump celebrated the low unemployment rate among African-Americans, talked of urban development zones, honored one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen and awarded a fourth-grader from Philadelphia, Janiyah Davis, with a school-choice scholarship.
The black unemployment rate is 5.9%, according to the latest government statistics, up slightly from the historic low of 5.4% reached in August 2019. Overall, the U.S. unemployment rate is 3.5%.
While Mr. Trump's re-election strategy mainly relies on motivating his conservative base, the focus on African-Americans, and a similar push for Hispanics, shows an effort to attract new voters. Only 8% of blacks voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, but his campaign is confident it can improve on that. Even a small boost could help in battleground states such as Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.

""There's significant support out there that you're not going to hear about but it will show up at the ballot box. People see results,"" said Calvin Tucker, who directs minority outreach for the Republican Party of Pennsylvania. He noted that Mr. Trump in 2016 did better among black voters than the past two Republican nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain.
The push Mr. Trump has displayed in the last week—chiefly the emotional Super Bowl ad, which generated favorable reviews—also appears intended for another group of voters he has struggled with.
""Ads showing the compassionate part of Trump's agenda could help raise his favorable ratings with some suburban voters,"" said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist in Washington. ""They like his economic policies, but are turned off by the tweets and harsh rhetoric.""
The Trump campaign has been holding outreach events, seeking to shake the decadeslong dominance Democrats have held with black voters. It is a far different effort than 2016, when Mr. Trump lacked a record and simply asked, ""What the hell do you have to lose?""
The campaign plans to continue an advertising campaign geared toward black voters, including African-American community newspapers and radio. Ads encourage people to text ""woke"" to receive updates. The campaign is also training activists to engage and register voters, according to a person familiar with the strategy.
With a strong economy at the president's back, some Democrats say Mr. Trump's outreach is a wake-up call.
""What we saw from Donald Trump was a 2020 surgical strategy,"" said Quentin James, founder of the Collective PAC, which helps elect black candidates to office. Mr. James said Democrats need a large-scale program to engage with African-Americans and fears the party will play catch-up.
""We assume black voters will just vote for the Democratic Party like they always do,"" he said. ""Sure the numbers are there, but if Trump can get two or three more points with black men in swing states, this thing is over. I am very nervous.""
Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee who is also African-American, said Mr. Trump was smart to make a play for black voters. But he said that effort is hampered by the president's history of controversial statements, from saying there were fine people on ""both sides"" of the deadly 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., to saying four Democratic lawmakers, all of them minority women, should return to the ""totally broken and crime infested places from which they came"" and ""fix"" them.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you think President Trump can improve on his 2016 performance among African-American voters? Join the conversation below.
""This is a man who wanted to execute the Central Park Five,"" said Mr. Steele, referring to the black and Hispanic teenagers who were wrongfully convicted of raping a jogger in 1989. Asked about the case last year, Mr. Trump refused to apologize for his stance, which he had emphasized at the time in newspaper ads that called for bringing back the death penalty in New York.
A January poll released by the Washington Post showed more than 8 in 10 black Americans think Mr. Trump is a racist and that he has made racism a bigger problem. Despite Mr. Trump's boasts about the economy, 77% of black Americans said he deserves only ""some"" or ""hardly any"" credit, according to the poll.
""You go in the barber shop and talk to people—they hate Donald Trump,"" said Keith Williams, chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party's black caucus. He said Mr. Trump's frequent criticisms of former President Obama were a sore spot and noted the economic recovery began under Mr. Trump's predecessor.
""He can bring people to the State of the Union but he's never been for us,"" Mr. Williams said.
A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll from January showed only 15% of African-Americans approve of the job Mr. Trump is doing, and 83% disapprove—by far the worst of any demographic group.
Still, another Journal poll in December showed Mr. Trump could improve on his 2016 margin. While only 9% of blacks were almost certain to vote for the president and 72% were almost certain to vote against him, 21% said it depends on whom Democrats nominate.

WASHINGTON—A National Security Council official, who voiced concerns about President Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's leader, and the official's brother were removed from their White House posts and escorted off the grounds on Friday.
Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, the NSC's Ukraine expert, had angered Mr. Trump over his testimony in the House impeachment probe. Col. Vindman's twin brother, Yevgeny Vindman, a senior lawyer and ethics official on the NSC who is also an Army lieutenant colonel, didn't testify to House investigators.
""There is no question in the mind of any American why this man's job is over, why this country now has one less soldier serving it at the White House,"" said David Pressman, referring to his client Alexander Vindman, adding that he ""was asked to leave for telling the truth.""
Mr. Pressman said Yevgeny Vindman was ""deeply disappointed that he will not be able to continue his service at the White House.""

How do you think the Trump administration should treat witnesses who testified during the impeachment inquiry? Join the conversation below.
Alexander Vindman is expected to return to the Army, a U.S. official said, though his exact role is unclear. Yevgeny Vindman's future role in the military wasn't clear.
""Well, I'm not happy with him. You think I'm supposed to be happy with him? I'm not,"" Mr. Trump told reporters on Friday morning about Alexander Vindman. ""They'll make that decision. You'll be hearing. They'll make a decision."" He later retweeted tweets critical of Col. Vindman.
NSC spokesman John Ullyot said, ""We do not comment on personnel matters.""
Earlier on Friday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters at the Pentagon that Col. Vindman would be welcomed back from the White House like any other military official returning from an assignment.
Mr. Esper said Col. Vindman would be protected when a reporter asked if the Army would shield him from any possible retribution for his testimony against the president. ""We protect all of our servicemembers from retribution or anything like that,"" Mr. Esper said.
The ranks of the White House National Security Council are made up of specialists from agencies like the State Department, the CIA and the Pentagon, and they rotate in and out for set periods.
The lengths of the appointments vary, but Defense Department personnel are often detailed for a period of one to three years. Col. Vindman was detailed to the NSC in July 2018 as director for European affairs. His two-year detail was slated to end in July, said a person familiar with the matter.
Col. Vindman's departure comes as national security adviser Robert O'Brien is taking steps to reduce the size of the NSC by sending dozens of government officials temporarily detailed to the council back to their home agencies, said people familiar with his thinking.
Col. Vindman, who listened in on the president's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, told impeachment investigators last year that Mr. Trump's request for an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden was ""inappropriate and improper."" He also said ""there was no doubt"" that Mr. Trump was asking on the call for an investigation from Kyiv as a condition for Mr. Zelensky to get a proposed White House meeting.
Col. Vindman testified that he had raised concerns about the call with an NSC lawyer. But he denied that he was the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the impeachment probe and said he didn't know the identity of the whistleblower.
Mr. Pressman, a partner at Boies Schiller Flexner, noted that Col. Vindman testified under subpoena.
""He did what any member of our military is charged with doing every day: he followed orders, he obeyed his oath, and he served his country, even when doing so was fraught with danger and personal peril,"" Mr. Pressman said. ""And for that, the most powerful man in the world—buoyed by the silent, the pliable, and the complicit—has decided to exact revenge.""
Col. Vindman's departure comes after Mr. Trump was acquitted this week in the Republican-led Senate on two articles of impeachment stemming from his efforts to press Ukraine to announce investigations that would benefit him politically in this year's election, including a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate.
The president has defended himself against the charges, calling the impeachment probe a Democratic ""witch hunt,"" and repeatedly describing his July call with Ukraine as ""perfect.""
Mr. Trump has distanced himself from Col. Vindman in the past. After Col. Vindman's closed-door testimony last year, Mr. Trump called him a ""Never Trumper"" on Twitter. At a cabinet meeting in November, the president said ""I don't know Vindman at all. What I do know is that even he said that the transcript was correct.""
Col. Vindman told House investigators that the rough transcript released by the White House accurately reflected the July 25 call, though he said there were changes he suggested to the text that weren't made.
When asked during his public testimony whether he would call himself a ""Never Trumper,"" Col. Vindman answered: ""I would call myself never partisan.""
Born in Ukraine, Col. Vindman moved to the U.S. as a young child. He served multiple tours as an Army infantry officer in South Korea, Germany and Iraq. He was wounded in an IED attack in Iraq and was subsequently awarded a Purple Heart.
In November testimony before the House, Col. Vindman said he had reassured his father not to worry about the repercussions of his appearance before the committees investigating the president.
Asked by a lawmaker why he wasn't worried, Col. Vindman said, ""Congressman, because this is America. This is the country I've served and defended. That all my brothers have served. And here, right matters."" Applause broke out in the hearing room.

After Donald Trump's election, Lev Parnas saw a chance to cash in on his connections.
The Florida businessman and Trump donor was courting investors for a real-estate project. He took one of them, Roman Nasirov, at the time the head of Ukraine's tax service, to Mr. Trump's Florida Mar-a-Lago resort, where they chatted with the president-elect in a crowd of supporters, a video released by Mr. Parnas's attorney shows. Mr. Nasirov ultimately helped fund a $10 million loan Mr. Parnas arranged for the project, people familiar with the matter said.
A sizable donation to a political campaign typically brings a handshake and some chitchat with the candidate. In the three years that followed, Mr. Parnas went further.
As he launched himself into Mr. Trump's orbit, Mr. Parnas found sponsors for his own ventures among wealthy Republican donors, mingling with them at fundraisers and dinners that he documented in copious selfies. He also sought out and eventually became a key associate of Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, who embraced Mr. Parnas in his pursuit of investigations in Ukraine.
The role he has carved out for himself has thrust the Ukrainian-born Mr. Parnas into the impeachment saga, injecting a wild card into the tightly choreographed
proceedings on Capitol Hill
. Last week, he offered new allegations in several interviews that have inflamed the debate about whether senators should call witnesses in the president's trial, which opens Tuesday.

Many of Mr. Parnas's ventures went awry
despite his connected patrons' support. The real-estate project Mr. Nasirov invested in ended in a lawsuit, in which Mr. Parnas said the developer cut him out of a subsequent deal and that he is owed $250,000 for expenses in January 2017 alone, as well as the costs of hiring a personal assistant and leasing Cadillac Escalades. Mr. Nasirov didn't respond to a request for comment.
In Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Parnas found not a patron but an inroad with the White House—perceived access that he in turn sought to use to broker new business deals.
Mr. Parnas says he arranged meetings and carried messages for Mr. Giuliani as the president's attorney tried to
pressure Ukraine's government to undertake investigations
into a leading Trump rival in this year's elections, Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden. That campaign is at the center of the president's impeachment, in which Democrats say Mr. Trump abused his power for personal benefit. Mr. Trump has denied that and called the impeachment a hoax.
Democrats in the House and Senate say Mr. Parnas should be heard from. Republicans, meanwhile, question his credibility, citing his federal indictment in Manhattan in October. The prosecutors, who accused Mr. Parnas and an associate of attempting to funnel foreign money into U.S. elections and influence American politics on behalf of at least one Ukrainian politician, say they are continuing to investigate the two men. The fall indictment doesn't address the efforts to push for investigations in Ukraine.
Parnas's Impeachment Role
Now facing campaign-finance charges, Lev Parnas had worked with President Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as he sought to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens—an effort that is now a focus of impeachment proceedings.

(Dec. 23, 2019)
Mr. Parnas has pleaded not guilty, and he and his attorney say his cooperation in the impeachment proceedings should earn him leniency. He has turned over
hundreds of pages of text messages and other documents
to House committees that outline his relationship with Mr. Giuliani and others in the Trump camp. In television interviews last week, he said Mr. Trump knew what he and Mr. Giuliani were doing in Ukraine. Mr. Trump says he doesn't know Mr. Parnas, though he has acknowledged taking pictures together.
At a meeting with prosecutors from the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office late last year, people familiar with the matter say, Mr. Parnas's attorney disputed that he pushed for the removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine at the behest of a Ukrainian official—one of the charges in the campaign finance indictment.
As Mr. Parnas sat without speaking, the attorney told prosecutors that his client didn't act at the official's direction, though the two had been in contact about removing the ambassador, the people said. Manhattan prosecutors rejected that explanation, the people said. Prosecutors haven't detailed publicly any evidence that would support their allegation.
In Florida, Mr. Parnas, who frequently puffs on a vape pen, gained a reputation for having quick access to large amounts of financing, former business associates and others said. An investor who met Mr. Parnas in the early 2010s remembers him having a Rolls-Royce, an Aston Martin and a chauffeur. Mr. Parnas has acknowledged he likes nice cars and has had a bodyguard who served as a driver at times.
Others recall him as a charming if questionable operator who reminded them of a Joe Pesci character. ""Anything that you talked to them about, they had some kind of angle on it,"" said Joe Cartolano, an attorney who worked briefly with a firm involved with Mr. Parnas, referring to Mr. Parnas and another business associate.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How, if at all, do you think Lev Parnas's statements and documents might influence President Trump's impeachment trial? Join the conversation below.
A $50,000 donation to the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee shortly before the November 2016 election first brought Mr. Parnas into the Trump orbit. At a fundraiser in Florida, Mr. Parnas introduced himself to Messrs. Trump and Giuliani.
After the fundraiser, Mr. Parnas pressed the host, construction magnate Robert Pereira, to invest in a new venture, Fraud Guarantee, which offered insurance for investments. Mr. Pereira told The Wall Street Journal last year that he ""didn't trust this guy"" and cut off contact with Mr. Parnas.
Fraud Guarantee was born from a failed venture to develop real estate in which Mr. Parnas says he was scammed. His former business partner, Dale Wood, who is now serving a 12-year sentence for a related $7 million investment fraud, said in an interview that around $500,000 of the money stolen in the fraud in 2012 paid for Mr. Parnas's house, cars, bodyguard and private jets.
Records from several companies linked to their efforts show $50,000 went to a charter plane firm and $55,000 to a car-leasing company, both used by Mr. Parnas.
Mr. Parnas's attorney, Joseph Bondy, said Mr. Parnas was a victim and that Mr. Wood didn't provide agreed-upon payments. Because Mr. Parnas provided information on Mr. Wood to law enforcement, he ""now seeks to cast Mr. Parnas in a falsely negative light,"" Mr. Bondy said.
Mr. Parnas, who wasn't charged in the case, sought to use his experience with Mr. Wood to his benefit. ""The one good thing that came out of the situation was our desire to turn lemons into lemonade! That was the birth of Fraud Guarantee,"" one pitch letter to investors said.
His 2016 donation had taught him he needed to spend money to earn money. Bigger donations vaulted Mr. Parnas further into Trump circles and brought success in recruiting investors.
In May 2018, Mr. Parnas and a fellow Soviet-born businessman, Igor Fruman—both U.S. citizens—made a $325,000 donation to America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC. Prosecutors said the donation came through a limited liability company to conceal their identities. Mr. Fruman has pleaded not guilty to campaign finance violations. Unlike Mr. Parnas, he has declined to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry and hasn't spoken publicly.
After the donation, the pair attended a small dinner at the Trump Hotel in Washington with the president, his son Donald Trump Jr. and other top donors to America First Action.
Those connections bred new ones. At the Trump hotel in June, Dallas investor and Trump donor Roy Bailey introduced them to Harry Sargeant III, a Florida-based businessman and Trump donor who would later help foot the bill for the pair's travel to Ukraine. Mr. Bailey told Mr. Sargeant the pair had written a big check to the super PAC, according to a person familiar with the matter.
When Mr. Giuliani in 2018 demanded a $500,000 fee for his consulting services for Fraud Guarantee, Messrs. Parnas and Fruman didn't have the money. So they turned to another Trump donor, personal-injury lawyer Charles Gucciardo, who paid Mr. Giuliani that fall in exchange for a stake in the company, according to Mr. Gucciardo's lawyer.
With Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Parnas flew higher still. He and Mr. Fruman ramped up their efforts to arrange meetings for Mr. Giuliani with key Ukrainian officials in their quest to get Kyiv to announce investigations into alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election by Ukrainian officials—a largely unsubstantiated theory embraced by the president and some congressional Republicans—and into the role Mr. Biden's son, Hunter, played on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings.
The pair were also on a mission of their own in Ukraine:
to broker a deal to sell U.S. liquefied natural gas to the country
. In a meeting with a top official at Ukraine's state oil-and-gas company, Messrs. Parnas and Fruman cited their alleged access to Mr. Trump. The deal didn't materialize, another unsuccessful attempt by the pair to use their connections to bolster their business prospects.
Their push for investigations in Ukraine gave Mr. Parnas fodder to bond with high-level Trump associates, according to documents released by the House committees. He traded texts with Tommy Hicks Jr., who in early 2019 was named co-chairman of the Republican National Committee. Mr. Hicks, a close friend of Mr. Trump Jr., didn't respond to a request for comment.
In March, an official at America First Policies, AFA's nonprofit arm, solicited Mr. Parnas's suggestions on what Mr. Trump Jr. should tweet about issues in Ukraine, according to texts released by the House. Mr. Parnas sent the official an article about calls to remove the ambassador to Ukraine, which Mr. Trump Jr. tweeted. His spokesman declined to comment.
Mr. Giuliani has denied knowing about the two highest-level Ukrainian meetings Messrs. Parnas and Fruman attended: one in February with then-President Petro Poroshenko, and one the following May with a top aide to the incoming president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr. Parnas said he relayed to both men that favorable U.S. treatment was at risk if they didn't announce the sought-after investigations.
Messrs. Giuliani and Parnas were in close contact in the days surrounding both meetings: The two men called or tried to call each other nearly 40 times the week of the February meeting, a person familiar with the matter said. On the day of the May meeting, Mr. Giuliani called Mr. Parnas twice, and Mr. Parnas called him three times the next day, the person said, and they exchanged hundreds of calls over the course of that week.
Meanwhile, funding the travel for the Ukraine project began to wear on Mr. Sargeant, the Trump donor. In April, he texted Mr. Parnas: ""Just become expensive flying u guys everywhere LEV."" Mr. Parnas promised to pay him back.
An attorney for Mr. Sargeant said he lent Mr. Parnas money because he ""claimed, perhaps falsely, he was broke and promised to pay the funds back.""
When Messrs. Parnas and Fruman were arrested in October, the owner of a charter company that Mr. Parnas had hired at Mr. Sargeant's recommendation took notice. Mr. Parnas owed the company more than $30,000 for a flight for Mr. Giuliani and his girlfriend, according to a person familiar with the matter.
After their arrest, the person said, the owner ran a credit card belonging to Mr. Parnas's wife to pay himself back.

MISSION, Texas—Flor Martinez has spent most afternoons for the past couple of weeks walking the neighborhoods of Texas' Rio Grande Valley, knocking on doors and asking Democratic voters, mostly in Spanish, to support Bernie Sanders for president.
Ms. Martinez spent the weeks leading up to the 2016 presidential primary doing the same thing. But this year is different, she said. More people know who the Vermont senator is. More of them sound interested in his views. She said Mr. Sanders' recent momentum in other states will help him get a second look from more voters in a community that has historically voted for moderates, not democratic socialists.
Campaigns are working hard this year to court Latino voters, particularly in Texas, where since 2018 the majority of Democratic registered voters are Hispanic, according to data collected by Univision. Latino turnout in those midterms
was nearly double the previous cycle
in several states and helped the party gain a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Latino Democrats in Texas have long voted more conservative than other Texas Democrats and than Latinos in states like California and Nevada, political pollsters said. In 2016, when Mr. Sanders was running against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, he fared worse in heavily Hispanic border counties than in Texas overall, which Mrs. Clinton won in a landslide.
That may change this year, after Mr. Sanders won Nevada in large part by winning the most Hispanic votes, according to caucus polls. Latino voters are critical to his hopes of winning Texas, the second-most populous state voting in Super Tuesday after California.
A poll from Progress Texas conducted last week found Mr. Sanders with 27% support among Hispanic Democrats,
compared with 23%
for former Vice President Joe Biden. Among Texas Democrats overall, the two were tied.
Rosie Rodriguez, 63 years old, said she voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and still wants to see a woman president, but doesn't relate to the women running this year. She supports Mr. Sanders this year.
""It's just so scary. You don't know who you can trust anymore, and he's one person I can trust—he speaks from the heart; he's relatable,"" she said.
Ms. Rodriguez said seeing the ""disgraceful"" treatment of immigrants detained and separated from their children in neighboring cities made her more passionate this year.
Still, other border voters said they doubted many Texas Latinos would fully back Mr. Sanders. Adam Azua, 38, said the people he knows who vote regularly are older, Catholic Latinos who care about helping minorities but are more conservative than other Democrats. Jose Moreno, 75, agreed.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Which Democratic platforms and candidates do you think are resonating most strongly with Latino voters? Join the conversation below.
""Trump's going to win if Bernie stays in,"" Mr. Moreno, who plans to vote for Joe Biden, said. ""You see a lot of Mexicans going Republican now because Bernie just wants to give everything away for free.""
Most state-level elected Democrats have endorsed Mr. Biden. He is also the preferred candidate of political groups Latino Victory Fund and Tejano Democrats.
""When we had the discussion, it was Bernie that had the sexy ideas but Joe with the solid record,"" said Manuel Medina, Tejano Democrats' chairman, who said 90% of the group's members voted to back Mr. Biden.
Mr. Medina said he can't recall another election cycle where so many national candidates had campaign headquarters across Texas, including in heavily Hispanic South Texas. Both Democrats and Republicans nationally
have struggled to get Latino voters to turn out
in the past.
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's campaign has two Texas-based organizers and held a Texas Latino Community Engagement tour earlier this month, with stops in Laredo and McAllen.
Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg now has multiple offices and paid organizers in the Rio Grande Valley. They are countering the Sanders campaign's grass-roots effort with the message that Mr. Bloomberg is the candidate best positioned to defeat President Donald Trump in November and unite the party.
""People are just excited to see national campaign offices in an area where they've never seen them before,"" said Amanda Elise Salas, the Bloomberg campaign's regional organizing director. Ashlea Graves Turner, the campaign's state director, said her team is adjusting tactics in Texas because voters are more conservative on some issues.
""You cannot talk about pro-choice in the Valley,"" said Ms. Turner. ""We need to be very careful about how we word things to not offend Texas Latinos.""

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg faced a barrage of attacks as he joined Democrats for the first time in a
fiery presidential debate
that saw every candidate on stage launching shots at one another.
Within minutes of the start of the ninth debate of this election cycle, held in Las Vegas just three days before Nevada's caucuses, Mr. Bloomberg began facing criticism from nearly a half-dozen rivals for his record on criminal justice. The other candidates also brought up his prior comments about women in an effort to cast the New York billionaire as no different than President Trump.
""I'd like to talk about who we're running against—a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians, and no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump, I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg,"" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said. ""Democrats are not going to win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, of harassing women, and of supporting racist policies like red-lining and stop-and-frisk.""
The attacks on Mr. Bloomberg came as the billionaire, who launched his candidacy in November and has run a torrent of advertising, has gained traction in national polls. Having bypassed all the early states, he has focused on the March 3 Super Tuesday contests and is hoping to
roil a largely unsettled race
that has Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in a
double-digit lead
in national polling but no one yet to emerge as decisive front-runner among the centrist candidates.
In response to the criticism of him, Mr. Bloomberg apologized for the stop-and-frisk policing practice—in which police officers were given wide latitude to stop people whom they suspected of criminal behavior and which mainly affected racial minorities—saying it ""got out of control"" and is one thing he was embarrassed about from his time as mayor. A federal judge ruled in 2013 that the policy was carried out in an unconstitutional manner.
That response proved insufficient for Mr. Bloomberg's opponents. ""It's not whether he apologized or not, it's the policy,"" said former Vice President Joe Biden, a longtime front-runner who has slipped in polls just as Mr. Bloomberg has risen. ""The policy was abhorrent. And it was…a violation of every right people have.""
Ms. Warren, who was looking for a breakout moment after failing to collect any delegates in New Hampshire, came out swinging in a debate that saw her land several punches and demonstrate a rare willingness to confront her opponents over health care and other issues.
Mr. Bloomberg wasn't alone in facing the heat. Rifts quickly ripped open between Mr. Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, the
top delegate-earners in the race so far
, after their strong showings in Iowa and
New Hampshire
. Mr. Buttigieg, until recently the mayor of South Bend, Ind., warned that a two-person race between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bloomberg would feature ""the two most polarizing figures on this stage.""
""We've got to wake up as a party,"" he said. ""Let's put forward someone who's actually a Democrat,"" he said, a dig at Mr. Bloomberg, a former Republican, and Mr. Sanders, who was elected as an independent but caucuses with Democrats in the Senate.
Mr. Sanders responded by saying: ""If speaking to the needs and the pain of a long-neglected working class is polarizing, I think you got the wrong word.""
Refusing to back down, Mr. Buttigieg brought up a feud between the Vermont senator's supporters and a powerful Nevada culinary union in Nevada over his signature Medicare for All proposal. The union complained it had been harassed by Mr. Sanders's supporters online after arguing his proposal for health care would be less generous than health benefits for which they had bargained.
Mr. Sanders disavowed any of his supporters who attacked the union, saying: ""If there are a few people who make ugly remarks, who attack trade union leaders, I disown those people. They are not part of our movement.""
Mr. Sanders's polling lead has stirred increasing
concern among establishment Democrats
who believe a more centrist candidate could be stronger in the general election. There has been less polling in Nevada than in Iowa and New Hampshire, but pre-caucus surveys show Mr. Sanders ahead.
Mr. Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist, dismissed a new
Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll
showing that a majority of voters were uncomfortable with a socialist candidate for president. He pointed out that the same poll showed him leading the Democratic field.
Tensions also rose between Mr. Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who are competing for the party's center lane and who engaged in a series of testy, often personal exchanges.
After Ms. Klobuchar pushed for a comprehensive immigration overhaul, Mr. Buttigieg interjected to attack her record, including her vote in 2007 to make English the official language of the U.S.
""You voted to confirm the head of Customs and Border Protection under Trump, who was one of the architects of the family-separation policy. You voted to make English the national language,"" Mr. Buttigieg said. ""Do you know the message that sends?""
""I wish everyone was as perfect as you, Pete,"" Ms. Klobuchar retorted. ""In fact, I have opposed and not supported two-thirds of the Trump judges. So get your numbers right.""
The two also sparred over Ms. Klobuchar's inability to name the president of Mexico during a recent interview. Mr. Buttigieg, a 38-year-old who Ms. Klobuchar has said lacks the experience to be president, said it was troubling that the lawmaker was ""not able to speak to literally the first thing about the politics of the country to our south.""
""Are you trying to say that I'm dumb? Are you mocking me here, Pete?"" Ms. Klobuchar responded. ""I don't think that that momentary forgetfulness actually reflects what I know about Mexico and how much I care about it.""
Ms. Klobuchar, who was standing next to Mr. Buttigieg, walked off the stage after the debate without shaking his hand.
Still, Mr. Bloomberg, who has poured more than $400 million into his campaign and been accused by the rest of the field of trying to buy the election, took the most hits. In addition to his policies during his dozen years as mayor, Mr. Bloomberg weathered attacks from his rivals over accusations that his financial-data and media company was a hostile workplace for women.
He dismissed calls from his opponents to release from nondisclosure agreements women who have sued his company and said Mr. Bloomberg made crude remarks to them or otherwise alleged discrimination. He played down the claims: ""None of them accuse me of doing anything, other than maybe they didn't like a joke I told.""
""We're not going to end these agreements because they were made consensually,"" Mr. Bloomberg added, prompting groans from the crowd. ""They have every right to expect that they will stay private.""
Ms. Warren flatly rejected Mr. Bloomberg's response regarding nondisclosure agreements.
""I hope you heard his defense: 'I've been nice to some women.' That just doesn't cut it,"" she said.
Wednesday's debate, which aired on Comcast Corp.'s NBC News and MSNBC, drew 19.7 million viewers, making it the highest-rated Democratic debate ever, according to Nielsen data. The previous audience record for a Democratic debate
was set on June 27, 2019
, at the start of the primary season, and drew 18.1 million viewers.
The most-watched primary debate ever featured the top 10 GOP hopefuls of the 2016 presidential race and was seen by 24 million viewers on Fox News.

WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he expects to start the impeachment trial of President Trump next Tuesday, after the House votes on Wednesday to name the Democrats who will argue the case for Mr. Trump's removal and to
send the case over to the Senate.

Republican senators briefed on draft rules for the trial said they would likely guarantee a vote on witnesses and documents after opening arguments and a period for written questions. Moderate Republicans had been pushing hard behind the scenes for such a vote, while Mr. Trump has urged the Senate to dismiss the articles of impeachment without a trial.
Share Your Thoughts
Should the Senate call witnesses and subpoena documents in the impeachment trial or stick to the House's report? Join the conversation below.
Mr. McConnell (R., Ky.) emerged from a closed-door lunch with his caucus on Tuesday to say that all 53 Republican senators were united in favor of a resolution setting the rules for the first phase of the trial, but that there is ""little or no sentiment"" among Senate Republicans for a motion to dismiss.
""You can't end the trial unless you have 51 people to end the trial,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), a Trump ally. ""So yes, there will be an opportunity to make a motion for witnesses and documents.""
The House plans to vote on Wednesday to name the managers and transmit the case to the Senate. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said she would announce the managers at a news conference Wednesday morning.
The managers will likely be members of the Democratic caucus who played central roles in the
House's impeachment inquiry
. Their role will be to make the Democrats' case for Mr. Trump's removal from office in the Senate trial, similar to the role of prosecutors in a criminal proceeding.
The president will also designate a team to defend him. White House counsel Pat Cipollone is expected to lead the team. A Trump personal lawyer, Jay Sekulow, is also expected to join.
Democratic lawmakers said Tuesday they expect Mrs. Pelosi to name Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) to be impeachment managers. Other lawmakers seen as possible managers include Reps. Val Demings (D., Fla.) and Jamie Raskin (D., Md.). It wasn't known on Tuesday how many individuals Mrs. Pelosi would name.
For the 1999 impeachment trial of President Clinton, Republicans named 13 managers, including Mr. Graham, then a member of the House; current Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson; and former Rep. James Rogan, the California Republican whom Mr. Schiff defeated in 2000.
The Democratic-led House
last month voted to impeach Mr. Trump
on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The articles of impeachment
accuse him of pressuring Ukraine
to open investigations that would benefit him politically, including by withholding almost $400 million in aid to help the country combat Russian aggression, and of impeding Congress's investigation by preventing witnesses from testifying and defying subpoenas for documentary evidence.
House Democrats on Tuesday released new documentation in connection with the impeachment probe, aiming to incorporate it into the House record in time for the start of the Senate's trial. The documentation includes messages from Lev Parnas, an indicted associate of Mr. Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. The White House didn't respond to a request for comment on the documents.
Mr. Trump has wavered over the terms of a trial. He has at times indicated he would support a quick trial but at other times suggested his
preference for a longer trial
that could vindicate him, not merely acquit him.
A protracted trial beginning next week could extend beyond the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses, complicating the presidential campaigns of Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York has said he has told them he expects them all to attend the trial.
Meanwhile, Democratic and Republican leaders in the Senate on Tuesday debated the parameters of the trial. Democrats have demanded the ability to call witnesses and subpoena documents to gather more information than what came out during the House investigation. Most Republicans favor a quick trial without hearing any new evidence.
""Do Senate Republicans want the truth?"" Mr. Schumer asked on the Senate floor. Of 16 completed impeachment trials in the Senate's history, all but one included witnesses, Mr. Schumer said.
Mr. McConnell said Mr. Schumer wanted to hold votes to subpoena new witnesses and documents merely to trigger tough voters for Republican senators in re-election battles.
""The Senate Democratic leader recently said that as long as he can try to use the trial process to hurt some Republicans' re-election chances, quote, 'It's a win-win.' That's what this is all about,"" Mr. McConnell said, citing comments Mr. Schumer made in the news media.
Mr. McConnell said House Democrats' case can't simultaneously be so strong that it was enough to impeach in the first place but also so weak that the Senate ""needs to go fishing.""
Democrats counter that the White House blocked people from testifying in the House Investigation and say they want to hear from more witnesses in the trial.
Some Republicans have supported leaving the door open to call new witnesses. If all Democrats stick together, they would need four Republican votes.
On Tuesday, Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.) said he would
oppose a motion to dismiss the case
, saying the Senate has a responsibility to hold a full trial. He said the Senate should hear the arguments and ask questions, and then have a vote on whether to call additional witnesses or evidence.
Witnesses sought by Democrats include former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, both of whom didn't appear before the House.

Some Republican senators want to call as a witness Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden. The younger Mr. Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company that Mr. Trump asked Ukraine's leader to investigate—an act at the center of the House's impeachment case. Both Bidens deny any wrongdoing.

MANCHESTER, N.H.—President Trump encouraged his supporters to vote in New Hampshire's Democratic primary, urging a rally crowd in Manchester on Monday to cast a ballot for whoever would be easiest for him to beat.
""Pick the weakest one you think,"" Mr. Trump said at Southern New Hampshire University Arena in his first campaign rally since his
acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial
. ""I don't know who it is.""
New Hampshire election laws allow independent voters to cast ballots in either a Republican or Democratic primary. Mr. Trump's political advisers generally view Sen. Bernie Sanders as the easiest to beat, they have said, but others on his team privately warn that early-state momentum for Mr. Sanders could carry into the general election.
A Democratic Party spokeswoman said, ""His effort tonight to encourage Republicans to interfere in the Democratic primary is an unsurprising and desperate attempt to fool voters.""
""Granite Staters are fed up with Trump's distractions, and will hold him accountable for his broken promises in November,"" said Maya Hixson.
Some of Mr. Trump's critics in the Republican Party opened a similar campaign over the weekend, urging independents to support a centrist candidate who would appeal to moderate voters in the fall. Their texts and phone calls didn't mention a specific candidate, but Bill Kristol, founder of the conservative Weekly Standard magazine, told the NH Journal that the effort was aimed at slowing the momentum of Mr. Sanders, who was leading primary polls in the state.
The president's rally was timed to counterprogram
Tuesday's Democratic presidential primary in the state
. Similarly, Mr. Trump held a rally within
days of the Iowa caucuses
last week, and held his high-profile campaign events during Democratic presidential debates.
Mr. Trump and his team have identified New Hampshire as one of their best opportunities to win new states in 2020, and have been pouring resources into this region for months. In 2016, Mr. Trump lost the New Hampshire by 0.3%, or about 2,700 votes out of 694,000 cast.
New Hampshire was among the first states in which the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee hired field staff. Their top staffers were announced in August.
With a little less than nine months before Election Day, the Trump team has knocked on 55,000 doors and made more than 70,000 phone calls to voters in the state, according to the Trump campaign. The campaign has held 80 volunteer training sessions and 160 meetups for Trump supporters, part of an effort in 17 key states to build campaign infrastructure ahead of the election.
Still, polls show Mr. Trump consistently trailing the major Democratic contenders in New Hampshire, which has four electoral votes. In a Marist College poll in January, Mr. Trump trailed former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg by 10 points, former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders by 8 points and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren by 4 points.
Mr. Trump's approval rating has improved recently in New Hampshire, following national trends, but remains underwater at 42%, or 14 points below where it was when he was first elected, according to Morning Consult.
One of Mr. Trump's strongest pitches to voters this year, both nationally and in New Hampshire, his team says, is the performance of the economy during the past three years. The unemployment rate in New Hampshire is 2.6%, lower than the national average. Low-income workers, whose incomes stagnated during the 2007-09 recession, have seen wage growth in recent years, according to the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute.
But overall economic growth in New Hampshire trails the national average. Job growth has been fueled mostly by the real estate and insurance industries, according to federal data. Meanwhile, jobs in manufacturing, an industry Mr. Trump promises to revitalize, have been dropping in New Hampshire since 2018 but remain above levels when Mr. Trump took office.
Following the rally, Mr. Trump flew to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware to meet the bodies of two
U.S. soldiers killed Saturday
in Afghanistan, the White House said. The soldiers were identified as Sgt. First Class Antonio R. Rodriguez and Sgt. First Class Javier J. Gutierrez. Vice President Mike Pence was also scheduled to attend.

DETROIT—Black voters helped save Joe Biden's presidential campaign
in South Carolina
. Now, many black Democrats in Michigan are intent on delivering him another resounding victory that could help deliver him the nomination over Bernie Sanders.
Black Democrats—particularly those who are older—have been a boon to Mr. Biden's candidacy,
according to election results
, and could shape up to be roughly a quarter of Michigan's electorate during Tuesday's primary. The
other states voting Tuesday
are Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, and Washington. Of those, only Michigan is expected to be hotly contested come November, making this state the night's most-watched prize.
Lennard Coklow walked across the street from his townhouse to vote at Calvary Baptist Church—an orange, triangular-shaped structure that is a staple in the city's Elmwood Park neighborhood. ""I believe it's going to be a done deal,"" he said of the primary, arguing Mr. Biden's strength with black voters like himself felt like an advantage Mr. Sanders couldn't match. ""I'd be surprised if he lost one state today.""
But supporters of Mr. Sanders haven't given up and hope to secure a surprise victory for the Vermont senator, similar to the one he took in the 2016 Democratic presidential contest. Mr. Coklow's 19-year-old granddaughter Imani cast a ballot for the first time Tuesday. She voted for Mr. Sanders.
""They say he has a better chance of winning,"" Ms. Coklow said of Mr. Biden,"" but I just feel like [Mr. Sanders] knows how to appeal to younger people."" She cited his plans for student-loan debt cancellation.
Jessica Parker—a secondary education student at Wayne State University who cast a ballot for Mr. Sanders on campus Tuesday—said that the more liberal agenda pushed by the senator could still catch fire in the race. She added Democrats still have unresolved internal spats—like how much of a role the government should play in health care—to resolve before turning to the general election.
""I feel like on the one hand we've already said everything that's needed to be said. But I just feel like … they need to keep having the debates to hear both sides of view,"" said Ms. Parker, 20 years old. ""Not everyone's been watching [the televised debates] for a year.""
Some voters here contemplated what it meant for the Democratic Party now that the race has essentially narrowed to two candidates—Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, both older white men—after a year of campaigning by a sprawling and diverse field.
Some voters argued that the party over the past year had undertaken a rigorous debate that has reached its waning days, and urged fellow Democrats to focus more on the general election matchup with Mr. Trump. ""I think we should unite and be strictly on Trump,"" said Michael Tolliver, 70 years old, a former assembly line worker for General Motors.
Mr. Biden has a significant delegate lead over Mr. Sanders, but it is not insurmountable, and a majority of delegates are still outstanding.
Voting here ends around 8 p.m. E.T. Earlier in the day, there were no long lines at several polling places inside Detroit. Some precinct captains said they expected more people to come after work and noted that many people had voted early by mail.
Kenneth Curry, a deacon at Calvary Baptist Church, said he was hearing from his staff that in-person voting rivaled turnout at the church during the 2018 midterm elections. Why? Mr. Curry said older black voters were intent to show their support for Mr. Biden, the former vice president.
""I think he's regained footing after South Carolina. Can't nobody do it like us,"" Mr. Curry said, adding that black people had saved Mr. Biden's once-shaky candidacy. ""There had been a cluster going on.""

DES MOINES, Iowa -- A campaign that began more than a year ago for this state's Democratic presidential caucuses is drawing to a frenzied close as a flood of candidate appearances and ads blanket the state before Monday's balloting starts the nomination season.
The party's debate over whether to go with a candidate who supports a bigger role for government in people's lives, or one with a more modest approach, hung above all the activity as its voters continued to wrestle with who would have the best chance of defeating President Trump, their top concern in polls.
The early-voting state is a general election battleground, which Mr. Trump captured by nearly 10 percentage points in 2016 over Hillary Clinton, but President Obama won in 2008 and 2012.
Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who polls have shown has a good chance of winning the popular vote here, used rallies and concerts to mobilize supporters. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts made a direct appeal to women and sold herself as someone who could unite the party.
Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., continued to pitch his message of generational change and the need for someone who could unite the party. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who has played to smaller crowds than many of rivals in Iowa despite leading national polls for most of the year, leaned into his message of being the party's safest choice to defeat Mr. Trump.
For Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the weekend marked an important burst of Iowa campaigning after being kept off the trail because they were serving last week as jurors in the president's impeachment trial. The Senate will return Monday for several more hours of proceedings.
Added uncertainty was injected into the final hours of the contest when the sponsors of a respected survey in the state -- the Iowa Poll -- on Saturday night held back results of a survey after questions were raised about its accuracy.
Iowa Polls, traditionally released the weekend before the caucuses, have in the past given candidates near the top a boost while hurting those showing weakness.
An Iowa campaign that saw roughly $70 million spent on television ads headed to an unpredictable finish as thousands of volunteers and campaign workers went door-to-door to encourage attendance at nearly 1,700 neighborhood caucuses, typically held in school gymnasiums and public libraries, or dozens of other ""satellite caucuses"" held for those unable to attend a meeting in their neighborhood.
The campaign dominated TV screens here from sunrise to sunset. Even the Super Bowl featured campaign ads, including spots from Mr. Trump and Democratic candidate Michael Bloomberg.
Iowa's outcome will depend on many variables, including second choices. Candidates who don't reach a 15% threshold on the first round of balloting will be deemed not viable in that precinct, and their supporters are then free to move to a new candidate on the second and final round.
Some Iowans said they are considering supporting a candidate already out of the race or one with little chance of being viable so that they can gauge support for all the candidates before making their final decision to back someone.
Mr. Sanders, who came within striking distance of a victory in Iowa during his 2016 presidential bid, has drawn some of the state's largest crowds in recent days.
""Our job is to bring out our family, our friends, our co-workers, bring out everybody you know,"" Mr. Sanders told supporters Sunday in Cedar Rapids. ""Now is the time for action. Action is tomorrow night.""
Mr. Biden told an audience in Dubuque that they had the power to ""hold Trump accountable"" and ""say the words that Trump fears the most: 'We're going to caucus for Joe Biden.' ""
Ms. Warren eyed an audience on Sunday that her aides said totaled 1,100 in Indianola.
""You have made me a better candidate, and you will make me a better president,"" she said. ""Thank you, Iowa.""
Ms. Warren used the final full day of campaigning in Iowa to sharpen her argument that she is best suited to unite the Democratic Party.
Mr. Buttigieg, speaking to an audience of roughly 2,000 people packed into a high school gymnasium in Des Moines Sunday, reflected what began as an upstart campaign.
""It is difficult to believe how far we have come from a year ago when we first turned up in a coffee shop in Ames, thrilled because there were literally dozens of people there,"" he said. ""That's how this thing began: no personal fortune, no national name recognition.""
Aides to Ms. Klobuchar said she was drawing some of her largest crowds in Iowa so far. The future of her candidacy could be more dependent on Iowa than the others because of her deep investment in the state and status as a neighbor.
She centered her closing pitch on her record of winning in conservative districts. ""My profound advice is this: We better not screw this up,"" Ms. Klobuchar told an audience.

WASHINGTON—In six days of arguments on the Senate floor, Democrats and the White House defense team sparred over whether the president abused the power of his office and obstructed Congress—and whether those actions would merit his removal from office.
President Trump's defense team on Tuesday concluded its three days of arguments in the impeachment trial, in which the lawyers sought to rebut Democrats' allegations of wrongdoing by the president and dismiss the investigation as a politically motivated stunt.
Their arguments followed three days of sessions in which Democrats, who sought to persuade senators of the urgent need to remove Mr. Trump—whom they described as a threat to democracy—from office. In one major development after the Democrats finished their arguments, the New York Times revealed that former national-security adviser John Bolton, in a draft of his forthcoming book, wrote that Mr. Trump told him aid to Ukraine was conditioned on investigations.
Here is a breakdown of the arguments the House Democratic impeachment managers made on key points, and how the Trump team responded:
Ukraine Aid
Impeachment Managers: The Democrats alleged Mr. Trump leveraged nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine to pressure Kyiv to undertake investigations that could benefit him politically. Democrats said that amounted to an effort to interfere in the 2020 election. The aid was released after pressure from Congress.
Trump's Defense: Mr. Trump's team noted the aid to Ukraine was released in September without any announcement of investigations by Ukraine. President Trump denied the conversation Mr. Bolton described in his book. Alan Dershowitz, a member of the Trump legal team, argued that even if the conversation did take place as Mr. Bolton described, it wouldn't amount to an impeachable offense.
July 25 Call
Impeachment Managers: Democrats said the White House sought to cover up a July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president—in which Mr. Trump asked him to investigate Democrat Joe Biden and his son and alleged election interference—by moving the transcript to a classified server typically reserved for the nation's top secrets.
Trump's Defense: Lawyers said the White House wasn't seeking to hide the transcript of the July 25 phone call because it was both preserved on a White House server and, in September, made public. The lawyers also pointed to the fact that Mr. Trump didn't link aid to investigations on the call.
Articles of Impeachment
Impeachment Managers: Aside from blocking aid, Democrats said, the president obstructed the impeachment investigation by blocking evidence and testimony sought by House investigators—including that of Mr. Bolton.
Trump's Defense: The president's team argued the articles of impeachment are constitutionally deficient and overly broad. The lawyers also argued that Democrats don't allege that the president committed a crime, which they said is necessary to warrant removal from office. In past impeachments, lawyers—some of whom are now serving on Mr. Trump's team—have argued a crime wasn't necessary to impeach a president.
Trump's Removal From Office
Impeachment Managers: The president poses a national-security threat to the country and, said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), an ""imminent threat to the integrity of our democracy"" and therefore must be removed prior to the 2020 election.
Trump's Defense: Mr. Trump's lawyers said the president is up for re-election in less than 10 months and the choice should be left to the voters. The lawyers also countered Democrats' calls for urgency in removing the president from office by noting that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) waited a month to turn over the articles of impeachment to the Senate.
Senate Witnesses
Impeachment Managers: Democrats argued the Senate should call new witnesses—among them Mr. Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney— who could offer first-hand accounts of the president's motivation for holding up aid to Ukraine.
Trump's Defense: The president's team said the House was responsible for collecting testimony and documents, and in voting for the articles of impeachment determined it had enough evidence to warrant the president's removal from office. Therefore there is no need to prolong the trial, they argued.

DES MOINES, Iowa—A campaign that began more than a year ago for this state's Democratic presidential caucuses is drawing to a frenzied close as a flood of candidate appearances and ads blanket the state before Monday's balloting starts the nomination season.
The party's debate over whether to go with a candidate who supports a bigger role for government in people's lives, or one with a more modest approach, hung above all the activity as its voters continued to wrestle with who would have the best chance of defeating President Trump, their top-of-mind concern in polls.
The early-voting state is a general election battleground, which Mr. Trump captured by nearly 10 percentage points in 2016 over Hillary Clinton, but President Obama won in 2008 and 2012.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, who polls have shown has a good chance of winning the popular vote here, used rallies and concerts to mobilize supporters who have shown deep loyalty to him. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts made a direct appeal to women and sold herself as someone who could unite the party.
Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., continued to pitch his message of generational change and the need for someone who could unite the party. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who has played to smaller crowds than many of his rivals in Iowa despite leading national polls for most of the year, leaned into his message of being the party's safest choice to defeat Mr. Trump.

For Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the weekend marked an especially important burst of Iowa campaigning after being kept off the trail because they were serving last week as jurors in the president's impeachment trial in Washington. The Senate will return Monday for several more hours of trial proceedings.

Added uncertainty was injected into the final hours of the contest when the sponsors of a respected survey in the state—the Iowa Poll—on Saturday night held back results of a final survey after questions were raised about its accuracy.
Iowa Polls, traditionally released the weekend before the caucuses, have in the past given candidates near the top a boost, while hurting those showing weakness. That is because the results can boost media attention and offer validation for voters looking for a nudge to finally decide.
An Iowa campaign that saw roughly $70 million spent on television ads headed to an unpredictable finish as thousands of volunteers and campaign workers went door-to-door to encourage attendance at one of nearly 1,700 neighborhood caucuses, typically held in school gymnasiums and public libraries, or dozens of other ""satellite caucuses"" held for those unable to attend a meeting in their own neighborhood.
The campaign dominated TV screens here from sunrise to sunset. Even the
Super Bowl Sunday evening
included campaign ads, with spots from Mr. Trump and billionaire Democratic candidate Michael Bloomberg, who is focusing his spending in states with March contests.
Iowa's outcome will depend on many variables, including second choices. Candidates who don't reach a 15% threshold on the first round of balloting will be deemed not viable in that precinct and their supporters are then free to move to a new candidate on the second and final round.
Some Iowans savvy with the process said they are considering supporting a candidate already out of the race or one with little chance of being viable so that they can gauge support for all the candidates before making their final decision to back someone.
In a close race, this realignment process could be critical. Decisions made between that first and final round can hinge on the quality of the campaign precinct captains, local politics and personal relationships, creating even more uncertainty.
Mr. Sanders, who
came within striking distance of a victory in Iowa
during his 2016 presidential bid, has drawn some of the state's largest crowds in recent days.
""Our job is to bring out our family, our friends, our co-workers, bring out everybody you know,"" Mr. Sanders told supporters Sunday in Cedar Rapids. ""Now is the time for action. Action is tomorrow night.""
In more than a dozen interviews at Mr. Sanders's campaign events this weekend, supporters told stories of considering other candidates—often Ms. Warren—before coming back to Mr. Sanders in the final weeks because of his consistency on issues.
Mr. Biden told an audience of a few hundred people in Dubuque, a heavily Catholic community along the Mississippi River where his advisers hope to show strength on Monday night, that they had the power to ""hold Trump accountable"" and ""say the words that Trump fears the most: 'We're going to caucus for Joe Biden.'""
Mr. Biden ""is anything but doomed,"" said former Democratic Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd during a Bloomberg News event in Des Moines. Symone Sanders, a senior adviser to Mr. Biden's campaign, said since the former vice president's entry into the race, ""people have been writing our campaign's obituary. Tuesday morning will be no different.""
Mr. Biden's team has said coming contests in Nevada and South Carolina, which follow Iowa and New Hampshire, were just as crucial in determining the party's strongest nominee.
Ms. Warren gleefully eyed an audience on Sunday that her aides said totaled 1,100 in Indianola.
""You have made me a better candidate, and you will make me a better president,"" she said. ""Thank you, Iowa.""
Ms. Warren used the final full day of campaigning in Iowa to sharpen her argument that she is best suited to unite the Democratic Party's liberal and centrist wings against President Trump.
""I am running a campaign from a belief in what we can do together,"" she said. ""What we can do together if we choose courage, what we can do together if we choose hope.""
Mr. Buttigieg, speaking to an audience of roughly 2,000 people packed into a high school gymnasium in Des Moines Sunday, reflected on the evolution of what began as an upstart campaign.
""It is difficult to believe how far we have come from a year ago when we first turned up in a coffee shop in Ames, thrilled because there were literally dozens of people there,"" he said. ""That's how this thing began: no personal fortune, no national name recognition.""
Mr. Buttigieg expressed optimism for Monday. ""We're just one day away from victory in the Iowa caucuses,"" he said.
Aides to Ms. Klobuchar said she was drawing some of her largest crowds in Iowa so far. The future of her candidacy could be more dependent on the Iowa outcome than the others because of her deep investment in the state and status as a neighbor.
She centered her closing pitch on her record of winning in conservative districts in her home state and suggested she could replicate that as the party's nominee, giving a boost to down-ballot candidates. ""My profound advice is this: We better not screw this up,"" Ms. Klobuchar told an audience.

With the leadoff Iowa caucuses days away, President Trump's re-election campaign wants to remind voters that Democrats aren't the only game in town.
For the Feb. 3 caucuses, the Trump campaign is planning an ambitious show of force around the state, with over 80 surrogates expected to campaign at caucus locations. The push will be led by campaign manager Brad Parscale, the president's sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, as well as Eric Trump's wife Lara Trump, who works for the campaign, and Donald Trump Jr.'s girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle, also a campaign adviser.
The group heading to Iowa includes White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and a number of cabinet members, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. Also attending are members of Congress, among them House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), Rep. Elise Stefanik, (R., N.Y.) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), as well as Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and governors from surrounding states.
Four years ago, President Trump placed second in the Iowa caucuses. This time around he has no strong challenger and Republican turnout is expected to be light. Still, the campaign sees the night as an opportunity to test its organizational muscle across the state's 99 counties and put on a show of strength in a key general election state.
""Our Caucus Day operation is just a preview of what is to come,"" said Mr. Parscale, in a statement provided to The Wall Street Journal. ""This will be the strongest, best funded, and most organized presidential campaign in history.""
The president is also heading to Des Moines on Thursday for a rally in advance of the caucuses, and Vice President Mike Pence is planning a bus tour through the state that day. The campaign has held caucus training sessions and Lara Trump recently issued a video detailing how to participate.
""By attending your caucus you can show your support for the president and send a clear message to the rest of the country,"" she said.
Mr. Trump has made clear he plans to leave nothing to chance in Iowa, a state he captured by nearly 10 percentage points in 2016 over Hillary Clinton but that Barack Obama won in 2008 and 2012. He has stayed close to Iowa Republicans, visiting the state throughout his presidency.
Some states have opted not to hold Republican primaries this year, but Iowa -- ever mindful of its first-in-the-nation status -- has kept the GOP contest going.
""When you're a first-in-the- nation state, you can't take off an election cycle,"" said Iowa Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kaufmann. ""We need to make sure both parties are out front and showing the country that we're going to do things in a transparent way and an efficient way.""
On the evening of Feb. 3, Republicans and Democrats will gather in nearly 1,700 precinct locations to pick their choice to be the party nominee. The GOP process is more straightforward than the Democratic approach, with Republicans simply casting a vote. The caucus results ultimately determine the delegates that represent the state at the Republican convention in August.
Mr. Trump has followed the Democratic nomination fight.
Speaking to Fox Business recently, he said of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders: ""I don't know, maybe he's really surging. He really is,"" while adding that Massachusetts Sen. ""Elizabeth Warren seems to be going in the other way."" Of former Vice President Joe Biden, Mr. Trump said he ""doesn't seem to be doing too well.""
Although the president's impeachment trial will continue this week, the push in Iowa comes as he has been or will be central to several other events.
He is holding a rally in New Jersey this week, as well as a meeting with Israeli leaders. On Friday, he became the first president to address the March for Life in Washington in person.

Former Vice President Joe Biden has emerged as
the Democratic presidential front-runner
over Sen. Bernie Sanders as the two face off in a third straight Tuesday of major primary contests—the first set of voting contests since the coronavirus pandemic has upended life across the country and the world.
Officials from the three states holding primaries–Florida, Illinois and Arizona—have said they are taking extra precautions to keep voting machines sanitized, and each state moved some polling places away from nursing homes and other vulnerable sites. Ohio's governor said the state was
postponing its planned in-person voting
Tuesday until June, even after a judge blocked its last-minute attempt to do so.
Polls in Florida and Illinois close by 8 p.m. ET, and Arizona's polls close by 10 p.m. ET.
Here is a guide to the races and our planned coverage.
How Does the Democratic Race Stand Now?
Mr. Biden is expected to further cement his path to the Democratic nomination. In fact, Democratic presidential primary voters now
overwhelmingly back Mr. Biden
over Mr. Sanders, a dramatic reversal in their standings from just one month ago, the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows.
It is a major reversal from mid-February, before Mr. Biden's win in South Carolina's Feb. 29 primary and dominance in a string of field-narrowing primaries since then.
The coronavirus pandemic has drastically altered the primary season, amid strict guidance against gatherings, including closing schools and avoiding groups of more than 10 people, discretionary travel, bars, restaurants and food courts.
In addition to Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard is also still running but trails by hundreds of delegates.
Three Key Things to Watch For:
Does voting avoid major problems?
The virus will pose a series of hurdles for voters, and states have been grappling with how to hold their presidential nominating contests while keeping voters and workers shielded. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has urged states to encourage early and mail-in voting when possible, or to encourage voters to come during off-peak times. The CDC also recommended cleaning and routinely disinfecting voting equipment, such as electronic voting machines.
Can Joe Biden extend his lead?
Mr. Biden is strongly favored in the three states scheduled to vote while Mr. Sanders's aides have acknowledged the senator faces an uphill battle. In 2016, Mr. Sanders lost all of those states to Hillary Clinton.
As of Tuesday morning, Mr. Biden has 890 delegates and Mr. Sanders has 736 delegates; 1,991 are needed to secure the nomination.
Which state will vote next?
Amid the nationwide shutdown, Louisiana, Georgia and Kentucky have delayed their primaries. Louisiana's has been moved to May 19 from March 24, Louisiana's is rescheduled to June 20 from April 4, and Kentucky has delayed its May 19 primary until June. On Monday, President Trump said he is leaving the decision to postpone the primaries ""up to the states.""
Wisconsin is scheduled to vote in early April, but more changes to the primary calendar could still come.

Supporters of Bernie Sanders want him to stay in the presidential contest, despite an unlikely path to the Democratic nomination after a string of primary losses in March.
The Vermont senator would have to completely upend the race by capturing more than 60% of the remaining delegates to overtake former Vice President Joe Biden and earn the party's nomination to face President Trump in November. Mr. Biden's allies have called for unity, but Mr. Sanders has shown no sign of leaving the race and has deflected questions about how long he will continue.
In interviews with more than two dozen Sanders supporters, many of them acknowledged his second bid for the Democratic nomination was unlikely to be successful. But nearly all said they saw no reason for him to exit now, and most of those in states with primaries still to come said they planned to vote for the senator.
Backers said the coronavirus pandemic that has shut down much of the U.S. highlights the need for many of Mr. Sanders's signature issues, such as a Medicare for All health insurance program. They hope that his continued presence in the race will pressure the Democratic Party and Mr. Biden to adopt more of Mr. Sanders's policies.
""I think he should not give up, even if it looks like he's not going to be the nominee. He needs to continue to advocate for what we believe in,"" said Luis Yofe, 67 years old, who works in the travel industry and lives in Dallas. ""For us to be enthusiastic, Biden and the party will have to adopt, in the platform for the general election, some of the key principles that Bernie is advocating.""
Mr. Biden has adopted some policies in a nod to liberals, including an expanded free-college program. Mr. Sanders has said the proposal doesn't go far enough.
""I'm happy to talk with him, and I've indicated that I also hear his supporters,"" Mr. Biden said on ABC's ""The View"" this week. ""He's had very strong support from young people, and I hear them.""
Democratic Party officials are set to meet in mid-July to decide on their platform and nominate the candidate who will take on Mr. Trump in the general election. To win the nomination on the first ballot at the convention, a candidate must earn 1,991 delegates, a majority of those awarded through state caucuses and primaries. As of Thursday afternoon, Mr. Biden had roughly 300 more delegates than Mr. Sanders.
But since the coronavirus crisis prompted some states to delay their contests, Mr. Biden is unlikely to sew up the nomination quickly if Mr. Sanders remains in the race.
In an interview with NPR Friday, Mr. Sanders said it would be ""a very steep road"" to overtake Mr. Biden.
The uncertainty caused by Covid-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, has given some hope to a handful of Mr. Sanders's supporters that he still has a shot at the nomination. They say that the crisis has highlighted the need for a Medicare for All system because millions of people who lose their jobs because of the illness could also lose their health insurance.
""I think that the Covid stuff is maybe the absolute best possible thing for his campaign right now,"" said Kirsten Southwell, 29, a senior designer at the Art Institute of Chicago. ""I think it really confirms a lot of the things that Bernie has talked about.""
Ms. Southwell and others are hoping that voters will see Mr. Sanders's reaction to the crisis and go for him in droves, giving him the significant margins he would need in every state going forward.
Mr. Sanders returned to Vermont on Thursday after voting the night before on a roughly $2 trillion stimulus package aimed at bolstering the U.S. economy as it struggles with the spread of the coronavirus. Aides say the campaign's focus is on the day-to-day operation and responding to the pandemic rather than what Mr. Sanders's future holds.
The campaign hasn't put up a TV ad in more than a week and has stopped soliciting donations via email to fund its operation, instead pulling in money to support organizations that are involved in coronavirus relief. However, the campaign is still accepting donations on its website and recurring funds are still being pulled in. The Vermont senator is doing frequent virtual briefings, at times bringing on progressive lawmakers and activists.
Mr. Sanders hasn't indicated any intention to quit the race. His spokesman said recently that he would participate in a presidential debate in April if the Democratic National Committee held one.
""He is being extremely presidential and he's showing us exactly the way a leader would act in this moment,"" said Katherine Abegg, 43, a textile research and development manager who lives in Brooklyn.
Ms. Abegg wasn't alone in her passion for Mr. Sanders. Eleven of the 25 people interviewed by The Wall Street Journal said they would have a difficult time voting for Mr. Biden in November and planned to write in a name at the top of their ballot, leave it blank or stay home on Election Day.
Most of those who said they would not cast their ballots for Mr. Biden said they lived in states that were likely to vote for the Democrat anyway.
However, some Sanders supporters in Arizona, a 2020 battleground state, Idaho and Tennessee, both of which generally vote Republican, also said they wouldn't cast ballots for Mr. Biden.
An aide to Mr. Biden declined to comment beyond pointing to polling that shows the former vice president leading Mr. Trump in swing counties.
One Sanders supporter, 58-year-old Brenda Wilson of Cleveland, said Mr. Sanders should exit the race soon. Ms. Wilson said she is likely to cast her ballot for Mr. Biden when Ohio votes in June. ""I still love him,"" she said of Mr. Sanders, adding that if he remains in the race, he could hurt Mr. Biden's chances against Mr. Trump.
""I'm a true believer if there's a stronger candidate, we should go with you,"" she said.

Facebook Inc. officials say they try to avoid political bias. Try telling that to Democrats.
The relationship between the company and the political left is at an all-time low, more than a dozen Democratic operatives, campaign officials and leaders of progressive groups said in interviews, following a series of company policy decisions widely seen among their ranks as favoring President Trump. Many Democrats and campaign officials are increasingly criticizing Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg in personal terms.
It is a
stark departure from the 2016 campaign
, when Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg endorsed Democrat Hillary Clinton. The relationship has frayed partly because of actions Facebook took to address criticisms of bias from conservatives and in part owing to revelations from U.S. intelligence and special counsel Robert Mueller's report on how Russia used Facebook to spread disinformation to boost Mr. Trump's campaign.
On the campaign trail and in Democratic political circles, there is little love left for the Silicon Valley giant, even as presidential candidates on both sides of the aisle rely on Facebook as a valuable platform for political advertising.
This month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, former Vice President Joe Biden and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer all lambasted Facebook over misleading videos, ads and hate speech on the platform. Mrs. Clinton
recently called Mr. Zuckerberg authoritarian
. Those public remarks came after behind-the-scenes discussions between Facebook and Democrats about whether the company was allowing harmful discourse ahead of the 2020 election.
""Progressives think the way Facebook has permitted and amplified disinformation has become antithetical to a well-functioning democracy,"" Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, a progressive think tank, said in an interview.
Facebook representatives say the company is in an awkward position. Democrats want the company to fulfill its promise to combat misinformation, but conservatives argue that the fact-checking groups employed by Facebook are liberal and could unfairly limit their speech.
""People on both sides of the aisle disagree with some of the positions we've taken, but we remain committed to seeking outside perspectives and communicating clearly about why we make the decisions we do,"" a Facebook spokesman said in an emailed statement.
The social media platform remains a major part of campaign infrastructure.
""Facebook is the big bad ugly, but you talk to operatives about where they're spending their money and it's Facebook,"" said Tim Lim, a Democratic digital strategist.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren and some other presidential candidates are pushing for a
breakup of the company
, and the Massachusetts lawmaker's campaign asks supporters to confirm they aren't an executive at a big tech company before donating to her.
Still, she has put more than $6.8 million into Facebook ads since the start of 2019. Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has also been critical of the company, spent more than $7 million in that time. Mr. Trump's campaign put more than $22 million toward Facebook ads during the period.
Mr. Lim said campaign officials feel they have no choice but to buy Facebook ads because voters spend so much time on the platform.
Not every campaign is keeping Silicon Valley at arm's length. A Facebook board member, Jeffrey Zients, who was National Economic Council director during the Obama administration, is backing Mr. Biden for president. He welcomed the former vice president to his Washington home for an evening fundraiser in November. He is among a number of co-hosts for a February fundraising event as well, according to an invitation reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
Mr. Biden has said it is worth taking a ""really hard look"" at breaking up tech companies including Facebook.
Conservatives have long complained of bias in Silicon Valley. In 2016, employees of Facebook donated almost 100 times more to Mrs. Clinton than Mr. Trump, according to federal data. That spring, conservatives were in an uproar after the tech-news site Gizmodo reported that the company altered a list of
trending topics
to suppress conservative content.
Facebook denied the Gizmodo article, but
several conservatives visited the company's headquarters
to discuss the issue.
Mr. Zuckerberg has
relied on advice
from Peter Thiel, a longtime Facebook board member and Trump backer. Joel Kaplan, one of Facebook's top policy executives and a former aide to President George W. Bush, has sometimes
postponed or killed projects
that risk upsetting the political right, the Journal has previously reported.
While Facebook was repairing its relationship with conservatives, many Democrats soured on the company.
Last year, Facebook
refused to take down a video
that had been altered to appear to show Mrs. Pelosi slurring her words. Facebook executives were divided on how to handle the video but fell back on the stance that a tech company shouldn't be the arbiter of truth, people familiar with the matter say.
Following that same logic, Facebook said in late September that it wouldn't fact-check posts, images or ads from politicians on the platform. In October, Facebook allowed an ad run by Mr. Trump's re-election campaign that included a claim about Mr. Biden's role in the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor. The former vice president's campaign said the claim was false.
In an Oct. 4 letter, the Biden campaign accused the company of selling ""the tools to target certain segments of the population with lies."" Facebook's global head of elections policy, Katie Harbath, who previously worked with Republicans, responded that the company strove to ""empower voters to judge what politicians say for themselves."" The New York Times earlier reported the email exchange, which the Journal also reviewed.
The Biden campaign then urged Facebook to remember that it ""promised the public, the United States Congress, and its users…that its platform will no longer be a conduit for misinformation and a tool of political distortion.""
Share Your Thoughts
How well do you think Facebook has been handling political messaging on its platform during this election cycle so far? Join the conversation below.
Earlier this month, Facebook
stood by its decision
to allow political ads to be targeted to small segments of American voters, unlike moves by its competitors Google and Twitter Inc. Mr. Trump's campaign used this method to reach narrow voter groups in 2016. Some Democrats say such targeting can make it hard to detect misinformation, even though others in the party have also used the tactic.
Ms. Sandberg has told Democratic operatives that the decisions are tough to make, according to people familiar with those conversations. One person characterized Ms. Sandberg's behind-the-scenes position as: ""I'm a Democrat, this is so hard for me.""
In some discussions with Democrats, Facebook staffers describe Facebook as the public's ""favorite punching bag,"" this person said.
A senior Biden campaign official said Facebook had been ""nominally cooperative"" in making people from the company available to talk about policy differences. The official said Facebook had notified the campaign after a video surfaced on the platform that had been edited in a way that changed the meaning of remarks by the vice president, which Mr. Biden's allies said made the comments sound racist.
""The thing that I have taken away from all of our interactions with them is that they realize that misinformation is a problem that for PR reasons they realize they need to talk about,"" this person said.
""They understand they have an optics problem,"" the Biden official said.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.—Michael Bloomberg's
unprecedented spending
couldn't win over voters in Super Tuesday states—and his advisers are assessing his campaign.
The former New York City mayor spent about $215 million of his own money on TV and radio ads in Super Tuesday states alone—more than 100 times what former Vice President Joe Biden spent on ads in those states and roughly 12 times what Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders spent, according to ad-tracking data from Kantar/CMAG.
It also is only slightly less than the total amount the campaigns of Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden spent—combined—between launching their campaigns last year and the end of January, according to the latest available Federal Election Commission reports.
Overall, on TV, radio and digital platforms, the billionaire put out more than $500 million—an unprecedented amount in just over three months.
That doesn't include the cost of the massive campaign operation of more than 2,400 staffers Mr. Bloomberg built. A significant chunk of those staffers were based in states that voted Tuesday.
As of primary night, with many states still counting votes,
he had earned just a few dozen delegates
. The only contest Mr. Bloomberg had won was American Samoa.
Minutes before polls closed in many states, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, told reporters the campaign would assess the results to decide the billionaire's path moving forward.
""Well, I think you make an assessment in any campaign like this after every time that there's a vote,"" he said. ""I think most Democrats in this race understand that our number one objective is defeating Donald Trump, and then all of us are supporting a nominee.""
""As of right now we're committed to stay in, but we'll see what happens today,"" Mr. Sheekey said.
As early results showed Mr. Biden sweeping states where Mr. Bloomberg had heavily invested, he addressed his supporters and tried to project confidence.
""No matter how many delegates we win tonight, we have done something no one else thought was possible,"" Mr. Bloomberg said at his election night event in West Palm Beach. ""In just three months, we've gone from just 1% in the polls to being a contender for the Democratic nomination.""
Mr. Bloomberg didn't win any states Tuesday, but he may have cost Mr. Biden some delegates. In some states where Mr. Sanders won or was leading, Mr. Bloomberg's vote share was larger than the margin between Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. Before the results came in, Mr. Sheekey insisted Mr. Bloomberg wasn't playing spoiler to Mr. Biden.
Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Biden both competed
for support from moderate and black voters
, trying to tie themselves to former President Obama in ads. Mr. Bloomberg spent an estimated $40 million on several versions of a 30-second spot, including one in Spanish, which featured Mr. Obama praising him, according to Kantar/CMAG.
But the former vice president's landslide victory in South Carolina helped consolidate those blocs of voters behind him, along with key endorsements from party leaders and his former Democratic rivals ahead of Super Tuesday.
Based on its internal data, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign saw a big shift after South Carolina, according to a campaign aide, who added that the effect of Mr. Biden's win in the state was reflected in Tuesday's results. In states where many people voted early or by mail, like Colorado and Utah, Mr. Bloomberg was performing better.
In Virginia alone, where the state was called for Mr. Biden as soon as polls closed, Mr. Bloomberg spent about $18 million on TV and radio ads to earn roughly 10% of the vote. In North Carolina, another state that was called for Mr. Biden immediately after polls closed, Mr. Bloomberg spent $15.3 million. In those two states, Mr. Bloomberg had more than 200 staffers and 18 offices.
Philip Balas, 68, an attorney in Palm Beach Gardens who attended Mr. Bloomberg's election night event, said Tuesday was only a ""start"" for the billionaire and praised him for spending his money to try to defeat Mr. Trump. ""He seems to care a lot about America, and he's spending money on it to bring it back to what it used to be and to unify America,"" Mr. Balas said.
""To me, anything is worth that,"" he said.
In a tweet Tuesday night, Mr. Trump said Mr. Bloomberg was the ""biggest loser of the night."" ""His 'political' consultants took him for a ride. $700 million washed down the drain, and he got nothing for it but the nickname Mini Mike, and the complete destruction of his reputation. Way to go Mike!"" he said.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Bloomberg had said at a field office in Miami that he was ""in it to win it,"" while acknowledging his only path to the Democratic nomination was through a contested convention.
He also dodged questions about whether he was taking votes away from Mr. Biden, whom moderates swiftly consolidated behind after his landslide victory in South Carolina.
""Have you asked Joe whether he's going to drop out?"" he said in response to questions from reporters at his field office in Miami's Little Havana section. ""When you ask him that, then you can call me.""
Mr. Bloomberg launched his White House bid in large part because he thought Mr. Biden was faltering and couldn't defeat Mr. Trump. Despite Mr. Biden gaining momentum in recent days, Mr. Bloomberg continued to make the case Tuesday that he was the ""unTrump,"" as he put it, who could defeat the president.
Mr. Bloomberg emphasized his wealth—even more so than usual—in speeches leading up to Super Tuesday as one of his assets in taking on Mr. Trump.
""If you want somebody who has the resources to beat Trump, that's me,"" he said. ""Now, I give virtually all my company's profits to charity, and there's no better investment I can make in the future of our country than spending to defeat Donald Trump.
""If you think this campaign is expensive, just imagine what four more years with Donald Trump would cost us,"" he said.

LAS VEGAS -- Joe Biden has made the case for months that he can best appeal to black, Latino and moderate voters. But after the Nevada caucuses, Bernie Sanders is the one beginning to show the makings of a broad electoral coalition.
The Vermont senator's decisive victory Saturday was powered by a diverse set of voters, including overwhelming support among Latinos and young people drawn to his calls for an expansive government-run health-care program and the elimination of student debt.
Mr. Sanders's ability to build upon that coalition will help dictate whether he is able to prevent the former vice president from notching a victory on Feb. 29 in South Carolina, where black voters make up more than half of the Democratic electorate. If Mr. Sanders edges Mr. Biden out there, he could be poised for a dominant run on March 3, when a series of contests including the diverse states of California, Texas and North Carolina will award about one-third of the delegates for the nomination.
""In Nevada, we have just put together a multigenerational, multiracial coalition which is not only going to win in Nevada, it's going to sweep this country,"" Mr. Sanders said in San Antonio on Saturday night.
Mr. Biden took the stage at a Las Vegas union hall as results trickled in, seizing upon projections of a second-place finish -- albeit distant -- that he said would revitalize his campaign.
Beyond his connection with diverse voters, Mr. Biden's electability pitch has also centered on his ability to persuade suburban voters and disaffected Republicans in general election battleground states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.
Mr. Biden's campaign manager, Greg Schultz, said that despite Mr. Sanders's victories in New Hampshire and Nevada, he had not been able to generate the surges in voting that the senator has promised would help him beat President Trump in the November election.
""Their campaign continues to say, directly and indirectly, look at turnout, look at turnout, look at turnout,"" Mr. Schultz said. ""And in none of the first three contests has there been this surge in turnout in what they think is their greatest asset.""
Nevada's Democratic Party said about 75,000 people voted early ahead of Saturday's primaries, and turnout was expected to surpass the 85,000 who participated in 2016. But it was unclear if it would exceed the 118,000 who caucused in 2008. New Hampshire's turnout was higher than primaries in 2008 and 2016, while Iowa's turnout cleared the 2016 race there but fell short of 2008 numbers.
Entrance polls in Nevada showed Mr. Sanders capturing about half of Hispanic voters and triumphing among those with college degrees and without, union and nonunion households and every age group except those age 65 and older, who supported Mr. Biden. The former vice president was backed by about one third of African-American voters, giving him an edge over Mr. Sanders, who was backed by about one quarter of black voters.
Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist who isn't affiliated with a presidential campaign, credited Mr. Sanders with cultivating strong ties with the Latino community since the 2016 election, particularly among young people and millennials. She noted that since the last election, four million Latinos have turned age 18, giving Mr. Sanders a significant advantage.
""Sanders has done a really good job of transforming the electability argument. And the pendulum is swinging toward him right now,"" she said.
Mr. Biden's message focuses on protecting the Obamacare health-care law he helped pass alongside President Obama and his work to curb gun violence.
Both issues sought to draw bright lines with Mr. Sanders, who has advocated for a Medicare-for-all health-care overhaul that would eventually eliminate the private insurance system and who voted against legislation to institute background checks for gun purchases.
South Carolina has long been viewed as a firewall for the Biden campaign. Depending on his performance, it could serve as a springboard into delegate-rich states or Mr. Biden's political Waterloo as he seeks the presidency for the third time.
""I think he does have momentum,"" Mr. Biden said of Mr. Sanders after attending church services Sunday in predominantly black North Charleston, S.C. But he added: ""Whoever wins this primary is going into Super Tuesday very strongly, and I think it's going to be Bernie and me going into Super Tuesday.""

Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar formally ended her bid for the presidency and endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden on Monday, one day before the biggest day of Democratic primary voting so far.
Ms. Klobuchar, who ran on a message of Midwestern pragmatism, took the stage with Mr. Biden at a rally in Dallas, Texas, where she paid tribute to a campaign that she said ""beat the odds."" She then urged her supporters to vote for Mr. Biden in Texas and 13 other states that vote in what is
known as Super Tuesday
.
""We need to unite our party and our country and to do it not just with our words but our actions,"" Ms. Klobuchar said. ""That is why today, I am ending my campaign and endorsing Joe Biden for president.""

How will Amy Klobuchar's departure affect Super Tuesday results? Join the conversation below.
The rally took place several hours after aides to Ms. Klobuchar confirmed she was suspending her campaign after lackluster showings in recent early state contests. Her departure from the race came after former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg also ended his campaign. Mr. Buttigieg also endorsed Mr. Biden in Dallas on Monday.
The show of unity for Mr. Biden came as moderate Democrats are seeking to coalesce behind an alternative to front-runner Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
Ms. Kloubchar didn't mention Mr. Sanders in her remarks and instead emphasized the need for Democrats to come together to defeat President Trump in November.
""It is time to join hands instead of pointing fingers. It is time to turn back the division and the hate and the exclusion and the bitterness,"" she said. ""And it is time to work together to lift up those who are left out and to bring people with us instead of shoving them away.""
Ms. Klobuchar finished in
sixth place in South Carolina
and in
the Nevada caucuses
a week earlier. She had hoped to bounce back on Tuesday in her home state of Minnesota, though Mr. Sanders's strength was growing in the state, which has a total of 92 delegates.
Ms. Klobuchar decided to end her campaign on Monday morning in a move that caught some of her campaign staff, who were still reserving television ads and scheduling events beyond Super Tuesday, off guard.
Days before ending her campaign, Ms. Klobuchar continued to voice concerns about the possibility that Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, might run away with the nomination. At a fundraiser in Raleigh, N.C., last week, Ms. Klobuchar said she had ""trouble with a socialist leading the ticket.""
Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, dismissed the decision by Ms. Klobuchar and others to endorse Mr. Biden, saying, ""The establishment is nervous, not because we can't beat Trump but because we will.""
Ms. Klobuchar had focused her campaign on Iowa and appeared in all 99 counties in the state. She placed fifth in the caucuses but performed better than polling had indicated she would, and she followed it up with a debate performance in New Hampshire that caused
some voters to give her a second look
and helped her to come in a surprising third place there.
Ms. Klobuchar's campaign touted a $12 million fundraising haul in
the aftermath of the New Hampshire primary
and moved quickly to allocate resources to subsequent contests. But Ms. Klobuchar struggled to catch up with rivals in other key early contests and had only a scant presence on the ground in Nevada and South Carolina.
Still, Ms. Klobuchar hoped to prevail with voters who she said were ""caught between the extremes"" of the party.
Unlike some liberals, she campaigned against a single-payer health-care system and free college, arguing that the proposals were expensive and unrealistic. Instead, Ms. Klobuchar pushed for more incremental plans that would build on systems already in place.
She sparred fiercely with Mr. Buttigieg while competing in the centrist Democrat lane, leading to a series of cutting exchanges between the pair during recent debates.
When Mr. Buttigieg criticized her
record on immigration
at last month's debate in Las Vegas, Ms. Klobuchar retorted, ""I wish everyone was as perfect as you, Pete.""
The former rivals struck a friendlier tone upon exiting the race. Hours after Ms. Klobuchar dropped out, Mr. Buttigieg said he ""got to see firsthand the midwestern grit, determination and common sense that our country needs more of.""
""I am thankful for the spirit and humor she brought to this race, and I look forward to working with her to build the country we all deserve,""
Mr. Buttigieg tweeted Monday.

Ms. Klobuchar, like Mr. Buttigieg, struggled to break through with nonwhite voters—a key constituency in Nevada, South Carolina and states that vote in March.
Ms. Klobuchar was forced to cancel a rally in St. Louis Park, Minn., late Sunday after protesters chanting ""black lives matter"" occupied the stage where she was set to speak. The protest was sparked by renewed scrutiny over Ms. Klobuchar's role in prosecuting a black teenager over the 2002 killing of an 11-year-old girl.
An Associated Press investigation
found inconsistencies in the case.
Ms. Klobuchar was the first woman elected to the Senate from Minnesota and frequently spoke of how critical Midwest states like hers were to winning the presidency.
She easily won re-election to her Senate seat in 2018, after President Trump lost the state in 2016 by less than 2 percentage points. Ms. Klobuchar argued that her ability to win in Minnesota would make her a formidable candidate in other battlegrounds, such as Ohio, Michigan and Wisconsin, all of which went for Mr. Trump in 2016.
But her campaign faced early headwinds as a series of stories alleged that Ms. Klobuchar was a difficult boss who treated her staff poorly. For a period of time, she had the highest office turnover rate in the Senate.
Ms. Klobuchar acknowledged she could ""do better"" but largely defended herself against the allegations.
""If you are a boss, you have to have high standards, and that is what I have always had. And that doesn't mean it's a popularity contest all the time,"" she told CNN last year. ""And so I've had high standards for myself, high standards for our staff, and mostly I'm going to have high standards for the country.""
Ms. Klobuchar
announced her run for president
during a snowstorm in Minneapolis in February 2019. She frequently invoked the chilly day during her campaign as an illustration of her ability to power through adversity and take on Mr. Trump.
As Ms. Klobuchar's campaign neared its end, she warned Democrats that the increasingly combative tenor of the primary was working to Mr. Trump's advantage.
""If we spend the next four months tearing each other apart like this, we may spend the next four years watching Donald Trump tear the country apart,"" she said.

Michigan, a state that breathed life into the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign four years ago, delivered a punishing blow to his 2020 prospects as Joe Biden easily won the most closely watched primary among Tuesday's
six Democratic nominating contests
.
The Midwest industrial state was the biggest delegate prize on a day when Mr. Biden also scored wins in Mississippi, Missouri and Idaho. Mr. Sanders won in North Dakota, and Washington state hadn't been called as of early Wednesday.
Share Your Thoughts
How do you think the Democratic nominee will fare against President Trump in the Midwest in November? Join the conversation below.
The results, which raise questions about the viability of the Vermont senator's campaign, arrived after both candidates canceled election night events in Cleveland because of concerns about
the coronavirus epidemic
. Ohio hosts one of four March 17 primaries.
Mr. Sanders faces even tougher terrain as the race moves later this month to states that include Florida, Illinois and Georgia. Those delegate-rich states have large proportions of black voters and Mr. Biden, the vice president to America's first black president, has shown strength in winning their support.
Here are the key takeaways from Tuesday's voting and what they may mean for the race ahead:
Why Michigan Matters
The Michigan primary took on greater importance in the race for a variety of reasons.
There was history: Mr. Sanders scored an upset win there four years ago against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. That victory gave him momentum to keep fighting for the nomination all the way to the Democratic National Convention.
There was investment: In recent days, Mr. Sanders had shifted campaign time and money to Michigan in hopes of securing the sort of defining win Mr. Biden had in South Carolina's Feb. 29 primary.
And there was significance: Michigan is a top battleground for the general election, so Mr. Biden's victory provides ammunition for his argument that he's the party's best option to confront President Trump in the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin where a total of about 77,000 gave the Republican a winning Electoral College margin.
Black Voters Keep Helping Biden
African-Americans in South Carolina helped revive Mr. Biden's candidacy, and the Michigan results showed he can win northern black voters as well. Exit polls published by CNN showed him winning roughly two-thirds of that vote in Michigan and 70% in Missouri.
Wayne County, home to Detroit and a large share of Michigan's black population, backed Mr. Biden over Mr. Sanders, 54.5% to 35.8%. Turnout there was up almost 16% from the 2016 primary.
Such strong support could prove helpful to Mr. Biden in contests later this month in Illinois, Florida and Georgia. In 2016, the black share of the Democratic primary electorate in Georgia was 51%, while it was 28% in Illinois and 27% in Florida.
Hispanic voters continued to be a weak spot for Mr. Biden and a strength for Mr. Sanders. In Michigan, the senator won 55% of Hispanic voters, while the former vice president drew 37% from that demographic.
Suburban Voters Boost Biden
While Mr. Sanders has argued he's the candidate most capable of beating Mr. Trump because he would expand the Democratic electorate, that hasn't proved to be the case in primaries and caucuses held so far. Growth from the 2016 primaries has mostly been among older people, more moderate suburban residents and African-Americans.
The suburban Detroit vote in Oakland and Macomb counties leaned heavily in Mr. Biden's direction. Four years earlier, Mr. Sanders ran a close second in both counties.
Macomb, home of automotive plants and parts suppliers and mostly white union-member voters, is also considered a key county in the general election. Mr. Trump beat Mrs. Clinton there by more than 11 percentage points in 2016.
Michigan exit polls showed roughly two-thirds of the primary's voters live in suburban areas, and Mr. Biden won a narrow majority of that vote, compared with 40% for Mr. Sanders. Mr. Biden also won in the state's urban and rural areas.
In Ionia County east of Grand Rapids, Mr. Biden beat Mr. Sanders 52% to 38%. Four years earlier, Mr. Sanders had won the county by 30 percentage points.
Mr. Biden won a majority of the vote in all five regional areas tracked by the exit polls in Michigan, a stark contrast to four years ago when Mr. Sanders won 73 of the state's 83 counties.
Young Voters Don't Grow Their Vote Share
Mr. Sanders has tried hard to boost turnout among the young voters drawn to his candidacy from the start. But he has shown little success in doing so this year, at least as a share of the total electorate.
Among voters 18 to 24 years old in Michigan, Mr. Sanders dominated Mr. Biden, 79% to 18%. But their share of the total electorate was essentially unchanged from four years ago and not enough to overcome Mr. Biden's strength with other age groups.
Among those 65 and older in Michigan, Mr. Biden won almost three-quarters of the vote.
White Working-Class Voters Back Biden
Mr. Biden also performed well among Michigan's white, working-class voters. The former vice president beat Mr. Sanders 50% to 43% among whites with no college degree, a group that accounted for 37% of the electorate.
Should Mr. Biden win the Democratic nomination, those voters will be a key group in Michigan and other states because they were a source of strength for Mr. Trump in the 2016 election.
Among white men with no college degree, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders split the vote evenly.
Mr. Sanders beat Mr. Biden in Michigan by 7 percentage points among independent voters, who accounted for 29% of Democratic primary voters. But that was a much smaller share than four years earlier, when he won 71% of that group.

DES MOINES, Iowa—Pete Buttigieg pushed his supporters to ""astonish the political world"" at a field office Monday morning. Joe Biden brought boxes of pizza for his volunteers. And Andrew Yang, through bursts of laughter, told his backers to physically drag undecided Democrats to his side.
Meanwhile, three other top Democratic presidential contenders—Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar—were more than 1,000 miles away in Washington, D.C., for impeachment proceedings just hours before Iowans made their final decisions in
caucuses that marked the first 2020 nominating contest.

After nearly 60 Democratic presidential-campaign events across the state over the past three days alone—in breweries, high-school gyms, coffee shops and arenas—it was
decision time Monday
for many still-undecided Democrats. Though the big rallies were over, campaign volunteers were using the last few hours to make the case for their candidates through door knocks, calls and texts.
At a West Des Moines field office for Mr. Buttigieg, organizers were trading advice on how to win over caucus-goers who were still mulling their choices.
Anthony Elarth, a training captain for the 38-year-old former South Bend, Ind., mayor's campaign, told volunteers to reinforce the need for ""a new generation of leadership.""
Mr. Buttigieg urged Mr. Elarth and others in the packed office to imagine ""that famous day the sun comes up and Donald Trump is no longer president,"" as he frequently tells crowds at his campaign events.
""I'm looking to you and I'm counting on you to put us over the top,"" he told his supporters in the office.
Richard Rarick, a retired architect from Des Moines, was one of the undecided Democrats who said he would make his final pick at the caucus site. Mr. Rarick, who stopped by Mr. Buttigieg's field office Monday, said he liked that the former mayor was ""young, enthusiastic and motivated,"" but added that he was leaning toward Mr. Sanders.

What to Watch

* The caucuses started at 7 p.m. local time (8 EST). The outcome will depend on many variables, including second choices.
* Candidates that don't reach a 15% threshold of voters in the first round of balloting will be deemed not viable in that precinct. Their supporters are then free to move to a new candidate in the second and final round.
* The Associated Press will call the race according to the results of the state delegate equivalents based on the second round.
* A winner could be declared by 11 p.m. EST.
Carrying boxes of pizza, Mr. Biden rode his campaign bus to a field office in Des Moines, where a sign posted to the front door declared, ""It's game time! Let's get Joe elected!""
""I'm feeling good about today,"" the former vice president told a group of volunteers and campaign workers, as he thanked them for their work. ""We gotta get folks out.""
Inside the office, Mr. Biden, who was joined by his wife, Jill, and some of his grandchildren, wore his trademark aviator sunglasses that have become a logo for his campaign. Paper cutouts of the sunglasses with ""2020"" in the lenses are often plastered on walls at his events.

Still in the Senate for impeachment proceedings, the senators in the presidential race weren't expected to return to Iowa until Monday evening. But Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, hosted a virtual town hall by telephone—also known as a ""tele town hall""—from Washington. More than 50,000 callers joined, according to a campaign aide.
Before heading to Washington Sunday night, Ms. Klobuchar, of Minnesota, and Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, stopped by Super Bowl watch parties to motivate their supporters one more time.
Mr. Sanders, who was in an unusually cheerful mood during the final campaigning sprint, joked with supporters, who wore campaign stickers and waved signs. He thanked them for their ""hospitality and for the seriousness in which the people of this state accept their responsibility as the first people who will be voting in the 2020 election.""
A few miles away, Ms. Klobuchar told her supporters—some of whom wore circular, bright green earrings with ""Amy"" on them—to ""double down"" on her behalf while she is at work in the Senate. Some of her backers sported T-shirts that listed Ms. Klobuchar's electability argument on the back and carried signs with her campaign slogan, ""Win Big.""
""I'm asking you to run for me, just like those guys running down the field,"" the senator said at a barbecue restaurant with the football game playing on TV screens in the background.
""I'm asking you to take this over the goal post for me.""

WASHINGTON—President Trump is expected to release a $4.8 trillion budget Monday that charts a path for a potential second term, proposing steep reductions in social-safety-net programs and foreign aid and higher outlays for defense and veterans.
The plan would increase military spending 0.3%, to $740.5 billion for fiscal year 2021, which begins Oct. 1, according to a senior administration official. The proposal would lower nondefense spending by 5%, to $590 billion, below the level Congress and the president agreed to in a two-year budget deal last summer.
A White House budget reflects an administration's priorities in spending negotiations for the next fiscal year. This year, the budget proposal also reveals Mr. Trump's fiscal policy objectives should he win re-election, and his campaign messaging will likely reflect it.
The proposal is unlikely to become law, however, as Democrats control the House and spending bills in the GOP-led Senate need bipartisan support. Democrats signaled their opposition later Sunday to the administration's budget plan, which Rep. John Yarmuth (D., Ky.), chairman of the House Budget Committee, called ""destructive and irrational.""
Mr. Yarmuth criticized Mr. Trump's proposal as targeting ""programs that help Americans make ends meet—all while extending his tax cuts for millionaires and wealthy corporations,"" he said in a statement, adding that ""Congress will stand firm against this President's broken promises.""
Budget analysts expect lawmakers to punt final decisions on 2021 spending until after the November election, and instead fund the government with temporary spending measures for the first few months of the fiscal year.
NASA
would see a 12% increase next year
under Mr. Trump's proposal as he seeks to fulfill his goal of returning astronauts to the moon by 2024. On the other hand, the Environmental Protection Agency's spending would be slashed by 26%.
The plan
would request $2 billion in new funding
for construction of the wall on the southern U.S. border, the senior administration official said—Mr. Trump's signature 2016 campaign promise that sparked fights with Democrats, leading the president to trigger a
historic five-week government shutdown
last winter after lawmakers refused to fund the project. The latest $2 billion request is less than the $5 billion the administration sought last year.
The White House proposes to cut spending by $4.4 trillion over a decade. Of that, it targets $2 trillion in savings from mandatory spending programs, including $130 billion from changes to Medicare prescription-drug pricing, $292 billion from safety-net cuts—such as work requirements for Medicaid and
food stamps
—and $70 billion from tightening eligibility access to disability benefits.
The budget would lower future spending from where it would be under current policy. A senior administration official said government spending will continue to rise, but not as much as it would under current policy.
In campaigning for the White House Mr. Trump had promised voters he would protect funding for Medicare and Medicaid. His new budget's proposals to find savings through changes to those programs reflect longstanding GOP efforts to reduce federal safety-net spending, and come the week after
all but one Republican senator voted to acquit
the president of impeachment charges passed by House Democrats.
The budget plan assumes the $1.5 trillion tax-cut package enacted in 2017, set to expire by 2025, is extended, and projects revenues in line with last year's proposal. It also expects economic growth will be faster than most economists predict if the president's policies are implemented. After a brief pickup in 2018, growth last year settled back to the roughly 2% pace that has prevailed during the decade since the recession ended, where many economists expect it to remain. At the same time,
unemployment has fallen
close to a 50-year low.
The White House projects the economy will grow 3.1% in the fourth quarter of 2020 compared with a year earlier, and 3% in 2021, and that it will continue to expand at that pace for the rest of the decade. But the administration expects year-over-year growth—comparing total GDP for the year—to be slightly lower in 2020 than it forecast last year, the senior administration official said.
The federal budget deficit would shrink to $966 billion next year from an
estimated $1 trillion in 2020
, but more than twice what Mr. Trump projected in his first budget proposal in 2017. The administration forecasts total deficits over the next decade would shrink $4.6 trillion under its plan, and annual deficits would be eliminated by 2035. During his 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump
discussed
paying off the federal debt within eight years.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Are you surprised by any of the proposals in the Trump administration's 2020 budget plan? Join the conversation below.
Though Trump budget officials have pushed for spending cuts to reduce deficits, the president has reached two agreements with congressional Democrats to boost spending above limits set in 2011.
Meanwhile, tax cuts enacted in 2017 have reduced government revenues as a share of economic output, pushing deficits as a share of GDP to 4.7%, well above the 2.7% average over the past 50 years.
The administration forecasts the 10-year Treasury yield, which reflects the cost of government borrowing to finance the deficit, will average 2% in 2020 and rise gradually over the next decade, well below the rates forecast in last year's budget. The change reduces projected net interest costs by $600 billion over the next decade.
Under Mr. Trump's plan the budget of the Department of Veterans Affairs would rise 13% next year, and the Department of Homeland Security's 3%. The National Nuclear Security Administration's budget would get a 19% boost.
The Department of Housing and Urban Development's budget would be cut by 15%, although the proposal includes $2.8 billion in homelessness assistance grants. Mr. Trump has repeatedly
criticized Democratic-led cities
, saying they have failed to address homelessness.
The Commerce Department's budget would be reduced by 37% from 2020, but officials said much of that cut can be attributed to the completion of the census. Foreign aid would be slashed by 21%.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would see its budget decline 9%, but with the coronavirus sparking global panic, $4.3 billion in funding for fighting infectious diseases would be preserved.

Separately, the administration has notified Capitol Hill that it might reprogram $136 million in funds from fiscal year 2020 to address the virus, the administration official said, though no decision has been made on whether the money is needed.
The budget also proposes moving the U.S. Secret Service from DHS to the Treasury Department, in a win for Mr. Mnuchin, who has pushed for such a move. The change would require congressional approval.
Security assistance to Ukraine would remain at current levels following Mr. Trump's decision last summer to suspend congressionally approved aid as he pushed the country to investigate 2020 Democratic candidate Joe Biden, an episode at the center of the impeachment saga.
The budget eliminates funding for the Yucca Mountain Nuclear Waste Repository in Nevada. Mr. Trump has said he hopes to work with state politicians, who widely oppose the repository, on an alternative. Nevada is a battleground state in the coming presidential election.

Glitches to a mobile app and a backup phone-in plan for reporting results in Iowa's Democratic presidential caucuses delayed the outcome and heightened concerns about the integrity of the voting process in the 2020 elections.
After Monday night's failure, some Democratic Party officials in the 1,700-plus caucus sites complained about the rollout and difficulties in downloading and using the app. Some said a final version was only made available this past weekend. Still, others said that when they tried to phone results to party leaders, they were put on hold or disconnected.
The faulty kickoff led Democratic candidates to express frustration. Nevada's State Democratic Party, which holds its caucuses later this month, said it wouldn't use the app that malfunctioned in Iowa.
The Iowa Democratic Party chairman, Troy Price, said no cyber intrusion occurred and paper records ensure that results data are accurate. While the data were collected accurately by the app, he said, an underlying coding error that affected how figures were reported was found and fixed.
""We took the steps we felt was necessary, but we found a coding error last night once we discovered some irregularities,"" Mr. Price said during an afternoon press conference shortly before partial results were released. Apologizing for the problems, Mr. Price promised a full, transparent investigation. ""What happened last night was simply unacceptable.""
The debacle in Iowa's first-in-the-nation nominating contest threatened to shake voter confidence in the electoral process at the start of the 2020 voting season, election and cybersecurity experts said.
""The big risk is that disruptions and uncertainty like this will be exploited to discourage people from voting,"" said Matt Blaze, an election security expert and professor of computer science at Georgetown University.
The app at the center of the controversy was built by a small Washington, D.C.-based company Shadow Inc., the tech arm of a nonprofit progressive digital strategy firm Acronym. State records show that the Iowa Democratic Party paid Shadow a little more than $63,000 in two installments in November and December.
Shadow, in a series of tweets, apologized on Tuesday for the app's performance and said the company ""worked as quickly as possible overnight to resolve this issue.""
Cybersecurity experts and U.S. election security officials said that while no hacking or other foul play had been detected, the app hadn't been security tested or vetted for statewide use -- something Mr. Price disputed.
""Our Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency had offered to test the app,"" Chad Wolf, the acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said Tuesday on ""Fox & Friends,"" the Fox network's flagship morning program. ""They declined."" Mr. Price said he wasn't aware of any offer.
Some Democratic campaigns, including those of former Vice President Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, have used a Shadow-built app to send text messages to supporters and solicit donations, according to federal campaign expense records and people familiar with the matter. The Biden campaign halted its use of that app amid concerns about its reliability.
""Our campaign used Shadow only once and on a very small scale, for sending text messages to voters about our campaign kickoff in Philadelphia,"" a Biden aide told The Wall Street Journal. ""Our IT team expressed security concerns about it, and it ultimately did not pass our cybersecurity checklist, so we declined to use it again.""
In Iowa, the confusion over the app fueled intraparty squabbling among Democrats.
Trump campaign officials also seemed to touch on Democratic divisions, questioning whether the app problems and the Iowa party's checking of the data were designed to favor a particular candidate. ""Quality control = rigged?"" tweeted Brad Parscale, manager for President Trump's re-election campaign.
Acronym distanced itself from Shadow, saying in statements that it is one of a number of investors in the company and that the two ""are distinct organizations, with separate teams of employees."" Acronym said it wasn't involved in the development of the app or in Shadow's work with the Iowa Democratic Party.
Last year, Acronym Chief Executive Tara McGowan said the company was launching Shadow as part of an acquisition of a political customer-relationship management tool.
Acronym is led by Ms. McGowan, a Democratic political strategist, and has several related arms, including a political-action committee with a roughly $75 million advertising budget to target voters in swing states. She is married to a senior aide in Mr. Buttigieg's campaign, a connection that earned widespread attention on social media.
Mr. Buttigieg's campaign ""didn't have anything to do with the design of the app,"" a Buttigieg aide said, while adding the campaign's contract with the firm predates that of the Iowa Democratic Party.
Until Monday night, party officials declined to identify the app's developer. The office of Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) asked the Democratic National Committee three times about details regarding the app during the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses, but received no reply, an aide to the senator said.
Problems with the Shadow app surfaced Monday in Iowa before voting started, with some precinct leaders saying they had trouble downloading or logging onto the app. The Iowa Democratic Party said the reported issues were mainly from areas with poor cell service or involved minor user errors that were being resolved.
Some precinct officials in rural areas didn't know about the app until a few weeks ago, received no training and decided not to use it, said Tracy Freese, chair of the Democratic Party in Grundy County, who also serves as a precinct chair. She opted to call in results, as she did for previous caucuses.
The app was intended to help the precinct chairs record the results from each round of voting and take care of the calculations to apportion delegates. Then the precinct chair was supposed to use the app to send the results to the Iowa Democratic Party.

Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg faced a barrage of attacks as he joined Democrats for the first time in a fiery presidential debate that saw all the candidates on stage launching shots at one another.
Within minutes of the start of the ninth debate of this election cycle, held in Las Vegas just three days before Nevada's caucuses, Mr. Bloomberg began facing criticism from nearly a half-dozen rivals for his record on criminal justice. The other candidates also brought up his prior comments about women in an effort to cast the New York billionaire as no different than President Trump.
""I'd like to talk about who we're running against -- a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians, and no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump, I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg,"" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said. ""Democrats are not going to win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, of harassing women, and of supporting racist policies like red-lining and stop-and-frisk.""
The attacks on Mr. Bloomberg came as the billionaire, who launched his candidacy in November and has run a torrent of advertising, has gained traction in national polls. Having bypassed all the early states, he has focused on the March 3 Super Tuesday contests and is hoping to roil a largely unsettled race that has Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in a double-digit lead in national polling but no one yet to emerge as the decisive front-runner among the centrist candidates.
In response to the criticism of him, Mr. Bloomberg apologized for the stop-and-frisk policing practice -- in which police officers were given wide latitude to stop people whom they suspected of criminal behavior and which mainly affected racial minorities -- saying it ""got out of control"" and is one thing he was embarrassed about from his time as mayor. A federal judge ruled in 2013 that the policy was carried out in an unconstitutional manner.
That response proved insufficient for Mr. Bloomberg's opponents. ""It's not whether he apologized or not, it's the policy,"" said former Vice President Joe Biden, a longtime front-runner who has slipped in polls just as Mr. Bloomberg has risen. ""The policy was abhorrent. And it was . . . a violation of every right people have.""
Ms. Warren, who was looking for a breakout moment after failing to collect any delegates in New Hampshire, came out swinging in a debate that saw her land several punches and demonstrate a rare willingness to confront her opponents over health care and other issues.
Mr. Bloomberg wasn't alone in facing the heat. Rifts quickly ripped open between Mr. Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, the top delegate-earners in the race so far, after their strong showings in Iowa and New Hampshire. Mr. Buttigieg, until recently the mayor of South Bend, Ind., warned that a two-person race between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bloomberg would feature ""the two most polarizing figures on this stage.""
""We've got to wake up as a party,"" he said. ""Let's put forward someone who's actually a Democrat,"" he said, a dig at both Mr. Bloomberg, a former Republican, and Mr. Sanders, who was elected as an independent but caucuses with Democrats in the Senate.
Mr. Sanders responded by saying: ""If speaking to the needs and the pain of a long-neglected working class is polarizing, I think you got the wrong word.""
Refusing to back down, Mr. Buttigieg brought up a feud between the Vermont senator's supporters and a powerful Nevada culinary union in Nevada over his signature Medicare for All proposal. The union complained it had been harassed by Mr. Sanders's supporters online after arguing his proposal for health care would be less generous than health benefits for which they had bargained.
Mr. Sanders disavowed any of his supporters who attacked the union, saying: ""If there are a few people who make ugly remarks, who attack trade union leaders, I disown those people. They are not part of our movement.""
Mr. Sanders's polling lead has stirred increasing concern among establishment Democrats who believe a more centrist candidate could be stronger in the general election. There has been less polling in Nevada than in Iowa and New Hampshire, but pre-caucus surveys show Mr. Sanders ahead.
Tensions also rose between Mr. Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who are competing for the party's center lane and who engaged in a series of testy, often personal exchanges.
After Ms. Klobuchar pushed for a comprehensive immigration overhaul, Mr. Buttigieg interjected to attack her record, including her vote in 2007 to make English the official language of the U.S.
""You voted to confirm the head of Customs and Border Protection under Trump, who was one of the architects of the family-separation policy. You voted to make English the national language,"" Mr. Buttigieg said. ""Do you know the message that sends?""
""I wish everyone was as perfect as you, Pete,"" Ms. Klobuchar retorted. ""In fact, I have opposed and not supported two-thirds of the Trump judges. So get your numbers right.""
Still, Mr. Bloomberg, who has poured more than $400 million into his campaign and been accused by the rest of the field of trying to buy the election, took the most hits. In addition to criticism of his policies during his dozen years as mayor, Mr. Bloomberg weathered attacks from his rivals over accusations that his financial-data and media company was a hostile workplace for women.
Mr. Bloomberg dismissed calls from his opponents to release from nondisclosure agreements women who have sued his company and who have said he made crude remarks to them or otherwise alleged discrimination. He played down the claims: ""None of them accuse me of doing anything, other than maybe they didn't like a joke I told.""
""We're not going to end these agreements because they were made consensually,"" Mr. Bloomberg added, prompting groans from the crowd. ""They have every right to expect that they will stay private.""
Ms. Warren flatly rejected Mr. Bloomberg's response regarding nondisclosure agreements.
""I hope you heard his defense: 'I've been nice to some women.' That just doesn't cut it,"" she said.

ALLENDALE, S.C. -- If South Carolina is former Vice President Joe Biden's firewall against Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primary race, interviews with black voters here indicate some cracks have formed.
Most of nearly two dozen likely voters who discussed their plans for Saturday's primary said they were trying to decide between Mr. Biden, who has long benefited from strong support from African-Americans, and billionaire Tom Steyer, who has campaigned heavily in the state.
Allendale County, tucked along the Georgia border away from the cities candidates typically focus on, carries symbolic weight in the first 2020 primary where black voters will play a significant role: It has the state's highest proportion of nonwhite voters, a Wall Street Journal analysis of state data found.
""I feel very strongly about Joe Biden, but he's making me nervous right now,"" said Lottie Lewis, a town council member here.
Polling averages in the state show Mr. Biden leading, followed by Mr. Sanders and Mr. Steyer.
South Carolina is critical for Mr. Biden. He has decadeslong ties to the state and needs a win to brighten his campaign narrative after poor showings in nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire and a second-place finish in Nevada. His once-dominant lead in South Carolina polls has narrowed, and Mr. Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist from Vermont, has intensified his campaign in the state this week.
In Tuesday night's debate in Charleston, Mr. Biden showed no hesitation when asked whether he would win Saturday. ""I will win South Carolina,"" he said. On Wednesday, Mr. Biden secured the important endorsement of Rep. James Clyburn, the most influential Democrat in the state.
But Mr. Sanders has momentum after victories in Nevada and New Hampshire and a split decision in Iowa with Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind. Only one voter interviewed here mentioned Mr. Buttigieg as someone they were thinking about backing on Saturday.
Mr. Buttigieg was among the few candidates who visited Allendale County, which is an hour or more from the state's major population centers.
In recent weeks, Mr. Steyer has largely had South Carolina to himself. Most of the other candidates focused more on Nevada, New Hampshire and some of the 14 states that host contests March 3. Mr. Steyer has spent more in the state on advertising than any other 2020 candidate, at $22.4 million, according to data from advertising tracker Kantar/CMAG.
Nate Hartley, a retired information technology manager who remains undecided, said he was intrigued. ""Tom Steyer has hit really hard here,"" he said. ""Every week, I get some kind of contact from him.""
Mr. Hartley said he didn't see Mr. Biden ""pulling back up from where he is"" in the race and thought Mr. Sanders was too progressive.
Patricia Johnson, a retired elementary school teacher, said she already had voted via an absentee ballot for Mr. Steyer. She said she did so, in part, because of Mr. Steyer's wealth and his potential ability to compete against President Trump in a general election. ""We all know money talks,"" she said. ""He could match Trump dollar for dollar on advertising.""
In an interview, Mr. Steyer said he thought he was in second or third place in South Carolina and moving up. He attributed his success with black voters to his focus on racial issues and spending more time in South Carolina than any other candidate.
""I deal explicitly with race,"" he said. ""I have a decadeslong history of working with people in the African-American community and Latino community, and actually taking part when it had nothing to do with me running for president.""
Clifford Smith, a pig farmer, said he was originally a supporter of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts before switching to Mr. Biden. He is concerned, however, about the former vice president's lackluster performance on the campaign trail. ""I don't know what his problem is,"" he said. ""It was his to lose and he's losing it.""

WASHINGTON—House Democratic impeachment managers filed their first documents in the coming Senate trial, outlining how they plan to make the case for removing President Trump from office.

The Democrats' 111-page document, filed on Saturday
, outlines the case the seven impeachment managers plan to present to senators when the trial begins on Tuesday. In the filing, House Democrats tell senators, who serve as jurors in the trial, to follow the Constitution and ""rise above partisan differences"" as they hear the case.
""President Trump abused the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in our elections for his own personal political gain, thereby jeopardizing our national security, the integrity of our elections, and our democracy,"" the impeachment managers said in a statement.
The Democratic-led House approved
two articles of impeachment
against Mr. Trump last month. The first article of impeachment stems from Mr. Trump
pressing Ukraine to investigate
former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination,
including by withholding almost $400 million in aid
to help Kyiv combat Russian aggression. The second article accuses Mr. Trump of impeding Congress's investigation by preventing witnesses from testifying and defying subpoenas for documentary evidence.
The president denies the accusations and says the transcripts from calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky show he did nothing wrong.
The president's legal team, in a
response posted on Saturday
, called the House impeachment articles ""a brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election and interfere with the 2020 election"" and said the articles fail to allege any crime or violation.
Democrats counter that impeachment doesn't have to include a crime, and say abuse of power is an impeachable offense, according to an aide working on the inquiry.
Mr. Trump
finalized his legal team
for the Senate impeachment trial on Friday, choosing a group of attorneys with wide name recognition and TV experience, including constitutional-law professor Alan Dershowitz and former Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. The White House must formally respond to the House Democrats' brief by midday Monday.
House Democrats plan to allege the president interfered in the 2020 election by seeking investigations against his political rivals, and argue that senators are responsible for removing the resulting threat to national security.
""The Constitution provides a remedy when the President commits such serious abuses of his office: impeachment and removal,"" the Democrats wrote. ""The Senate must use that remedy now to safeguard the 2020 U.S. election, protect our constitutional form of government, and eliminate the threat that the President poses to America's national security.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How would you respond to the impeachment trial brief from the White House's perspective? Join the conversation below.
Most of the material that the Democrats plan to use to make their case is already known. The brief does show that Democrats plan to cite documents released after the House voted to impeach the president. The brief cites documents released by Lev Parnas, an associate of Rudy Giuliani, and the decision announced last Thursday by the Government Accountability Office that the Trump administration didn't have the legal authority to put on hold millions of dollars in security assistance to Ukraine last summer.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) hasn't outlined how the trial will be structured, though he has said it would be similar to the procedures adopted for former President Bill Clinton. Mr. McConnell would need a simple majority of the Senate to pass rules for the trial, and with 53 Republican senators, he doesn't need bipartisan support.
While some GOP senators have said they would be open to hearing new witnesses, Senate Republicans are in agreement to delay a vote on witnesses until after the trial begins, according to people familiar with the plans. The White House doesn't believe there is a need to hear witness testimony in the Senate trial, a senior administration official said.
Democrats are seeking to introduce new witnesses and documents to make their case.
Democrats want to hear
from former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who were directed by the White House not to testify before the House inquiry.

WASHINGTON—Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are arguing about Mr. Biden's position on Social Security. Elizabeth Warren confronted Mr. Sanders over whether he told her a woman couldn't be elected president. Ms. Warren and Pete Buttigieg have sniped at each other over fundraising.
But there is no sign of the enmity—shown online and in debates in recent months—in the Democratic presidential campaign that is playing out on Iowa TV screens. In a barrage of 85 different ads that have aired more than 72,000 times in the past two months on local television, no Democrat has even mentioned a primary rival by name, a Wall Street Journal review found.
Instead, the candidates and political groups backing them have trained their collective fire on President Trump and talked about health care, corruption and their ability to unite the country and win in November's general election, according to the Journal's analysis.
""They're not too mean yet,"" Ellen Kay, 57, said of the ads she's seen on television from her home in Mason City, where she works at a credit union. ""I'm hoping they keep it clean and stick to the issues,"" added Ms. Kay, who spoke to the Journal at a Biden event this week but is also considering supporting Sen. Amy Klobuchar.
With a little more than a week before the Feb. 3 caucuses, the Democrats in the race and outside groups supporting them have poured more than $65 million into Iowa TV and radio ads since the beginning of last year, according to political ad tracker Kantar/CMAG. More than half of that spending has occurred since late November as the candidates make their closing arguments to voters in what has consistently been a close race.
Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator and two-time presidential candidate, and Mr. Biden, the former vice president and three-time presidential candidate, have led most recent Iowa polls, with Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts senator, and Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., close behind them.
Tom Steyer, a billionaire self-funding his presidential campaign, has put about $15 million into Iowa ads, but recently better-polling candidates have been matching or exceeding his weekly spending, according to Kantar/CMAG. Messrs. Sanders and Buttigieg each have spent more than $9.5 million on Iowa ads, followed by the combined efforts of Mr. Biden and Unite the Country, a super political-action committee supporting him, at about $7.7 million.
Entrepreneur Andrew Yang has also poured more than $6 million into the state and aired more than 1,000 spots a week since late November. But that hasn't resulted in a bump in polling.
Overall, hundreds of Democratic TV ads are airing in Iowa each day, according to Kantar/CMAG. On Monday, for example, more than 530 aired in Cedar Rapids alone.
Anti-Trump messages appear in more Democratic ads than any other theme, Kantar/CMAG data show. Over the past two months, more than 25,000 such spots have aired, many of them saying the president is dangerous and unfit for office. If Mr. Trump is re-elected, Mr. Biden says in one of his campaign ads, ""he will forever and fundamentally alter the character of this nation.""

.
Ahead of the 2016 Iowa contest, there were about a dozen Republicans in the race, about the same number as the Democratic field has this year. But the Republicans that year were much more willing to attack each other in messages to Iowa voters, with negative ads popping up
from Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas
and the numerous
well-funded super PACs
involved in that race.
Democratic candidates, wary of turning off voters whose support might shift during the caucusing process, have instead tried to implicitly distance themselves from rivals.
In a heavily aired spot that made its debut earlier this month, Mr. Sanders invokes President Kennedy's speech about how Americans try to do things such as go to the moon ""not because they are easy but because they are hard.""
Mr. Sanders says that while ""other candidates"" may say it is impossible to combat climate change, make health care and college affordable and create world peace, ""remember, America is best when we strive to do big things, even when it's hard.""
Health care—the second-most common issue mentioned by Democratic candidates in ads after opposition to Mr. Trump—appears prominently in at least one heavily aired ad by Messrs. Sanders, Biden and Buttigieg.
One of Mr. Sanders's most frequently aired ads opens with people standing at a gravestone of a 22-year-old. Mr. Sanders narrates, ""There are people who are dying in America because they cannot afford the outrageous cost of prescription drugs in this country. And we have a government that does nothing about it because this government is owned by the pharmaceutical industry.""
Both Messrs. Biden and Buttigieg have ads that implicitly criticize their opponents who are advocating for Medicare for All.
""Medicare for All Who Want It can work in a way that creates that public alternative, gets everybody covered,"" Mr. Buttigieg says in an ad that began airing in early December. ""But unlike the Medicare for All plan, it doesn't dictate that to the American people and risk further polarizing them.""
And Mr. Biden takes a shot at Mr. Trump for trying to tear down Obamacare while touting his own relationship with Mr. Obama. ""If you want to build on Obamacare, trust Joe Biden,"" a deep-voiced narrator says. ""After all, he and President Obama passed it in the first place.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What is the most memorable ad you have seen this year? Join the conversation below.
Only Ms. Warren has no Iowa commercials that include her stance on health care, which proved a tricky topic for her in the fall. While she, like Mr. Sanders, has advocated for Medicare for All, she took heat from the rest of the 2020 field for months for declining to outline how she'd pay for it—unlike Mr. Sanders, who had long said the middle class would pay more in taxes. Ms. Warren eventually said she would fund the expansion of government insurance through tax hikes on the wealthy and corporations, rather than the middle class.
Instead, Ms. Warren says in most of her ads that wealthy people and big corporations are ruining the country and that she would strive to tackle that as president.
Jay Newell, an Iowa State University professor who studies advertising, said Iowans tend to be highly engaged in politics, decreasing the impact of TV ads while inflating the value of candidates being out on the trail, talking to voters. ""You have to do some,"" he said of TV ads. ""But it doesn't get the job done.""
That is the case for Paul Willis, 75, a farmer from Thornton, Iowa, who said he is constantly seeing political ads on TV and getting bombarded with mailers.
""When you can meet people in person, the ads are secondary,"" he said.

WASHINGTON—Gov. Andrew Cuomo said he doesn't believe U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders is the best Democratic candidate to beat President Trump and said it is too early to determine who the party's standard-bearer should be.
Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat in his third term as governor, said he believed Mr. Sanders's identification as a democratic socialist would be a liability in a general election challenge, calling the label ""a big pill for a lot of voters to swallow.""
And despite
earlier praise
for former Vice President Joe Biden, Mr. Cuomo during an interview this weekend stopped short of saying he was the best candidate for the nomination. Mr. Biden finished fourth in
last week's Iowa caucuses
; Mr. Sanders and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg are
in a close contest
for first place.
""It's Iowa and New Hampshire, right? Let's get some other states that are more representative, and then let's have a conversation,"" Mr. Cuomo said Saturday, declining to pick a favorite presidential candidate as he snacked on mixed nuts. ""It's early yet. We'll see what happens.""
New York won't hold its presidential primary until April 28. Progressive groups and legislators who back Mr. Sanders have long been wary of Mr. Cuomo. They include two women who challenged the governor in Democratic primaries—Zephyr Teachout and Cynthia Nixon—as well as legislators who have pushed the governor on tax and housing policy.
Assemblyman Phil Steck, a Democrat from suburban Albany, has endorsed Mr. Sanders and said the Vermont senator would inspire turnout key for a Democratic victory around the country.
""The neoliberal economic policies of conservative Democrats have left many voters dispirited,"" Mr. Steck said.
Mr. Cuomo weighed in on the national contest during a rare trip to Washington, D.C., for the annual winter meeting of the National Governors Association. The governor hasn't spent much time traveling the country or visiting its capital in the same way as other politicians seeking to build a national brand.
Instead, national affairs have increasingly found him. The Department of Homeland Security announced late Wednesday that it is restricting New Yorkers' ability
to enroll in trusted-traveler programs
like Global Entry because of restrictions on sharing driver's license information with federal immigration authorities.
Mr. Cuomo called the move political and sought a White House meeting while in Washington to discuss the issue. The governor said Mr. Trump didn't schedule any confab; Mr. Trump
said on Twitter
that Mr. Cuomo had canceled the meeting and said officials in New York are ""very hard to work with."" Mr. Cuomo
tweeted back
that the president's message was ""#FakeNews.""
The governor said that he reached the president by phone on Sunday, and that Mr. Trump said he would be in touch on Monday to schedule a meeting. According to Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Trump said his tweet referenced Mr. Cuomo's decision to skip a Sunday evening White House dinner for all the nation's governors.
Mr. Cuomo said the purpose of his trip wasn't partisan fighting, but building relationships with neighboring governors. He sat through a panel discussion about private funding for infrastructure programs and a presentation by the leaders of several Canadian provinces.
Later this year, he will become the NGA chair, and he gave a speech about how tangible accomplishments will rekindle public trust in government. It was a variation on a speech he has given for years, and in the interview he said he had accomplished many things in New York—a $15 minimum wage, expanded scholarships to public colleges, paid family leave—that Mr. Sanders is proposing.
So I asked Mr. Cuomo about the possibility of Mr. Sanders winning the Democratic nomination, but losing to Mr. Trump in the general election. Would that open a lane for him to run in 2024?
""You have to start with the premise, Cuomo wants to run for president,"" Mr. Cuomo said. ""Maybe you could have a better public purpose over here. Maybe. But I know where I am now. I believe where I am now. I'm doing good, and that's enough.""
THE QUESTION: Who were the last Republican and Democratic New York governors to win their party's presidential nomination, but lose the general election?
—Know the answer? Leave a comment!
THE LAST ANSWER: The original Pennsylvania Station was designed by the architectural firm of McKim, Mead & White.

WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Tuesday denied requests to quickly decide the fate of the Affordable Care Act, a move that is likely to make the health-care law play less of a role in the 2020 election.
A group of 20 Democratic-led states and the U.S. House of Representatives had asked the court to fast-track their appeals so that the latest legal battle over the Obama-era law could be resolved by the end of June.
The justices denied those requests in a one-sentence order with no dissents noted. The move likely means that any court consideration of the ACA won't happen until the fall at the earliest, with any decision likely coming after Election Day.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you think the Supreme Court's failure to take action on the ACA before the election will play out with candidates and with voters? Join the conversation below.
The Supreme Court has twice upheld the ACA. Had the court issued another ruling this summer, it could have placed the issue at the center of the election and put pressure on President Trump and other Republicans, no matter the outcome.
The latest case stems from a lawsuit brought by Republican-led states and backed by the Trump administration that
challenged the law's insurance mandate
. Mr. Trump has pledged to repeal the ACA and has long promised to release his own health plan.
Last week, Mr. Trump claimed he had saved coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, but his Justice Department has argued for the invalidation of that provision in the current litigation.
The Supreme Court's move on Tuesday comes after a New Orleans-based federal appeals court
ruled last month
that a central feature of the ACA was unconstitutional. That part of the law required most individuals to carry health insurance or pay a penalty. The appeals court declined to say whether any, some or all other parts of the law remain enforceable without the mandate, leaving the federal health-policy regime in legal limbo.
The law continues to remain in effect during the litigation, which began after a GOP-controlled Congress reduced the penalty under the insurance mandate to $0. The GOP-led states argued the elimination of the tax rendered the mandate unconstitutional.
The appeals court has ordered a federal judge in Texas to reconsider what parts of the sprawling health law can remain in place, but the Democratic-led states and House were seeking to have the Supreme Court go ahead and rule that the entire law remains valid.
The timing of the appeals court ruling, after more than five months of deliberations, put the law's defenders in a bind, because it made it difficult to squeeze the case onto the Supreme Court's current calendar, which likely filled up last week.
The House and the Democratic states floated the possibility of a special argument session in May, but the court rarely agrees to place additional days for arguments on its schedule. The justices seemed even less likely to do so this time because they already have an unusually long list of blockbuster cases to decide before the end of June, including ones on abortion, gay rights, gun rights and immigration.
The Trump administration argued against expedited Supreme Court consideration of the case, saying in a court brief that there were no exigencies that required it.
Democratic presidential candidates including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg have all criticized President Trump as a threat to health coverage and the ACA, and a number have cited the administration's support for the lawsuit as evidence.
Judd Deere, a spokesman for the White House, said on Tuesday: ""While radical Democrats propose plans that would destroy the health insurance of millions of Americans, President Trump continues to work to improve health care more broadly, including creating a system that protects the vulnerable and those with pre-existing conditions, and delivers the affordability Americans need, the choice and control they want, and the quality they deserve.""
About half of Americans now approve of the ACA, according to Gallup, up slightly from 48% in fall of 2018.
The court's decision leaves uncertainty hanging over health care. Hospital groups have said the lack of clarity on the long-term status of the ACA is complicating decisions on investments, and patient groups have said consumers are concerned they could lose health-care coverage if the law is struck down.
""The court's decision today leaves the fate of tens of millions of people who could lose health coverage protections for pre-existing health conditions, and access to treatment for substance use disorders and mental health, maternal care, and more, up in the air,"" said Emily Stewart, executive director of Community Catalyst, a consumer advocacy group.

The Senate impeachment trial headed into the
question-and-answer period
Wednesday, after six days of arguments from House impeachment managers and President Trump's defense team. Here is a look at where things stand and what comes next.

(Follow our live updates and analysis of the impeachment trial. »)

1. Debate Over Rules
After the House sent over the articles of impeachment, the Senate trial began in earnest with a debate over the rules of the trial. After
hours of votes on Democratic amendments
that were defeated, the Republican-led body passed the rules on a party-line vote. The rules don't guarantee new witnesses or documents but allow for a vote on them after opening arguments and the Q&A portion are complete.
2. Democrats Argue for Removing Trump
In their opening arguments, the Democrats
alleged Mr. Trump
leveraged nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine to pressure Kyiv to undertake investigations that could benefit him politically. Democrats said that amounted to an effort to interfere in the 2020 election. The aid was released after pressure from Congress. Democrats also said the president obstructed the House impeachment investigation by blocking evidence and testimony and argued Mr. Trump posed a national-security threat to the country and needed to be removed from office now. They also argued for more witnesses and documents.
3. Bolton Manuscript Emerges
On Sunday, Jan. 26, after the Democrats closed their arguments and just several hours into the defense presentation, the New York Times revealed that former national security adviser John Bolton,
in a draft of his forthcoming book
, wrote that Mr. Trump told him aid to Ukraine was conditioned on investigations. Democrats said this underscored
the need to call Mr. Bolton
as a witness.
4. Trump Team Rebuts Charges
Mr. Trump's team noted the aid to Ukraine was released without any announcement of investigations by Ukraine.
Mr. Trump denied the conversation
Mr. Bolton described in his book and has denied any wrongdoing. The team argued that even if the conversation did take place as Mr. Bolton described, it wouldn't amount to an impeachable offense. Mr. Trump's lawyers said the president is up for re-election soon and the decision on his
fate should be left to the voters
. They also argued that it was the House probe's job to secure new witnesses, not the Senate's.
5. Question-and-Answer Period Begins
Starting Wednesday, senators have 16 hours over two days to submit questions to Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, alternating from Republicans to Democrats. The questions will be handwritten on beige-colored cards that ask for the senator's name and who they want to direct the question to—Mr. Trump's team or the House managers.
The questions could come from a single senator or a group. Chief Justice Roberts urged the managers and defense lawyers to limit their answers to five minutes.
6. Vote on Witnesses and Documents
Later this week, after the Q&A session concludes, senators are expected to vote on whether to call new witnesses and documents. A yes vote means lawmakers could then hold subsequent votes on whether to hear from Mr. Bolton and other witnesses such as acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and Hunter Biden, son of former vice president Joe Biden. A no vote would set the trial on course for a quick conclusion with a final vote on convicting or acquitting Mr. Trump.
7. Final Vote
Barring any major developments, Mr. Trump is expected to be acquitted in the Republican-controlled Senate, where a two-thirds vote is required to remove him from office.

President Trump's team has been weighing the prospects of a race against a populist outsider or a party stalwart. Michigan's Democratic primary may determine just what they get.
The Midwestern battleground, voting on Tuesday, is the first major general election battleground state to hold a primary. Tuesday is the first day Democrats cast a ballot since voters whittled the race down to two candidates a week before.
In 2016, President Trump became the first Republican to win Michigan since George H.W. Bush in 1988, eking out a victory over Hillary Clinton that was powered by strong support in white rural areas and benefited from the fact that Mrs. Clinton couldn't match former President Obama's turnout in majority-black districts.
In that year's Democratic nomination race, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won the state, and he retains loyal support among young people and liberals. But former Vice President Joe Biden appears to have momentum after a strong Super Tuesday that showed him consolidating moderate support, and he has gathered key endorsements in the state.
Each Democrat argues he is best equipped to defeat Mr. Trump.Mr. Sanders says he can bring to the party new voters who support his message of radical political change, while Mr. Biden's allies stress his backing among centrist suburban voters will be critical in November. Recent general election polling of head-to-head matchups with Mr. Trump in Michigan show both Democrats ahead of the president.
For weeks, Mr. Trump and his associates had openly been agitating for Mr. Sanders, with the president seeking to stir up the Vermont senator's supporters by claiming without evidence the Democratic establishment had fixed the race for Mr. Biden. But the Trump team's focus turned to Mr. Biden again after his wins on Super Tuesday.
A key question is whether Mr. Biden can bring back to the Democratic fold voters in the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which Mr. Trump swept in 2016 to take the White House, as well as compete in historic swing states like Florida.
""I'll tell you, I was all set for Bernie, because I thought it was going to happen,"" Mr. Trump said during a Fox News town hall Thursday. ""In a certain way Bernie would be tougher because he's got a base,"" he said, but added, ""I think it's going to be very hard for him to come back.""
Some Democratic voters in Detroit and its suburbs said they preferred a contest between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden, fearing Mr. Sanders's suite of policy proposals are too far to the left.
""I'm happy with Biden getting stronger. Bernie has a lot of good criticisms to make, but I still feel like in my heart Biden is our best choice,"" said Sara Frank, 69 years old, a retiree from West Bloomfield. ""He would have a broader reach.""
Aaron Parks, 24, who works in the health-insurance industry, backed Mr. Sanders in 2016 but this year said he is supporting Mr. Biden. He said when he knocked on doors for Mr. Sanders in Commerce Charter Township four years ago, he found resistance to his liberal policies.
""What I like most about [Mr. Biden] is he's going to resonate with people around here,"" he said.
But Megan Hakala, 31, who works at Wayne State University and lives in Garden City, said if Democrats chose Mr. Biden, Mr. Trump could beat him in Michigan.
""He just doesn't have the passion. I have not met anyone, personally, who is fired up about Biden the way people are fired up about Bernie,"" she said. ""I think that the passion has to be there for the Democratic candidate in order to beat Trump.""
Michigan, which offers 125 delegates to the Democratic convention awarded proportionately, could prove a critical moment in the primary race, either as the state in which Mr. Biden solidifies his march to the nomination or where a strong victory enables Mr. Sanders to remain competitive.
Mr. Sanders has said a loss in Michigan's primary won't force him out of the race, and he has made an aggressive push in Michigan in the final days before the primary, canceling events in other states to add extra stops there.
Mr. Biden was expected to appear later Monday with California Sen. Kamala Harris, who endorsed him Sunday, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who announced his backing Monday. Meanwhile, Mr. Biden has sent surrogates including Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a former primary rival, and has key backers in the state, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Heading into Tuesday, Mr. Sanders has begun to criticize Mr. Biden's trade record more forcefully, hitting his support for trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement. His aides feel the criticism resonates with Michigan's large union population and would be a powerful general election argument. They argue Mr. Trump won Michigan and other Midwest states in part because he focused on the trade deals.
Mr. Biden is expected to focus on his record as vice president while trying to avoid a back-and-forth with Mr. Sanders.
He likely also will emphasize his role in the 2009 bailout of General Motors and Chrysler, as well as the Affordable Care Act, issues that he would likely continue to stress in a general election. His aides said his strong showing in suburban swing districts on Super Tuesday show he will be competitive in Michigan.
One Biden adviser said, ""Vice President Biden has actually been on two presidential tickets that won Michigan.""

With the leadoff Iowa caucuses days away, President Trump's re-election campaign wants to remind voters that Democrats aren't the only game in town.
For the Feb. 3 caucuses, the Trump campaign is planning an ambitious show of force around the state, with over 80 surrogates expected to campaign at caucus locations. The push will be led by campaign manager Brad Parscale, the president's sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, as well as Eric Trump's wife Lara Trump, who works for the campaign and Donald Trump Jr.'s girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle, also a campaign adviser.
The group heading to Iowa includes White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and a number of cabinet members, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. Also attending are members of Congress, among them House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) , Rep. Elise Stefanik, (R., N.Y.) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), as well as Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and governors from surrounding states.
Four years ago, President Trump placed second in the Iowa caucuses. But this time around he has no strong challenger and Republican turnout is expected to be light. Still, the campaign sees the night as an opportunity to test its organizational muscle across the state's 99 counties and put on a show of strength in a key general election state.

""Our Caucus Day operation is just a preview of what is to come,"" said Mr. Parscale, in a statement provided to The Wall Street Journal. ""This will be the strongest, best funded, and most organized presidential campaign in history.""
The president is also heading to Des Moines on Thursday for a rally in advance of the caucuses, and Vice President Mike Pence is planning a bus tour through the state that day. The campaign has held caucus training sessions and Lara Trump recently issued a video detailing how to participate.
""By attending your caucus you can show your support for the president and send a clear message to the rest of the country,"" she said.
Mr. Trump has made clear he plans to leave nothing to chance in Iowa, a state he captured by nearly 10 percentage points in 2016 over Hillary Clinton but that Barack Obama won in 2008 and 2012. He has stayed close to Iowa Republicans, repeatedly visiting the state throughout his presidency.
Some states have opted not to hold Republican primaries this year, but Iowa—ever mindful of its first-in-the-nation status—has kept the GOP contest going.

How should news media outlets balance coverage of an event vs. free exposure for political candidates? Join the conversation below.
""When you're a first in the nation state, you can't take off an election cycle,"" said Iowa Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kaufmann. ""We need to make sure both parties are out front and showing the country that we're going to do things in a transparent way and an efficient way.""
On the evening of Feb. 3, Republicans and Democrats will gather in nearly 1,700 precinct locations to pick their choice to be the party nominee. The GOP process is more straightforward than the Democratic approach, with Republicans simply casting a vote. The caucus results ultimately determine the delegates that represent the state at the Republican convention in August.
Mr. Kaufmann stressed that the turnout among Republicans would likely be low, perhaps in the thousands, but said the night provided an on-the-ground organizing test.
Mr. Trump has followed the closely fought
Democratic nomination fight
, which kicks off in Iowa.
Speaking to Fox Business recently, he said of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders: ""I don't know, maybe he's really surging. He really is,"" while adding that Massachusetts Sen. ""Elizabeth Warren seems to be going in the other way.""
Of former Vice President Joe Biden, Mr. Trump said he ""doesn't seem to be doing too well.""
Although the
president's impeachment trial
will continue unfolding in Washington this week, the push in Iowa also comes as he has been or will be central to several other notable events.
He is holding a rally in New Jersey this week, as well as a high profile meeting with Israeli leaders. He recently attended the
World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos
and on Friday became the
first president to personally address the March for Life
in Washington.

Former Vice President Joe Biden began the year with about $9 million in available campaign cash—less than the other three top-polling Democratic presidential candidates, reports filed Friday show.
Mr. Biden raised and spent about $23 million in the final three months of the year. Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg burned through more cash than Mr. Biden, but each had millions of dollars more in the bank than he did as the financial quarter ended.
As the Democratic candidates prepare for Monday's Iowa caucuses, they reported their fourth-quarter fundraising and spending activities to the Federal Election Commission.
Other political committees, such as super PACs, Senate and House campaigns and party groups, also filed FEC reports Friday.
Here are some of the highlights:
MONEY TO BURN
Mr. Sanders spent about $50 million in the final three months of last year and had about $18 million in the bank as of Dec. 31, according to his disclosure. His spending exceeded the $34.3 million he brought in during the quarter.
The majority of Mr. Sanders's and Ms. Warren's fourth-quarter donations came from people who gave $200 or less, while Messrs. Biden and Buttigieg each counted on small donors for less than 40% of their latest fundraising hauls, the reports show.
Ms. Warren tore through her campaign cash, spending $33.7 million while raising $21.7 million in the fourth quarter. That left her with $13.7 million at the start of this year.
Mr. Buttigieg's campaign had $14.5 million in the bank on Dec. 31, after he raised $25.2 million and spent $34.1 million in the fourth quarter, his report shows. The campaign spent about $670,000 on digital lists of potential supporters, a common way candidates try to find new small donors.
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who has risen in some Iowa polls, spent about $10.1 million of the $11.4 million she raised between October and December. She had about $5 million cash on hand at the end of the quarter.
BACKING BIDEN
Mr. Biden is the only top-polling Democratic presidential candidate whose close associates have formed a super PAC to help him.
Unite the Country reported raising about $3.8 million in the second half of last year, according to its FEC filing. Billionaire California real-estate broker George Marcus gave $1 million at the end of December, making him the super PAC's top donor. In October, Mr. Marcus co-hosted a fundraiser for the Biden campaign in Palo Alto, Calif. Super PACs aren't allowed to coordinate their spending with the campaign they are supporting and can accept donations of any size.
Other major donors included Alan Leventhal, chief executive of Boston real-estate investment firm Beacon Capital Partners, and Joe Kiani, the founder of a California medical technology company, who each contributed $250,000. The PAC for the International Association of Fire Fighters, which endorsed Mr. Biden, gave $100,000.
In a statement ahead of its filing, Unite the Country said it has raised nearly $4 million in January from donors who will be disclosed in its next filing, due Feb. 20.
The group said it has so far spent about $6 million on
advertising and research in Iowa
alone. That gave Mr. Biden a boost on the airwaves over the past two months, keeping him competitive with his rivals and allowing him to devote his own resources elsewhere.
TRUMP MONEY
President Trump's re-election campaign began the year with about $103 million in available cash. He faces no serious primary challenge, and his campaign raised about $46 million in the fourth quarter.
The campaign spent the largest share of its money on advertising, paying $13 million to American Made Media Consultants, an entity created by Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale. The campaign has said no one working on the campaign benefits financially from the company.
The campaign carried a payroll of more than $2 million and spent about $1.4 million on legal consulting during the months leading up to the president's impeachment trial.
THE DROPOUTS
New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker had about $4 million in cash on hand just two weeks before he ended his presidential bid on Jan. 13, according to his year-end fundraising report. That was about the same amount he had in the bank at the start of the fourth quarter. He raised and spent $6.5 million in the final months of his campaign.
Former Housing Secretary Julián Castro, who
dropped out of the race at the start of the year
and endorsed Ms. Warren, had just under $1 million in campaign cash as 2019 ended, his report shows.
SENATE COMMITTEES
The chief Republican Senate political committee raised almost $68 million last year, about $5 million more than its Democratic counterpart, according to their FEC filings.
Democrats need to gain at least three seats—while holding on to seats in challenging places such as Alabama and winning the presidency—to gain control of the chamber. Each committee raised about $7 million in December alone, the reports show.
The National Republican Senatorial Committee had about $20 million in available cash as of the end of last year, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee had nearly $19 million.

John Brackney, a former county commissioner from the Denver suburbs and registered independent, will be able to do something for the first time on Tuesday: cast a vote in a Democratic presidential primary.
A pair of 2016 ballot propositions changed Colorado's presidential caucus system to a primary for the first time in 20 years, opening the nominating process for both major political parties to those who aren't affiliated with either—more than one-third of the approximately 3.5 million active registered voters there, according to Colorado's secretary of state. The change has created less certainty over what will happen in the Democratic race in Colorado on Super Tuesday, as a significant swath of the electorate is now up for grabs.
""I am pleased that I'm not having to be held under the sway of either party but can still vote in the primary,"" said Mr. Brackney, who left the Republican Party in 2016 when it became apparent Donald Trump would become the GOP nominee. He had been leaning toward former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who
dropped out of the race
Sunday, but now plans on voting for former Vice President Joe Biden.
The switch to a mail-in-ballots presidential primary, a format that typically draws more participants than caucuses, and the inclusion of unaffiliated voters have changed the political calculus since 2016, when Sen. Bernie Sanders beat Hillary Clinton by about 59% to 40%. A pair of polls last week showed Mr. Sanders leading Colorado's primary by between 12 and 14 points. But local experts said the number of unaffiliated voters casting ballots in the primary for the first time made the outcome less certain.
In addition to Mr. Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar also
dropped out of the race
Monday shortly before she was scheduled to hold a rally in Denver.
A few other Super Tuesday states, including California, also have large populations of independents who can vote in the Democratic presidential primary. But the combination of Colorado moving away from a caucus and opening up its presidential primary marks a dramatic shift.
""We've moved from the most restrictive process with the caucuses to the most open process possible,"" said Craig Hughes, a Democratic consultant and senior adviser Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet's
since-abandoned presidential campaign
. ""There are thousands of unaffiliated voters out there who are now in play for the candidate who correctly capitalizes on them.""
Some 619,947 ballots have been received in the Democratic primary so far this year, dwarfing the 122,296 people who participated in the 2016 Democratic presidential caucuses, state and AP data show. Of those, 203,548 ballots came from unaffiliated voters, according to the Colorado secretary of state.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What do you expect to be the outcome of the Democratic presidential primary in Colorado on Super Tuesday? Why? Join the conversation below.
""The key question is who will those voters support?"" Robert Preuhs, a political-science professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver, said of the unaffiliated primary voters.
While Democrats hold virtually all major elected offices in Colorado and the historically swing state has been trending blue, the wide cross section of unaffiliated voters runs the gamut from progressives to moderates to libertarians. Mrs. Clinton beat Mr. Trump in the state by 5 points in 2016, and Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner is considered among the most vulnerable incumbent Republican senators facing reelection this year.
""I think that anyone who tells you they have a strong insight into how the primary election in Colorado will turn out is full of it,"" said Curtis Hubbard, Colorado communications adviser for former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has made tighter gun restrictions a centerpiece of his Democratic campaign for president in a state that has experienced numerous mass shootings.
Mr. Hubbard, who ran the campaigns to pass the pair of propositions that changed Colorado's election system, said the steady stream of appearances by candidates and surrogates in the state has shown its primary is potentially more competitive than the 2016 caucuses were. Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, both no longer in the race, Mr. Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts have all held well-attended rallies in Colorado in recent weeks.
Cathy Shull, a former Republican, voted for Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. She decided to give up her GOP affiliation two years ago because she worried it would conflict with her consulting business. She plans on voting in the Democratic primary this year but hasn't made up her mind for whom.
""It's not so much being a Republican or Democrat,"" she said of voting in the state's only competitive presidential primary this year, as Mr. Trump is virtually assured his party's nomination. ""But it's being able to make my voice heard.""

WASHINGTON—Republican leaders said they don't currently have enough votes to block witnesses in President Trump's Senate impeachment trial, after his legal team concluded its efforts to counter Democrats' charges that the president abused power and obstructed Congress.
On the third and final day of presentations by the Trump legal team, lawyers tried to cast doubts on the importance and credibility of
allegations by former national security adviser John Bolton
about the president's motives for freezing aid to Ukraine.
But at a meeting of all Republican senators late Tuesday, GOP leaders told their conference that they don't currently have the votes to prevent witnesses from being called, people familiar with the matter said. Republicans had hoped to wrap up the trial with an acquittal of the president by this week, but Democrats have said he should appear under oath to offer a firsthand account of the president's motivations for freezing aid to Ukraine—a matter at the heart of the impeachment case.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said the vote total wasn't where it needed to be on blocking witnesses or documents, these people said. He had a card with ""yes,"" ""no,"" and ""maybes"" marked on it, apparently a whip count, but he didn't show it to senators.
Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado, Martha McSally of Arizona and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who face competitive races in the fall, warned colleagues in the meeting against backing more witnesses, people familiar with the matter said. The senators said a drawn-out trial could lead to more Democratic attacks and hurt their re-election chances, the people said. None of the three senators' offices immediately responded to requests for comment.
During Tuesday's proceedings, the president's lawyers argued that House managers hadn't established their case that Mr. Trump abused power and obstructed Congress and said the accusations fell short of the threshold needed to remove a president from office, particularly in an election year.
""The bar for impeachment cannot be set this low,"" said Jay Sekulow, one of the president's personal attorneys, of the Democrats' impeachment case. Deputy White House counsel Pat Philbin said the abuse-of-power article was ""infinitely malleable"" and allowed for too much subjectivity. ""How are we supposed to get the proof of what's in the president's head?"" he asked.
White House counsel Pat Cipollone, in closing, reminded senators that the presidential election was nine months away and said the choice should be left to voters. ""Why tear up their ballots?"" he asked.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), following the conclusion of the session, dismissed the Trump legal team's arguments. ""Their whole argument is diversion,"" he said.
""If you don't believe the newspaper report, call the witnesses,"" he said of the
Bolton account
, which was first reported Sunday evening in the New York Times. He reminded senators that the witnesses Democrats have wanted to call but that have been blocked by the White House—which include Mr. Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney—are Republicans appointed by the president.
Democrats, who control 47 seats, need four Republicans to join them to approve motions for new testimony or documents, which need a simple majority to pass. Starting Wednesday, the Senate will have two days to ask each side questions, followed by a vote later this week on new evidence. 





The impeachment question card. PHOTO: WSJ
In Tuesday's closing, the defense team was seeking to persuade senators not to support hearing testimony from further witnesses, among them Mr. Bolton. Mr. Bolton wrote in a draft of his forthcoming book that the president told him he wanted to keep aid to Ukraine frozen until Kyiv had aided investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Mr. Bolton's lawyer confirmed.
The president has denied Mr. Bolton's description of the conversation. He has repeatedly said there was no link between freezing the aid to Ukraine and his push for investigations.
In a marked shift from Monday, when the defense team made scant mention of Mr. Bolton's allegations, the president's lawyers on Tuesday argued that too little is known about the claims for them to factor into the Senate trial.
Mr. Sekulow called the allegations ""inadmissible"" and pointed to the president's denials, while accusing the former adviser of seeking to boost his book sales. Impeachment, he added, ""is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts. That is politics, unfortunately.""
The House last fall had sought Mr. Bolton's testimony but moved forward with articles of impeachment when he declined to appear without a subpoena. The House declined to subpoena him in an effort to move quickly and not get bogged down in court fights.
The reports of Mr. Bolton's account unsettled Republican senators and bolstered the odds of a successful vote to hear further witness testimony. Several on-the-fence Republican senators said Mr. Bolton's claims strengthened the case for further witness testimony, while the number of senators the White House believes may vote for more testimony ticked up.
Lawmakers expressed interest in learning more about Mr. Bolton's claims. One proposal by Sen. James Lankford (R., Okla.) to make the Bolton manuscript available to the Senate in a classified setting for review drew the support of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), a top ally of the president's.
Mr. Schumer rejected the idea of reading the manuscript behind closed doors. ""What an absurd proposal,"" he said. ""It is a book. There is no need for it to be read in the SCIF unless you want to hide something,"" referring to a secure facility. The book is set to be published in March.
While no administration officials during the fall's House hearings testified that they were told directly by Mr. Trump that he was holding up the aid to pressure Kyiv,
four current and former officials
said they understood that to be the case.

Republicans have said this week that if the Senate votes for more testimony, they want to call witnesses including Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter.
Sens. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) and Susan Collins (R., Maine) indicated on Monday that they were likely to favor witnesses. Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) and Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.) remained open to the idea.
""I think that John Bolton probably has something to offer us,"" Ms. Murkowski said Tuesday.
The White House has grown concerned in recent days that two other senators might vote in favor of more testimony: Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio, people familiar with the discussions said. The defense team has been preparing for the possibility that the Senate will vote in favor of calling more witnesses and discussing how it would go to court to fight a subpoena for Mr. Bolton's testimony.
Mr. Bolton has said he would testify
during a Senate trial if subpoenaed.
Mr. Toomey suggested at a closed-door Senate lunch on Monday an arrangement in which the Senate subpoena Mr. Bolton as well as a witness sought by the White House, an approach Mr. Romney said he found fair.
""I think if you hear from one side, you probably ought to have a chance to hear from witnesses from the other side,"" said Mr. Romney.
Republicans senators said that during the coming days of questioning they planned to ask about the elder Mr. Biden as vice president
withholding loan guarantees from the Ukrainian government
when the nation was slow to fire a prosecutor general whom Western diplomats criticized for not cracking down on corruption.
They also planned to ask about Hunter Biden's role on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president. Mr. Trump and his allies have argued it was corrupt for Mr. Biden to call for the ouster of the Ukrainian prosecutor because he had once investigated the gas company, Burisma Holdings, that had ties to his son. The Bidens deny wrongdoing. Hunter Biden has said that serving on the company's board showed poor judgment given his father's anticorruption efforts.

Republicans also plan to use their questions to attack the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), over his office's dealings with the whistleblower whose account of the Ukraine pressure campaign spurred the impeachment inquiry.
Democratic senators said they would like to ask questions that could allow the Democratic House managers to rebut comments from the Trump defense team.
Following the period of questioning, the Senate will hold as much as four hours of debate on whether to subpoena witnesses or documents. If that hurdle is cleared, the Senate would then proceed to vote on whether to hear from Mr. Bolton, subpoena the notes he took during his tenure as national security adviser and gather other information or hear from other witnesses.

WASHINGTON—President Trump's legal team said Democrats had failed to make a case for removing the president from office, arguing at his impeachment trial Saturday that there was no evidence he pushed Ukraine's president for an investigation of his political rival in exchange for aid.
In their first chance to address the Senate after three days of arguments by Democratic House impeachment managers, the president's lawyers sought to undercut the Democrats' case that Mr. Trump abused the power of his office by asking a foreign leader to investigate a political rival and obstructed Congress's impeachment inquiry.
The defense team, opting to use just two hours of its time, argued that the president's actions were in the national interest and that Democrats' investigation was politically motivated.
""They're asking you not only to overturn the results of the last election…they're asking you to remove President Trump from the ballot in an election that's occurring in approximately nine months,"" White House counsel Pat Cipollone told senators as he opened the session. ""We don't believe that they have come anywhere close to meeting their burden for what they're asking you to do.""
The defense team's arguments will pick back up on Monday. But unlike Democrats, who used nearly 24 hours over three days, the president's team is expected to use around eight hours of its allotted time, an administration official said.
With the chance of conviction in the Republican-controlled Senate virtually zero, the primary task facing the president's legal team is to dissuade on-the-fence Republican senators from voting in favor of hearing more testimony from witnesses. Democrats have tried to impress on the chamber the need to hear from witnesses whose testimony the White House blocked during the House investigation, among them acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton.
Mr. Trump's team took aim at House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who also has been criticized by Mr. Trump. Republicans have accused Mr. Schiff's office of coordinating with the whistleblower whose complaint described Mr. Trump's efforts to solicit Ukraine's help in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden, a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination this year. Mr. Schiff denies that his office coordinated with the whistleblower.
Mr. Schiff has acknowledged the whistleblower approached a staff member in his office before filing a formal complaint, but his office said it informed the person to seek legal counsel, as it customarily does when approached by would-be whistleblowers. Mr. Schiff said last year he ""should have been much more clear"" when he previously said his committee hadn't been in touch with the whistleblower. Mr. Schiff said Friday that Republicans were merely trying to distract from the case.
Much of Saturday's session was focused on the transcript of the president's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he
asked his counterpart to investigate
Mr. Biden and his son, as well as alleged interference by Ukraine in the 2016 U.S. election. Mr. Trump ordered nearly $400 million
in aid to Ukraine frozen
more than a week before that call.
Mr. Cipollone and his deputy, Mike Purpura, argued that the transcript shows the president didn't explicitly condition aid on the investigations, and that Mr. Zelensky repeatedly agreed with the president on the call. The lawyers also noted Mr. Zelensky's public statements that he didn't feel pressured by Mr. Trump.
While Mr. Trump didn't explicitly bring up aid, Mr. Zelensky told him his country wanted to order more Javelin missiles from the U.S., to which Mr. Trump responded: ""I would like you to do us a favor, though."" By the time of the call, Mr. Zelensky had been told by several administration officials and people close to the president that he needed to assure Mr. Trump he was willing to undertake the investigations if he wanted a White House meeting, according to testimony to House investigators.
The president's team sought to portray the Democratic House managers as disingenuous, punctuating their sentences with phrases such as: ""This is what the House managers didn't tell you."" They also took repeated jabs at the length of Democrats' arguments, promising the chamber to be ""respectful of your time.""
The lawyers tried to cast doubt on testimony by witnesses who said they understood the aid to be linked to an investigations, playing a video clip of Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland saying the words ""presume"" and ""presumption."" Democrats have noted that the White House has blocked from testifying officials who would have direct knowledge of the relationship between the frozen aid and the push for investigations.
The president's lawyers argued that Mr. Trump couldn't have been leveraging aid to pressure Ukraine to undertake investigations because Kyiv wasn't aware of the hold. But a top Defense Department official told House investigators in November that Ukraine inquired about the status of the aid on the day of the call with Mr. Zelensky.
Senate Democrats criticized the defense's presentation. ""I don't think the president's counsel did a very good job,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) told reporters. ""If you're a Republican and you think that the case that was made today was strong, then why not have witnesses and documents if you think both sides made their case?""
Four Republicans would need to join all 47 Democratic senators to pass a motion in favor of hearing more testimony from witnesses. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) is privately concerned that some Republicans could vote for more testimony, people familiar with the discussions said.
But Saturday's session appeared to have changed few Republicans' minds. ""I don't think there will be any need for witnesses at all,"" Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.) said. ""The sooner we can conclude this, the better."" Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) said he would ""likely"" be in favor of calling witnesses, which he has said repeatedly in recent weeks.

Saturday's truncated session arose partly because the White House wanted to present some arguments from Democrats and to provide fodder for Sunday television shows, but save the bulk of its arguments for Monday and Tuesday, when viewers will be more tuned in.
Mr. Trump on Friday complained about his team's turn starting on a Saturday, which he tweeted ""is called Death Valley in T.V.""

The move also came in response to a push for a shorter session from several senators in both parties, who have been running on

LOS ANGELES—Joe Biden's Super Tuesday
victories served notice
that
his triumph in South Carolina was no fluke
and could form the basis of a competitive coalition of voters in what is shaping up to be a protracted fight with Sen. Bernie Sanders.
The former vice president, once staggered by losses in Iowa and New Hampshire, stormed back with wins in at least eight states, including delegate-rich North Carolina and Virginia.
Mr. Sanders triumphed in California, the night's biggest delegate prize, as well as Colorado, Utah and his home state of Vermont.
But Mr. Biden captured Texas, the second-biggest prize of the night. He also took Minnesota, a day after receiving
the endorsement of onetime rival Sen. Amy Klobuchar
, and Oklahoma—two states that Mr. Sanders carried in his 2016 campaign.
Super Tuesday served as a disappointment for former Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who faced daunting questions about the futures of their campaigns.
Mr. Bloomberg only managed to snatch victory in American Samoa,
despite his freewheeling campaign spending
, while Ms. Warren
lost her home state
of Massachusetts, trailing both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders.
Here are the main takeaways from Super Tuesday:
The Biden Coalition
Exit polls showed Mr. Biden assembling a winning coalition that included African-Americans, suburban voters and older voters, allowing him to argue he could best unite the party against Republican President Trump.
Mr. Sanders performed well with liberal voters and voters under age 30, exit polls showed, but his poor performance in the South showed the limits to his appeal with African-Americans and moderate voters. Mr. Biden was victorious in Tennessee and Alabama, and also notched a win in Oklahoma, despite never visiting the state during his campaign.
About half of Democratic primary voters in Virginia and Oklahoma said they made their decision within the past few days, and Mr. Biden won roughly 6 in 10 of those voters in both states. Late-deciders represented a smaller proportion of the vote in North Carolina and Alabama, but he also had the largest share of those voters there.

Sanders's Setback
Mr. Sanders won three of the first four early voting states and showed strength with Latino voters in Nevada, liberals and young people.
But Mr. Biden's comeback in South Carolina exposed Mr. Sanders's struggles with black voters, and Tuesday night's results raised questions about whether the self-described democratic socialist could garner broad support in suburban regions viewed as critical in the general election against Mr. Trump, including in Virginia near Washington, D.C., in Charlotte, N.C., and Minnesota's Twin Cities.
Mr. Sanders demonstrated staying power in California and hoped to net a significant number of delegates from the state. But Mr. Biden's recent rise has prevented Mr. Sanders from building a significant early delegate lead, as some of his advisers had hoped, and means the two men are likely to be engaged in a lengthy battle for the nomination.
Biden's Momentum
After the nadirs of Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr. Biden's ascent has been rapid as moderates in the party fear Mr. Sanders leading the ticket.
On the eve of the primaries, he racked up the endorsements of former rivals Pete Buttigieg, Ms. Klobuchar and Beto O'Rourke in Dallas. The coalescing around his candidacy followed
a pivotal endorsement by South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn
only days before the state's primary, a decision that helped power Mr. Biden's victory.
Bloomberg or Bust
For a billionaire who has long thrived on data, Mr. Bloomberg couldn't have been pleased with his Super Tuesday return on investment. He spent about $215 million in advertising in the 14 states but was on pace to only win in American Samoa.
Mr. Bloomberg was certain to win delegates, but Super Tuesday showed that he is unlikely to become the main alternative to Mr. Sanders, even though he tried to displace Mr. Biden during the former vice president's struggles.
Mr. Bloomberg campaigned extensively in the South, hoping to win over black voters and others in states such as North Carolina, Alabama and Tennessee that might otherwise be drawn to Mr. Biden.
But Mr. Bloomberg lost every Super Tuesday state in which he competed and was likely to encounter pressure to drop out and devote his vast resources and deep campaign operation to help Mr. Biden.
Home-State Loss
Ms. Warren entered the night searching for an elusive first victory and facing a home-state challenge from Mr. Sanders. She appeared to come up empty-handed on both counts.
Mr. Biden won the state and Mr. Sanders, who staged rallies in Boston and Springfield in the days before the primary, was also leading Ms. Warren in Massachusetts, undercutting her case that she could become a consensus choice if none of the candidates can claim a majority of the delegates by June.
She is projected to pick up delegates, which could give her leverage in a drawn-out fight for the nomination. But the promises of her campaign, when she led some national polls last fall, seem long ago.

Joe Biden won all three primaries held Tuesday on a day filled with anxious voting, building a lead in the Democratic presidential nomination race that appears increasingly difficult for Bernie Sanders to overcome.
The contest lurched forward amid major disruptions triggered by the coronavirus pandemic as the first balloting was held -- in Florida, Illinois and Arizona -- since the crisis engulfed the nation.
After all of the day's votes are counted, the former vice president is likely to have a majority of the delegates awarded so far. As of late Tuesday, he already had secured more than half of the 1,991 needed to win the nomination.
In Florida, a critical general election battleground, Mr. Biden won nearly three times as many votes as the Vermont senator and carried all 67 counties. In Illinois, with 85% of precincts reporting, he was racking up a 59% to 36% margin. The Associated Press called the race in Arizona for Mr. Biden with early results coming in.
The latest large victories by Mr. Biden are likely to place more pressure on Mr. Sanders to exit from the race so the party can focus on competing against President Trump in November. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Sunday showed Mr. Biden was favored nationally, 61% to 32%, among those who have already voted in the Democratic primary or plan to do so.
Mr. Biden is already trying to unify the party behind him, endorsing policy proposals related to bankruptcy laws and college tuition in a bid to woo liberals. Mr. Sanders acknowledged last week that he's losing the ""debate over electability"" among Democrats.
Time is running out for Mr. Sanders to catch up with more than half of state primaries and caucuses already held. He would have to capture a large share of the remaining delegates to win the nomination -- and no other states are expected to hold contests until early April.
Mr. Biden, speaking from his home in Wilmington, Del., reached out to his rival's supporters. He noted he was delivering his address by live stream to avoid gathering supporters during the pandemic.
""We've moved closer to securing the Democratic Party's nomination for president, and we're doing it by building a broad coalition,"" he said.
Mr. Biden said he and Mr. Sanders ""may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision"" on issues such as health care, wealth inequality and climate change. He told young voters inspired by Mr. Sanders, ""I hear you, I know what's at stake.""
During a live-stream address earlier Tuesday evening, Mr. Sanders outlined his proposals to blunt the effects of the coronavirus outbreak. He didn't mention the primary elections or his narrowing prospects.
Ohio had been expected to hold a primary on Tuesday, but it joined a growing list of states that have delayed their contests until May or June in hopes the coronavirus situation will improves.
On the eve of the balloting, a court there rejected a request to postpone the state's primary until June 2 as Republican Gov. Mike DeWine had recommended. The in-person voting was subsequently placed on hold after the state's top health official ordered polls closed.
The state Supreme Court denied a last-minute legal challenge to the postponement, and county election boards were deluged with phone calls from confused, frustrated voters.
Late Tuesday, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez called for states with upcoming primaries and caucuses to use voting by mail and other alternatives to casting ballots in person.
""What happened in Ohio last night has only bred more chaos and confusion,"" he said. ""States that have not yet held primary elections should focus on implementing the aforementioned measures to make it easier and safer for voters to exercise their constitutional right to vote, instead of moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.""
Florida and Arizona are battleground states, so they may offer insights into general-election trends. This round of contests might be the last significant ones for some time, if more states announce primary postponements.
States that move their contests later than June 9 will need a waiver from the party to avoid losing delegates to the July convention, the DNC wrote in a memo this week.
Voters, sobered by the health crisis, also cast ballots in local and state contests as they confronted school closures, travel limitations, event cancellations and a stressed global economy. Germs were also on their minds.
At a polling location inside a Miami fire station, workers wore gloves as they inspected voter identification cards and dispensed hand sanitizer to visitors. Some voters arrived with their own pens, gloves and disinfecting wipes.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee noted Tuesday night that Mr. Trump had secured enough delegates through the GOP primaries to become the party's presumptive nominee for president.

Bernie Sanders's supporters want him to stay in the presidential contest, despite an unlikely path to the Democratic nomination after a string of primary losses in March.
The Vermont senator would have to completely upend the race by capturing more than 60% of the remaining delegates to overtake former Vice President Joe Biden and earn the party's nomination to face President Trump in the November election. Mr. Biden's allies have called for unity, but Mr.
Sanders has shown no sign
of leaving the race and has deflected questions about how long he will continue competing against him.
In interviews with more than two dozen Sanders supporters, many of them acknowledged his second bid for the Democratic nomination was unlikely to be successful. But nearly all said they saw no reason for him to exit now, and most of those in states with primaries still to come said they planned to vote for the senator.
Backers said
the coronavirus pandemic
that has shut down much of the U.S. highlights the need for many of Mr. Sanders's signature issues, such as a Medicare for All health insurance program. They hope that his continued presence in the race will pressure the Democratic Party and Mr. Biden to adopt more of Mr. Sanders policies.
""I think he should not give up, even if it looks like he's not going to be the nominee. He needs to continue to advocate for what we believe in,"" said Luis Yofe, 67, who works in the travel industry and lives in Dallas. ""For us to be enthusiastic, Biden and the party will have to adopt, in the platform for the general election, some of the key principles that Bernie is advocating.""
Mr.
Biden has adopted
some policies in a nod to liberals, including an expanded free-college program. Mr. Sanders has said the proposal doesn't go far enough.
""I'm happy to talk with him, and I've indicated that I also hear his supporters,"" Mr. Biden said on ABC's ""The View"" this week. ""He's had very strong support from young people, and I hear them.""
Democratic Party officials are set to meet in mid-July to decide on their platform and nominate the candidate who will take on Mr. Trump in the general election. To win the nomination on the first ballot at the convention, a candidate must earn 1,991 delegates, a majority of those awarded through state caucuses and primaries. As of Thursday afternoon, Mr. Biden had roughly 300 more delegates than Mr. Sanders.
But since the
coronavirus crisis prompted some states
to delay their contests, Mr. Biden is unlikely to
sew up the nomination quickly
if Mr. Sanders remains in the race.
In an interview with NPR Friday, Mr. Sanders said it would be ""a very steep road"" to overtake Mr. Biden.
The uncertainty caused by Covid-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, has given some hope to a handful of Mr. Sanders's supporters that he still has a shot at the nomination. They say that the crisis has highlighted the need for a Medicare for All system because
millions of people who lose their jobs
because of the illness could also lose their health insurance.
""I think that the Covid stuff is maybe the absolute best possible thing for his campaign right now,"" said Kirsten Southwell, 29, a senior designer at the Art Institute of Chicago. ""I think it really confirms a lot of the things that Bernie has talked about.""
Ms. Southwell and others are hoping that voters will see Mr. Sanders's reaction to the crisis and go for him in droves, giving him the significant margins he would need in every state going forward.
""More far-fetched or seemingly impossible scenarios have happened,"" said college student Brooke Britt, 21, who lives in Bristol, R.I., and plans to vote for Mr. Sanders in her state's primary, which has been
postponed to June
.
Mr. Sanders returned to Vermont on Thursday after voting the night before on a roughly $2 trillion stimulus package aimed at bolstering the U.S. economy as it struggles with the spread of the coronavirus. Aides say the campaign's focus is on the day-to-day operation and responding to the pandemic rather than what Mr. Sanders's future holds.
The campaign hasn't put up a TV ad in more than a week and has stopped soliciting donations via email to fund its operation, instead pulling in money to support organizations that are involved in coronavirus relief. However, the campaign is still accepting donations on its website and recurring funds are still being pulled in. The Vermont senator is doing frequent virtual briefings, at times bringing on progressive lawmakers and activists.
Mr. Sanders hasn't indicated any intention to quit the race. His spokesman said recently that he would
participate in a presidential debate
in April if the Democratic National Committee held one.
""He is being extremely presidential and he's showing us exactly the way a leader would act in this moment,"" said Katherine Abegg, 43, a textile research and development manager who lives in Brooklyn.
Ms. Abegg wasn't alone in her passion for Mr. Sanders. Eleven of the 25 people interviewed by The Journal said they would have a difficult time voting for Mr. Biden in November and planned to write in a name at the top of their ballot, leave it blank or stay home on election day.
""I don't want to show loyalty to a party that isn't showing loyalty to me,"" said Quentin Kanta, 20, a college student living in Monmouth, Ore.
Most of those who said they would not cast their ballots for Mr. Biden justified their position by saying they lived in states that were likely to vote for the Democrat anyway. However, Sanders supporters with whom the Journal spoke in Arizona, a 2020 battleground state, Idaho and Tennessee, both of which generally vote Republican, also said they wouldn't cast ballots for Mr. Biden.
An aide to Mr. Biden declined to comment beyond pointing to polling that shows the former vice president
leading Mr. Trump in swing counties
.
Just one of the Sanders supporters interviewed, 58-year-old Brenda Wilson of Cleveland, said Mr. Sanders should exit the race soon. Ms. Wilson said she is likely to cast her ballot for Mr. Biden when Ohio votes in June. ""I still love him,"" she said of Mr. Sanders, adding that if he remains in the race, he could hurt Mr. Biden's chances against Mr. Trump.
""I'm a true believer if there's a stronger candidate, we should go with you,"" she said.

DES MOINES, Iowa—In the months leading up to the Iowa caucuses, Joe Biden suggested he could stake an early claim to the Democratic nomination with a victory.
By caucus night, as his team dealt with
disappointing early results and a meltdown
of the state party's election system, he was so far out of the lead that his campaign questioned whether the process had been fair.
His advisers are now facing the potential of losses in both Iowa and New Hampshire, an outcome that has decimated presidential bids in the past, and are seeking to convince financial donors about his staying power in diverse states such as Nevada and South Carolina.
Mr. Biden was in fourth place in Monday's chaotic caucuses based on partial results released Tuesday, circumstances that allowed his campaign to emphasize ""considerable flaws"" in the state Democratic Party's reporting system. His campaign's general counsel urged the state party on Monday night to withhold any official results until campaigns had received ""full explanations"" on ""methods of quality control.""
When 71% of the tabulations were finally released Tuesday, it showed Mr. Biden badly trailing former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a stunning setback for a front-running former vice president who has made electability central to his candidacy. He also trailed Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and was only narrowly ahead of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar.
Traveling to New Hampshire, Mr. Biden tried to quickly pivot, telling supporters in a Concord union hall, ""There's nothing to come back from yet but I'd like you to rocket me out of here to make sure this thing works, OK?""
Mr. Biden received encouraging news on Wednesday when the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, a union of 775,000 members, endorsed his campaign, giving him more labor support ahead of the New Hampshire vote.
But his advisers have been playing down his chances in New Hampshire, noting that the state has a history of supporting New England neighbors. Three of his challengers hail from the region.
Beyond New Hampshire, the Iowa finish threatens to damage Mr. Biden's campaign with major contests looming in Nevada and South Carolina, two states where polls have shown him leading.
Mr. Biden's campaign rolled out a series of endorsements in coming contests, including former South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges.
South Carolina has long been viewed as a crucial springboard to amassing delegates on Super Tuesday. Mr. Biden has maintained
strong support with African-American voters
, who make up about 60% of the primary electorate in South Carolina.

But poor showings at the start of the calendar could give his rivals an opening with black voters while the party's centrist voters may consider billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who has
poured more than $300 million
into his campaign and focused on states beginning in March.
In a sign of Mr. Bloomberg's growing strength, he staged a rally in Philadelphia—about a mile from Mr. Biden's campaign headquarters—that drew more than 2,000 people.
Mr. Biden also faces financial repercussions. He started the year with about $9 million in his campaign account and has
struggled to build up his reserves
in recent months. The campaign emphasized in a call to top donors Tuesday Mr. Biden's strength in coming contests in Nevada and South Carolina, according to participants.
Days before the caucuses, Mr. Biden's campaign said January was its best fundraising month and the former vice president is planning large fundraisers in the coming weeks, including in New York and Denver.
""Donors and Biden supporters are smart about letting the process play out,"" said Wade Randlett, a longtime Biden donor in the San Francisco area. ""The fundamentals always matter, and the worst thing you can do is panic.""
The campaign had sought to lower Iowa expectations in recent weeks, but the outcome still came as a blow.
Mr. Biden at one point had sensed an opportunity for a momentum-fueling victory there. He spent parts of 29 days in Iowa during December, January and February, the most of any candidate during that span.
Recent polls in Iowa had shown Mr. Biden vying for the lead against Mr. Sanders, who was among a group of senators
forced to postpone many campaign events
because of the Senate impeachment trial.
Despite his standing in national polls, some Democrats began to question his ability to go the distance.
Bill Dotzler, an Iowa state senator, said he had told Mr. Biden's team that he planned to endorse ""as long as they didn't mess up.""
""It was tough for me to call them back and say, 'Hey, listen, I think we're in trouble here. I don't see the big crowds with Joe compared to some of the others. I'm also deeply concerned about how his fundraising is,' "" Mr. Dotzler said in an interview.

In December, Mr. Dotzler endorsed Mr. Buttigieg.
Entrance polls Monday underscored Mr. Biden's challenge, with solid majorities expressing support for a candidate who will fundamentally change the nation's political system.
Traveling aboard his campaign bus in early December, he told reporters, ""If I were to win Iowa, I think it's awful hard to stop me from winning the nomination.""
He added, ""If I were to come in, like some of the polling has shown, 5 points behind, or 3 points behind, or 7 points behind, I think I survive.""
Last week, Mr. Biden suggested the outcome in Iowa could include four candidates within a few percentage points of each other, ""essentially a tie and so everybody goes to the next stop.""
But he added, ""if you come out of here and somebody's 25 and you're at 12, well then you're done, in terms of Iowa.""
When the data was finally released, Mr. Biden's deficit against Mr. Buttigieg approached that margin.

Editor's note: This is an excerpt from our newsletter,
""2020 Election+Business,""
a weekly dive into the intersection of business, finance and the 2020 election.

Few contrasts are as stark in the 2020 election, or the primaries, as business taxes.
President Trump would keep or expand his tax cuts, even as
debate rages
over their
costs and successes
, while the Democratic candidates are proposing dramatic tax increases on wealthy people and corporations that go far beyond what the party has offered before.
President Trump's proposals are the fuzziest. His advisers have been
touting another round of tax cuts
for months and the president has promised a middle-class tax cut—if he's re-elected and Republicans control Congress. But the White House won't provide details yet. A spokesman said the White House is studying numerous proposals.
By contrast, the four leading Democratic candidates are proposing tax increases, along with tax credits and deductions likely to benefit some kinds of companies, particularly in the renewable energy industry.
At the high end, Elizabeth Warren's plan would raise $28.4 trillion in new tax revenue—nearly two-thirds of which would fund her Medicare for All health care proposal—while at the low end (relatively speaking), Joe Biden's proposals would raise $3.4 trillion,
according to an analysis
by Americans for Tax Fairness Action Fund, a liberal advocacy group.
All are bigger than the $1.4 trillion in tax increases that Hillary Clinton ran on in 2016. That partly reflects a more progressive Democratic party. It's also just arithmetic: The 2017 tax cuts reduced federal revenue, and reversing some of them adds to the price tag.
Of course, the candidates' proposals wouldn't just sail into law even with Democratic control of the House, Senate and presidency—and Republican control of any branch would make adoption still less likely. The Medicare-for-All plans, in particular, have divided Senate Democrats.
The candidates count on different sources to raise these funds, too. Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden would generate just over half their totals from business, while Bernie Sanders would get just over half from individuals and families.
Business, of course, is a broad term, and some of the new taxes Democrats propose would be felt by individuals, including shareholders, customers and workers. The candidates are also proposing a wide range of credits and deductions that would ultimately benefit a range of businesses, from electric-car makers to pharmaceutical-makers.
Here's a look at some details of the Democratic candidates' tax plans, courtesy of analyses by the Tax Policy Center:
Corporate tax rate:
Several Democrats want to raise the corporate rate from 21% back to 35%, but Mr. Biden prefers 28% and Amy Klobuchar, 25%. Ms. Warren has proposed a 7% tax on profits over $100 million, above and beyond a 35% tax rate, while Mr. Biden has pitched a 15% minimum tax on book income, offset by foreign taxes paid.
Partnerships and S-Corps:
Pete Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders would end a deduction adopted in 2017 that cut the taxes levied on the owners of businesses that don't pay corporate income taxes.
Overseas profits:
Most Democratic candidates have proposed altering portions of the 2017 tax overhaul's complex international provisions, which impose a minimum tax on U.S. companies' foreign income that's often below what they would pay on the same profits at home.
—Mr. Biden wants to raise the global minimum tax on U.S. firms to 21% and raise $200 billion from penalties on countries seen as facilitating tax shenanigans.
—Mr. Sanders wants companies to pay the same rate on foreign as on U.S. income and would limit the credit companies get for foreign tax payments and their deductions for the expense of moving production overseas.
—Ms. Warren would replace the global minimum with country-specific rates bringing tax rates on foreign income up to 35% with a 35% country-specific tax, and tax foreign companies based on their U.S. sales.
Manufacturing:
Mr. Biden would create a tax credit benefiting communities affected by manufacturing layoffs, while Ms. Klobuchar would create a tax preference for manufacturing investments in such communities and rural areas.
Banking:
Ms. Warren would charge banks 0.15% of liabilities other than deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Energy:
All the leading candidates say they would eliminate tax preferences benefiting fossil-fuel production, and several also would create or expand tax credits for displaced workers. Ms. Warren and Messrs. Bloomberg, Biden and Buttigieg propose expanding tax credits for solar and wind energy production.
Pharmaceuticals:
Mr. Buttigieg would tax drugmakers' gross sales each quarter they don't reach a negotiated price with federal health programs. He would also provide tax incentives to companies making drugs in the U.S. Mr. Biden would end tax deductions for drug advertising costs.
Private equity:
Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Warren would both eliminate the existing tax preference for carried interest, under which private-equity managers' profits are taxed as capital gains. Ms. Warren would also limit interest deductions for excessive debt used to acquire a company.

A week ago, Joe Biden's campaign was struggling and potentially near collapse. Since then, he has completed one of the most dramatic political turnarounds in recent memory with a string of primary wins that showed him to be the only candidate so far to expand the Democratic electorate, a claim that his top rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, had made for himself.
The reversal was the result of a combination of signaling from party insiders,
beginning with South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn
, and more organic decisions by millions of Democrats eager to defeat President Trump in November who quickly coalesced around Mr. Biden, turning him from underdog to potential nomination front-runner.
The electorate that backed Mr. Biden
in South Carolina
on Saturday and fueled his victories
in 10 of 14 states on Super Tuesday
had many similarities to the one that boosted his party in the 2018 midterm elections. Suburban voters turned out in droves, along with more traditional elements of the Democratic coalition, particularly African-American voters.
Mr. Sanders's appeal among the young, the liberal and the politically independent was too weak in many places to create the revolution he promised. Speaking to reporters Wednesday in Vermont, he acknowledged that he hadn't been as successful as he had hoped in increasing youth voter turnout. ""It isn't easy,"" he said.
He also called for a positive campaign between himself and Mr. Biden, before he suggested his opponent is incapable of creating change because he is too closely tied to corporate interests. ""What this campaign, I think, is increasingly about, is which side are you on?"" Mr. Sanders said.
Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a co-chairman of Mr. Biden's campaign, hit at Mr. Sanders on Wednesday. ""As he rails against the establishment, I just did not know that African-American voters in the South were considered part of the establishment,"" he told reporters.
In many states, those backing Mr. Sanders were simply outnumbered by more centrist Democrats, who showed far more enthusiasm for voting than four years ago, when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was considered the front-runner for her party's nomination and Donald Trump hadn't yet come to dominate the nation's politics. The electorate in many states was older and less liberal than in 2016.
Mr. Biden's comeback began in South Carolina, where a loss or underwhelming win would have been crippling. Mr. Clyburn's pivotal endorsement, delivered during a Feb. 26 news conference at a technical college outside Charleston, brought tears to Mr. Biden's eyes as the congressman spoke of his late wife's fondness for the former vice president and an elderly constituent who had asked Mr. Clyburn to make his views public.
""I don't think you can state enough the significance of Jim Clyburn's endorsement,"" said Harold Schaitberger, the general-president of the International Association of Fire Fighters and a longtime Biden friend. ""Not only the endorsement but the power of his words.""
Mr. Biden won South Carolina by nearly 30 points. Within 72 hours, about $15 million in fresh donations flowed into his campaign.
Mr. Biden quickly accrued the backing of three former foes: former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Rep. Beto O'Rourke of Texas. (Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg joined the roster of Biden supporters on Wednesday.)
The late endorsements earned significant media attention and appear to have moved many voters to Mr. Biden just before Super Tuesday, vote totals and exit polls suggest. They also may have helped Mr. Biden earn surprise victories in Minnesota and Texas.
Some 40% of Texas voters who settled on a candidate on election day itself backed Mr. Biden, compared with 10% who voted for Mr. Sanders, exit polls found. The decision process was similar in Minnesota and many other Super Tuesday states.
""This is a case where endorsements were able to drive popular support, rather than the other way around,"" said Marty Cohen, a political scientist at James Madison University in Virginia, who has studied the effect of insider endorsements.

The endorsements
by Mr. Buttigieg, Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. O'Rourke weren't coordinated, campaign officials said, but instead were made through individual considerations by the candidates. Mr. Buttigieg made the decision after consulting with aides and former President Obama by phone.
Mr. Biden's success follows a pattern of voter behavior common in elections, said Joe Trippi, a longtime Democratic strategist. Voters spend the early part of the primary process comparing the party's candidates to each other. Later, they compare the candidates to the incumbent president they hope to defeat, and their perspective can change.
""After they saw Bernie tie in Iowa, win New Hampshire, win Nevada, then suddenly the voters were confronted with, 'He is going to be our nominee.' And then you realize the risks in nominating Bernie against Trump and you ask, 'What's the alternative?' '' said Mr. Trippi.
Mr. Sanders has long argued that his brand of government activism would draw a broad coalition of voters eager to defeat Mr. Trump, describing his campaign as ""the strongest grass-roots movement of any campaign in modern American history.""
Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, a Methodist preacher, will speak at a rally for Mr. Biden in Kansas City, Mo., on Saturday ahead of that state's March 10 presidential primary election. Asked to give a preview of his remarks, Mr. Cleaver smiled. ""There's a lot of stuff in the Bible,"" he said, ""about resurrection.""
Michigan also looms on the March 10 primary slate, and Florida is the biggest prize March 17, as Messrs. Biden and Sanders are headed for a nomination fight that could drag into April or beyond.
William Frey, a senior demographer at the Brookings Institution in Washington who studies political trends, said of the strong turnout of moderate voters: ""I think it's a continuation of the trend we saw in the 2018 midterms, when there was huge turnout. A lot of it is a reaction to Trump.""
White women with college degrees strongly supported Mr. Biden and could be a source of strength for Democrats against Mr. Trump in November. ""They did a lot for Biden yesterday,"" Mr. Frey said. ""That's going to be a part of the coalition that the Democrats will be banking on.""
Voter turnout jumped by nearly 70% in Virginia over 2016 levels, unofficial results showed, while rising more than 40% in Texas and 16% in North Carolina, all states that Mr. Biden won. Mr. Biden, the man who most embodied the Democratic establishment, won substantial margins among African-Americans, a core Democratic group, as well as older voters.

The twin pillars of Mr. Sanders's support in 2016—voters under age 30, and political independents—were far less reliable this time around. Those groups either shrank as a share of the 2020 voter pool or were poached by rival candidates.
The senator barely won some of the biggest college communities, including Charlottesville, home to the University of Virginia. Montgomery County, home to Virginia Tech, favored Mr. Biden over Mr. Sanders. In North Carolina, Mr. Sanders won the county that is home to the UNC Asheville, but he lost to Mr. Biden in the home to UNC Chapel Hill.
Worse for Mr. Sanders: For all the talk that he would draw a wave of newcomers to the voter pool, those young voters made up a smaller share of the electorate than in 2016, while the share of voters age 65 and older rose.
Meanwhile, money is continuing to move Mr. Biden's way. Following his Super Tuesday performance, Mr. Biden attended a Los Angeles fundraiser at the home of former film studio executive Sherry Lansing, and his team has scheduled fundraisers during the month in Bethesda, Md., Chicago, Miami Beach, Phoenix and New York City, including one at the home of Jay Snyder, a principal at HBJ Investments.
Donors including financiers Blair Effron, Mark Gallogly and Marc Lasry have reached out to others recently to rally more financial support for Mr. Biden. ""It's not that hard,"" a person familiar with the efforts said. ""Who else are you going for?""

WASHINGTON—The deep partisan divide over the allegations against President Trump was on full display as the
Senate impeachment trial
moved into the
questioning period
and senators got their first chance to influence the trial.
The two-day questioning session comes as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.)
works to lock down enough support
to defeat a vote to bring in new witnesses and information to the trial. Wednesday's session offered a window into what senators on the fence about the witness decision were considering ahead of the vote, which is expected Friday.
Mr. Trump's lawyers used their answers to portray Democrats' case for impeachment as politically motivated, rushed and lacking evidence, and as falling well short of the bar needed to remove a president from office. Democratic managers said they were trying to block Mr. Trump from interfering in the 2020 election and mounted a forceful defense of the
articles of impeachment
—on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress—as they argued that Republican senators were holding Mr. Trump to an unusually low standard.
GOP leaders gave the first question to Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who submitted her query on behalf of herself as well as Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah, all Republican senators who are debating on siding with Democrats on a motion to bring in witnesses. They asked the president's lawyers for their guidance on how the Senate should view a situation where the president might have more than one reason to withhold aid from Ukraine last summer.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What questions are you hoping get asked and to whom? Why? Join the conversation below.
White House Deputy Counsel Pat Philbin answered by saying that in a situation where there are mixed motives, some personal and some in the public interest, the act isn't impeachable.
""All elected officials, to some extent, have in mind how their conduct, how their decisions, their policy decisions, will affect the next election,"" Mr. Philbin said. ""It can't be a basis for removing a president from office.""
The president's motivation for freezing aid to Ukraine, just as he was pressing the country to announce investigations that would benefit him politically, is at the heart of the impeachment case. Mr. Trump has said he did nothing wrong and called the impeachment a politically driven hoax.
In the Democratic senators' opening question, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York sought to underscore the importance of witnesses who could provide a firsthand account of the president's thinking. He asked the House managers if there could be a fair trial without calling former national security adviser John Bolton, who
alleges in a coming book
that Mr. Trump told him in August that he wanted to keep aid to Ukraine frozen until the country helped with investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.
The lead Democratic impeachment manager, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, responded: ""The short answer to that question is no,"" and told lawmakers to not wait for the book. Democrats need to pick up at least four Republicans to win a vote later this week opening the door for witnesses.
In tweets Wednesday, Mr. Trump urged Republicans to reject calling witnesses and called Mr. Bolton's yet unpublished book ""nasty & untrue.""
In the questioning session, the House Democrats and Mr. Trump's legal team differed sharply on questions of what sort of action is impeachable.
One of the president's lawyers, Alan Dershowitz, offered a new argument: that because Mr. Trump believes his re-election is in the public interest, even if he had political motivations in pressing Ukraine to open an investigation into the Bidens, it wouldn't be an impeachable offense.
""Every public official that I know believes that his election is in the public interest,"" Mr. Dershowitz said. ""If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.""
The president's lawyers had previously argued that Mr. Trump's decision to freeze aid wasn't driven by political considerations and that his push for investigations in Ukraine was due to his concerns about corruption in the country. The aid was released in September amid a bipartisan uproar in Congress.
Mr. Schiff, of California, shot back that if President Obama had asked Ukraine to investigate Mr. Romney, his 2012 opponent, the Senate would have found it impeachable. ""Are we ready to say the president can sacrifice the interest of that…country, because all quid pro quos are fine, it's carte blanche? Is that really what we're prepared to say?"" Mr. Schiff said.
The hypothetical continued in a later question, from Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Ted Cruz of Texas to Mr. Schiff. If Mr. Obama had had evidence that Mr. Romney's son was being paid $1 million a year by a corrupt Russian company and Mr. Romney had acted to benefit that company, they asked, would Mr. Obama then have legal authority to ask for that to be investigated.
Mr. Trump and his allies have said it was corrupt for the elder Mr. Biden to seek the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had once investigated a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Holdings, where his son sat on the board. Mr. Biden sought the prosecutor's removal as part of a broad international effort to combat corruption in Ukraine. The Bidens have denied wrongdoing.
Mr. Schiff said that the hypothetical didn't have a direct correlation and said the U.S. had ways to investigate corruption that didn't involve the president seeking a foreign leader's help.
Senators were given 16 hours over two days to submit questions to Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding, following
six days of arguments
by Democratic managers and Mr. Trump's legal team in which senators, acting as jurors, had to remain quiet.
Republican leaders, who on Tuesday said
they didn't have enough votes
to block witnesses, on Wednesday worked to dissuade Republicans from joining Democrats on seeking subpoenas. Mr. McConnell met Wednesday morning with Ms. Murkowski, who had said that she was curious about what Mr. Bolton had to say. After the meeting, Ms. Murkowski declined to discuss witnesses or her meeting.
""We will open Pandora's box if we move to talking about witnesses,"" said Sen. David Perdue (R., Ga.), a close ally of Mr. Trump who speaks to the president frequently.
Other GOP senators said they wanted to hear from witnesses. ""I'd like to hear from John Bolton,"" Mr. Romney said. Ms. Collins reiterated her support for witnesses ""to clarify some ambiguities.""
The House last fall had sought Mr. Bolton's testimony but declined to subpoena him, in Democrats' effort to move quickly and not get bogged down in court fights.

Separately, the National Security Council disclosed Wednesday that it told Mr. Bolton's lawyer last week that the manuscript of his book contained ""significant amounts"" of classified information, including some classified as top secret, and directed him to remove those materials before publishing, according to
a copy of the letter
viewed by The Wall Street Journal.
Chuck Cooper, Mr. Bolton's lawyer, didn't respond to a request for comment. Three days after the letter was sent, the New York Times published details of the manuscript on Sunday.
Meanwhile, more revelations emerged about Mr. Bolton's concerns about the administration's dealings with Ukraine. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.) said that in a Sept. 23 phone call weeks after Mr. Bolton left his post, Mr. Bolton urged him, unprompted, to have his committee look into the removal of the former ambassador to Ukraine. ""He strongly implied that something improper had occurred around her removal,"" Mr. Engel said.
Marie Yovanovitch's removal last spring is one of several key episodes in the impeachment inquiry. The former ambassador was for months targeted by Rudy Giuliani, who said he wanted to remove her because she was blocking his push for investigations in Ukraine. Mr. Trump, who has the right to replace ambassadors, ordered her removed after hearing complaints from Mr. Giuliani.

Bernie Sanders, in a final ad ahead of Monday's Iowa caucus, touts universal health care and free college, dismissing moderate alternatives to his ambitious agenda as mere half-measures.
Joe Biden, in his own ad, responds with warnings about moving too far left: ""This is no time to take a risk.""
The two 30-second spots frame the stakes for the U.S. economy. As Democratic voters choose a nominee to challenge President Trump in November,
starting in Iowa
, they will choose between two visions: a continuation of the more market-oriented approaches of the past two Democratic presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, or a more full-throated revival of the earlier, sweeping visions for big government, such as Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and Lyndon Johnson's Great Society.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Will Democratic voters choose center-left or far-left policies to take on the platform of President Trump? Why? Join the conversation below.
National and early-state polls suggest
Democrats are divided
. Roughly half support one of the self-proclaimed pragmatists, a group including former Vice President Biden, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg. Vermont Sen. Sanders, a democratic socialist, leads the bigger-government camp, joined by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
Most Democrats say they are hungry to oust Mr. Trump and
will unify around the eventual nominee
. But many worry the big ideological divisions could be hard to bridge this year, just as lingering acrimony with Sen. Sanders's camp hampered Hillary Clinton's bid in 2016. ""The question is whether we have an economic message that can win over at least half the country,"" says Jim Kessler, executive vice president at Third Way, a Washington think tank seeking middle ground between liberal goals of more equality with more business-friendly policies.
Moderates tout Mr. Clinton's 1992 ""New Democrats"" agenda of keeping the deficit in check, promoting growth, targeted tax cuts, job training and free trade. They cite the resulting Clinton boom of the 1990s, and also the recovery from the great financial crisis under Mr. Obama.
Before Mr. Clinton, Democrats lost five of the previous six presidential elections, the moderates note. Since Mr. Clinton, they won four of seven—and captured the popular vote twice even in those losses.
The moderates attribute such gains to the party's move to the center. ""If Democrats are seen as too far left,"" Mr. Kessler says, ""then Donald Trump wins re-election.""
Progressives, by contrast, are casting the 2020 election as a chance not just to retake the White House, but to smash the longstanding economic model they blame for stoking income and wealth inequality during the past four decades, even amid economic expansions.
In a recent report framing the intra-party ideological battle lines, the Roosevelt Institute—a progressive New York think tank seeking to define a 21st-century version of FDR's New Deal—calls the centrist approach as much a threat as Mr. Trump, and criticizes Democrats who seek ""policy tweaks rather than wholesale reforms.""
The Democratic field is, in fact, united over a number of policies that would move the party leftward. Candidates from both wings call for trillions of dollars in new federal spending on health care, child care and higher education. They agree on reorienting the American economy away from fossil fuels by mid-century.
They all support doubling the federal hourly minimum wage and giving labor unions new organizing powers. They rarely warn about the dangers of government debt and deficits, a major focus of the Clinton and Obama administrations. And
they all call for expanding Social Security
and Medicare and for higher taxes on corporations and capital gains.
Republicans say any leading Democrat would ""tank the economy, ruin health care, raise taxes,"" as Tim Murtaugh, communications director for Mr. Trump's re-election campaign, put it in commenting on the final pre-Iowa caucus debate Jan. 14.
While Democrats are all vilified by their GOP opponents, they differ sharply among themselves over what they believe ails the economy and how far they would go to fix it. Mr. Biden tends
to portray Mr. Trump as the main problem
to be solved. He envisions repealing many of the president's programs and replacing them with an updated version of Obama-era policies, adapted to new challenges.
Sanders-Warren backers see Mr. Trump as a symptom of deeper woes, of the desperation of long-struggling voters disaffected by the recent economic prescriptions of both parties. They say the party can only win back support with sweeping changes curbing the power of big corporations and the wealthy. Mr. Sanders portrays good-paying jobs, health care, education and affordable housing as not just policy goals, but as government-guaranteed economic rights.
According to a Wall Street Journal analysis of public statements by the candidates, Mr. Biden more frequently uses words like ""growth"" and ""opportunity,"" while Sens. Sanders and Warren are the most likely to invoke terms like ""billionaire,"" ""Wall Street"" and ""rigged.""
While Messrs. Biden and Buttigieg hold regular big-dollar fundraisers with affluent Democratic business donors, Sens. Warren and Sanders refuse to do so. They have largely avoided the veteran Clinton and Obama economic advisers who have shaped the Biden and Buttigieg plans. In mid-January, 18 liberal activist groups urged unity among Sens. Sanders and Warren backers in fighting what they called ""the corporate wing of the party.""

This Year's Iowa Caucuses Are Different. Here's How They'll Work.

The main economic flashpoints in the contest so far have been the progressive wing's support of universal government health care, free college and taxes on the wealthy, policies that would increase federal taxes and spending by tens of trillions of dollars over the next decade—more than triple the amounts proposed by their more-moderate rivals.
Wealth-tax proponents see it not only as a means to pay for their big-ticket items, but also to curb the power of the rich. Opponents say the tax is inefficient, unconstitutional and unnecessarily vilifies success. Liberals, meantime, say the private health insurance market is so broken that only a fully government-run system can replace it. The moderate camp continues to favor a blend between the public and private sectors.
In the free-college debate, liberals want to expand the roster of universal entitlements as a way of building broad-based public support, while moderates warn of excessive costs.
""We have an obligation to be fiscally responsible,"" Ms. Klobuchar said in the December Democratic debate in Los Angeles, making sure voters understand the party is ""honest with them about what we can pay for.""

Facebook's Relationship With Democrats Hits Low Point

The economic policy divide extends to less prominent issues as well. Both Sens. Klobuchar and Warren have sought to bolster antitrust policies to curb corporate power. But Ms. Klobuchar's platform calls for toughening the process—to ""update the standards for reviewing … mergers,"" and ""to undertake aggressive retrospective review of mergers.""
Ms. Warren promises clear results on antitrust: ""My administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector,"" she says, ""including breaking up Amazon, Facebook and Google.""
While all the main candidates float new regulations for industries from pharmaceuticals to fossil fuels, Ms. Warren is the only one with a broad blueprint for overhauling American business: requiring a federal charter for all big companies, limiting the ability of executives to sell shares, and setting aside 40% of all board seats for worker-elected directors.
That type of expansive agenda has sparked a backlash from the Democratic economic establishment. Speaking at a Brookings Institution panel in Washington on Tuesday, Harvard economist Lawrence Summers labeled the types of ideas promoted by Sens. Warren and Sanders as fanciful. A leading architect of Clinton and Obama economic policies, he said: ""What we should not do is launch untried, massive experiments.""

Joe Biden's field-narrowing romp in a string of primaries, along with the Democratic National Committee's decision to pull the live audience over coronavirus concerns, means Sunday's debate in Washington, D.C., could be a quieter affair than the 10 that preceded it.
Still, Bernie Sanders, in a blunt assessment of his improbable path to the Democratic nomination Wednesday, made plain that he wouldn't clear the way for Mr. Biden. He offered a preview of the 2020 cycle's first one-on-one debate between the pair and pledged to press the former vice president on a range of liberal policy issues.
The scaled-down, televised event comes after Mr. Biden dominated a series of nominating contests over the past two weeks, opening up a wide delegate lead that will be hard for Mr. Sanders to close. The race moves next week to another group of states that are mostly friendly to Mr. Biden.
Mr. Sanders -- who was the front-runner and center of attention at the last Democratic debate in Charleston, S.C., in February -- acknowledged in his remarks Wednesday that his circumstances have changed.
""Today, I say to the Democratic establishment: In order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""And you must speak to the issues of concern to them.""
Repeatedly calling Mr. Biden ""my friend Joe,"" he went on to list issues he said were important to his ardent supporters, including climate change, student debt and income inequality. His aides confirmed they view the debate as an opportunity to push his agenda.
""Bernie knows his base better than anybody,"" said Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist who backed Mr. Sanders in 2016.
""They aren't just going to line up behind Biden. What he did was tell Biden exactly how to win his supporters. It was a hell of a cheat sheet,"" she said.
Mr. Biden, meanwhile, will stay focused on President Trump, while making the case that he can make ""real, lasting progressive change in this country and in people's lives,"" according to a campaign spokesperson.
Allies of both candidates said they expected the duo to be more critical of President Trump than of each other.
The matchup will be the first this election cycle without any female candidates, after all of the women in the race dropped out except Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who didn't qualify for the debate.
The one-on-one matchup could also give Mr. Biden more preparation to face Mr. Trump in general-election debates, if he ends up securing the Democratic nomination.
""A Bernie versus Biden debate needs to happen,"" said Adam Green, co-founder of the liberal group Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which backed Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. ""Biden has to withstand one-on-one scrutiny similar to a debate with Trump.""

Bernie Sanders concedes he is currently losing the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination. But the
Vermont senator is staying in the fight
to try to win a bigger war: his lifelong crusade to push the party's economic agenda further to the left.
The
candidate wants to dramatically expand government
in order to address ""the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality in this country,"" as he put it Wednesday.
Mr. Sanders's uncompromising adherence to his liberal ideals has been both his strength and weakness in this campaign. It energizes his core supporters, who favor his purity over more flexible rivals. But it has also turned off

Democrats who dislike his ideas or worry they are unrealistic
, and that his stubbornness would keep him from the give-and-take necessary to accomplish change in Washington. As Mr. Sanders himself has acknowledged, many also worry that his far-left position could make it hard to draw enough voters to beat President Trump in a general election. The escalating coronavirus crisis might also make Americans more risk-averse when choosing a leader.
Mr. Sanders argues that voters agree with his platform, even if they are skeptical of his candidacy. ""Poll after poll…shows that a strong majority of the American people support our progressive agenda,"" he said, in explaining why he would continue his
campaign against front-runner Joe Biden
, despite two straight weeks of big primary losses and mounting calls for him to drop out and unify the party against Mr. Trump.
He vowed to use this Sunday's debate, the first solely between the two candidates, to press his rival for detailed plans for expanding health care, reducing childhood poverty and curbing the political power of billionaires. The candidates face primaries on Tuesday in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio.
Mr. Sanders's bid to
remake Democratic economic thinking
remains one of the most intense conflicts in this election cycle, pitting him against affluent party donors and longtime policy makers who share many of his general goals, but prefer a less government-oriented, or more tempered approach.
Surveys indicate a party electorate torn. A February Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed 53% of Democratic voters preferred a candidate pushing Sanders-like ""larger scale policies that might cost more"" and ""bring major change,"" versus 41% favoring a Biden-like candidate ""who proposes smaller scale policies that…will bring less change.""
But the same poll found Democrats, by 53% to 42%, favored a candidate ""with the best chance to defeat Donald Trump"" over one ""closest to your views""—and they have increasingly concluded Mr. Biden has the best chance.
When Mr. Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, appeared ascendant last month in the nominating contest, his sweeping platform of national health care, universal free college and a Green New Deal drew blistering criticism from Democratic stalwarts.
Harvard economist Lawrence Summers, a top adviser to both Presidents Clinton and Obama, predicted ""major adverse consequences"" for workers, markets and business investment should Mr. Sanders prevail. Former Obama White House chief economist Jason Furman, also now at Harvard, said the Sanders program would lead to ""too many individuals too constrained from choices"" and ""a weaker economy."" The Progressive Policy Institute, a Washington center-left think tank, branded the Sanders platform ""fiscal fantasy.""
None of that moved Mr. Sanders to soften his policies. Instead, Mr. Sanders and his aides have blasted the criticism and the critics as tainted and out of touch. They blame moderate Democratic economists and think tanks, as much as Republicans, for long-term wage stagnation and other economic worries still haunting millions of Americans despite the long expansion.
""We need to think outside the box,"" said Warren Gunnels, Mr. Sanders's longtime policy adviser. ""Over the past 45 years we've seen a massive increase in income and wealth inequality while the working class continues to struggle. It's too late for establishment economics.""
Mr. Sanders is more likely to discuss fostering a ""moral economy"" than strategies to boost gross domestic product, business investment or corporate profits. With his ""economic bill of rights,"" he wants Washington to guarantee all Americans a job, health insurance, college and housing.
Many Democratic economists ""would argue those are fine aspirations, but in order to achieve them, you'd have to intervene in markets beyond levels they're comfortable with,"" said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the chief economist in the Obama administration for then-Vice President Biden.
Mr.
Sanders proposes sharply higher taxes
, bigger government spending and more regulation. He would boost the size of the federal government's share of GDP to a level exceeded only once, during World War II.
While many Democrats over the past few decades have tried to balance government intervention with market forces, Mr. Sanders has less trust in the power of markets to improve lives. On Thursday, he said his big-government vision of a national health-care plan and price controls on drug companies would put the country on stronger footing to address crises such as the coronavirus pandemic.
At times, he has dismissed cost concerns outright. Asked at a Feb. 18 CNN Las Vegas town hall about the price and feasibility of his plan to phase out fossil fuels, he replied: ""You tell me how much is too much if we're talking about saving this planet.""
Mr. Sanders wants to smash the conventional wisdom that he says has constrained thinking in Washington since Ronald Reagan—a consensus that treats higher taxes and new government programs with suspicion—and reopen discussion of liberal ideas that haven't been seriously considered since the 1970s.
The candidate already claims victory on that front, recounting how proposals from his failed 2016 bid, dismissed at the time as too far left, have since been embraced by Democratic party leaders.
One fight with Hillary Clinton, who won the 2016 Democratic nomination, was over his push to double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. The Democratic-led House last year passed a bill seeking to make that law, while all his 2020 rival candidates endorsed the goal. Mr. Sanders's 2016 proposal for a Wall Street tax on certain financial transactions was also embraced by much of the 2020 field. Mr. Biden's current positions on many issues, such as expanding the Social Security and Medicare entitlement programs, have moved him closer to Mr. Sanders than the longtime Delaware politician has been for much of his career.
""I have been called radical and extreme,"" Mr. Sanders said during an Iowa campaign stop last year. ""Over the last four years…a whole lot of other people have become radical and extreme.""
Even some mainstream center-left economists praise Mr. Sanders's bid to shake up the Washington consensus on restricting spending. ""All upper-income democracies in the world have much more generous welfare states than the U.S. and do fine,"" said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank that has long advised both Republican and Democratic administrations. ""We've gone so far off the rails in terms of underinvestment in the public sphere that even a massive shift would only get us part way to where we should be,"" Mr. Posen said.
The Sanders campaign has been the only major one in this election cycle to avoid even talking to top advisers of previous Democratic presidents. Economists who weren't part of the Clinton or Obama administrations have been close to the Sanders campaign. One is
Stephanie Kelton, a professor at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, N.Y., who served as an aide to Mr. Sanders on the Senate Budget Committee
. She is the leading proponent of ""modern monetary theory,"" which argues that governments shouldn't fret over debt and deficits.
Another is
Darrick Hamilton of Ohio State University, whose work focuses on what he calls ""economic justice."" He aims to narrow the wealth gap between black and white households
and has been a proponent of the federal job guarantee idea that Mr. Sanders has endorsed.
Mr.
Sanders's wealth tax
was written with the help of two French economists at the University of California, Berkeley, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren had a similar plan influenced by their work. Until she dropped out in early March, she was Mr. Sanders's competitor for the liberal lane in the nominating contest.
The Progressive Policy Institute estimates that Mr. Sanders is proposing adding just over $50 trillion in spending over 10 years, nearly doubling the federal government's current outlays. The new funds would mainly be used to expand the social safety net and to increase infrastructure spending.
That is more than eight times the spending proposed by Mr. Biden, and about 40% more than what Ms. Warren had proposed, according to PPI estimates.
Mr. Sanders would boost taxes by more than $20 trillion over 10 years, according to PPI, through increases in income, payroll and corporate taxes, as well as the new wealth tax. That could increase revenues collected under current policies by about half. That is about the same as Ms. Warren had planned but is six times the tax hikes laid out by Mr. Biden.
Most mainstream economists say spending and taxes on that scale would so distort the economy and private-sector activity that it would undermine growth. They warn that significantly higher tax rates could damp incentives for businesses and individuals to invest, while bigger payouts to households could curb incentives to work. They add that attempts by regulators to override market outcomes can impose costly inefficiencies in affected industries.
Share Your Thoughts
Has Bernie Sanders changed the economic agenda of the Democratic Party? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Gunnels, the Sanders aide, dismissed concerns about boosting the size of government. ""If we were a poor country…these would be legitimate questions,"" he said. ""We're not living in a Third World country. It's not too much to ask that everybody in this country has a decent standard of living.""
Sanders allies said his platform has successful 20th-century parallels: Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1930s New Deal, which created Social Security and a raft of new government programs and regulations; and Lyndon B. Johnson's 1960s Great Society, which created Medicare and new antipoverty initiatives.
Harvard's Mr. Summers said the scale of Mr. Sanders's proposals would far exceed anything FDR or LBJ enacted, or even what South Dakota Democratic Sen. George McGovern proposed during his 1972 landslide loss to Richard Nixon, a defeat that helped usher in the party's retreat from liberalism.
If Mr. Sanders were able to enact his full program, government as a share of GDP would jump from the 2017 level of about 38%, one of the lowest levels in the developed world, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, to more than 50%. That is well above any peacetime level in U.S. history, but in line with European countries such as France and Denmark.
Mr. Sanders and his supporters have embraced the European model—in 2016, in response to gibes he wanted ""America to look more like Scandinavia,"" he replied, ""What's wrong with that?""
He also envisions
a raft of new government regulations
, from national rent control to new rules for CEO pay to an outright ban on fracking.
While some Democratic economists prefer to address climate change with market incentives, such as a carbon tax, Mr. Sanders would rely more on direct government orders. To protect energy workers who might lose their jobs as Mr. Sanders moved to phase out fossil fuels, he promises five years of government-guaranteed salary, plus housing assistance, pension support and retirement subsidies for those who decide not to continue working.
That ""would be an utter nightmare to enforce,"" said Dean Baker, an economist at the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, saying it would be difficult to flesh out the criteria for who exactly would qualify. ""What about the person who works for the supplier to an oil company? What about the person who lost his job one month before the Green New Deal? It's quite hard to do these things as a practical matter.""
Mr. Sanders would aim to shrink the role of the financial sector in the economy by, among other things, breaking up the largest banks, and reimposing Depression-era limits on banking activity.
He would make it harder for employers to fire workers, unionized or not, and would require big companies to give workers shares of company stock and the right to choose nearly half the seats on corporate boards. His goal is to recalibrate the balance of power between corporations and unions, who have seen their clout erode steadily over the past 40 years.
""In Bernie Sanders's world, the market doesn't come from a state of nature, it comes out of an allocation of power,"" said Robert Reich, a Berkeley public policy professor, who served as President Clinton's labor secretary and has periodically defended Mr. Sanders against attacks from other academics. ""The standard economic view is that the market is filled with potential win-win opportunities, but when you're talking about power, it's more complicated. Some people gain it and others lose it.""

While some Democrats are nervous about Sen. Bernie Sanders capturing the Democratic presidential nomination, he cites polls suggesting he can beat President Trump in November. PHOTO: Victor J. Blue for The Wall Street Journal
MYRTLE BEACH, S.C.—Some Democrats in Southern states from North Carolina to Florida are anxious about Bernie Sanders winning the Democratic presidential nomination, saying it could jeopardize a closely-won governor's seat, reverse recent gains in state legislatures and turn what might be competitive congressional races into GOP landslides.
South Carolina House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford said Mr. Sanders, who has
surged to the top of the national polls
in the Democratic presidential primary, would bomb with South Carolina Democrats, including the socially and fiscally moderate constituents in his predominantly African-American district that includes Columbia.
Mr. Rutherford recently endorsed Democratic candidate Michael Bloomberg, even though the former New York mayor isn't on the ballot in Saturday's primary. He said he wanted to send up a flare that Democrats need resources and momentum to derail a Sanders nomination and beat President Trump.
""How do we explain to our people what democratic socialism is when we don't even know?"" Mr. Rutherford said, referring to Mr. Sanders's self-described ideology. ""It would be a bloodbath.""
At a Wednesday rally of 2,800 people in this fast-growing retiree mecca, Mr. Sanders said his critics were ignoring nearly 50 national polls that show he is the Democratic candidate who would beat Mr. Trump.

""We are putting together the strongest grass roots movement we've seen in a long time,"" he said, to cheers. ""We are beating Trump because our agenda is the agenda of the working families of this country.""
State Rep. Justin Bamberg, a longtime Sanders backer who represents a rural district in the central part of South Carolina, said Mr. Sanders would bring voters to the polls, which he said will help other Democrats on the ballot. To say otherwise is a scare tactic, he said.
""If you can't beat him straight up, you play Jenga with him, and try to undermine him,"" he said. ""It's not gonna work.""
Across the border in North Carolina, Mr. Sanders's ascendancy sent some leading Democrats from supporting former Vice President Joe Biden to rallying behind Mr. Bloomberg.
At a recent Bloomberg rally in Raleigh, Senate Minority Leader Dan Blue said a far-left candidate like Mr. Sanders would lose big in a state nearly evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, where President Obama won in 2008 and lost in 2012.
A loss at the top of the ticket could jeopardize Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's re-election chances as well as Democrats' prospects of gaining seats in the GOP-led legislature, said Mr. Blue, who in his previous role was the first African-American speaker of the state House. Mr. Cooper won the governor's chair in 2016 by roughly 10,000 votes—out of more than 5 million cast.
Democrats won enough seats in 2018 to break a GOP supermajority in the North Carolina House, and they picked up seats in the Senate, making it easier to advocate for increased teacher pay and other Democratic priorities, Mr. Blue said. Maintaining or adding to their ranks is critical in 2020 because of the coming round of redistricting and the possibility of approving Medicaid expansion, he said.
""Who we nominate matters for our country, but it also matters for our state races,"" Mr. Blue said. ""Beating Trump is one thing, but after that, we have a lot of problems to solve.""
Tommy Hendrickson, a former Democratic state chairman and longtime fundraiser who co-hosted an event in October for Mr. Biden, shifted his support to Mr. Bloomberg in mid-February.
""If we nominate Bernie, everybody's vulnerable,"" he said. ""Bernie for us is the equivalent of (George) McGovern,"" the liberal Democratic senator who lost 49 states in 1972 to GOP President Nixon.
Mr. Bloomberg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who is also running for the Democratic nomination, are the advertised headliners for a Saturday rally in Charlotte hosted by the North Carolina Democratic Party, with Mr. Cooper and Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez expected to attend. The state's primary is on Super Tuesday, March 3. The state party said it invited all Democratic candidates, including Mr. Sanders.

What would a winning strategy for moderate Democrats look like? Join the conversation below.
Earlier this week, Florida Democrats fretted over Mr. Sanders's potential alienation of constituencies like Cuban-Americans and Jewish voters, with
his characterization of the late Fidel Castro's education policie
s in Cuba and his stated refusal to attend the annual conference of the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee. The Florida Democratic Party issued a statement noting that party members ""need to understand our immigrant communities' shared stories.""
In South Carolina, Democratic leader Mr. Rutherford said a Sanders nomination would wipe out the hope of picking up seats in fast-growing places, including suburbs of Charlotte that are just south of the state line.
At a luncheon this week for House Democrats, Mr. Rutherford said a Sanders nomination would, at best, let him hold his 44 seats in the House to Republicans' 80. Forget about gains, he said, or holding on to Democrats' newly won Charleston congressional seat.
""With Bernie, you're only competitive where you already are,"" he said. ""In districts that could swing the other way, we all lose.""

WASHINGTON—Taking a victory lap a day after
he was acquitted
in the Senate impeachment trial, President Trump said he ""went through hell"" during what he deemed a politically driven investigation and called top Democrats ""very evil and sick people"" for seeking his removal from office.
Before an audience of aides and Republican allies, Mr. Trump offered freewheeling remarks from the East Room of the White House on Thursday. Speaking for just over an hour, he characterized the event as a celebration, while taking swings at political rivals who he alleged have been targeting him since he took office.
""We've been going through this now for over three years. It was evil, it was corrupt, it was dirty cops, it was leakers and liars, and this should never, ever happen to another president, ever,"" Mr. Trump said.
Holding up a copy of a newspaper with the headline ""Trump Acquitted,"" he quipped: ""It's the only good headline I've had in the Washington Post.""
He reiterated his stance that he did nothing improper regarding Ukraine, and called former special counsel
Robert Mueller's earlier probe
into possible ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia ""all bullshit.""
The remarks came one day after the Republican-led Senate acquitted Mr. Trump on
two articles of impeachment
stemming from his efforts to
press Ukraine
to announce investigations that would benefit him politically in this year's election, including a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate.
Mr. Trump's comments about Democratic leaders also came on the heels of his
State of the Union speech
on Tuesday night, when he didn't shake the hand offered by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), and she ripped up her copy of his address at its conclusion.
""He is impeached forever, no matter what he says or the headlines he wanted to carry around,"" Mrs. Pelosi said in remarks to reporters on Thursday. She added that Mr. Trump was ""never getting rid of that scar.""
Mrs. Pelosi also defended tearing up the speech, calling the address ""a manifesto of mistruths"" and her action necessary to ""get the attention of the American people.""

President's Second-Term Agenda Still on the Drawing Board

The combative comments from Mr. Trump on Thursday and the vigorous response from Mrs. Pelosi made clear that the
rancorous political climate
between Democrats and Republicans will continue even with impeachment over.
Republicans cheered Mr. Trump's acquittal in the Senate and have called his impeachment part of a three-year effort to delegitimize the 2016 election and remove the president from office nine months before Democrats face him again at the ballot box.
Democrats said Mr. Trump's acquittal amounted to a defeat for the institution of Congress, and they warned that leaving Mr. Trump in office would free him to try to cheat again in this year's election.
In his White House event, the mood was triumphant, with guests hugging and slapping each other on the back. The crowd gave Mr. Trump more than a half-dozen standing ovations. He thanked various supporters in the room by name, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). Mr. Trump also thanked his Senate impeachment legal team.
He didn't mention personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, whose efforts in Ukraine were at the center of the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Giuliani wasn't in attendance.
Mr. Trump also continued his criticism of Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah), who was the
lone Republican to vote to convict
the president on the first article of impeachment. Without naming him, Mr. Trump said there were ""some that used religion as a crutch"" and called him a failed presidential candidate.
Mr. Romney, the 2012 GOP candidate against President Obama, said Wednesday that he was a very religious person and reached an ""inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded"" that he vote to convict Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump took two tacks toward Democrats in his White House speech. He called for bipartisanship, citing infrastructure and drug prices as areas of common interest. If Republicans and Democrats work together, ""what we can do is incredible,"" he said.
But he also continued to question the goodwill of Democrats. Earlier, in remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast, Mr. Trump appeared to reference Mrs. Pelosi, saying he doesn't like ""people who say, 'I pray for you,' when they know that's not so.""
Mrs. Pelosi, who was seated at a long table near the lectern at the breakfast, clapped as he entered the room. Later, she told reporters that she did pray for Mr. Trump, while criticizing his actions in office as ""so off the track of our Constitution, our values, our country.""
Mr. Trump's appearance at the breakfast marked the fourth year he has addressed the annual gathering, which is hosted by members of Congress and has been running since 1953. Presidents of both parties traditionally attend the event. Mr. Trump enjoys
strong support from evangelical Christians
, who were a key piece of his winning 2016 coalition.
Before Mr. Trump spoke at the breakfast, there was a keynote address from Arthur Brooks, former president of the American Enterprise Institute, who urged the audience to rise above the country's divided political climate.
Mr. Trump, known for his combative style, acknowledged the message when he took the lectern, but said: ""Arthur, I don't know if I agree with you.""

South Carolina is a make-or-break state for former Vice President Joe Biden, who was the national Democratic primary front-runner for much of 2019 but who has watched Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont rack up a delegate lead after the first three contests. Because the state doesn't permit early voting, Tuesday night's debate could significantly influence people who are still making up their minds ahead of Saturday's voting.
Besides Messrs. Biden and Sanders, on stage will be former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and billionaire activist Tom Steyer.
The debate is set to start at 8 p.m. ET and is expected to run about two hours. It will air on CBS and also stream on CBSN.
Here's what we'll be watching:
Will Sanders finally have a target on his back?
Mr. Sanders, fresh off a decisive win in the Nevada caucuses Saturday, is the indisputable leader of the Democratic presidential field. This is likely to be the debate where the others in the race treat him as such.
This debate will have to be about ""one candidate"" who is ""on pace to amass an insurmountable delegate lead,"" Dan Kanninen, states director for Mr. Bloomberg's campaign, told reporters on Monday.
Even Mr. Sanders's aides have expressed surprise that his opponents haven't gone after him harder in the nine previous debates, including
in Las Vegas last week
, where new participant
Mr. Bloomberg took most of the incoming fire.

Mr. Buttigieg,
who did well in Iowa and New Hampshire
but struggled with Nevada's more diverse electorate, gave a fiery speech on Saturday urging Democrats to ""take a sober look"" at the party's general-election chances if the Vermont senator, who identifies as a democratic socialist, is at the top of the ticket.

""Sen. Sanders believes in an inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans,"" the former mayor said.
South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn said Sunday on ABC's ""This Week"" that Mr. Sanders as the nominee would be ""a real burden for us in these states or congressional districts that we have to do well in.""
And Mr. Bloomberg's campaign is promoting a digital ad against Mr. Sanders that details the National Rifle Association's past support for him.
Watch for candidates to make those arguments—and sharply question how Mr. Sanders would pay for some of his top initiatives, such as Medicare for All, on the Charleston stage.
It isn't clear what a late-stage pummeling of Mr. Sanders on national television could mean for his chances—he is leading the field in national polls and surveys of several coming states. One exception is South Carolina, where Mr. Biden is outperforming him.
How will Bloomberg handle a rematch with Warren?
After the Massachusetts senator's pummeling of Mr. Bloomberg last week in what was the most-watched debate of the primary, viewers may tune in to see what happens between the two in Charleston.
Ms. Warren ripped the former New York mayor for his commentary about women's appearances over the years, directly comparing him with President Trump, and for reaching nondisclosure agreements with former employees who filed lawsuits against Bloomberg LP. Mr. Bloomberg, making his first debate appearance, stumbled over his answers and at one point rolled his eyes at Ms. Warren, though he later
said that he was releasing three former employees from their NDAs.

He has been off the campaign trail preparing for the next debate for days and is hoping to better defend himself in Charleston.
The antipathy between the two is nearly a decade in the making. Mr. Bloomberg endorsed and raised money for Ms. Warren's opponent, Republican incumbent Sen. Scott Brown, in the 2012 Massachusetts Senate race, saying he appreciated Mr. Brown's decisive vote against a congressional right-to-carry gun bill. At the time, it was also clear that the billionaire businessman hard-wired to Wall Street wasn't a fan of the woman who had spent years pursuing tighter restrictions on the financial services industry.
""You can question, in my mind, whether she's God's gift to regulation, close the banks and get rid of corporate profits, and we'd all bring socialism back, or the U.S.S.R.,"" Mr. Bloomberg said of Ms. Warren in an October 2012 interview with the New York Times.
Ms. Warren's team believes her performance helped her with Nevadans who caucused after the debate, so she might be looking for another fight.
Can Biden finish strong in his 'firewall' state?
Mr. Biden has staked his presidential bid on what happens in South Carolina, where he draws strong support from the state's large bloc of black voters. Mr. Biden bombed in Iowa and New Hampshire and placed a distant second to Mr. Sanders in Nevada.
The former vice president and his campaign strategists have pleaded with donors and supporters to hang on until South Carolina, where they expect to win. Mr. Biden will be looking to use the debate to close the deal with South Carolina voters and revive his campaign. As he has in the past, he will likely emphasize his relationship with President Obama, one key factor in his popularity with black voters.
But a weak debate performance could prompt more black voters to look elsewhere.
A recent Wall Street Journal/ NBC News poll
included troubling signs for Mr. Biden, showing that nationally, black voters are beginning to peel away from him.
Which moderate will emerge on top?
Messrs. Biden, Buttigieg and Bloomberg and Ms. Klobuchar have tried to present themselves as more-electable alternatives to Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, who both back more-liberal policies like Medicare for All.
Yet Democratic strategists have been increasingly vocal about concerns that there are too many moderate candidates and no clarity as to who is best positioned to face Mr. Sanders in a two-person race.
Obvious animosity between Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg in the Nevada debate made for great TV. Now, all four will be trying to demonstrate they can consolidate centrist support and take on Mr. Sanders before he amasses an insurmountable delegate lead.
What will the other billionaire do?
Mr. Steyer largely disappeared from the Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada contests while he focused on South Carolina, where state polls show he has been making progress.
He hopes to use the Tuesday debate to make a closing case to South Carolina voters. But he will be in an awkward position: Mr. Steyer supports liberal policies to tax wealthy Americans, but he may have to defend using his own money to further his presidential aspirations, as Mr. Bloomberg is doing.

Democratic presidential candidates are debating in Charleston, S.C., as the rivals of Bernie Sanders are expected to challenge the early front-runner prior to Saturday's South Carolina primary and next week's delegate-rich Super Tuesday contests.
The Vermont senator's
massive win in Nevada
last week cemented him as
the front-runner
in the Democratic presidential race and added to
the concerns of moderates
in his party who don't agree with some of his policies and fear nominating a self-described democratic socialist would be a mistake.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Which candidate has the most to win or lose from their debate performance? Why? Join the conversation below.
Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg—who is second in the delegate hunt—former Vice President Joe Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar,
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren
and billionaire activist Tom Steyer are all hoping a strong performance on stage will give them a boost in the South Carolina primary and the 14 states that vote on March 3, known as Super Tuesday.
Meanwhile, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is hoping to redeem himself after
a lackluster debate performance
last week. Mr. Bloomberg isn't competing in South Carolina and is hoping that about half a billion dollars
he has put into
TV, radio and digital advertising will help make him moderate Democrats' consensus choice to take on Mr. Sanders.

Dan Kanninen, states director for Mr. Bloomberg's campaign, said Monday that his team believes this debate will have to be centered on one candidate who is ""on pace to amass an insurmountable delegate lead,"" referring to Mr. Sanders.
Some candidates have previewed that they will go after the lawmaker for calling himself a democratic socialist, portraying it as a tag that could hurt not only him in a general election but bring down other Democrats running for office, too.
A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed 
Mr. Sanders leading
President Trump in a hypothetical matchup. But Mr. Trump's team
has already been trying
to tie Democrats to socialism, particularly in appeals to Venezuelan and Cuban Americans in Florida.
Rivals are also likely to seize on comments Mr. Sanders made in a ""60 Minutes"" interview Sunday, in which he defended past positive comments about communist Cuban leader Fidel Castro's literacy program.
Mr. Sanders continued to defend his views in a CNN town hall Monday, saying: ""I think teaching people to read and write is a good thing. I have been extremely consistent and critical of all authoritarian regimes all over the world, including Cuba.""
Mr. Buttigieg said during a CNN town hall that he didn't think Democrats wanted to explain ""why our nominee is encouraging people to look on the bright side of the Castro regime when we're going into the election of our lives. We need to stand unequivocally against dictatorships everywhere in the world.""
Mr. Biden, who has campaigned with Democrats who won seats in 2018 that were previously held by Republicans, has said that Mr. Sanders will make it difficult for those candidates to be re-elected.
Mr. Biden is jostling with Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Klobuchar for the support of moderate Democrats. The former vice president has seen his comfortable lead in South Carolina dwindle in recent polls, and
he needs to do well
in the state to prove he can build the diverse coalition he has promised would propel him to the White House. A lackluster performance Tuesday could hurt his chances at winning and further boost Mr. Sanders. Mr. Steyer has also concentrated resources on the state and will be looking to make an impact.
Mr. Bloomberg is likely to encounter scrutiny after being the center of attention in the last debate. He has stayed out of the public eye preparing for this gathering. Last week in Las Vegas, Ms. Warren grilled him over the number of nondisclosure agreements he had signed with women who made accusations about his behavior in lawsuits against Bloomberg LP. Mr. Bloomberg later said that
he was releasing
three former employees from their NDAs.
Ms. Warren appears to be ready to attack him again. On Tuesday morning, her campaign released a new ad highlighting Mr. Bloomberg's support for her Republican opponent during her 2012 Senate campaign.

Bernie Sanders concedes he is losing the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination. But the Vermont senator is still fighting a bigger war: his lifelong crusade to push the party's economic agenda to the left.
The candidate wants to dramatically expand government in order to address ""the grotesque level of income and wealth inequality in this country,"" as he put it Wednesday.
Mr. Sanders's uncompromising adherence to his liberal ideals has been both his strength and weakness in this campaign. It energizes his core supporters, who favor his purity over more flexible rivals. But it has also turned off Democrats who dislike his ideas or worry they are unrealistic, and that his stubbornness would keep him from the give-and-take necessary to accomplish change in Washington. As Mr. Sanders himself has acknowledged, many also worry that his far-left position could make it hard to draw enough voters to beat President Trump in a general election. The escalating coronavirus crisis might also make Americans more risk-averse in choosing a leader.
Mr. Sanders argues that voters agree with his platform, even if they are skeptical of his candidacy. ""Poll after poll . . . shows that a strong majority of the American people support our progressive agenda,"" he said, in explaining why he would continue his campaign against front-runner Joe Biden, despite two straight weeks of primary losses and calls for him to drop out and unify the party against Mr. Trump.
He vowed to use Sunday's debate, the first solely between the two candidates, to press his rival for detailed plans for expanding health care, reducing childhood poverty and curbing the political power of billionaires. The candidates face primaries on Tuesday in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio.
Mr. Sanders's bid to remake Democratic economic thinking remains one of the most intense conflicts in this election cycle, pitting him against affluent party donors and policy makers who share many of his general goals, but prefer a less government-oriented, or more tempered approach.
Surveys indicate a party electorate torn. A February Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed 53% of Democratic voters preferred a candidate pushing Sanders-like ""larger scale policies that might cost more"" and ""bring major change,"" versus 41% favoring a Biden-like candidate ""who proposes smaller scale policies that . . . will bring less change.""
But the same poll found Democrats, by 53% to 42%, favored a candidate ""with the best chance to defeat Donald Trump"" over one ""closest to your views"" -- and they have increasingly concluded Mr. Biden has the best chance.
When Mr. Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist, appeared ascendant last month in the nominating contest, his sweeping platform of national health care, universal free college and a Green New Deal drew blistering criticism from Democratic stalwarts.
Harvard economist Lawrence Summers, a top adviser to both Presidents Clinton and Obama, predicted ""major adverse consequences"" for workers, markets and business investment should Mr. Sanders prevail. Former Obama White House chief economist Jason Furman, also now at Harvard, said the Sanders program would lead to ""too many individuals too constrained from choices"" and ""a weaker economy."" The Progressive Policy Institute, a Washington center-left think tank, branded the platform ""fiscal fantasy.""
None of that moved Mr. Sanders to soften his policies. Instead, Mr. Sanders and his aides have blasted the criticism and the critics as tainted and out of touch. They blame moderate Democratic economists and think tanks, as much as Republicans, for long-term wage stagnation and other economic worries still haunting millions of Americans.
""We need to think outside the box,"" said Warren Gunnels, Mr. Sanders's policy adviser. ""Over the past 45 years we've seen a massive increase in income and wealth inequality while the working class continues to struggle. It's too late for establishment economics.""
Mr. Sanders is more likely to discuss fostering a ""moral economy"" than strategies to boost gross domestic product, business investment or corporate profits. With his ""economic bill of rights,"" he wants Washington to guarantee all Americans a job, health insurance, college and housing.
Many Democratic economists ""would argue those are fine aspirations, but in order to achieve them, you'd have to intervene in markets beyond levels they're comfortable with,"" said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the chief economist in the Obama administration for then-Vice President Biden.
Mr. Sanders proposes sharply higher taxes, government spending and regulation. He would boost the size of the federal government's share of GDP to a level exceeded only during World War II.
While many Democrats over the past few decades have tried to balance government intervention with market forces, Mr. Sanders has less trust in markets to improve lives. On Thursday, he said his big-government vision of a national health-care plan and price controls on drug companies would put the country on stronger footing to address crises such as the coronavirus pandemic.
At times, he has dismissed cost concerns outright. Asked at a Feb. 18 CNN Las Vegas town hall about the price and feasibility of his plan to phase out fossil fuels, he replied: ""You tell me how much is too much if we're talking about saving this planet.""
Mr. Sanders wants to smash the conventional wisdom that he says has constrained thinking in Washington since Ronald Reagan -- a consensus that treats higher taxes and new government programs with suspicion -- and reopen discussion of liberal ideas that haven't been seriously considered since the 1970s.
The candidate already claims victory on that front, recounting how proposals from his failed 2016 bid, dismissed at the time as too far left, have since been embraced by Democratic party leaders.
One fight with Hillary Clinton, who won the 2016 Democratic nomination, was over his push to double the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. The Democratic-led House last year passed a bill seeking to make that law, while all his 2020 rival candidates endorsed the goal. Mr. Sanders's 2016 proposal for a Wall Street tax on certain financial transactions was also embraced by much of the 2020 field. Mr. Biden's current positions on many issues, such as expanding Social Security and Medicare, have moved him closer to Mr. Sanders than the longtime Delaware politician has been for much of his career.
""I have been called radical and extreme,"" Mr. Sanders said in Iowa last year. ""Over the last four years . . . a whole lot of other people have become radical and extreme.""
Some mainstream center-left economists praise Mr. Sanders's bid to shake up the Washington consensus on restricting spending. ""All upper-income democracies in the world have much more generous welfare states than the U.S. and do fine,"" said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a think tank that has long advised both Republican and Democratic administrations. ""We've gone so far off the rails in terms of underinvestment in the public sphere that even a massive shift would only get us part way to where we should be.""
The Sanders campaign has been the only major one in this election cycle to avoid even talking to top advisers of previous Democratic presidents. Economists who weren't part of the Clinton or Obama administrations have been close to the Sanders campaign. One is Stephanie Kelton, a professor at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, N.Y., who served as an aide to Mr. Sanders on the Senate Budget Committee. She is the leading proponent of ""modern monetary theory,"" which argues that governments shouldn't fret over debt and deficits.
Another is Darrick Hamilton of Ohio State University, whose work focuses on what he calls ""economic justice."" He aims to narrow the wealth gap between black and white households and has been a proponent of the federal job guarantee idea that Mr. Sanders has endorsed.
Mr. Sanders's wealth tax was written with the help of two French economists at the University of California, Berkeley, Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman.
The Progressive Policy Institute estimates that Mr. Sanders is proposing adding just over $50 trillion in spending over 10 years, nearly doubling the federal government's current outlays. The new funds would mainly be used to expand the social safety net and infrastructure spending.
That is more than eight times the spending proposed by Mr. Biden, according to PPI.
Mr. Sanders would boost taxes by more than $20 trillion over 10 years, according to PPI, by increases in income, payroll and corporate taxes, as well as the new wealth tax.
That is six times the hikes laid out by Mr. Biden.
Most mainstream economists say spending and taxes on that scale would so distort the economy and private-sector activity that it would undermine growth. They warn that significantly higher tax rates could damp incentives for businesses and individuals to invest, while bigger payouts to households could curb incentives to work. They add that attempts by regulators to override market outcomes can impose costly inefficiencies in affected industries.
Mr. Gunnels, the Sanders aide, dismissed concerns about boosting the size of government. ""If we were a poor country . . . these would be legitimate questions,"" he said. ""We're not living in a Third World country. It's not too much to ask that everybody in this country has a decent standard of living.""
Sanders allies said his platform has successful parallels: Franklin D. Roosevelt's 1930s New Deal, which created Social Security and a raft of new government programs and regulations; and Lyndon B. Johnson's 1960s Great Society, which created Medicare and new antipoverty initiatives.
Harvard's Mr. Summers said the scale of Mr. Sanders's proposals would far exceed anything FDR or LBJ enacted, or even what South Dakota Democratic Sen. George McGovern proposed during his 1972 landslide loss to Richard Nixon, a defeat that helped usher in the party's retreat from liberalism.
If Mr. Sanders enacted his full program, government as a share of GDP would jump from the 2017 level of about 38%, one of the lowest levels in the developed world, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, to more than 50%. That is well above any peacetime level in U.S. history, but in line with European countries such as France and Denmark.
He also envisions a raft of new government regulations, from national rent control to new rules for CEO pay to an outright ban on fracking.
While some Democratic economists prefer to address climate change with market incentives, such as a carbon tax, Mr. Sanders would rely more on direct government orders. To protect energy workers who might lose their jobs, he promises five years of government-guaranteed salary, plus housing assistance, pension support and retirement subsidies for those who decide not to continue working.
That ""would be an utter nightmare to enforce,"" said Dean Baker, an economist at the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, saying it would be difficult to flesh out the criteria for who exactly would qualify.
Mr. Sanders would aim to shrink the role of the financial sector in the economy by, among other things, breaking up the largest banks, and reimposing Depression-era limits on banking activity.
He would make it harder for employers to fire workers, unionized or not, and would require big companies to give workers shares of company stock and the right to choose nearly half the seats on corporate boards. His goal is to recalibrate the balance of power between corporations and unions, who have seen their clout erode steadily over the past 40 years.
""In Bernie Sanders's world, the market doesn't come from a state of nature, it comes out of an allocation of power,"" said Robert Reich, a Berkeley public policy professor, who served as President Clinton's labor secretary and has periodically defended Mr. Sanders against attacks from other academics. ""The standard economic view is that the market is filled with potential win-win opportunities, but when you're talking about power, it's more complicated. Some people gain it and others lose it.""

New York will move its presidential primary from April to late June as deaths stemming from the new coronavirus pandemic
escalate sharply
.
More than 200 people in New York have died since Friday from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday afternoon, bringing the state's overall toll to 728. That includes a New York City police detective, the first uniformed NYPD officer to die of the disease, officials said.
The Democratic governor said officials are still working to increase hospital capacity for when the epidemic reaches its peak, which is projected in 14 to 21 days. Mr. Cuomo also planned to issue an executive order that would allow women giving birth in hospitals to be joined by a partner, his top aide Melissa DeRosa said. Some
hospital systems
had previously banned visitors, even for women in labor.
As of Saturday, there were 52,318 people in the state who had tested positive for the virus.
More than half
of those cases were in New York City.
New York election officials have for several weeks considered moving the Democratic nominating contest from April 28 to June 23, when the state had been previously scheduled to hold primary elections for congressional and state legislative seats.
Mr. Cuomo will sign an executive order moving the presidential primary as well as several special elections scheduled for the same date. Village elections slated for June 16 will also take place on June 23, a spokesman for the governor said.
""I don't think it's wise to be bringing a lot of people to one location to vote,"" Mr. Cuomo said.
Good-government advocacy groups, including the League of Women Voters, applauded the change. New York isn't holding a Republican presidential primary because President Trump was the only candidate who qualified for the ballot.
The state's Democratic primary was shaping up to be Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders's last stand against former Vice President Joe Biden. Mr. Biden has
amassed 1,215 delegates
, compared with Mr. Sanders's 910.
Officials in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island have all postponed balloting from April 28 to June 2. Along with New York, they were set to host the ""Acela Primary"" next month, a reference to the Amtrak express train that connects them.
The Democratic National Committee's rules, issued last year, reduce the number of delegates to its July convention from any state that holds its primary after June 9. In a statement, DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said the party was encouraging states to ""implement critical tools like vote by mail and other critical reforms to make it easier to vote."" She said the party's rules committee would meet to determine what would happen to New York for violating the rule.
The delay in the state's Democratic primary came as the state and New York City faced grim news in its fight against the coronavirus.

NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said Detective Cedric Dixon, a 48-year-old assigned to the 32nd Precinct in Harlem, had died after a coronavirus infection. Previously, two civilian NYPD employees died from the disease.
""We are hurting, we are crying and we continue to fight,"" Mr. Shea said. ""We simply have no other choice.""
On Friday, 4,111 NYPD uniformed employees were on sick report—11.4% of the NYPD's uniformed workforce. As of Friday, 442 uniformed members and 70 civilian members tested positive for the virus.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio planned to visit the United Nations to accept their donation to the city of 250,000 face masks.
Mr. Cuomo reiterated during his briefing in Albany that he didn't want to raise taxes as part of the state budget due on Tuesday because revenue has cratered. Labor unions and several Democratic members of the state Assembly and Senate are pushing to raise taxes on the wealthy to fund social programs.
The governor said he wouldn't tap an estimated $6 billion of additional Medicaid money that was approved earlier this month by Congress because doing so would prevent him from changing eligibility rules and reimbursement rates in the state's Medicaid program.
Mr. Cuomo hoped these changes could reduce cost overruns in the program, which provides health care to more than 6 million New Yorkers. Democrats who control the state Senate spoke out against the proposed reductions during the last week.
""It seems wrong place, wrong time,"" state Sen. Brad Hoylman, a Democrat from Manhattan, said Friday. He said Mr. Cuomo's ""cuts would take the rug out from under hospitals as they fight a pandemic.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders has taken sole possession of the lead in the Democratic primary race, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds, with four candidates essentially tied for second place amid declining support for former Vice President Joe Biden and the rising profile of Michael Bloomberg, the former New York mayor.
More on the Poll
*
Full results of February poll

*
Past WSJ/NBC polls

Mr. Sanders had 27% support among Democratic primary voters nationally in the new survey, the same as in January. Mr. Biden, who previously had 26%, has dropped 11 percentage points since last month.
Mr. Biden is bunched closely with Mr. Bloomberg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who each have 14% support, and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, with 13%. Sen. Amy Klobuchar has 7%.
The four-way tie for second place shows that Democrats enter their third nominating contest, Saturday's caucuses in Nevada, with the race for the party's political center unsettled.
As in prior surveys, about 40% of Democrats say their top choice is one of the most ardent liberals, Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren, with 45% to 50% picking a more centrist candidate. The difference now is that more candidates are dividing the party's self-described centrist voters, while Mr. Sanders has expanded his lead over Ms. Warren among liberals.
Another sign of the muddle among Democrats: No prior Journal/NBC News poll had found more than three candidates with double-digit support. This month's survey has five.
The new Journal/NBC News survey also finds that President Trump has suffered little political damage, and possibly has gained ground, after the impeachment trial in Congress. Some 47% approve of his job performance, a high mark that he has hit only once before, with 50% disapproving. Approval among independents hit a record 51%.
Among all voters, 53% approve of how Mr. Trump is handling the economy, also a new high. A majority of 51% say the Senate was right to vote against removing Mr. Trump from office in the impeachment trial, with 47% favoring removal.
Mr. Trump's job-approval rating still lags behind that of the last two predecessors seeking re-election, Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. Both were at 50% approval at about this point in prior elections, though with lower ratings on the economy.
In another caution signal for Mr. Trump, he trails the leading Democrats in test general-election matchups: Mr. Trump trails Mr. Biden by 8 percentage points; Mr. Bloomberg by 7 points; Mr. Sanders by 4 points; and Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg by smaller margins.
An unpredictable factor in the Democratic race is the rising profile of Mr. Bloomberg, who entered the contest late and has spent more than $385 million of his personal fortune to introduce himself through TV, radio and web ads, according to ad tracking data from CMAG/Kantar. Now, voters will get a less filtered view of Mr. Bloomberg. He is scheduled to appear with other leading candidates on the debate stage Wednesday for the first time, after his standing in recent national polls met the party's eligibility requirements.
Amid the scramble for second place, the poll displayed one point of clarity in the Democratic race: Mr. Sanders holds the lead alone. ""Bernie Sanders is the definitive front-runner, and his numbers represent not his ceiling but his base, with room to grow,'' said Democratic pollster Peter Hart.
Mr. Hart noted that 65% of Democratic primary voters say they are enthusiastic about Mr. Sanders' candidacy or comfortable with it—a larger share than for any other candidate, and well above his 27% support as the voters' first choice for nominee.
""It's a mistake at this stage to say we're looking at his peak, because it just looks to me that as the field narrows, he becomes the beneficiary, especially if Elizabeth Warren drops out,'' said Mr. Hart, who worked on the survey with Jeff Horwitt, also a Democrat, and Republican Bill McInturff.
The survey also showed Mr. Sanders' strength when testing him in hypothetical, two-person races against some of his Democratic rivals, to assess coalitions that could materialize later in the nomination process. Mr. Sanders topped Mr. Bloomberg in a two-person race, 57% to 37%, and he led Mr. Buttigieg by 16 points, 54% to 38%.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What, if any, results from this recent poll surprise you? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Biden, in contrast to Mr. Sanders, has lost ground. According to Mr. McInturff, the Biden support is moving to several other candidates, including to Mr. Sanders, and not just to the two candidates who gained support since January, Messrs. Bloomberg and Buttigieg.
Mr. Sanders won the popular vote in Iowa's disputed caucuses and New Hampshire's primary, though Mr. Buttigieg emerged with a small lead in the score that matters: He tops Mr. Sanders by a single convention delegate. Now, however, the Democratic Party's primary rules could give Mr. Sanders a boost, if his lead in national polls holds in state nominating contests.
Those rules award delegates only to candidates who reach 15% support in a state, congressional district or in some cases other geographic areas. Mr. Sanders is well above that threshold in the national survey, while his top competitors are at just about the cutoff mark or below it.
""Sanders has strong enough support to be in a delegate race everywhere,'' Mr. McInturff said.
The survey found that Mr. Sanders would carry potential liabilities into a general election. More than half of all voters said that a candidate who had had a heart attack in the past year or was older than 75 would leave them with reservations or make them very uncomfortable. Mr. Sanders fits both descriptions. Two-thirds said they were uncomfortable with a socialist; Mr. Sanders calls himself a democratic socialist.
By contrast, voters showed lower levels of discomfort with a candidate who is gay or under age 40, two qualities that fit Mr. Buttigieg. In both cases, substantial majorities said they would be enthusiastic about or comfortable with a candidate with those characteristics.
The Journal/NBC News poll surveyed 900 registered voters from Feb. 14-17 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.27 percentage points. The margin of error for the 426 Democratic primary voters in the survey was plus or minus 4.75 percentage points.

WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court denied requests to quickly decide the fate of the Affordable Care Act, a move that is likely to make the health-care law play less of a role in the 2020 election.
A group of 20 Democratic-led states and the U.S. House had asked the court to fast-track their appeals so that the latest legal battle over the Obama-era law could be resolved by the end of June.
The justices denied those requests on Tuesday in a one-sentence order with no dissents noted. The move likely means that any court consideration of the ACA won't happen until the fall at the earliest, with any decision likely coming after Election Day.
The court has twice upheld the ACA. Had the court issued another ruling this summer, it could have placed the issue at the center of the election and put pressure on President Trump and other Republicans, no matter the outcome.
The latest case stems from a lawsuit brought by Republican-led states and backed by the Trump administration that challenged the law's insurance mandate. Mr. Trump has pledged to repeal the ACA and has long promised to release his own health plan.
Last week, Mr. Trump claimed he had saved coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, but his Justice Department has argued for the invalidation of that provision in the current litigation.
The Supreme Court's move on Tuesday comes after a New Orleans-based federal appeals court ruled last month that a central feature of the ACA was unconstitutional. That part of the law required most individuals to carry health insurance or pay a penalty. The appeals court declined to say whether any, some or all other parts of the law remain enforceable without the mandate, leaving the health-policy regime in legal limbo.
The law continues to remain in effect during the litigation, which began after a GOP-controlled Congress reduced the penalty under the insurance mandate to $0. The GOP-led states argued the elimination of the tax rendered the mandate unconstitutional.
The appeals court has ordered a judge in Texas to reconsider what parts of the sprawling health law can remain in place, but the Democratic-led states and House were seeking to have the Supreme Court go ahead and rule that the entire law remains valid.
The timing of the appeals court ruling, after more than five months of deliberations, put the law's defenders in a bind, because it made it difficult to squeeze the case onto the Supreme Court's calendar, which likely filled up last week.
The justices already have an unusually long list of blockbuster cases to decide before the end of June, including ones on abortion, gay rights, gun rights and immigration.
The Trump administration argued against expedited Supreme Court consideration of the case, saying in a court brief that there were no exigencies that required it.
Democratic presidential candidates including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg have all criticized President Trump as a threat to health coverage and the ACA, and a number have cited the administration's support for the lawsuit as evidence.
Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said on Tuesday: ""While radical Democrats propose plans that would destroy the health insurance of millions of Americans, President Trump continues to work to improve health care more broadly.""
About half of Americans now approve of the ACA, according to Gallup, up slightly from 48% in fall of 2018.
The court's decision leaves uncertainty hanging over health care. Hospital groups have said the lack of clarity on the long-term status of the ACA is complicating decisions on investments.

Social distancing already seems to have diminished the impact of influenza in the U.S. by one key measure and should help to limit coronavirus as well.
Dr. Stephen Grant, an emergency-room physician in South Carolina, finds encouraging news in the
latest influenza data
from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Dr. Grant writes via email that the percentage of flu tests that are positive has lately been declining rapidly, including in the new data for week 12 of the U.S. flu season which ended on March 21. ""As hoped for, the precipitous drop in new flu cases continues."" He adds that since the incubation period for the flu is believed to be shorter than for Covid-19, ""we would expect to see beneficial effects of social distancing show up first in the flu numbers."" He adds that if social distancing is working to prevent transmission of respiratory viruses, then we might soon see a drop in Covid-19 cases as well.
To be sure, this flu season has already taken a toll. CDC reports:
Pneumonia and influenza mortality levels have been low, but 155 influenza-associated deaths in children have been reported so far this season. This number is higher than recorded at the same time in every season since reporting began in 2004-05, except for the 2009 pandemic.
CDC estimates that so far this season there have been at least 39 million flu illnesses, 400,000 hospitalizations and 24,000 deaths from flu.
***
Meanwhile on the Campaign Trail Measures against both coronavirus and the flu are especially valuable for those in vulnerable populations, including America's leading presidential candidates. More good news on that front is that Democratic front-runner and former Vice President Joe Biden is staying alive, just as instructed by
a recent article
in The Atlantic.
The desire to embrace reasonable expectations for the candidate appears to extend beyond the magazine. Today in Politico Ryan Lizza
writes
that some Democrats believe Mr. Biden ""can defeat Trump in a general election the same way he has almost won the Democratic nomination: just by being there.""
Ben Mathis-Lilley seemed to be setting expectations even lower with his recent
observation
in Slate:
Sure, it might be nice to have a nominee with the energy and mental focus to appear in public every day during the possible end of civilization, but the 2020 edition of Biden was never such a person, and you can't disappear if you were never really there.
To be fair, Mr. Biden is continuing to campaign from his home in Delaware and is doing much more than simply staying alive. In fact he may be overdoing it when it comes to describing his academic credentials. In the Washington Times, James Varney
reports on a Wednesday virtual town hall event:

Mr. Biden claimed to be an Ivy League professor at the end of a nearly 8-minute, rambling answer to a question from an 18-year-old on what he was doing to appeal to young voters who may favor Sen. Bernie Sanders for the Democratic presidential nomination.
""There's a lot we can do. When I left the United States Senate, I became a professor at the University of Pennsylvania,"" he said, bringing up that fact to claim that his professorship established a bond with college students...
In fact, Mr. Biden was given an honorary-professor position one week after he left the vice president's office in 2017. (He also misstated the time of his becoming the first ""Benjamin Franklin Presidential Practice Professor,"" as he left the Senate in 2009 to become vice president.)
He was neither supposed to nor did he ever teach a class, according to his own spokesperson and multiple Philadelphia media accounts.
""Penn has paid Joe Biden more than $900K since he left the White House. What did he do to earn the money?"" Jonathan Tamari
wrote
last year in the Phiadelphia Inquirer.
In any case Mr. Biden probably won't have to answer too many more questions before claiming the Democratic nomination, notwithstanding postponements of various state primaries. Barbara Sprunt
reports
for NPR:
Biden currently holds a more than 300 delegate lead in the race for the Democratic nomination. During an online press conference Wednesday, Biden was asked about whether there should be more Democratic primary debates and answered, ""I think we've had enough debates. I think we should get on with this.""
Sanders conceded that he substantially lagged Biden in the race, saying ""it's going to be a very steep road,"" but said there was value to holding more debates.
Whether considering the risks of the flu or coronavirus, there's no harm and a lot of benefit to keeping both candidates isolated for the time being.
***
Road to Recovery Now along comes a clear benefit for the nation's economic health. Aparna Mathur, known for her insightful analysis of the impact of corporate income taxation on workers—and on many other subjects as well—is headed to the White House to become senior economist at the Council of Economic Advisers. With former CEA chairman Kevin Hassett returning to the White House, President Trump is clearly assembling an A-team to help enable robust revival.

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- Michael Bloomberg's unprecedented spending couldn't win over voters in Super Tuesday states -- and his advisers are assessing his campaign.
The former New York City mayor spent about $215 million of his own money on TV and radio ads in Super Tuesday states alone -- more than 100 times what former Vice President Joe Biden spent on ads in those states and roughly 12 times what Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders spent, according to ad-tracking data from Kantar/CMAG.
It also is only slightly less than the total amount the campaigns of Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden spent -- combined -- between launching their campaigns last year and the end of January, according to the latest available Federal Election Commission reports.
Overall, on TV, radio and digital platforms, the billionaire put out more than $500 million -- an unprecedented amount in just over three months.
That doesn't include the cost of the massive campaign operation of more than 2,400 staffers Mr. Bloomberg built. A chunk of those staffers were based in states that voted Tuesday.
As of primary night, with many states still counting votes, he had earned just a few dozen delegates. The only contest Mr. Bloomberg had won was American Samoa.
Minutes before polls closed in many states, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, told reporters the campaign would assess the results to decide the billionaire's path moving forward.
""Well, I think you make an assessment in any campaign like this after every time that there's a vote,"" he said. ""I think most Democrats in this race understand that our number one objective is defeating Donald Trump, and then all of us are supporting a nominee.""
""As of right now we're committed to stay in, but we'll see what happens today,"" Mr. Sheekey said.
As early results showed Mr. Biden sweeping states where Mr. Bloomberg had heavily invested, he addressed his supporters and tried to project confidence.
""No matter how many delegates we win tonight, we have done something no one else thought was possible,"" Mr. Bloomberg said at his election night event in West Palm Beach, Fla. ""In just three months, we've gone from just 1% in the polls to being a contender for the Democratic nomination.""
Mr. Bloomberg didn't win any states Tuesday but he may have cost Mr. Biden some delegates. In some states where Mr. Sanders won or was leading, Mr. Bloomberg's vote share was larger than the margin between Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. Before the results came in, Mr. Sheekey insisted Mr. Bloomberg wasn't playing spoiler to Mr. Biden.
Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Biden both competed for support from moderate and black voters, trying to tie themselves to former President Obama in ads. Mr. Bloomberg spent an estimated $40 million on several versions of a 30-second spot, including one in Spanish, which featured Mr. Obama praising him, according to Kantar/CMAG.
But the former vice president's landslide victory in South Carolina helped consolidate those blocs of voters behind him, along with endorsements from party leaders and his former Democratic rivals ahead of Super Tuesday.
Based on its internal data, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign saw a big shift after South Carolina, according to a campaign aide, who added that the effect of Mr. Biden's win in the state was reflected in Tuesday's results. In states where many people voted early or by mail, like Colorado and Utah, Mr. Bloomberg was performing better.
In Virginia alone, where the state was called for Mr. Biden as soon as polls closed, Mr. Bloomberg spent about $18 million on TV and radio ads to earn roughly 10% of the vote. In North Carolina, another state that was called for Mr. Biden immediately after polls closed, Mr. Bloomberg spent $15.3 million. In those two states, Mr. Bloomberg had more than 200 staffers and 18 offices.
Philip Balas, 68 years old, an attorney in Palm Beach Gardens who attended Mr. Bloomberg's election night event, said Tuesday was only a ""start"" for the billionaire and praised him for spending his money to try to defeat Mr. Trump. ""He seems to care a lot about America, and he's spending money on it to bring it back to what it used to be and to unify America,"" Mr. Balas said.
""To me, anything is worth that,"" he said.
In a tweet Tuesday night, Mr. Trump said Mr. Bloomberg was the ""biggest loser of the night."" ""His 'political' consultants took him for a ride. $700 million washed down the drain, and he got nothing for it but the nickname Mini Mike, and the complete destruction of his reputation. Way to go Mike!"" he said.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Bloomberg had said at a field office in Miami that he was ""in it to win it,"" while acknowledging his only path to the Democratic nomination was through a contested convention.
He also dodged questions about whether he was taking votes away from Mr. Biden, whom moderates swiftly consolidated behind after his landslide victory in South Carolina.
""Have you asked Joe whether he's going to drop out?"" he said in response to questions from reporters at his field office in Miami's Little Havana section. ""When you ask him that, then you can call me.""

After Donald Trump's election, Lev Parnas saw a chance to cash in on his connections.
The Florida businessman and Trump donor was courting investors for a real-estate project. He took one of them, Roman Nasirov, at the time the head of Ukraine's tax service, to Mr. Trump's Florida Mar-a-Lago resort, where they chatted with the president-elect in a crowd of supporters, a video released by Mr. Parnas's attorney shows. Mr. Nasirov ultimately helped fund a $10 million loan Mr. Parnas arranged for the project, people familiar with the matter said.
A sizable donation to a political campaign typically brings a handshake and some chitchat with the candidate. In the three years that followed, Mr. Parnas went further.
As he launched himself into Mr. Trump's orbit, Mr. Parnas found sponsors for his own ventures among wealthy Republican donors, mingling with them at fundraisers and dinners that he documented in copious selfies. He also sought out and eventually became a key associate of Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, who embraced Mr. Parnas in his pursuit of investigations in Ukraine.
The role he has carved out for himself has thrust the Ukrainian-born Mr. Parnas into the impeachment saga, injecting a wild card into the tightly choreographed proceedings on Capitol Hill. Last week, he offered new allegations in several interviews that have inflamed the debate about whether senators should call witnesses in the president's trial, which opens Tuesday.
Many of Mr. Parnas's ventures went awry despite his connected patrons' support. The real-estate project Mr. Nasirov invested in ended in a lawsuit, in which Mr. Parnas said the developer cut him out of a subsequent deal and that he is owed $250,000 for expenses in January 2017 alone, as well as the costs of hiring a personal assistant and leasing Cadillac Escalades. Mr. Nasirov didn't respond to a request for comment.
In Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Parnas found not a patron but an inroad with the White House -- perceived access that he in turn sought to use to broker new business deals. Mr. Parnas says he arranged meetings and carried messages for Mr. Giuliani as the president's attorney tried to pressure Ukraine's government to undertake investigations into a leading Trump rival in this year's elections, Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden. That campaign is at the center of the president's impeachment, in which Democrats say Mr. Trump abused his power for personal benefit. Mr. Trump has denied that and called the impeachment a hoax.
Democrats in the House and Senate say Mr. Parnas should be heard from. Republicans, meanwhile, question his credibility, citing his federal indictment in Manhattan in October. The prosecutors, who accused Mr. Parnas and an associate of attempting to funnel foreign money into U.S. elections and influence American politics on behalf of at least one Ukrainian politician, say they are continuing to investigate the two men. The fall indictment doesn't address the efforts to push for investigations in Ukraine.
Mr. Parnas has pleaded not guilty, and he and his attorney say his cooperation in the impeachment proceedings should earn him leniency. He has turned over hundreds of pages of text messages and other documents to House committees that outline his relationship with Mr. Giuliani and others in the Trump camp. In television interviews last week, he said Mr. Trump knew what he and Mr. Giuliani were doing in Ukraine.
Mr. Trump says he doesn't know Mr. Parnas, though he has acknowledged taking pictures together. At a meeting with prosecutors from the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office late last year, people familiar with the matter say, Mr. Parnas's attorney disputed that he pushed for the removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine at the behest of a Ukrainian official -- one of the charges in the campaign finance indictment.
As Mr. Parnas sat without speaking, the attorney told prosecutors that his client didn't act at the official's direction, though the two had been in contact about removing the ambassador, the people said. Manhattan prosecutors rejected that explanation, the people said. Prosecutors haven't detailed publicly any evidence that would support their allegation.
In Florida, Mr. Parnas gained a reputation for having quick access to large amounts of financing, former business associates and others said.
A $50,000 donation to the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee shortly before the November 2016 election first brought Mr. Parnas into the Trump orbit. At a fundraiser in Florida, Mr. Parnas introduced himself to Messrs. Trump and Giuliani.
After the fundraiser, Mr. Parnas pressed the host, construction magnate Robert Pereira, to invest in a new venture, Fraud Guarantee, which offered insurance for investments. Mr. Pereira told The Wall Street Journal last year that he ""didn't trust this guy"" and cut off contact with Mr. Parnas.
Fraud Guarantee was born from a failed venture to develop real estate in which Mr. Parnas says he was scammed. His former business partner, Dale Wood, who is now serving a 12-year sentence for a related $7 million investment fraud, said in an interview that around $500,000 of the money stolen in the fraud in 2012 paid for Mr. Parnas's house, cars, bodyguard and private jets.
Mr. Parnas's attorney, Joseph Bondy, said Mr. Parnas was a victim and that Mr. Wood didn't provide agreed-upon payments.
Bigger donations vaulted Mr. Parnas further into Trump circles and brought success in recruiting investors.
In May 2018, Mr. Parnas and a fellow Soviet-born businessman, Igor Fruman, both U.S. citizens, made a $325,000 donation to America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC. Prosecutors said the donation came through a limited liability company to conceal their identities. Mr. Fruman has pleaded not guilty to campaign finance violations.
After the donation, the pair attended a small dinner at the Trump Hotel in Washington with the president, his son Donald Trump Jr. and other top donors to America First Action.
With Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Parnas flew higher still. He and Mr. Fruman ramped up their efforts to arrange meetings for Mr. Giuliani with key Ukrainian officials in their quest to get Kyiv to announce investigations into alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election by Ukrainian officials -- a largely unsubstantiated theory embraced by the president -- and into the role Mr. Biden's son, Hunter, played on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings.
Mr. Giuliani has denied knowing about the two highest-level Ukrainian meetings Messrs. Parnas and Fruman attended: one in February with then-President Petro Poroshenko, and one the following May with a top aide to the incoming president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr. Parnas said he relayed to both men that favorable U.S. treatment was at risk if they didn't announce the sought-after investigations.
Messrs. Giuliani and Parnas were in close contact in the days surrounding both meetings: The two men called or tried to call each other nearly 40 times the week of the February meeting, a person familiar with the matter said. On the day of the May meeting, Mr. Giuliani called Mr. Parnas twice, and Mr. Parnas called him three times the next day, the person said, and they exchanged hundreds of calls over the course of that week.

WASHINGTON—Taking a victory lap a day after
he was acquitted
in the Senate impeachment trial, President Trump said he ""went through hell"" during what he deemed a politically driven investigation and called top Democrats ""very evil and sick people"" for seeking his removal from office.
Before an audience of aides and Republican allies, Mr. Trump offered freewheeling remarks from the East Room of the White House Thursday. Speaking for just over an hour, he characterized the event as a celebration, while taking swings at political rivals who he alleged have been targeting him since he took office.
""We've been going through this now for over three years. It was evil, it was corrupt, it was dirty cops, it was leakers and liars, and this should never, ever happen to another president, ever,"" Mr. Trump said.
Holding up a copy of a newspaper with the headline ""Trump Acquitted,"" he quipped: ""It's the only good headline I've had in the Washington Post.""
He reiterated his stance that he did nothing improper regarding Ukraine, and called former special counsel
Robert Mueller's earlier probe
into possible ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia ""all bullshit.""
The remarks came one day after the Republican-led Senate acquitted Mr. Trump on
two articles of impeachment
stemming from his efforts to
press Ukraine
to announce investigations that would benefit him politically in this year's election, including a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate.
Mr. Trump's comments about Democratic leaders also came on the heels of his
State of the Union speech
on Tuesday night, when he didn't shake the hand offered by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), and she ripped up her copy of his address at its conclusion.
""He is impeached forever, no matter what he says or the headlines he wanted to carry around,"" Mrs. Pelosi said in remarks to reporters on Thursday. She added that Mr. Trump was ""never getting rid of that scar.""
Mrs. Pelosi also defended tearing up the speech, calling the address ""a manifesto of mistruths"" and her action necessary to ""get the attention of the American people.""

President's Second-Term Agenda Still on the Drawing Board

The combative comments from Mr. Trump on Thursday and the vigorous response from Mrs. Pelosi made clear that the
rancorous political climate
between Democrats and Republicans will continue even with impeachment over.
Republicans cheered Mr. Trump's acquittal in the Senate and have called his impeachment part of a three-year effort to delegitimize the 2016 election and remove the president from office nine months before Democrats face him again at the ballot box.
Democrats said Mr. Trump's acquittal amounted to a defeat for the institution of Congress, and they warned that leaving Mr. Trump in office would free him to try to cheat in this year's election again.
In his White House event, the mood was triumphant, with guests hugging and slapping each other on the back. The crowd gave Mr. Trump more than a half-dozen standing ovations. He thanked various supporters in the room by name, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). Mr. Trump also thanked his Senate impeachment legal team.
He didn't mention personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, whose efforts in Ukraine have been at the center of the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Giuliani wasn't in attendance.
Mr. Trump also continued his criticism of Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah), who was the
lone Republican to vote to convict
the president on the first article of impeachment. Without naming him, Mr. Trump said there were ""some that used religion as a crutch"" and called him a failed presidential candidate.
Mr. Romney, the 2012 GOP candidate against President Obama, said Wednesday that he was a very religious person and reached an ""inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded"" that he convict Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump took two tacks toward Democrats in his White House speech. He called for bipartisanship, citing infrastructure and drug prices as areas of common interest. If Republicans and Democrats work together, ""what we can do is incredible,"" he said.
But he also continued to question the goodwill of Democrats. Earlier, in remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast, Mr. Trump appeared to reference Mrs. Pelosi, saying he doesn't like ""people who say, 'I pray for you,' when they know that's not so.""
Mrs. Pelosi, who was seated at a long table near the lectern at the breakfast, clapped as he entered the room. Later, she told reporters that she did pray for Mr. Trump, while criticizing his actions in office as ""so off the track of our Constitution, our values, our country.""
Mr. Trump's appearance at the breakfast marked the fourth year he has addressed the annual gathering, which is hosted by members of Congress and has been running since 1953. Presidents of both parties traditionally attend the event. Mr. Trump enjoys
strong support from evangelical Christians
, who were a key piece of his winning 2016 coalition.
Before Mr. Trump spoke at the breakfast, there was a keynote address from Arthur Brooks, former president of the American Enterprise Institute, who urged the audience to rise above the country's divided political climate.
Mr. Trump, known for his combative style, acknowledged the message when he took the podium, but said: ""Arthur, I don't know if I agree with you.""

WASHINGTON—President Trump has had two major national audiences in the past five days, and both times he aimed a message at African-Americans, a group that overwhelmingly disapproves of the job he is doing but could help decide whether he gets to keep it.
During the Super Bowl, Mr. Trump's campaign spent millions of dollars on a commercial featuring an African-American woman who had a drug sentence commuted by the president. ""Politicians talk about criminal-justice reform,"" the ad said. ""President Trump got it done.""
At the State of the Union, Mr. Trump celebrated the low unemployment rate among African-Americans, talked of urban development zones, honored one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen and awarded a fourth-grader from Philadelphia, Janiyah Davis, with a school-choice scholarship.
The black unemployment rate is 5.9%, according to the latest government statistics, up slightly from the historic low of 5.4% reached in August 2019. Overall, the U.S. unemployment rate is 3.5%.
While Mr. Trump's re-election strategy mainly relies on motivating his conservative base, the focus on African-Americans, and a similar push for Hispanics, shows an effort to attract new voters. Only 8% of black voters went for Mr. Trump in 2016, but his campaign is confident it can improve on that. Even a small boost could help in battleground states such as Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.

Many Black Voters Like Joe Biden, but Some Are Open to Other Democrats

""There's significant support out there that you're not going to hear about but it will show up at the ballot box. People see results,"" said Calvin Tucker, who directs minority outreach for the Republican Party of Pennsylvania. He noted that Mr. Trump in 2016 did better among black voters than the past two Republican nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain.
The push Mr. Trump has displayed in the last week—chiefly the emotional Super Bowl ad, which generated favorable reviews—also appears intended for another group of voters he has struggled with.
""Ads showing the compassionate part of Trump's agenda could help raise his favorable ratings with some suburban voters,"" said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist in Washington. ""They like his economic policies, but are turned off by the tweets and harsh rhetoric.""
The Trump campaign has been holding outreach events, seeking to shake the decadeslong dominance Democrats have held with black voters. It is a far different effort than 2016, when Mr. Trump lacked a record and simply asked, ""What the hell do you have to lose?""
The campaign plans to continue an advertising campaign geared toward black voters, including African-American community newspapers and radio. Ads encourage people to text ""woke"" to receive updates. The campaign is also training activists to engage and register voters, according to a person familiar with the strategy.
With a strong economy at the president's back, some Democrats say Mr. Trump's outreach is a wake-up call.
""What we saw from Donald Trump was a 2020 surgical strategy,"" said Quentin James, founder of the Collective PAC, which helps elect black candidates to office. Mr. James said Democrats need a large-scale program to engage with African-Americans and fears the party will play catch-up.
""We assume black voters will just vote for the Democratic Party like they always do,"" he said. ""Sure the numbers are there, but if Trump can get two or three more points with black men in swing states, this thing is over. I am very nervous.""
Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee who is also African-American, said Mr. Trump was smart to make a play for black voters. But he said that effort is hampered by the president's history of controversial statements, from saying there were fine people on ""both sides"" of the deadly 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., to saying four Democratic lawmakers, all of them minority women, should return to the ""totally broken and crime infested places from which they came"" and ""fix"" them.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you think President Trump can improve on his 2016 performance among African-American voters? Join the conversation below.
""This is a man who wanted to execute the Central Park Five,"" said Mr. Steele, referring to the black and Hispanic teenagers who were wrongfully convicted of raping a jogger in 1989. Asked about the case last year, Mr. Trump refused to apologize for his stance, which he had emphasized at the time in newspaper ads that called for bringing back the death penalty in New York.
A January poll released by the Washington Post showed more than 8 in 10 black Americans think Mr. Trump is a racist and that he has made racism a bigger problem. Despite Mr. Trump's boasts about the economy, 77% of black Americans said he deserves only ""some"" or ""hardly any"" credit, according to the poll.
""You go in the barber shop and talk to people—they hate Donald Trump,"" said Keith Williams, chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party's black caucus. He said Mr. Trump's frequent criticisms of former President Obama were a sore spot and noted the economic recovery began under Mr. Trump's predecessor.
""He can bring people to the State of the Union but he's never been for us,"" Mr. Williams said.
A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll from January showed only 15% of African-Americans approve of the job Mr. Trump is doing, and 83% disapprove—by far the worst of any demographic group.
Still, another Journal poll in December showed Mr. Trump could improve on his 2016 margin. While only 9% of blacks were almost certain to vote for the president and 72% were almost certain to vote against him, 21% said it depends on whom Democrats nominate.

Top Democratic presidential candidates are laying out two distinct governing visions heading into the 2020 election year,
closing 2019
with opposing arguments about whether to seek compromise with Republicans if President Trump is defeated.
Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are among the candidates honing their final pitches with
Iowa's Feb. 3 caucuses
just more than a month away.
Mr. Biden is telling voters that the country's institutions are born out of compromise and that his deep relationships in Congress can help him appeal to some Republicans on issues such as health care and foreign policy. Ms. Warren, meanwhile, predicts a stratified political environment in which Democrats and Republicans will hardly ever agree, saying Democratic primary voters should pick someone willing to fight for their values.
Among the other candidates polling in the top tier in Iowa, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont tends to align with Ms. Warren. South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg tries to strike notes similar to Mr. Biden's view, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has gained steam with a message focused on her bipartisan record in Congress.
During a New Year's Eve speech in Boston that marked one year since she announced her candidacy, Ms. Warren, who
has been grappling
with dipping poll numbers, made the case that Democrats would need to prepare for a robust fight against the GOP and even some moderates in their own party if Mr. Trump is ousted following next year's general election.
She spoke of the near-unanimous support for Mr. Trump among Senate Republicans ahead of
an impeachment trial
as an example of how the parties are polarized in modern times. (House Democrats nearly unanimously
supported impeachment
.)
""So as we turn the page tomorrow—into an election year and a new decade—there is a chill of fear in the air,"" Ms. Warren said Tuesday. ""If you can imagine that something better lies on the other side of the chaos and ugliness of the last three years, then you are more than halfway there. The first step is to see it. The next step is to fight for it.""
Ms. Warren, who has proposed free public college tuition, government-run health insurance for all Americans and a sweeping array of new taxes on the wealthy, didn't name her more moderate rivals but implied that they would not defend liberal priorities.
""The billionaires, the corporate executives and their favorite presidential candidates have one clear goal…to convince you that everything you imagine is impossible,"" she said.
Ms. Warren told reporters after her speech that compromise is sometimes necessary, but ""it's not where we start. We start with a vision.""
Mr. Biden, on the other hand, has told audiences that the pillars of the nation's democracy are under attack and that the country will suffer deep consequences if it fails to unite after Mr. Trump leaves office.
Campaigning in Iowa and New Hampshire in recent days, Mr. Biden said his Democratic rivals consider him naive for trying to repair the nation's divides.
""I don't say this because I'm looking for everybody holding hands and having a Kumbaya moment,"" Mr. Biden said in Iowa earlier this month. ""You have to be able to get consensus, and there's a two-party system. We have to get back to it.""
Tom Vilsack, the former Democratic Iowa governor who recently endorsed the former vice president, told a crowd in Iowa that Mr. Biden's goals—which include a more modest government role in providing health insurance and free community college—are achievable ""because he has the relationships with people who will have to approve these plans.""
As the Senate prepares for a trial following the House impeachment of Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden often notes that he, more than any other candidate, has ample reasons to hold a grudge against Republicans. Mr. Trump's impeachment stemmed in part from his effort to convince Ukrainian officials to investigate the business dealings of Mr. Biden's son Hunter.
But, the former vice president says, the country needs healing.
""I refuse to accept the proposition that we will be in a state of perpetual war with Republicans because you can't govern the country if that's the case,"" Mr. Biden said Monday at a town hall in Exeter, N.H.
In an interview aboard his campaign bus in Iowa last week, Mr. Biden noted his past dealings with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and expressed hope that he might be able to reach consensus with Republicans as president.
""There will be a means by which we can provide accommodation on a whole range of things that are not nearly as ideological,"" Mr. Biden said, citing new infrastructure investment, foreign-policy initiatives and his efforts to promote cancer research.
Mary Kathryn Gepner, an Iowa librarian who said she was leaning toward caucusing for Mr. Biden or Ms. Klobuchar, cited ""the classic example"" of the bipartisanship she thought the U.S. should return to: Republican President Ronald Reagan's relationship with then Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill. ""They would disagree from 9 to 5, and after 6, they would agree to be friends,"" said Ms. Gepner, 77.
Democrats who back Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders say the quest for genuine compromise between Republicans and Democrats on landmark pieces of legislation is probably a lost cause in modern politics.
""I know there was a time when Republicans weren't as consistently conservative as they are today,"" said Vivien Morris, 66, a community activist from Boston who is supporting Ms. Warren. ""The people at the top, I don't think they'll ever change.""

CHARLESTON, S.C.—Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, days after a resounding victory in the
Nevada caucuses
, took the bulk of incoming fire
on the debate stage
here ahead of this state's Saturday primary.
The Democratic electorate in South Carolina is roughly 60% black, according to the state party, and all of the candidates sought to win over black voters, a powerful Democratic constituency. This state is seen as a must-win for former Vice President Joe Biden, though recent public surveys show that Mr. Sanders is gaining momentum here.
Like the Nevada debate a week before it, the South Carolina match included some sharp barbs. Seven candidates squared off: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren; Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar; former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg; billionaire and activist Tom Steyer; former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg; and Messrs. Biden and Sanders.
Here are the moments that mattered:
Sanders in the hot seat
""No, the math does not add up.""—Sen. Amy Klobuchar
Why this matters: Mr. Sanders stood in the center of the stage for the first time this election, underscoring his front-runner status. He certainly earned front-runner scrutiny.
""No, the math does not add up,"" Ms. Klobuchar said to Mr. Sanders, saying that his Medicare for All proposal was too expensive. She also said that Democratic Party elders, including former President Obama, had opposed his idea for expansive government proposals. ""They are not with you,"" she said.
He also took heat for his votes against the 1993 Brady Bill, which established mandatory background checks, while Mr. Sanders was a member of the House. Mr. Sanders called it a bad vote. Mr. Sanders also was criticized by Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg for his refusal to back rolling back the legislative filibuster in the Senate.
""This is not some long-ago bad vote that Bernie Sanders took. This is a current bad position that Bernie Sanders holds,"" Mr. Buttigieg said. ""How are we going to deliver a revolution if you won't even support a rule change?""
Mr. Sanders argues that rolling back the filibuster cuts both ways, and Republicans could take advantage of its absence, too.
Warren finally critiques Sanders
""I dug in, did the work, and Bernie's team trashed me for it.""—Sen. Elizabeth Warren
Why this matters: Ms. Warren has long been loath to be seen criticizing Mr. Sanders, whose supporters she doesn't want to alienate. After underperforming him in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, Ms. Warren offered her sharpest contrast with him.
""So look, the way I see this is that Bernie is winning right now because the Democratic Party is a progressive party, and progressive ideas are popular ideas,"" Ms. Warren said, before critiquing his plan as vague.
Scrutiny on Ms. Warren's Medicare for All plan by centrists who said it was unreasonable, and from many on the left who said it didn't go as far as Mr. Sanders's bill, was a big reason why Ms. Warren's position in the 2020 race has slipped.
""Bernie and I both want to see universal health care, but Bernie's plan doesn't explain how to get there, doesn't show how we're going to get enough allies into it, and doesn't show enough about how were going to pay for it,"" Ms. Warren said. ""I dug in, I did the work, and then Bernie's team trashed me for it.
Warren and Bloomberg have another testy exchange over NDAs
""If it bothered them, I was wrong and I apologize. I'm sorry for that.""—former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg
Why this matters: One of the most fiery moments happened when Ms. Warren once again confronted Mr. Bloomberg over complaints by several women about his behavior. She talked about her experience of getting fired from a teaching job in the 1970s because she was pregnant.
""At least I didn't have a boss who said to me 'kill it' the way that Mayor Bloomberg is alleged to have said to one of his pregnant employees,"" Ms. Warren said. ""I never said that,"" Mr. Bloomberg said. But Ms. Warren used the allegation to continue to hammer Mr. Bloomberg on the nondisclosure agreements between three women and his company, Bloomberg LP, and called on him to release any other women from any unreported NDA.
Mr. Bloomberg declined to do so but offered new apologies to women who have made complaints about comments he has made in the workplace.
""If it bothered them, I was wrong and I apologize. I'm sorry for that,"" Mr. Bloomberg said. ""Nobody accused me of doing anything other than just making a comment or two.""
He also clapped back at Ms. Warren for continuing to press the issue after he decided to release three women from NDAs. ""What the senator did suggest was that we release these women from the nondisclosure agreement. I did that two days later,"" adding: ""The trouble is, with this senator, enough is never enough.""
Buttigieg says Sanders has 'nostalgia' for 'revolutionary politics' of the 1960s
""This is not about what coups were happening in the 1970s or '80s, this is about the future.""—former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg
Why this matters: Asked about his Cuba comments, Mr. Sanders said he has opposed authoritarianism all over the world and equated his praise of the Cuban government's literacy program to President Obama's. ""What Barack Obama said is they made great progress on education and health care. That was Barack Obama.…And when dictatorships, whether it is the Chinese or the Cubans, do something good you acknowledge that, but you don't have to trade love letters with them,"" he said.
Mr. Buttigieg portrayed Mr. Sanders's past praise of some aspects of leftist governments as a weakness against Mr. Trump.
""I am not looking forward to a scenario where it comes down to Donald Trump with his nostalgia for the social order of the 1950s and Bernie Sanders with a nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the '60s,"" he said. ""This is not about what coups were happening in the 1970s or '80s, this is about the future. This is about 2020.""
Biden says not to count him out
""When you're knocked down, get up.""—former Vice President Joe Biden
Why this matters: Mr. Biden entered the race in April 2019 the undeniable front-runner. His campaign is now in clear peril after he finished fourth in Iowa, fifth in New Hampshire, and second in Nevada. Mr. Sanders and Mr. Steyer now challenge Mr. Biden among black Democrats, a bloc the Biden campaign had long considered the linchpin of his candidacy.
""When you're knocked down, get up,"" Mr. Biden said when asked, during the last round of questioning, to explain his life motto. It's an often-repeated phrase the former vice president uses on the campaign trail to urge Democrats who feel defeated by President Trump's presidency.

Joe Biden's
field-narrowing romp
in a string of primaries, along with the Democratic National Committee's decision to pull the live audience over coronavirus concerns, means Sunday's debate in Washington, D.C., could be a quieter affair than the 10 that preceded it.
Still, Bernie Sanders, in a blunt assessment of his improbable path to the Democratic nomination, Wednesday made plain that he
wouldn't clear the way
for Mr. Biden. He offered a preview of the 2020 cycle's first one-on-one debate between the pair and pledged to press the former vice president on a range of liberal policy issues.
The scaled-down, televised event comes after Mr. Biden dominated a series of nominating contests over the past two weeks, opening up a wide delegate lead that will be hard for Mr. Sanders to close. The race moves next week to another group of
states that are mostly friendly to Mr. Biden
.
Mr. Sanders—who was the front-runner and center of attention at the last Democratic debate in Charleston, S.C., in February—acknowledged in his remarks Wednesday that his circumstances have changed.
""Today, I say to the Democratic establishment: In order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""And you must speak to the issues of concern to them.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Which candidate made the strongest case for himself on the debate stage? Join the conversation below.
Repeatedly calling Mr. Biden ""my friend Joe,"" he went on to list issues he said were important to his ardent supporters, including climate change, student debt and income inequality. His aides confirmed they view the debate as an opportunity to push his agenda.
""Bernie knows his base better than anybody,"" said Rebecca Katz, a Democratic strategist who backed Mr. Sanders in 2016. ""They aren't just going to line up behind Biden. What he did was tell Biden exactly how to win his supporters. It was a hell of a cheat sheet.""
Mr. Biden, meanwhile, will stay focused on President Trump, while making the case that he can make ""real, lasting progressive change in this country and in people's lives,"" according to a campaign spokesperson. Allies of both candidates said they expected the duo to be more critical of President Trump than of each other.
The matchup—which was moved from Phoenix to Washington, D.C., Thursday to reduce cross-country travel during
coronavirus concerns
—will be the first this election cycle without any female candidates, after all of the women in the race dropped out except Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, who didn't qualify for the debate.
The coronavirus outbreak, which prompted both Messrs. Biden and Sanders to cancel events in Cleveland on Tuesday, led the DNC to forgo an audience in the debate theater. There will be no background clapping or booing, as some debate audiences have done in previous rounds.
Zac Petkanas, a Democratic strategist who worked on Hillary Clinton's 2016 bid, said that could make a ""huge difference"" for the candidates and viewers at home.
""The candidates are flying without a net,"" Mr. Petkanas said. ""They won't get reactions for their jokes, for things that they think are really popular. It becomes a lot harder because you're not able to gauge how things are being perceived, and viewers are going to be operating without the equivalent of a laugh track in a sitcom. They have to figure out on their own what's popular and what's not.""
The no-audience format has had an impact in politics before. In 1993, then-Vice President Al Gore and businessman Ross Perot, who had run for president as an independent a year earlier, debated on CNN about the Clinton administration's push for the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Gore was widely viewed as the winner of that debate, and some political analysts say it helped the administration win public support for Nafta.
The one-on-one matchup could also give Mr. Biden more preparation to face Mr. Trump in general-election debates, if he ends up securing the Democratic nomination.
""A Bernie versus Biden debate needs to happen,"" said Adam Green, co-founder of the liberal group Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which backed Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. ""Biden has to withstand one-on-one scrutiny similar to a debate with Trump.""

Montana's two-term Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock said he would challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines, putting the GOP on defense in another state as it fights to keep control of the Senate in November.
Democrats had heavily recruited Mr. Bullock, who has won three times statewide in Montana, once as attorney general and twice as governor. He won his second term as governor in 2016 by about 4 percentage points—when President Trump won the traditionally red state by about 20 points.
Mr. Bullock had repeatedly denied any interest in running for Senate before and after
his failed presidential campaign
, which ended in December. Since then, he met with former President Obama last month, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer traveled to Montana to make a last-minute appeal to Mr. Bullock to run.
Mr. Bullock's announcement came just under the wire, coinciding with the filing deadline in Montana and propelling a previously sleepy Senate race into the national spotlight.
""I've always fought for the people of Montana. Together, we expanded health care, protected public lands, banned dark money in politics & more. Now I'm taking that fight to the US Senate. Let's make Washington work more like Montana,"" Mr. Bullock wrote on Twitter Monday morning.
Republicans now hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate. But this is an unfavorable election cycle for the party, which is defending 23 Republican-held seats in 2020. Democrats are defending just 12 seats, nine of them in states President Trump lost in 2016.
Democrats must gain three seats to take control of the Senate if they win the White House. If Mr. Trump is re-elected, Democrats would need to net four seats.
""Bullock getting into the race is a legitimate game-changer,"" said Nathan Gonzales, editor and publisher of Inside Elections, which provides nonpartisan analysis of campaigns. ""It brings a seat that was previously solid for Republicans onto the battlefield of competitive races. It decreases the percentage of competitive seats that Democrats need to win in order to gain control.""
With Mr. Bullock's entry, Inside Elections likely will move its rating of the race from solid Republican to lean Republican, Mr. Gonzales said.
Democratic Sen. Jon Tester narrowly won re-election for the other Senate seat in Montana in 2018. Mr. Daines, a businessman who served in the House from 2013 to 2015, is seeking his second term in the Senate. He was elected in an open race in 2014. He has stockpiled more than $5 million in campaign cash in preparation for the possibility that Mr. Bullock might take him on.
Other Competitive Senate Races
The Montana Senate race will be one of the competitive contests this election cycle. Others include:
North Carolina, where Democrat Cal Cunningham, a former state lawmaker and Army veteran, is challenging incumbent Republican Sen. Thom Tillis;
Colorado, where former Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper is hoping to oust GOP Sen. Cory Gardner, who is hoping for a second term;
Arizona, where former astronaut Mark Kelly has outraised Republican Sen. Martha McSally, a former combat pilot appointed in 2018 to fill Sen. John McCain's seat after he died;
Maine, where polls show Republican Sen. Susan Collins in a close race with her likely rival, Democrat Sara Gideon, speaker of the Maine House of Representatives.
""We're going to win this race because Steve Daines is always on Montana's side fighting for more high-paying jobs, against big government and defending Montanans' way of life,"" said Shane Scanlon, campaign manager for Mr. Daines.
""I'm still feeling confident,"" said Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP's campaign arm. ""Steve Daines is a great fit for the state. He's helped to sustain the longest period of economic prosperity and economic growth in American history, and he's fighting hard for the people of the state."" Mr. Young said Mr. Bullock's entry wouldn't change the Republican campaign committee's strategy. ""We're good,"" he said.
But Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who headed the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee last cycle, said Mr. Bullock's decision to run in Montana would expand the map for his party, making Montana a top-tier race alongside tough contests in Colorado, Arizona, North Carolina and Maine. ""He is immediately a credible, strong candidate for United State Senate and he clearly puts that state in play,"" Mr. Van Hollen said.
Long seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party, Mr. Bullock was sought-after as a Senate recruit, but he said he wasn't interested. Instead he
launched a presidential bid in May
, touting his ability to work with Republicans to expand Medicaid coverage in his state.
He raised and spent about $5.4 million, framing himself as a moderate who could win in states friendly to Mr. Trump. But in a crowded field, his campaign never took off. He only made one debate and dropped out in December, before the Iowa caucuses.
Mr. Bullock's announcement to run for the Senate comes less than a week after an unexpectedly strong Super Tuesday performance revived former Vice President Joe Biden's 's hopes of securing the Democratic presidential nomination.
Mr. Gonzales said there is little doubt that Mr. Bullock's prospects would be better with Mr. Biden as the party's nominee, rather than Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist.
""It's hard to believe that a top-tier candidate in a red state would put their life on hold to run with Bernie Sanders at the top of the ticket,"" he said.

WASHINGTON—The Republican-led Senate acquitted President Trump of charges stemming from his efforts to
pressure Ukraine to announce investigations that would benefit him
in this year's election, concluding a four-month drama that has consumed Washington and intensified the nation's sharp divide over his presidency.
On the first article of impeachment, abuse of power, all 47 Democrats and one Republican voted to convict the president, falling short of the 67 needed to remove the president from office. On the second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress, the vote also failed, with all Democrats and no Republicans finding the president guilty.
The
presidential impeachment trial,
the nation's third in its history, grew out of a July 25 phone call in which Mr. Trump asked Ukraine's president to announce certain investigations just as he was holding up U.S. aid to the country. Mr. Trump has defended the call as ""perfect"" and has said he did nothing wrong regarding Ukraine. The aid was later released after bipartisan outcry from lawmakers.
""The American people, and frankly, people all over the world, know it's a hoax,"" he told supporters at a recent rally in Des Moines, Iowa.
Mr. Trump had hoped for vindication in the Senate trial after a House investigation that he had decried as politically motivated. What he got was something less: Amid strong support for his acquittal from his own party, several Republicans also said Democrats had proved that he acted improperly regarding Ukraine.
Mr. Trump was also denied a unanimous verdict from Republican senators, with Mitt Romney of Utah voting to convict Mr. Trump on abuse of power.
""The president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust,"" Mr. Romney said on the Senate floor before the vote.
The action by Mr. Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, made him the first senator in U.S. history to vote to convict a president of his own party. In the impeachment trials of Democratic presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, no Democratic senators voted to convict.
The White House, which as late as Wednesday morning had been predicting that all Republican senators would vote to acquit the president, was caught off-guard by Mr. Romney's announcement, aides said. The White House abruptly closed to the media a planned event at which Mr. Trump had been expected to make remarks.
Nonetheless, the Senate vote to acquit among Republicans marked a clear victory for the president, underscoring his primacy in the GOP and among the party's voters and the end to a process that had hung over his presidency as he seeks re-election in November. Mr. Trump has sent nearly 700 tweets or retweets about impeachment, an average of more than five per day.
Democrats said the acquittal amounted to a defeat for both their party and the institution of Congress, and they warned that leaving Mr. Trump in office would make him free to abuse power again.
""He has compromised our elections and he will do so again,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who led the team of impeachment managers. ""You will not change him. You cannot constrain him.""

How do you think President Trump's acquittal will affect his bid for 2020, if at all? Join the conversation below.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) opened the inquiry in September over the president's push for Ukraine to announce investigations into Joe Biden, a potential election opponent this year, and his son, Hunter. Mr. Trump and his allies have argued that it was corrupt for Hunter Biden to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father as vice president was spearheading an anticorruption effort in the country. The Bidens have denied any wrongdoing. Hunter Biden has said it was poor judgment to take the board position while his father was involved with Ukraine policy.
The Democratic-led House called 17 witnesses and hundreds of documents to build its case, formally
impeaching the president in December
. A month later, it handed the articles over to the Senate, which heard arguments from House impeachment managers and Mr. Trump's defense team over about three weeks but rejected calling additional witnesses or documents, speeding Mr. Trump's acquittal.
Mr. Trump's impeachment trial, the first not to include witnesses, was shorter than its predecessors. Former President Bill Clinton's trial lasted two weeks longer than Mr. Trump's after senators voted to allow new depositions.
The tightly choreographed Senate trial was upended late last month by new revelations from former national security adviser John Bolton about the president's pressure campaign on Ukraine. The former official's
revelations in a yet-unpublished memoir
briefly raised the possibility a sufficient number of Republicans would join with Democrats to vote in favor of new witness testimony. But Republicans ultimately voted nearly in unison to oppose hearing from Mr. Bolton and other witnesses, moving the trial along to Wednesday's expected acquittal.
A top House Democrat said Wednesday the House would ""likely"" subpoena Mr. Bolton and continue the investigation. Mr. Bolton's spokeswoman declined to comment on whether he would comply with any subpoena.
The trial's political impact isn't clear. Mrs. Pelosi spent much of last year avoiding impeachment, telling her caucus it needed to be a bipartisan process and last spring describing the effort as ""not worth it."" Her mind changed
after The Wall Street Journal reported
in September that Mr. Trump had pressed Ukraine's president in the July call to investigate the Bidens. When centrists in her caucus backed an impeachment inquiry, she announced it would move forward.
A majority of voters said they believed Mr. Trump abused his power and obstructed Congress, according to a
Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll
published Sunday. Some 49% of respondents said he should be allowed to finish his term, compared with 46% who said he should be removed.
Impeachment also made little impact on Mr. Trump's job-approval rating, which stood at 46% in the January poll—in line with his rating throughout his presidency.
Despite his public attacks on the impeachment process, Mr. Trump stayed—at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's urging—largely on the sidelines of Republican efforts to rally lawmakers against voting for new witnesses and approached his own legal team with a fairly light touch.
The president's sole recommendation to his team came after the defense's first day of arguments, an administration official said. After his lawyers argued for two hours, he called with a request: put Pam Bondi on TV more. He told the team he wanted Ms. Bondi, the former Florida attorney general who joined the White House last fall as an adviser on impeachment, to continue arguing his case on TV in the evenings.
Instead, Mr. Trump focused his attention elsewhere. As the trial unfolded last week, White House officials huddled with GOP House members and their aides in a small room in the vice president's office in the Capitol that one GOP aide described as ""mission control."" The president, the aide said, insisted advisers not call it a ""war room,"" which he said wrongly suggested Republicans were embattled and that impeachment was an actual crisis.
Republicans' arguments in favor of acquittal split broadly into two camps. Some argued that House impeachment managers' case was half-baked and that Democrats should have gone to court to pursue the testimony of further witnesses before voting to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate. Democrats countered that such a move would have significantly delayed the effort to oust Mr. Trump, who they saw as a danger to the next election.
Others in the party said House Democrats had proved their case but that the president's conduct wasn't impeachable.
Mr. Trump continues to be supportive of investigations into the Bidens, which are being pushed by his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and his allies on Capitol Hill. Hours before the Senate vote to acquit his client, Mr. Giuliani posted his fourth episode of his podcast, titled ""The Trial: The Biden Family Crimes Conclusively Proved."" In the video, he offered no new evidence but included a three-minute interlude asking viewers to subscribe to the magazine Cigar Aficionado.
