| Jump to first hitThe retired senator, still deeply involved in Nevada politics, is convinced that Saturday's caucuses will run smoothly and strengthen his state's case for leapfrogging Iowa in the next election.LAS VEGAS -- As the Democratic presidential candidates plead with Nevadans for their support in 2020, Harry Reid is already looking to 2024.Mr. Reid, the former Democratic leader in the Senate, said in an interview that he hoped that his home state would move to the very front of the primary calendar in the next election. The decades-long tradition of deferring to Iowa and New Hampshire should be over, Mr. Reid said.""We've done it for years -- to have the other 48 states playing second fiddle to two states that aren't representative of the country,"" he said, arguing that it was unfair for those overwhelmingly white states to vote first.Needless to say, the statement reflects Nevada's political interests, as well as Mr. Reid's longstanding ambition to elevate his state in the presidential nominating process. But even as he allowed that he had a certain bias, Mr. Reid insisted it was not merely Silver State pride behind his preference for Nevada going first in 2024.""Of course I think that, but it's not just me,"" Mr. Reid said, citing what he called a general view that Nevada is ""more representative of what's going on in the country.""""We have a state that is extremely diverse -- about half the state is white, the rest is minorities,"" he noted. ""We have a state that is environmentally sensitive. It is a state that's heavily unionized.""Mr. Reid, 80, is staking his hopes in part on Saturday's caucuses here, and a number of his current and former advisers have been deeply involved in preparing the state to avoid an Iowa-style meltdown. Nevada has held several days of early voting, with all signs so far pointing to strong turnout.Should the caucuses go off well this weekend -- and thus strengthen Nevada's claim to a place of privilege in the presidential nominating process -- it would represent a personal triumph for Mr. Reid, who set out more than a decade ago to give his state a powerful hand in selecting presidential candidates. A longtime critic of Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr. Reid engineered an early role for his state starting in the 2008 election cycle and the significance of Nevada has grown on the Democratic side with each successive campaign.The prospect of Iowa or New Hampshire being displaced in 2024 now appears more plausible than ever, as a result of the fiasco in Iowa this month and Democratic leaders' growing discomfort with the homogeneous character of those states.But the stakes are high this weekend for Nevada Democrats, who must pull off a complex caucus process of their own if they are going to have a chance of moving up next time. Officials with the state and national parties have taken additional steps since Iowa to ensure a smooth vote, but anxiety continues to run high among Democratic leaders and the various presidential campaigns.Mr. Reid expressed confidence that Nevada Democrats were prepared to conduct a far more successful caucus than the one that unfolded in Iowa, and boasted that his state had ""the strongest party organization in the country.""Though he nominally retired from professional politics in 2016, Mr. Reid still looms large as an elder statesman of Nevada politics and remains deeply involved with the party: He said that he was receiving regular updates on preparations from the caucuses and that he had been speaking frequently with Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee.But while Mr. Reid praised Mr. Perez as ""a very easy man to deal with,"" he said he had not recently asked the party chairman for any special assistance in ensuring the success of the vote this weekend.""I think we've got that under control,"" Mr. Reid said, adding of Mr. Perez, ""We keep him advised as to what's going on, but I don't think there's much they can do to help us, except help us financially.""Still, Mr. Reid acknowledged that the voter turnout so far had been higher than expected, leading to long lines at some early voting sites. One of Mr. Reid's sons had waited in line for an hour and a half to vote early this week, he said, with Mr. Reid's 18-year-old grandson in tow.""I wish we hadn't had lines that long, but we really have been stunned by the turnouts we've had so far,"" Mr. Reid said, adding, ""I think that we are having a very good voter experience. The turnout has been something, quite frankly, I didn't expect.""More than 70,000 Nevadans voted early in the caucuses, according to the Democratic Party, putting the state on track to easily surpass turnout in the 2016 contests.Meeting with a reporter on Tuesday, before the most recent debate, Mr. Reid reviewed the Democratic field in broadly positive terms: He said he believed that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was strong in Nevada, though he noted Mr. Sanders had faced ""a little trouble"" from the powerful Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which had ""indicated they're not happy with him.""(The labor group has strongly criticized Mr. Sanders for his proposal to replace the private health care system with a ""Medicare for all"" policy, because it would supersede the desirable health insurance plan negotiated by the union. Mr. Sanders has insisted that any health care plan enacted under his watch would improve workers' benefits.)Mr. Reid suggested former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had been better positioned in the state before his setbacks in Iowa and New Hampshire. But he said he believed that Mr. Biden still had the potential to finish second, and that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts should not be counted out, either.He added that he had spoken recently with former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whom he described as ""a very inquisitive man"" who had run an impressive campaign. But Mr. Reid remained scrupulously neutral.When it came to Nevada's role in choosing presidents, Mr. Reid made no pretense of neutrality. He acknowledged that it still might not be easy to leapfrog Iowa and New Hampshire, but he said he believed Nevada had ""a real shot at being first in the nation.""""I'm convinced that Nevada's going to move up significantly,"" he said.Mr. Reid said he planned to visit at least one caucus site on Saturday before monitoring the results from home. Throughout the day, Mr. Reid said, he would ""let my presence be known.""PhotographHarry Reid said Nevada's caucus ought to be first because the state is ""more representative of what's going on in the country.""

| Jump to first hitMs. Warren is figuring out what candidates like Beto O’Rourke, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand have already learned: It’s hard to appeal to both the center and the left of the Democratic Party.
DAVENPORT, Iowa — The voter asked Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts the question on many Iowans’ minds: What did she have to offer besides her litany of policy proposals?
At first, Ms. Warren responded with a story about her working-class upbringing, saying she intimately understood a family’s day-to-day financial struggles. Then she gave a second answer, a more direct argument for her ability to beat President Trump.
“I’m the only person who will be on the debate stage who's beaten a popular incumbent Republican anytime in the last 25 years,” Ms. Warren said. “In other words, I know how to fight, I know how to win, and that’s what I plan to do.”
The response, given at a rally in Davenport on Sunday, was a rare foray into horse-race politics from a candidate who has dismissed the importance of polls, rarely reads news coverage about herself and detests Beltway punditry. But it was part of a quiet recognition among her advisers and surrogates that, less than one month before the Iowa caucuses, Ms. Warren is being damaged by criticism and pressure from both moderates and liberals within the Democratic Party, whose doubts about her have fueled concerns about her ability to win.
These worries have also filtered down to voters, who, in more than two dozen interviews during Ms. Warren’s two most recent trips to Iowa, have expressed a growing fear that her candidacy is neither satisfying nor uniting the political factions in the party.
“It’s been a problem,” said Peter Leo, the chairman of Iowa’s Carroll County Democrats, who has endorsed Ms. Warren. “She’s getting hit from the left and the right.”
Ms. Warren’s conundrum is tied to the all-important notion of “electability,” the vague and sometimes discriminatory concept that has become paramount to Democratic voters who are motivated by defeating Mr. Trump.
When Ms. Warren’s campaign was riding high in the summer and early fall, the energy around her ideas was an implicit message to both liberals and moderates: She was the one who could win. But after a series of attacks, beginning on health care policy, she has lost ground as some voters have retreated to their ideological corners: the left-wing base that has rallied around Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and the moderate group of Democrats who have largely backed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. or former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.
It has created a self-fulfilling cycle that Ms. Warren is now trying to break.
Wallace Watson, a 52-year-old who attended her rally over the weekend in Dubuque, Iowa, said he decided to support Ms. Warren months ago because he saw her as the only candidate who could energize both voters who backed Mr. Sanders in 2016 and those who supported Hillary Clinton, the party’s nominee. In recent months, however, he admitted that his faith in Ms. Warren had been tested.
“I think she has long-term viability, but it’s unfortunate that she has had press coverage in the last months of the year that has seemed to lessen her impact,” Mr. Watson said. “She needs to step up her campaign and make herself a viable candidate again. I’m hopeful she will.”
Ms. Warren’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this story. But in private conversations, her advisers acknowledge that this ideological squeeze is similar to one that doomed earlier candidates like former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Senator Kamala Harris of California. But unlike those candidates, who often made grand pivots in order to appease both sides, Ms. Warren is placing her bet on authenticity and hoping voters will reward her for being consistent.
But she is still making minor tweaks to her strategy. She has appeared on more national television programs in recent days, including a rare appearance on the Sunday political talk show circuit. Adam Green, who leads the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and has advised Ms. Warren, said to expect her to “make the case for electability” against Mr. Trump in the coming month, aimed at “scared progressives” who are “tentatively parked with others like Biden.”
The campaign has also amassed a roster of energetic and potentially influential surrogates, including Julián Castro, the former cabinet secretary and presidential candidate, Representatives Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts and Katie Porter of California, and a collective of activists called “Black Womxn For,” all of whom are set to descend on Iowa in the coming weeks.
These surrogates may go on the offensive in ways Ms. Warren has resisted. At their joint rally in Brooklyn on Tuesday, it was Mr. Castro — not Ms. Warren — who made the most explicit case for why she was better suited than her primary opponents to beat Mr. Trump.
“More than any other candidate in this race, more than any other candidate that’s going to be on that debate stage in a few days, Elizabeth Warren is the candidate who can unite the entire Democratic Party,” he said. “When you talk to people on the ground, you find that they like Elizabeth Warren. You find that they’re willing to support her. You find that she has the best damn organization in these early states.”
Ms. Warren’s campaign has avoided setting expectations for its Iowa finish. But Sean McElwee, whose think tank, Data for Progress, has worked closely with Ms. Warren’s campaign, said he thought she probably needed a first- or second-place finish in Iowa to unlock her numbers elsewhere — and at a minimum, she must beat Mr. Sanders.
“One of her advantages are that a lot of people are considering her,” Mr. McElwee said. “One of her disadvantages is that the people who are considering her are considering everyone else.”
It will be an electoral tightrope walk of the highest order, as evidenced by the way the debate about Ms. Warren’s health care plan consumed the final months of 2019. It started with the race’s moderates, who pressured Ms. Warren into providing additional details about how she planned to pay for and transition to a “Medicare for all” system. When those details diverged from the outline in Mr. Sanders’s bill, some members of the party’s left flank accused her of political betrayal.
Other issues have prompted a backlash against Ms. Warren in the early days of this year. After Mr. Trump ordered the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, one of Iran’s top military commanders, Ms. Warren issued a statement that was rejected by some on the party’s left, who said she had not sufficiently embraced an antiwar framework like that of Mr. Sanders. After she released a second statement, she faced criticism for not denouncing Mr. Suleimani in sufficiently harsh terms, even as other candidates who also adjusted their public remarks — including Mr. Buttigieg — escaped scrutiny.
Last week, Ms. Warren surprised some of her own supporters by embracing the updated trade deal between the United States, Mexico and Canada, which was negotiated by Mr. Trump to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, saying it created some market stability for farmers. It was also a rare break between her and Mr. Sanders, who argued the bill would not stop the outsourcing of jobs and had lax environmental regulations.
The Sunrise Movement, the nationwide group of young climate activists, said Ms. Warren’s support for the agreement “undermines her commitments to the Green New Deal.” Prominent online supporters of Ms. Warren, including leaders at the Working Families Party, the progressive group that endorsed her in September, boosted tweets about being “heartbroken” by Ms. Warren’s decision.
In his western Iowa county, Mr. Leo said, Ms. Warren had not lost support to Mr. Sanders, but to moderates like Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. He believes the Warren campaign should focus on persuading moderate Democrats who may have abandoned it over electability fears.
“Forty percent of people are with the progressives. Forty percent of people are with Biden or Buttigieg. It’ll be a sprint to that 20 percent,” Mr. Leo said. “It’s an advantage that she’s a lot of people’s second choice. So when Pete or Joe or Amy isn’t viable, that support can find itself to her.”
Mr. McElwee, for his part, criticized the analysis of Ms. Warren’s general election prospects, including a poll released by The New York Times in the fall. He said it helped create a narrative that Ms. Warren was a weak candidate against Mr. Trump, resulting in a campaign that is more reliant on good results in Iowa than ever before.
At the same time, he cautioned Ms. Warren’s campaign against outsourcing the all-important electability argument to surrogates and outsiders.
“It’s been baffling,” Mr. McElwee said of the campaign’s response to being attacked from both sides. “They haven’t really contested the question.”

| Jump to first hitThe Sanders campaign appeared on the brink of a commanding lead in the Democratic race. But a series of fateful decisions and internal divisions have left him all but vanquished.In mid-January, a few weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Senator Bernie Sanders's pollster offered a stark prognosis for the campaign: Mr. Sanders was on track to finish strong in the first three nominating states, but Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s powerful support from older African-Americans could make him a resilient foe in South Carolina and beyond.The pollster, Ben Tulchin, in a meeting with campaign aides, recommended a new offensive to influence older black voters, according to three people briefed on his presentation. The data showed two clear vulnerabilities for Mr. Biden: his past support for overhauling Social Security, and his authorship of a punitive criminal justice law in the 1990s.But the suggestion met with resistance. Some senior advisers argued that it wasn't worth diverting resources from Iowa and New Hampshire, people familiar with the campaign's deliberations said. Others pressed Mr. Tulchin on what kind of message, exactly, would make voters rethink their support for the most loyal ally of the first black president.Crucially, both Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane, consistently expressed reservations about going negative on Mr. Biden, preferring to stick with the left-wing policy message they have been pressing for 40 years.The warnings about Mr. Biden proved prescient: Two months later, Mr. Sanders is now all but vanquished in the Democratic presidential race, after Mr. Biden resurrected his campaign in South Carolina and built an overwhelming coalition of black voters and white moderates on Super Tuesday.While Mr. Sanders has not ended his bid, he has fallen far behind Mr. Biden in the delegate count and has taken to trumpeting his success in the battle of ideas rather than arguing that he still has a path to the nomination. His efforts to regain traction have faltered in recent weeks as the coronavirus pandemic has frozen the campaign, and perhaps heightened the appeal of Mr. Biden's safe-and-steady image.In the view of some Sanders advisers, the candidate's abrupt decline was a result of unforeseeable and highly unlikely events -- most of all, the sudden withdrawal of two major candidates, Senator Amy Klobuchar and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who instantly threw their support to Mr. Biden and helped spur a rapid coalescing of moderate support behind his campaign.Mr. Sanders had been ""on the brink of winning,"" Mr. Tulchin argued, ""until the most unprecedented event in the history of presidential primaries occurred.""But interviews with more than three dozen Sanders aides, elected officials, activists and other people who worked with his campaign revealed a more extensive picture of his reversal of political fortune. Though Mr. Sanders climbed to a position of seeming dominance by mid-February, he and his inner circle also made a series of fateful decisions that left him ill positioned to win over skeptical Democrats -- and sorely vulnerable to an opponent with Mr. Biden's strengths.Mr. Sanders proved unable to expand his base well beyond the left or to win over African-Americans in meaningful numbers. He failed to heed warnings from traditional party leaders, and even from within his campaign, about the need to modulate his message and unify Democrats. He allowed internal arguments to fester within his campaign, an ungainly operation that fragmented into factions beneath the only two real decision makers -- Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane.Though outwardly amiable, Mr. Sanders's inner circle fractured between some long-serving counselors and relative newcomers, like Faiz Shakir, his campaign manager. Mr. Shakir and others regarded pleas from Mr. Tulchin and another pugilistic aide, David Sirota, to go on the attack against Mr. Biden as both futile and annoyingly predictable, while Mr. Shakir's internal critics saw him as exceedingly territorial.There were also serious operational mistakes: In South Carolina, the campaign effectively deputized a former Ohio state senator and loyal surrogate, Nina Turner, to direct strategy, rather than empowering a political strategist to run the pivotal early state. In private conversations, Mr. Sanders often touted his support from some younger African-Americans, seemingly missing the bigger picture.And for all of Mr. Tulchin's alarm in January about South Carolina, on the eve of the primary he was reassuring Mr. Sanders that a public poll showing him down over 20 percentage points in the state was ""an outlier for good reason.""In an email sent to Mr. Sanders and a group of senior aides, Mr. Tulchin reminded the senator that their internal polling had him trailing Mr. Biden by only four points. Two days later, the former vice president would win South Carolina by nearly 30 points.Perhaps the most significant factor, as with every presidential campaign, was the candidate himself, and the stubborn ideological and stylistic consistency that both endeared Mr. Sanders to his supporters and limited his ability to build a majority coalition larger than his own progressive movement.Mr. Sanders's campaign declined to comment for this article.It was Mr. Sanders's persistent lashing of the ""political establishment"" that concerned Representative Peter Welch, a liberal Democrat and fellow Vermonter who was one of just a few members of Congress to endorse Mr. Sanders's campaign.Mr. Welch said he had reached out to the campaign last month to implore Mr. Sanders to ease up on that rhetoric, which Mr. Welch believed sounded exclusionary to ordinary people backing other candidates. After all, Mr. Welch said, there were ""a lot of voters who are just everyday voters, who decided to vote for other Democrats.""An Inner Circle DividedIt was late January when Zephyr Teachout, a liberal law professor allied with Mr. Sanders, wrote a column in The Guardian alleging that Mr. Biden had ""a big corruption problem."" Mr. Sirota, the Sanders aide, who is known for his voluble and combative online persona, quickly blasted out her column to his large email list. A new phase of conflict between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden seemed to be underway.But Mr. Sanders put a stop to it. ""It is absolutely not my view that Joe is corrupt in any way,"" Mr. Sanders told CBS News.In private, Mr. Sanders's campaign went further, according to two people familiar with the internal turmoil. As punishment for stirring the controversy, Mr. Sirota, who is based in Colorado, was barred from traveling for the campaign outside of visits to its Washington headquarters.The conflict over Ms. Teachout's column was part of a long-running debate within the Sanders campaign about what approach to take with Mr. Biden. A small group of advisers -- including Mr. Tulchin, Ms. Turner and Mr. Sirota -- regularly pleaded with Mr. Sanders to attack the former vice president.But Mr. Sanders resisted, giving speech after speech scorching unnamed establishment Democrats but declining to pursue Mr. Biden directly. He ruled out several lines of attack against the former vice president because they touched on Mr. Biden's role in the Obama administration, which Democratic primary voters revere.Mr. Shakir and a second senior aide, Ari Rabin-Havt, took Mr. Sanders's side and repeatedly reminded other campaign officials that Mr. Sanders was the ultimate decision maker on the campaign. In conversations with associates, both men agreed that it might make sense to criticize Mr. Biden in a sharper way. But they said Mr. Sanders could not be persuaded to do so: He and Jane liked the Bidens personally, and their word was final.The fissures within the campaign leadership extended beyond how to deal with Mr. Biden.In January, efforts by Ms. Turner and others to direct some campaign resources into Super Tuesday states fizzled against opposition from Mr. Shakir and others. Mr. Shakir was adamant that Mr. Sanders's path to the nomination ran principally through Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, and the California primary on Super Tuesday.There was also a running argument within the campaign about how to handle Senator Elizabeth Warren, with some advisers viewing her as a serious threat that needed to be quashed and others, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mr. Sanders's most important endorser, urging the campaign to seek conciliation.The dispute erupted publicly in January, when CNN reported that Mr. Sanders had told Ms. Warren in 2018 that he did not believe a woman could defeat President Trump, an assertion Mr. Sanders denied.Mr. Shakir escalated the conflict, daring Ms. Warren on TV to call the report a ""lie."" Jeff Weaver, a top Sanders adviser, took a different approach in his own TV appearance, suggesting there had been a misunderstanding -- a step he told associates was aimed at calming things down.But Ms. Warren stood by the account, and a clash between her and Mr. Sanders consumed the Democratic debate in Iowa. It would linger over both of them for the remainder of the race.Revolutionary to a FaultDespite the divisions within his campaign, Mr. Sanders cut a winning path through the first few states to vote, culminating with a landslide victory in Nevada on Feb. 22. In his speech that night, Mr. Sanders sounded a unifying note, focusing on his ""multigenerational, multiracial coalition.""Encountering a pair of reporters in a Las Vegas hotel that evening, Mr. Tulchin -- strolling to dinner with Mr. Weaver -- crowed that Mr. Sanders had delivered a speech worthy of the general election. Mr. Weaver was more subdued, noting that the primary fight was not over.The speech turned out to be a blip between Mr. Sanders's anti-establishment diatribes. And there was little aides could do to steer him in a different direction: The chief speechwriter on the Sanders campaign was Mr. Sanders.For months, his political advisers and outside allies had quietly mulled a shift in tone -- the possibility that Mr. Sanders might take even modest steps to show skeptical Democrats that he could unify the party.But he has always been disdainful of the art of politics and had to be nudged into wooing even friendly Democratic leaders. As Ms. Warren relentlessly courted Ms. Ocasio-Cortez last fall, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's advisers had to prod Mr. Sanders's aides into having him call her -- a conversation that eventually led to her endorsing him.Pushing Mr. Sanders to reach out to ""establishment Democrats"" whom he regularly taunted was even tougher -- despite the best efforts of even some of his staunchest supporters on the left. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez repeatedly urged the campaign to broaden Mr. Sanders's message and seek out new allies, outside his familiar base. (In a statement, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez denied any ""tension or major disagreements"" with Mr. Sanders.)RoseAnn DeMoro, the former leader of the nurses union who was one of Mr. Sanders's most ferocious surrogates in 2016, and the actor John Cusack, another ally, both pressed the campaign to refocus Mr. Sanders's pitch on a general-election audience, people familiar with their entreaties said.Mr. Cusack urged the Sanders campaign to address voters beyond its progressive base, proposing that the senator give a speech at St. Francis College in Brooklyn and citing its namesake's connection to environmentalism and fighting poverty. ""His campaign needs to create a unit that is charged with outreach to groups who do NOT identify as progressive, but have strong views that are aligned with his. EXPAND EXPAND EXPAND"" Mr. Cusack wrote to top Sanders allies and advisers, in an email obtained by The New York Times.Mr. Sanders was not interested in moving in that direction. Some advisers, who endured the divisive 2016 campaign, believed that it was only after seizing a dominant advantage that Mr. Sanders could attempt to make peace with a Democratic establishment that remained intensely wary of him.Arriving in Charleston, S.C., ahead of the Feb. 29 state primary, Mr. Weaver said the campaign had not yet sought a working relationship with figures like the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi because they wanted first to demonstrate the full sweep of their coalition on Super Tuesday three days later. He reached for a Civil War analogy to explain the muscle-flexing strategy. Abraham Lincoln did not issue the Emancipation Proclamation, Mr. Weaver said, until after Union troops turned back the Confederacy at the bloody battle of Antietam.In the weeks before Super Tuesday, Mr. Sanders had indeed refused to yield to critics who were searching for gestures of accommodation. In Nevada, leaders of the powerful Culinary Workers Union Local 226 were frustrated that Mr. Sanders did not speak out more forcefully when his supporters heaped abuse on predominantly female union leaders over their opposition to ""Medicare for all.""As Culinary officials were deluged with vitriol, including graphic and misogynistic messages, Mr. Sanders placed a phone call to the union's secretary-treasurer, Geoconda Argüello-Kline, but they never connected.""Our feeling was that Senator Sanders should have said something earlier and should have been stronger about it,"" said Bethany Khan, a political strategist for the union.And then there was Cuba: In February, Democratic officials in Florida reached out to propose convening some conversations between Mr. Sanders and Latino leaders in South Florida, many of whom were nervous about his rhetoric on socialism and revolution. The Sanders campaign showed tentative interest, people familiar with the conversations said.Then, the day after the Nevada caucuses, CBS aired a ""60 Minutes"" interview in which Mr. Sanders stood by his past praise for certain policies of Fidel Castro's government. Democrats across Florida, including prominent members of Congress, erupted in dismay.Mr. Sanders stood his ground, including in a televised debate. And he made no attempt at private damage control: None of the lawmakers who rebuked him in public heard from Mr. Sanders or his senior aides.His campaign eventually dispatched emissaries, including the actress and activist Cynthia Nixon, to meet quietly with Latino groups in Orlando after Super Tuesday, but they could not assure local Democrats that Mr. Sanders would change course before Florida's March 17 primary.""It may be authentic to Bernie, but it does not work in Florida,"" said Alex Barrio, a Democratic activist in Florida who attended the meeting. ""It's conceding Florida in a monumental way.""By the time Florida voted, however, the race was all but over.Mr. Sanders's campaign, like much of the political world, had not anticipated Mr. Biden's roaring comeback after South Carolina's Feb. 29 primary. Indeed, until then, Mr. Sanders's campaign was expecting to win seven or eight of the 14 states voting on Super Tuesday and seize a solid delegate lead over the rest of the Democratic field.So confident was Mr. Sanders that he would vanquish Mr. Biden that he spent valuable days trying to force two other candidates out of the race by campaigning in Minnesota and Massachusetts, the home states of Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Warren. He won neither.Mr. Sanders had suddenly become a spectator in the campaign, powerless to stop a tectonic shift against him by the party's moderate wing. Ms. Klobuchar called Mr. Sanders before announcing her endorsement of Mr. Biden, while Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg did not speak.After being routed across the country, Mr. Sanders knew who to blame in an appearance on ABC's ""This Week.""""What the establishment wanted was to make sure that people coalesced around Biden and try to defeat me,"" Mr. Sanders said.

| Jump to first hitA female vice president would make history. But some cringe at settling for silver after spending a year competing hard for the gold.
DEARBORN, Mich. — The second highest, hardest glass ceiling is pretty good too, right?
With the Democratic presidential nominee all but certain to be a man, party activists, elected officials and voters are setting their sights on the biggest consolation prize in American politics: the vice presidency.
Within hours of Senator Elizabeth Warren’s exit from the race, a departure that left the party facing a primary battle between two septuagenarian white men, prominent Democrats began publicly insisting that the ticket include a woman, preferably a black woman.
At least one women’s organization, Supermajority, circulated a petition asking both Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. to “affirm their commitment to gender equity” by choosing a woman as their running mate. On Sunday, as he endorsed Mr. Sanders before thousands at a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., the Rev. Jesse Jackson called for the next president to pick a black woman as vice president.
“There must be a woman on this ticket,” said Cecile Richards, a longtime abortion rights activist and a founder of Supermajority. “What is really important to see is representation, a commitment to the issues that women care about and a commitment to do something about it.”
The selection of a female vice president, particularly one of color, would offer a fitting coda to a presidential primary where racial and gender representation has taken second place to concerns about defeating President Trump.
Even when the female candidates were still in the race, people at town hall meetings and campaign rallies often suggested Ms. Warren or Senator Kamala Harris as possible No. 2s on a ticket, as a way of providing a dose of history-making enthusiasm without what many voters viewed as the risk of having a woman lead the ticket. They’re unlikely to face much opposition from the candidates: Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders say they are considering multiple women for the position.
The calls for a female vice president have intensified as the primary has essentially narrowed to a two-man race. Hillary Clinton said she would “love” to see a woman on the ticket but, in an interview with CNN, urged the future nominee to “take a really hard look at the Electoral College for what will help him.”
On Sunday, Ms. Harris of California endorsed Mr. Biden, heightening speculation that she could be selected as his running mate. Despite a bitter competition, Mr. Biden remains fond of Ms. Harris, in part because she was friends with his late son Beau Biden when they both served as state attorneys general.
“I believe in Joe,” she said in a video posted on Twitter. “I really believe in him, and I have known him for a long time.”
His wife expressed a slightly less glowing view of the California senator.
At a Friday fund-raiser in the Chicago suburbs, a largely female audience shouted suggestions for vice-presidential nominees to Jill Biden, with many arguing the pick should be a woman. The former second lady described Ms. Harris’s debate-stage attacks on Mr. Biden’s record on race as a “punch to the gut.” She offered more praise for Senator Amy Klobuchar, who endorsed Mr. Biden last week, calling her “an incredible woman.”
Yet the reality is that the hope of seeing a woman come closer to the presidency than ever before now rests with two men born during World War II, a political dynamic that feels slightly uncomfortable to some of those most eager to see a woman in the White House. While academics, activists and officials seeking to promote women in politics embrace the idea that a qualified woman could become vice president, some also cringe at being encouraged to settle for silver after spending a year competing hard for the gold.
“In the current political environment, it looks tone deaf to have an all-white, all-male ticket,” said Jennifer Lawless, a professor at the University of Virginia and an expert on women in politics. “There’s no question that the notion of a female V.P. is used as a strategy and I think that’s a little bit sexist. It’s sort of like an ‘insert woman here’ kind of conversation.”
People close to both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders say their campaigns see strong political arguments for putting a woman on the ticket, believing such a choice could generate enthusiasm from female voters who make up the backbone of the party and sharpen their contrast with Mr. Trump, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by nearly a dozen women.
Women remain Mr. Trump’s staunchest opponents, with large majorities consistently giving him some of the lowest marks in polling. His presidency has inspired the largest gender gap in history and supercharged turnout among female Democrats.
“The nomination of the vice president is about building unity and a partnership that can best govern,” said Larry Cohen, a longtime adviser to Mr. Sanders and the chairman of Our Revolution, the organization that spun out of the senator’s 2016 presidential campaign. “The women who sought the nomination and others easily meet both criteria.”
Though not quite as barrier-breaking as a female president, electing a woman as vice president would be historic. Only two have been nominated: Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska by the Republican Party in 2008 and Representative Geraldine A. Ferraro by Democrats in 1984.
Putting a woman on the ticket could also move the country closer to electing a first female president. If elected, the female vice president could later find herself in a stronger position to win the presidency than any woman in American history.
A vocal segment of the party argues that the vice-presidential slot must go not just to any woman but specifically to a black woman, given the crucial support African-American women have given to the Democrats in recent elections. Over the past three years, the overwhelming backing of black women helped the party recapture control of the House and flip Senate and governor’s seats in deep-red states like Louisiana and Alabama.
“African-American women have been the most loyal supporters of Democratic candidates,” said Representative Barbara Lee of California, a former chairwoman of Ms. Harris’s campaign. “It’s time we have an African-American woman as vice president.”
Nikema Williams, the Democratic Party chairwoman in Georgia,put it simply: “A black woman on the ticket is the margin of victory.”
Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic Senate leader, is particularly focused on the idea, arguing that such a pick could help unite the party after a divisive primary, according to people who have spoken with Mr. Schumer.
Mr. Schumer isn’t the only party official intrigued by the idea of putting a black woman on the ticket. Some close to Mr. Biden are urging him to pick a nominee who could protect his support among black voters, whose strong support has helped him capture the lead in the primary race.
Women of various backgrounds have been suggested as possible running mates for Mr. Biden.
He recently named Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan as a national co-chair of his campaign. Other names that have been floated by Mr. Biden or those around him include Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia House minority leader who narrowly lost a race for governor last year; Sally Yates, the deputy attorney general who became a Democratic icon after being fired by Mr. Trump early in his term; Ms. Klobuchar; and Senators Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire.
Mr. Sanders, meanwhile, is seeking a woman who agrees with his signature policy proposal, “Medicare for all.” With many of his top female surrogates, including Representatives Ilhan Omar, Pramila Jayapal and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, disqualified from seeking the presidency because of their age or foreign birthplace, Ms. Warren is one of a few elected officials who fit the criteria, according to some close to the Sanders campaign.
Following in the long tradition of possible vice-presidential picks, the women in the midst of all the chatter have largely declined to comment on whether they’ve been approached about the job. Ms. Whitmer said that she raised the issue of representation with Mr. Biden and planned to participate in all aspects of the campaign — including vetting possible running mates. Ms. Abrams recently said that she planned to be president by 2040 but would consider vice president in the meantime.
“I accept that I exist in the political zeitgeist in a very specific way,” she told the website 538 in an interview, when asked about whether she could be selected to “balance out” a white man at the top of the ticket.
Ms. Klobuchar said she had no conversations about future positions with Mr. Biden or his aides when she discussed ending her campaign and endorsing his. “It didn’t even cross my mind to try to make some deal or anything like that,” she said.
While little academic research has been done on female vice presidents, there’s plenty of data from business and economics that suggests women are more likely to be overlooked for chief executive positions and other top jobs. As in politics, it’s harder for assertive, ambitious women to be seen as likable, and easier to conclude they lack some intangible, ill-defined quality of leadership, the data shows.
Yet there’s also little evidence that vice presidents — male or female — have a significant impact on converting undecided voters, despite all the thought campaigns put into selecting presidential running mates. Studies of the 2008 race found that while Ms. Palin shored up her party’s evangelical base, she did little to help John McCain, the Republican nominee, win over independent or Democratic-leaning women.
“The research on the importance of the vice president is pretty compelling in that there’s a lot of strategy that goes into the pick and not a lot of evidence that it matters,” Dr. Lawless said.
For months, both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden have indicated that they are likely to select a female candidate. In February, Mr. Sanders said his campaign would select someone “maybe not of the same gender that I am.”
During a town hall event in November, Mr. Biden floated four possible vice-presidential picks. All were women. He has also said both Ms. Warren and Ms. Harris would be on his list of potential picks.
Last spring, weeks before Mr. Biden announced his bid, his advisers discussed naming either Ms. Abrams or Ms. Harris to the ticket early, perhaps even before he captured the nomination. The unusual move was considered as a way to build enthusiasm and reassure voters about his age.
A few weeks later, Ms. Harris pushed back, noting that Mr. Biden, in turn, would be an asset as the No. 2 on the ticket: “As vice president, he’s shown he can do the job.”

| Jump to first hitThe battle for momentum in the two states could prove pivotal. Here's how the candidates are making their pitches.In South Carolina, four presidential candidates are running ads featuring praise from former President Barack Obama.In Nevada, Senator Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer and Pete Buttigieg are pitching their candidacies in Spanish.And Mr. Steyer has gone negative, attacking Mr. Sanders of Vermont for failing to provide a price tag for his ""Medicare for All"" plan, calling former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ""another insider"" and Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., an ""untested newcomer.""After the Iowa caucuses devolved into a chaotic mess and the New Hampshire primary did little to offer clarity, the battle for momentum in Nevada and South Carolina -- two states with meaningfully diverse populations that more closely resemble the Democratic base -- could prove pivotal.After the New Hampshire primary, multiple candidates began running their first significant ad campaigns in Nevada, which caucuses on Feb. 22, and South Carolina, which votes on Feb. 29. Total spending in both states jumped to $4.5 million from $2.5 million the week before.And with many campaigns now strapped for cash as they head toward Super Tuesday on March 3, their messaging and the money they can put behind it may foreshadow who will be a force in a national campaign and who will run into a wall.""While there has been some campaigning in Nevada, the voters aren't nearly as tuned in as Iowa and New Hampshire, so it is very important to get campaign messages in front of voters,"" said Kelly Gibson, a Democratic media strategist who advised the campaigns of Andrew Yang and Julián Castro.""The flip side of that,"" she said, is ""many voters are still making up their minds, so the ads can have more immediate effectiveness.""Obama, Clyburn and appeals to black voters in South CarolinaA majority of South Carolina's Democratic voters are black, and campaigns have been tailoring their pitches to appeal to them.Both Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are running 30 seconds of uninterrupted praise from Mr. Obama.The plaudits for Ms. Warren are for spearheading the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Her campaign has recently cut its ad reservations in South Carolina, and the ad will be on air for only a few more days.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]Mr. Biden's campaign, which has more than $735,000 on air over the next two weeks in a state it has staked its future on, cribbed its ad from the ceremony where he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.""Joe's candid, honest counsel made me a better president and a better commander in chief,"" Mr. Obama says. ""The best part is he's nowhere close to finished.""Mr. Biden enjoys strong support in South Carolina largely because of his association with Mr. Obama, and by highlighting it he is seeking to boost his struggling campaign.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]But Mr. Biden, who was supported on television in Iowa and New Hampshire by the super PAC Unite the Country, is on his own so far in Nevada and South Carolina; the group has made no additional ad buys, according to Advertising Analytics.Mr. Steyer had to reach a bit further for a connection to Mr. Obama. His ad features Edith Childs, a local politician who in 2008 shouted at Mr. Obama, ""Fired up, ready to go!"" The line became a tagline for him. Ms. Childs, who has now endorsed Mr. Steyer, says in the ad, ""My God, Tom's fired up, and Trump's got to go.""Mr. Steyer has mounted an exorbitantly expensive effort in South Carolina, spending nearly $17 million on television and radio ads in the state since July. For 15 weeks this summer and fall, he was the only candidate on air in the state, running ads largely targeted at black voters, including endorsements from local members of the state's legislative black caucus.By the numbersBIDEN $751,580 total, $404,909 over the last two weeksBUTTIGIEG $1,783,650 total, $428,128 over the last two weeksKLOBUCHAR $56,490 total, all over the last two weeksSANDERS $253,196 total, $162,886 over the last two weeksSTEYER $17,775,264 total, $1,870,852 over the last two weeksWARREN $651,351 total, $276,285 over the last two weeksMr. Buttigieg, who performed strongly in the first two voting states, has been struggling to connect with black voters in South Carolina.On Tuesday, his campaign booked $350,000 worth of ads over one week and put a new ad on air featuring two black staff members -- Walter A. Clyburn Reed and Abe Jenkins. In the ad, they explain why they decided to work for Mr. Buttigieg and reference their prominent grandfathers, the civil rights activist Esau Jenkins and Representative James E. Clyburn.Attack ads, super PACs and speaking in Spanish in NevadaIn Nevada, the ads are getting a little punchier. Mr. Steyer became the first candidate to target a Democratic rival, airing two negative ads, one taking aim at Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, and another at Mr. Sanders.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]""There's a reason people are nervous about Bernie Sanders scrapping Obamacare,"" the narrator says in the anti-Sanders ad, as the screen shows Mr. Sanders appearing on Fox News. ""Unions don't like it.""Mr. Steyer has flooded the airwaves in Nevada, spending $13.8 million of the $18.8 million spent by candidates and super PACs there so far. He's seen his stock rise in both Nevada and South Carolina, climbing in statewide polling likely as a result of having the airwaves mostly to himself.The decision to go negative, which could backfire among Democratic voters who are concerned about divisions before a contentious general election, is a sign of his financial might.""Steyer has nothing to lose,"" said Ms. Gibson, the strategist. ""He has the money to stay in, and has already invested so much. Right now, he doesn't have to go up against Bloomberg on the ballot, which I think he is really taking advantage of.""(Michael R.

The group's founder said last month that Mr. Sanders was in a ""uniquely bad position"" to win a general election.And a super PAC supporting Mr. Buttigieg, VoteVets, just began a $590,000 ad campaign in Nevada.Earlier this month, a top adviser to Mr. Buttigieg tweeted that his military experience would resonate in the state. Per federal election law, campaigns are barred from directly coordinating with super PACs. But by making the statement publicly, the campaign is exonerated.VoteVets clearly got the message, turning out an ad eight days later that featured a Vietnam veteran extolling Mr. Buttigieg's background and message.The current polling leader in Nevada, Mr. Sanders, is doing little message tailoring in the state. His Spanish-language ad is largely biographical, telling the immigration story of his father.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]Mr. Sanders's other ads in Nevada closely mirror his stump speech, though they are delivered by Mr. Sanders, clad in a blue sweater, in a living room. ""I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message because we need an economy that works for all of us,"" he says at the end of one of them, ""not just wealthy campaign contributors.""Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, whose campaign recently announced a ""seven-figure"" ad buy in Nevada and South Carolina, is recycling two ads from New Hampshire, including a rapid flip through her plan for her first 100 days as president.Ms. Klobuchar's campaign prefers basing ads on excerpts from her speeches, and after her surprise third-place showing in New Hampshire, she kicked off her primary-night speech with an ad-ready introduction.""Hello America, I'm Amy Klobuchar, and I will beat Donald Trump,"" she said.The candidate later told reporters that she started with that line because she thought it was the first time many in the country would see and hear her. It's likely voters in South Carolina and Nevada will soon hear that line, too.PhotographBarack Obama cameos from, clockwise from top left, Joseph R. Biden Jr., Elizabeth Warren, Michael R.

| Jump to first hitThe former vice president has made inaccurate claims this month about his record on Social Security, race and foreign policy.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. remains atop most national polls before the first votes are cast next month in the Democratic presidential primary. Before the Iowa caucuses, The New York Times reviewed recent statements he made defending his decades-long career, stressing his standing in the black community and highlighting his perceived strength on foreign policy. Here's a fact check.Mr. Biden tried to defend his record on Social Security and birth control with questionable claims.Antonia Hylton, a reporter for Vice News: ""Do you think, though, that it's fair for voters to question your commitment to Social Security when in the past you've proposed a freeze to it?""Mr. Biden: ""No, I didn't propose a freeze."" 
 -- at the Brown & Black Democratic Presidential Forum last week in IowaFalse. In 1984, faced with budget deficits under the Reagan administration, Mr. Biden was a co-sponsor of an amendment with two Republican senators that froze for one year nearly all military and domestic spending, including cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security benefits.Pressed by Ms. Hylton after his inaccurate denial, Mr. Biden said that his proposal came ""in the context of we saved Social Security during the Reagan administration"" and noted that Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, a liberal stalwart, voted for the plan.When President Ronald Reagan entered office in 1981, Social Security was running low on funding and Mr. Reagan did propose to make deep cuts to benefits. But he ultimately endorsed and signed bipartisan legislation in 1983 -- which Mr. Biden and Mr. Kennedy both voted for -- to assure the fund's continuing solvency. Changes included postponing cost-of-living adjustments, and the Biden campaign said that the former vice president was referring to this episode.""It is easy to believe Biden thought minor cuts in the program in the short run would represent a better outcome than the much bigger cuts President Reagan and his advisers seemed to favor,"" Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said. ""In those days, 'compromise' was not a dirty word in the eyes of most members of Congress.""Mr. Biden's own freeze plan, though, came ""well after the Social Security rescue was over,"" said Paul C. Light, a professor at New York University who wrote a book on the 1983 effort.Rather, the plan was another step in a decades-long ""mating dance between centrist Democrats and Republicans to come up with a grand bargain on the deficit,"" said Eric Laursen, author of ""The People's Pension: The Struggle to Defend Social Security Since Reagan.""Mr. Biden said as much in April 1984, as he decried ""gargantuan deficits"" and argued that not accepting a one-year freeze to cost-of-living adjustments would lead to a ""a fundamental debate over whether or not there should be COLAs in Social Security"" at all. The amendment that he co-sponsored ultimately failed by a vote of 65 to 33 (Mr. Kennedy voted against it).Mr. Biden's overall record on Social Security includes both actions that would slow or reduce spending and those that would protect benefits.He voted for an amendment in 1995 to require a balanced federal budget that he and other Democrats warned would endanger the Social Security fund. He was open to raising the eligibility age for Social Security in 2007. And he brokered a deal with Republican lawmakers in 2010 that extended the Bush-era tax cuts and created a holiday for the payroll tax, which funds Social Security, that temporarily reduced the tax by two percentage points.But Mr. Biden also voted for an amendment to that balanced budget legislation in 1995 that would have excluded Social Security from its aims. From 2001 to 2008, he repeatedly voted against privatizing Social Security and for improving the trust fund's solvency, according to the Alliance for Retired Americans, an affiliate of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. that represents union retirees. In 2008, Mr. Biden's last year in the Senate, he received a lifetime score of 96 out of 100 from the group. He spoke out against Social Security privatization in the 2012 vice-presidential debate and his current plan vows to protect the safety net.Lauren Kelley, New York Times Editorial Board member: ""You also originally argued for greater exemptions to the contraception mandate in Obamacare. So I think there's some concern out there --""Mr. Biden: ""No, I didn't, by the way.""
-- in an interview with The New York Times Editorial Board published Jan. 17This is disputed. The Obama administration announced in January 2012 a rule requiring most insurance plans to cover birth control free of charge, including for the employees of hospitals, schools and charities run by Catholic groups.The making of the rule sparked an internal debate in the White House. Reporting from news outlets cast Mr. Biden as part of the camp arguing for a less stringent rule.According to ABC News and Bloomberg, the vice president and William Daley, then the chief of staff to President Barack Obama, warned of the political fallout with Catholic voters who backed Mr. Obama in the 2008 election and argued that the issue would be framed as an attack on religious liberty. The Times reported that officials had initially sought a year to work out a compromise, but ""a group of advisers had bested Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and others and sold the president on a stricter rule.""The announcement fueled a fierce backlash from Catholic organizations and Republicans. As the Obama administration contemplated the fallout, Mr. Biden did not publicly oppose or defend the rule, but hinted during a radio interview that it would be softened.""There's going to be a significant attempt to work this out, and there's time to do that,"" he said on Feb. 9, 2012. ""And as a practicing Catholic, you know, I am of the view that this can be worked out and should be worked out and I think the president, I know the president, feels the same way.""Mr. Biden also said in the interview that the administration wanted to ""make sure women who need access to birth control are not denied that,"" according to The Wall Street Journal.A day later, the administration revised the rule to shift the responsibility of providing contraception to insurers, rather than the religiously affiliated institutions themselves.Mr. Biden overstated his support among young black voters and his role in the civil rights movement.Ms. Hylton: ""Why is Senator Sanders leading you with voters under age 35?""Mr. Biden: ""He is not leading me with black voters under the age -- look, just all I know is, I am leading everybody, combined, with black voters.""
-- at the Brown & Black forumThis is exaggerated. Mr. Biden is correct that in most polls, he leads Democratic candidates among black voters overall, but he is wrong to deny Senator Bernie Sanders' edge with younger African Americans.A January poll conducted by The Washington Post and Ipsos, a nonpartisan research firm, found that Mr. Biden held a wide lead among black Democrats with 48 percent support, but Mr. Sanders led with those between age 18 and 34 at 42 percent while Mr. Biden placed second at 30 percent.An Ipsos survey conducted with Vice this month asked black Americans who they would consider voting for and found that 56 percent would consider voting for Mr. Sanders and 54 percent for Mr. Biden, a statistical tie. Among those between ages 18 and 34, Mr. Sanders' support increased to 81 percent compared with 65 percent for Mr. Biden, according to a breakdown provided by Chris Jackson, the vice president of Ipsos Public Affairs.In a poll by the political action committee BlackPac and released in December, Mr. Biden led all black voters with 38 percent, but trailed Mr. Sanders in support among black voters between ages 18 and 24 at 14 percent compared to 30 percent for Mr. Sanders. Support for the two candidates was nearly identical among black voters between the ages of 25 and 39, with 24 percent supporting Mr. Biden and 25 percent supporting Mr. Sanders.The Sanders campaign also pointed to an array of surveys demonstrating the same generational gap: a fall poll from Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics where Mr. Sanders was the first choice of black voters between ages 18 and 29, a January poll from Chegg Media Center where Mr. Sanders led with black college students with 43 percent and a September survey from Essence Magazine where Mr. Sanders had the most support of black women between ages 18 and 34 with 19 percent.""I was involved in the civil rights movement.""
-- at the Brown & Black forumThis is exaggerated. Over his long political career, Mr. Biden has occasionally suggested he played a greater role in the civil rights movement of the 1960s than he actually did. While there are accounts of Mr. Biden participating in a few desegregation events, he has also said he would not consider himself an activist in the movement.Mr. Biden has said that he protested a segregated movie theater in demonstrations in Wilmington, Del. at the Rialto Theater in the early 1960s. His account is backed by a former president of the state chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and a former president of the Delaware A.F.L.-C.I.O.A 1987 edition of ""Current Biography Yearbook,"" a magazine that profiles American figures, noted that Mr. Biden had participated in ""anti-segregation sit-ins at Wilmington's Town Theatre during his high school years.""During his first bid for president, Mr. Biden wrongly said in 1987 that he had ""marched with tens of thousands of others"" in the civil rights movement. Later, a spokesman for Mr. Biden clarified that he had participated in actions to ""desegregate one restaurant and one movie theater."" Mr. Biden himself conceded that ""I was not an activist.""""I worked at an all-black swimming pool in the east side of Wilmington, Del. I was involved in what they were thinking, what they were feeling. But I was not out marching,"" he said in a news conference that fall. ""I was not down in Selma. I was not anywhere else. I was a suburbanite kid who got a dose of exposure to what was happening to black Americans.""He struck a similar tone in interviews with the journalist Jules Witcover, who wrote the book ""Joe Biden: A Life of Trial and Redemption.""""I didn't do any big deal, but I marched a couple of times to desegregate the movie theaters in downtown Wilmington,"" Mr. Biden said in the book. But he acknowledged that ""I wasn't part of any great movement.""Mr. Biden inaccurately characterized one element of President Trump's North Korea policy.""The president showed up, met with them, gave him legitimacy, weakened these sanctions we have against him.""
-- at the Democratic presidential debate in JanuaryThis is misleading. Mr. Biden is referring to Mr. Trump's efforts to engage diplomatically with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un. There is a widespread consensus that the president's willingness to meet with him provided Mr. Kim with additional credibility at home and abroad without giving the United States and its allies much in return.At the same time, Mr. Trump's meetings with the North Koreans have increased support from China and Russia for easing United Nations sanctions on North Korea, as the Biden campaign pointed out. Soo Kim, a policy analyst at the RAND Corporation, a research group, pointed out that South Korea has also recently been testing the waters for securing sanctions relief for its northern neighbor.But the Trump administration itself has not lifted the United States' own sanctions and has opposed the calls from China and Russia to ease the international sanctions.""As far as I know, sanctions have not been eased,"" said Jim Walsh of the Security Studies Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""Certainly the international U.N. sanctions continue unabated, and I am unaware of any significant sanctions relief granted by the administration.""A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department said Mr. Biden's statement was inaccurate and that the agency ""has sanctioned 261 individuals and entities under its North Korea authorities, accounting for more than half of North Korea-related sanctions ever imposed.""Nearly every month from March 2017 to March 2018, the department announced sanctions on North Korean nationals and companies, as well people and entities around the world linked to North Korea. After Mr. Trump's summit with Mr. Kim in Singapore in June 2018, Treasury imposed more sanctions in August, September, October, November and December of that year.In March 2019, shortly after Mr. Trump met again with Mr. Kim in Hanoi, Vietnam, the president issued a confusing statement on Twitter announcing that he had rolled back newly imposed sanctions on North Korea, though restrictions announced a day earlier on two Chinese companies linked to North Korea were not actually revoked. The White House press secretary at the time, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, explained that Mr. Trump ""doesn't feel it's necessary to add additional sanctions at this time.""A month later, Mr. Trump said the sanctions on North Korea are ""at a fair level"" and should remain in place. More were announced in June, August and September. The United States opposed lifting United Nations sanctions on North Korea in December and sanctioned two more entities January.Mr. Biden's theory that Mr. Trump's personal appeals to Mr. Kim has weakened the resolve of other countries to enforce sanctions is a matter of interpretation.This line of argument ""was trotted out every time Obama engaged in diplomacy,"" Mr. Walsh said. ""We don't know if diplomacy with North Korea has had the effect of reducing the impact of sanctions. Maybe. But as with all things North Korea, it's hard to say.""Curious about the accuracy of a claim? Email factcheck@nytimes.com.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitThe primary race is entering a critical nine-day stretch that could effectively determine the nomination as candidates face a debate, the South Carolina primary and Super Tuesday contests.HOUSTON -- Energized by his landslide victory in the Nevada caucuses, Senator Bernie Sanders turned his focus to President Trump on Sunday while his campaign made plans to try to win the coming South Carolina primary and amass an insurmountable delegate lead on Super Tuesday next week.Mr. Sanders plans to be up on the air with commercials in every South Carolina media market this week, and his staff is scrambling to add new rallies to his schedule as they take aim at their next big target: overtaking the front-runner in Saturday's primary there, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., to all but extinguish his candidacy.But attacks on Mr. Sanders began mounting on Sunday, with Mr. Biden criticizing him as disloyal to former President Barack Obama -- a charged message with the predominantly black electorate in South Carolina -- and others describing the Vermont senator as a long shot against Mr. Trump. Mr. Sanders, in turn, used a rally in the Super Tuesday state of Texas to highlight some favorable polling numbers against the president -- and attempt to reassure Democrats about his electability if he wins the nomination.With seven other candidates competing against the liberal Mr. Sanders, raising the possibility of a fractured moderate vote in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday, pressure is also starting to grow on some Democrats to drop out -- particularly Senator Amy Klobuchar, the billionaire Tom Steyer and even former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who narrowly won the Iowa caucuses. None has shown an ability to build a diverse coalition of voters, which would be crucial to beating Mr. Sanders, yet none showed signs of quitting anytime soon.The Democratic race is now entering a critical nine-day stretch that could effectively determine the nomination, with the future of multiple candidates riding in part on the next televised debate on Tuesday night, the South Carolina vote and the Super Tuesday contests.There were new twists in the race on Sunday, such as Mr. Steyer qualifying to join in the debate and an announcement by Representative James E. Clyburn, the most influential Democrat in South Carolina, that he will endorse a candidate on Wednesday. Adding to the unpredictability is former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who will try to start recovering from his disastrous debate performance last week by appearing for the first time in a CNN town hall, on Wednesday, as well Tuesday's debate.Aides to Mr. Sanders are racing to consolidate his political advantages to help him withstand any winnowing of the field, given that perhaps the biggest threat he now faces are anti-Sanders voters coalescing around one alternative candidate.He enters this next phase of the race with a pair of enviable assets. After finishing near the top in Iowa, winning New Hampshire and then overwhelming his rivals in Nevada, the first state with a racially diverse electorate, he has the aura of success -- and winning usually begets winning in presidential primaries.At the same time, the anti-Sanders camp remains split: Mr. Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar are all insisting on staying in the race while Mr. Bloomberg is spending heavily on advertising in Super Tuesday states like Texas and California, where Mr. Sanders could build up a delegate lead if the remaining vote is divided.In the aftermath of Mr. Sanders's triumph in Nevada, the question that increasingly looms over the race is whether Super Tuesday, when 16 contests are held on March 3, will be the day he puts himself on a glide path to the nomination.On Sunday, his aides began taking steps toward trying to do just that.After months of downplaying Mr. Sanders's prospects in South Carolina, where he lost badly in the 2016 primary because of his weakness with black voters then, his campaign was blunt about its objective in Saturday's vote.""We're fighting to win in South Carolina,"" said Jeff Weaver, a top Sanders strategist, noting that polls show them ""moving up considerably on the vice president.""Should Mr. Sanders defeat or even finish near Mr. Biden in South Carolina, a state the former vice president has long seen as his firewall, it could vault him into Super Tuesday three days later with such force that it may be difficult for any of his opponents to catch up with him.That's when Mr. Sanders is hoping to pile up delegates while also inflicting symbolic blows on his opponents by winning in some of their home states, including Ms. Warren's Massachusetts and Ms. Klobuchar's Minnesota, both of which Mr. Sanders plans to visit before March 3, according to aides.Yet it is Mr. Sanders's decision to compete aggressively in South Carolina, where he has long lowered expectations by vowing only to ""do well"" there, that illustrates how rapidly this race is moving to him. More than half of the state's Democratic electorate is expected to be African-American, one of Mr. Biden's strongest blocs of support, and the former vice president has led in the polls there since the outset of the race.Yet as Mr. Sanders made clear on Sunday, the primary has taken a turn.Addressing over 6,000 supporters at the University of Houston for an afternoon rally, he largely ignored his Democratic rivals and boasted about his lead over Mr. Trump in some head-to-head polls.""Some of the folks in the corporate media are getting a little bit nervous and they say, 'Bernie can't beat Trump,' so let's look at some of the polls out today,"" said a notably upbeat Mr. Sanders, before rattling off numbers that showed him beating Mr. Trump nationally and in battleground states.Even as Mr. Sanders braced for an onslaught of attacks many in his orbit thought would have come by now -- ""there are a lot of knives out for Bernie Sanders,"" Mr. Weaver said -- the senator appeared to be relishing his back-to-back victories. He and his wife and close political confidante, Jane, had a glass of wine on his charter flight Saturday evening after the Nevada results came in, according to a Sanders aide. By Sunday morning, though, Mr. Sanders's Democratic opponents were ready to try to spoil the moment.Speaking to reporters after attending an African-American church service in North Charleston, S.C., Mr. Biden acknowledged that Mr. Sanders ""does have momentum"" before seeking to deflate his candidacy.The former vice president suggested that Mr. Sanders, an avowed democratic socialist, could hurt Democrats' chances of maintaining control of the House in 2020 and winning back the Senate. And he sought to undermine his opponent's chances to win black voters by boasting that he's had Mr. Obama's ""back the whole time"" while saying Mr. Sanders weighed a primary bid against him in the 2012 election. (The Sanders campaign has denied that he considered challenging Mr. Obama.)In an interview on MSNBC on Sunday night, Mr. Biden pressed the point further, portraying Mr. Sanders as a foe of the Obama administration who could have cost Mr. Obama a second term.""We've just had significant disagreements with Bernie, but the way he talks about it, you'd think he and Barack were close buddies,"" Mr. Biden said. He added, ""I know they were not.""While his supporters sought to put the best face on his apparent, and distant, second-place finish in Nevada, Mr. Biden seemed likely to receive some long-awaited good news in South Carolina: the endorsement of Mr. Clyburn, the longtime lawmaker and highest-ranking African-American in Congress.In an interview, Mr. Clyburn said he would disclose his support on Wednesday, the day after the next debate. He cited his ""longtime friendship with Joe,"" but otherwise declined to reveal his preference. However, a Democratic official close to the Biden campaign, speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to reveal internal planning, said they expected to receive Mr. Clyburn's support.Mr. Clyburn, appearing on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, praised Mr. Sanders on their shared policy priorities like community health centers, but also raised doubts about his chances in South Carolina. ""Anybody who refers to themselves as a democratic socialist, that word has always had really dire consequences throughout South Carolina,"" Mr. Clyburn said.For Mr. Biden, a bigger matter than endorsements is the need for some of his rivals to exit the race. Yet each of them believes they have as much of a claim on staying in the primary as Mr. Biden, who finished well behind in the first two states, according to their top advisers.Speaking to reporters Sunday, Ms. Klobuchar dismissed a question about whether she'd quit the race.""Why would I get out, that's not even a close call for me,"" she said. ""And I think, why would you have a call for the two women to get out when you have two billionaires in the race""Appearing at campaign events in North Dakota, Virginia and Colorado on Sunday, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren, like Mr. Biden, warned Democrats about the risk of nominating Mr. Sanders.However, a number of moderate Democrats, some affiliated with Mr. Biden and others uncommitted, said it was Mr. Buttigieg, Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Steyer who were only helping Mr. Sanders by staying in the race as spoilers.
Some of the officials, like Susan Swecker, the chairwoman of the Virginia Democratic Party, were subtle with their pleadings.""It would certainly make voter decisions easier because people are still shopping,"" said Ms. Swecker, who has not taken sides and whose state votes a week from Tuesday. ""If there is less on aisle that makes the choice easier.""But other Democrats uneasy about the prospect of Mr. Sanders being their standard-bearer were more direct.""Some folks need to look hard at whether they are viable and contributing to a positive path forward for our party,"" said Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware, a Biden supporter. He carefully avoided mentioning names, but said those who remained in the race were undermining the party's chance for a ""shorter and less-divisive primary.""Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina legislator who has not endorsed, was happy to name names.""Pete and Amy have no path because they have no coalition built -- they don't do well with Hispanic or Black voters,"" Mr. Sellers said of Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar.And Mr. Sellers said Mr. Steyer's candidacy was a ""vanity project"" that would only siphon away votes from Mr. Biden and thrust Mr. Sanders into contention in South Carolina.Yet even if Mr. Steyer underperforms in South Carolina, as he did in Nevada despite vastly outspending the field, and Mr. Biden emerges with a clear victory, moderate Democrats are still facing a larger dilemma. Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Biden are on a collision course to divide votes, particularly among African-Americans, on Super Tuesday.Sydney Ember reported from Houston and Austin, and Jonathan Martin from Las Vegas.

| Jump to first hitDemocratic strategists worry that President Trump's consistent airtime is giving him a messaging advantage.Hi. Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Nick Corasaniti, back in the seat as your host on Tuesdays for our coverage of all things media and messaging.Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.The presidential campaign has largely shifted to the recesses of public consciousness during the coronavirus outbreak. So, too, has political broadcast advertising: Since last Tuesday, Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and President Trump haven't aired a single ad on television.It's a difficult time for political campaigns to run paid messaging. Calls for unity to stop the pandemic are widespread, and candidates could be accused of politicizing a crisis if they put out attack ads.But campaign rallies have been canceled, fund-raisers have been called off and in-person canvassing has been halted, all while Americans are spending more time indoors. With Mr. Trump on television constantly, Democratic strategists are worried that his unabated free airtime, even amid a crippling national crisis, gives him a messaging advantage.In that vacuum, two Democratic groups have started multimillion-dollar advertising campaigns attacking Mr. Trump for his previous comments that played down the threat of the virus.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]Priorities USA, one of the major Democratic super PACs, on Monday began a $6 million television and digital advertising campaign in four general election swing states -- Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- with multiple ads either criticizing Mr. Trump or trumpeting the record of Mr. Biden.In one particularly stark ad, a line tracing the exponential growth of coronavirus cases in the United States creeps across the screen, as Mr. Trump can be heard saying, ""We have it totally under control"" and ""One day, it's like a miracle, it will disappear."" (Those quotations came from January and February; Mr. Trump has since tried to rewrite history by claiming he knew the virus would be a pandemic all along.)The ad supporting Mr. Biden, which features the candidate proclaiming he would be ""better prepared,"" is the first such spot from Priorities USA, which had stayed neutral for most of the Democratic primary race but has since declared that it views Mr. Biden as the presumptive nominee.Pacronym, a progressive super PAC, is in the middle of a $2.5 million digital ad campaign attacking Mr. Trump for his response to the coronavirus. That campaign began in mid-March and will run through the end of April, and the group said it planned to spend at least $5 million in total on digital ads by July.The ads -- which are running in Arizona as well as the same four states Priorities is targeting -- are appearing on Facebook, YouTube, Hulu and other digital platforms, and feature a wide array of criticism.The most recent one highlights criticism from Tucker Carlson, the Fox News host and frequent Trump booster, who has blamed ""government incompetence"" for a lack of preparedness for the pandemic in the United States.""When voters consider who they want to be their next commander in chief, they'll remember how the president's chaotic administration, negligence and reckless behavior put our lives and economy at risk,"" said Tara McGowan, Pacronym's founder. ""Pacronym will continue to make this case to voters online and reach them with facts about how this president is putting us all in harm's way.""Another Democratic super PAC, American Bridge, has started including coronavirus ads as part of an $850,000 digital ad campaign attacking Mr. Trump in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. On Facebook, where the group has spent nearly $86,000 in the past week, it is running multiple ads claiming Mr. Trump has ""put American lives at risk"" and calling out his past comments on the virus.While it hasn't put the same kind of money behind ads as Pacronym or Priorities USA, the Biden campaign has started to buy digital ads denouncing Mr. Trump and his approach to the outbreak.In a Facebook ad shown to Wisconsin voters on Sunday, the Biden campaign ran a 90-second side-by-side comparison of Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden answering similar questions about the virus -- choosing clips that showed Mr. Trump lashing out at reporters and Mr. Biden calmly delivering advice from the debate stage.Mr. Trump, in his televised briefings and on Twitter, has repeatedly claimed that his administration has taken the virus seriously for months, pointing to his decision in late January to restrict travel from China, despite his many remarks minimizing the threat.The Trump campaign, for its part, has been running a digital ad campaign from an almost parallel universe unaffected by the coronavirus, pitching a ""gold card"" for donors and selling campaign merchandise like ""the EXCLUSIVE Trump Pence Keep America Great Dog Collar.""Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We'll try to answer it. Have a comment? We're all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com .... SeriouslySometimes, the best messaging is a blunt object rather than a sharp tool. Mayors across Italy, frustrated with those who won't stay home during the crisis, have been growing more direct in their instructions to constituents, as you can see in this video.

| Jump to first hitThe candidates gave their stump speeches. They took photos and shook hands. They tried mightily to address the polling elephant in the room without appearing to concern themselves with it.DES MOINES -- With the Iowa caucuses a week away and senators briefly sprung from their impeachment-induced confinement on Capitol Hill, the Democratic presidential candidates and their surrogates spilled out across Iowa on Sunday.They gave their stump speeches. They took photos and shook hands. They tried mightily to address the elephant in the room -- a series of polls showing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont pulling even with or ahead of the longtime front-runner, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. -- without appearing to concern themselves with it.Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., carried on the long tradition of campaign-trail subtweeting, attacking Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden unmistakably but without naming them.""The country will be crying out for a president capable of unifying and healing the American people,"" Mr. Buttigieg said at a rally in West Des Moines, a clear shot at Mr. Sanders.Later, at a town hall televised on Fox News, he said that he had ""heard some folks saying"" that now was not the time for voters to take a risk -- Team Biden is running an ad arguing exactly that -- but that the real risk ""would be to try to go up against this president with the same old playbook that we've been relying on.""Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who has gained ground in recent weeks but is still polling a distant fifth here, tried to focus on crowd sizes instead -- and on somewhat better poll results she received in New Hampshire, which will vote the week after Iowa.""We are seeing this overwhelming number of people showing up on a Sunday afternoon,"" Ms. Klobuchar told reporters in Ames. ""We're seeing the poll that we just saw this morning in New Hampshire, in double digits, just a few points away from many of my maybe more well-known competitors on the national stage.""And besides, how much attention should voters pay to polls to begin with? ""Let's see what happens when people are actually showing up,"" she said.As always, the undertone -- and sometimes the overtone -- was each candidate's so-called electability against President Trump. From Davenport in the east to Sioux City in the west, the candidates circled one another, jostling to cast themselves as the most viable contender for November.""Can we just address it right here? Women win,"" Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said at an event in Davenport, invoking the same argument she made at this month's debate when she noted that she and Ms. Klobuchar were the only people onstage who had never lost an election. ""Women candidates have been outperforming men candidates since Donald Trump was elected.""Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden, meanwhile, continued to spar with each other, each seeing the other -- justifiably, based on recent polls -- as his biggest threat.After a weeklong public fight over their records on Social Security, they turned to climate. At an event in Perry on Sunday, Mr. Sanders shot back at Mr. Biden for his remark a couple days earlier that ""not a single solitary scientist"" considered Mr. Sanders's climate plan workable.""Well, Joe, you're wrong,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""Many leading scientists agree with our plan, and in a few days we're going to have a long list of scientists who agree with our plan.""In Des Moines, Mr. Biden drew voters' attention to what is arguably his biggest strength nationally: his strong support from black voters. It is a key part of the same electability argument that echoed across the state all weekend: Black voters are an essential constituency in the Democratic Party.""I know a lot of folks out here were wondering, 'Why does Biden get such overwhelming support from the African-American community?""' Mr. Biden said. ""Because that's what I'm part of. That's where my political identity comes from. And it's the single most loyal constituency I've ever had.""As for the Iowans he and everyone else were courting, some of them ended the weekend as torn as they had begun it.""It's hard to tell. They are all so similar,"" said Ann Clary, a state budget analyst who attended one of Mr. Buttigieg's events on Sunday but is also considering caucusing for Mr. Biden and Ms. Klobuchar. ""Sometimes I can't fall asleep at night. I just can't stop thinking about it.""As night fell, Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg went on with business as usual, looking forward to another full week of events. And then there were the senators.Round and round the state they went: Ms. Warren from Davenport to Cedar Rapids, Ms. Klobuchar from Waterloo to Ames to Des Moines, Mr. Sanders from Perry to Storm Lake to Sioux City.They had to hurry, because soon the day, and their window, would be over.""I could have literally done these in every town and revisited all 99 counties again,"" Ms. Klobuchar told reporters wistfully after an event in Ames. ""That was one of my secret plans, but it's now been dashed, since I turn into a pumpkin at midnight.""Reporting was contributed by Nick Corasaniti from Ames, Iowa; Sydney Ember from Ames and Perry; Reid J. Epstein from West Des Moines and Storm Lake; Shane Goldmacher from Davenport; Thomas Kaplan from Des Moines; and Lisa Lerer from Perry.PhotographSupporters of Senator Amy Klobuchar at campaign event in Waterloo, Iowa, on Sunday.

| Jump to first hitHis placement behind his leading rivals in the caucuses on Monday dealt a damaging blow to his campaign. Some party officials say it was a long time in the works.DES MOINES -- Maybe it was the threat of bad weather. Maybe it was a seating assignment debacle. Maybe it was a struggling campaign organization that still hadn't found its footing.But as Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke at a major Iowa Democratic Party dinner in November, one thing was clear: His support appeared tepid compared with the vocal cheering sections of top rivals. The reception angered Mr. Biden and his top aides -- and it left little doubt about his standing, three months before the nominating process in the Democratic presidential race would begin: The former vice president was in deep trouble in Iowa.Two days after the dinner, Mr. Biden ripped into his campaign chairman, Steve Ricchetti, according to a person familiar with the conversation. And at the Biden headquarters in Philadelphia, senior officials sternly told staff members they needed to step up their performance.The dinner's damaging optics marked the beginning of a flurry of changes: Trusted aides were deployed to Iowa sooner than anticipated. Mr. Biden rescheduled time with donors to make space for a bus tour in Iowa. Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa and his wife, Christie Vilsack, major players in Iowa Democratic politics, announced their Biden endorsements.It was too late.Mr. Biden's performance in the Iowa caucuses on Monday dealt a damaging blow to the former vice president; with well over 90 percent of the results counted by Wednesday night, he trailed Pete Buttigieg and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, with Senator Amy Klobuchar not far behind.""I am not going to sugarcoat it,"" Mr. Biden said Wednesday as he campaigned in New Hampshire. ""We took a gut punch in Iowa.""Certainly over the past year, Mr. Biden has proved far more resilient than many expected. He has led national polls for months despite verbal gaffes, scrutiny of his long and sometimes controversial record in Washington, and a relentless assault from Republicans over his son's dealings in Ukraine. The slow drip of vote totals in Iowa -- and a swirl of other major news events -- may blunt the attention on Mr. Biden's challenges. And Iowa is an overwhelmingly white state, while Mr. Biden's biggest political strength is with black voters, whom he is counting on for support in later-voting, more diverse states.But he now faces jittery donors, an uncertain landscape in upcoming Democratic contests and a sharp challenge to the central argument of his campaign message: that he is the party's strongest candidate to win a general election.Interviews with more than a dozen advisers, allies and Iowa strategists show that Mr. Biden was late in focusing on Iowa, put together an organization there that fell well short of his top rivals' and that his core pitch about electability and experience wasn't enough to persuade voters who wanted a fresh face or more boldly progressive ideas.Mr. Biden was also a less-than-inspiring presence on the trail, according to some voters, struggling at times in the homestretch to deliver crisp, energetic, on-message performances.A late start proves costlyWhen Mr. Biden announced his candidacy on April 25, some of his chief rivals had already been running for months.His late start had long-lasting consequences, according to some of his supporters.""He could have been here sooner and more aggressively,"" said Mr. Vilsack, who became Mr. Biden's top surrogate in the state. ""Because this is all about relationships.""""It was frustrating that they weren't seeming to reach more people,"" added Susan Judkins, a member of the Clive City Council. ""Some of the other campaigns had been getting momentum. They had hired staffers who are known to Iowans, who had an ability to influence.""When he did get to the state over the summer and into the fall, Mr. Biden's team produced carefully managed events. He traveled with a phalanx of staff, sometimes used teleprompters and typically spoke from behind rope lines. None of that prevented a spree of verbal stumbles in Iowa in August -- but according to some of his allies, it did keep Mr. Biden from showing off his biggest strength: his retail politicking skills.""I've had that conversation at least since the end of May, beginning part of the summer, that Joe would do better and has always done better meeting with people,"" said State Representative Bruce Hunter, a staunch Biden ally who said he made that case to Mr. Biden's state campaign leadership. ""He needed to get out more, talk to smaller groups of people, listen to them, give his vision one-on-one to people.""Yet no amount of glad-handing could remedy an organization that even his supporters here found frustrating.""His campaign is not a good campaign,"" Roxanna Moritz, the Scott County auditor and a Biden supporter, said late last month. ""They're not embedding loyalty to the organization, he doesn't do groundwork.""She said that the campaign was ""not returning phone calls, no follow through.""""It's kind of sad because I really do think he is the right person,"" she added.By the fall, Mr. Biden's advisers felt that their campaign organization in Iowa had steadied -- but events in Washington took him down a detour that no one could have foreseen, or prevented.On Sept. 21, more than 1,000 Biden supporters assembled at the Polk County Steak Fry, featuring the kind of chummy interaction in which Mr. Biden is at his best.But their efforts were overshadowed by news that President Trump had asked Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden's son, Hunter Biden, a story that would consume the campaign for months. That night, a Des Moines Register poll revealed that Mr. Biden had slipped from first place in Iowa, overtaken by Ms. Warren of Massachusetts.Mr. Biden spent the next weeks grappling with the best way to respond to the Ukraine controversy. And party officials continued to describe his Iowa organization as scattershot, an issue thrown into sharp relief at the party dinner in November, the Liberty and Justice Celebration.Mr. Biden's team said that it had around 1,200 people in the arena, many of whom went on to become precinct captains and dedicated volunteers. But the empty seats and the smaller and less boisterous Biden sections spread throughout the arena cut a sharp contrast with the loud, unified crowds of Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., in a major test of organizational strength.More damaging than the evident differences in crowd strength was what many Iowa Democrats were seeing for the first time in person: a once-fiery candidate who was looking his age compared with a number of his younger rivals.A key endorsement, and some adviceMr. Biden's campaign could do little to alter the presentation of a candidate who was given to meandering into verbal cul-de-sacs even in his prime.But they concluded that they needed to better display Mr. Biden's strong interpersonal skills, and to connect with more moderate voters who live in rural areas.Mr. Vilsack, the former governor, had long advocated that approach, joining with his wife to advise their old friend to spend time in small towns during a private conversation last spring.After spending months meeting with candidates, the Vilsacks -- who supported Mr. Biden in his first presidential campaign, in 1987 -- informed Mr. Biden in a phone call that they would endorse him, impressed with his rural policy proposal, his empathy and his ""capacity to take a punch.""Behind the scenes, they offered the campaign leadership two major pieces of advice.""One, you need to be out there in all parts of the state,"" Mr. Vilsack said. ""And two, you need to spend time with voters in a way that they will get to know you.""After Thanksgiving, the Vilsacks joined Mr. Biden on a bus trip, called the ""No Malarkey"" tour, across rural parts of the state where the Biden campaign saw chances to accrue delegates.The trip revealed strategic openings for the campaign, officials said. They spotted an opportunity with Latino voters in Storm Lake and were reminded to accentuate Mr. Biden's advantage with Catholics in Dubuque.The problem: Those lessons were arriving with just weeks to capitalize on them. Other candidates had already spent many months trying to win over the state's Democratic caucusgoers.""Had he done the 'No Malarkey' tour in the summertime, you may never have seen that Elizabeth Warren bounce,"" said Representative Ami Bera, Democrat of California, who supports Mr. Biden.Jesse Harris, a senior Biden Iowa adviser, said the timing was designed to coincide with when caucusgoers intensified their focus on the race. ""The vice president did spend quite a bit of time in the state,"" he said. ""Obviously, he got into the race a bit later than the other candidates, so two or three months behind when he first visited the state compared to others. But we were actively here in Iowa.""""The bus tour,"" he added, ""was a very visible extension of what we were already doing.""Disappointing some supportersAs 2020 arrived, there were some encouraging developments, building on what the campaign saw as post-bus tour momentum.On Jan. 2, Representative Abby Finkenauer, a Democrat who in 2018 had flipped an eastern Iowa district, endorsed Mr. Biden, signaling that candidates in the toughest races believed Mr. Biden was their safest bet at the top of the ticket. Representative Cindy Axne, a Democrat from another competitive Iowa district, later followed suit.And tensions with Iran propelled national security matters into the spotlight, playing into Mr. Biden's message of experience.Yet even as he continued to land high-profile endorsements, Mr. Sanders of Vermont was on the rise, expanding his progressive support and seeking to cut into Mr. Biden's base of blue-collar workers by attacking his record on Social Security, pointing out that he had occasionally entertained freezes to the program. The specter of a possible conflict with Iran allowed Mr. Sanders to continually remind voters that Mr. Biden had approved the use of force in Iraq.A New York Times/Siena College poll released late last month found that even in eastern Iowa -- home to many white working-class voters with whom Mr. Biden expected to be strong -- he was struggling.Ahead of the 2016 campaign, David Plouffe, Barack Obama's former campaign manager, had warned Mr. Biden, according to an article in The Atlantic, ""Do you really want it to end in a hotel room in Des Moines, coming in third to Bernie Sanders?""In the final weeks before the 2020 Iowa caucuses, Mr. Plouffe's warning was starting to sound prescient.Recognizing the need to win new supporters, Mr. Biden's Iowa director, Jake Braun, floated a deal over dinner in Des Moines with an adviser to Ms. Klobuchar of Minnesota. The two moderate Democrats should form an alliance, Mr. Braun suggested a week before the vote, and urge their supporters to back the other if one of them did not advance to the final round in a precinct.Ms. Klobuchar's camp quickly shot down the prospect when the story leaked, and Mr. Braun, who had already been marginalized by Mr. Biden's national campaign, found himself isolated by his enraged superiors, who had warned him not to freelance, according to a person familiar with internal discussions.Sue Dvorsky, a former Iowa Democratic chair, had backed Senator Kamala Harris of California. After Ms. Harris dropped out, Ms. Dvorsky said she was inclined to support Mr. Biden, whom she and her husband had met when he ran for president in 1987.But Ms. Dvorsky was appalled at the state of Mr. Biden's organization, which was lacking precinct captains even in her own heavily Democratic community. Last week she endorsed Ms. Warren.""This has been a sloppy effort that was always aimed at a general election,"" she said of Mr. Biden's organization, deeming it worse than his first two Iowa campaigns. ""Right now, they're bringing in hundreds of people from out of state -- not to be canvassers but to be precinct captains.""Even some of Mr. Biden's high-profile supporters were perplexed by the campaign's choices, which included dispatching a number of his former Senate colleagues, all of them white men over 70, to stump for him in the Iowa campaign's final days.On the Saturday before the caucuses, Ms. Judkins had an uneasy feeling about the decision her state was about to make. She had spent the day knocking on doors with a host of prominent Biden supporters from across the country. She came away impressed by what her colleagues had told her -- that Mr. Biden had more support and organizational strength in later-voting states. She wished they had come to Iowa sooner.""I said to my husband, 'I feel like all of these people from around the country are coming in to try to save us from ourselves,""' she said when they went out that evening. ""Here we are, going out dancing. Kind of like the Titanic, the ship going down.""Photograph""We took a gut punch in Iowa,"" Joseph R. Biden Jr. said.

| Jump to first hitWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Trump on Friday pushed out Mick Mulvaney, his acting White House chief of staff, and replaced him with Representative Mark Meadows, a stalwart conservative ally, shaking up his team in the middle of one of the biggest crises of his presidency.Mr. Trump announced the change on Twitter after arriving in Florida for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate, choosing to make one of the most significant switches he can make in his White House on a Friday night when most of the country had tuned out news for the weekend. As a consolation prize, the president named Mr. Mulvaney a special envoy for Northern Ireland.Mr. Trump's decision to push out Mr. Mulvaney came as the president confronted a coronavirus outbreak that has unsettled much of the country, threatened the economy and posed a new challenge to his re-election campaign. But the decision was seen as a long-delayed move cleaning up in the aftermath of the Senate impeachment trial as he shuffles his inner circle for the eight-month sprint to Election Day.In taking over the White House, Mr. Meadows, 60, a retiring Republican from North Carolina, becomes Mr. Trump's fourth chief of staff in 38 months, the most that any president has had in such a short time. His arrival almost surely signals more changes to follow, as most of Mr. Mulvaney's deputies and others on his team are expected to leave, too, possibly including Emma Doyle, his top lieutenant, and Joe Grogan, the domestic policy adviser.Hope Hicks, one of Mr. Trump's most trusted advisers, returns on Monday in a new role working for Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser. Mr. Mulvaney, who technically retained his post as budget director while serving as acting chief of staff, will surrender that, too, and the acting director, Russell T. Vought, appears poised to take the job permanently, an appointment he has quietly lobbied for for months.The change has been a long time coming. The president soured on Mr. Mulvaney a while ago but was warned by advisers not to get rid of him until after his Senate trial, which ended with Mr. Trump's acquittal on Feb. 6. Throughout the impeachment battle, Mr. Mulvaney was at near-open war with the White House counsel Pat A. Cipollone, at one point seen as a potential successor as chief of staff.Mr. Mulvaney had increasingly been on the losing side of policy battles and appeared less often at Mr. Trump's side. Some saw a sign of impending dismissal last month at the wedding of Stephen Miller, the president's senior adviser, and Katie Waldman, the spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence. Mr. Trump sat with Mr. Meadows and his wife along with other advisers at one table, while Mr. Mulvaney was left at a lower-tier table, according to a witness. Wedding guests whispered about the optics of the scene, right in front of so many people.Mr. Trump called Mr. Meadows on Thursday to offer him the job, according to a person familiar with the discussion. Mr. Mulvaney, who took an annual trip to Nevada this week, learned of the decision on Friday, another person familiar with the events said. Mr. Mulvaney did not travel with Mr. Trump to Florida; instead, he sent Ms. Doyle.The president wanted to announce the news on Twitter earlier in the day, but ended up waiting until after a day of travel to Tennessee to survey tornado damage and to Georgia to tour the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to another person close to the situation. Some aides assumed he would therefore wait until Sunday and were taken off-guard at the Friday night tweet.The replacement was widely seen in the West Wing as a chance for the president to reinvigorate his staff, over which Mr. Mulvaney was seen as losing control. Some of the president's conservative advisers, including Fox News hosts, had been pressing him to replace Mr. Mulvaney.In Mr. Meadows, Mr. Trump will have an ally he considers a confidant and bellwether of congressional conservatives. ""I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. At a closed-door fund-raiser on Friday evening, he told donors that Mr. Meadows would be ""my James Baker,"" according to a person in the room, referring to the chief of staff to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Mr. Baker is generally considered the gold standard in the post.In a statement of his own, Mr. Meadows praised Mr. Mulvaney for doing ""a great job,"" adding, ""This president and his administration have a long list of incredible victories they've delivered to the country during this first term, with the best yet to come.""A founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, Mr. Meadows has been one of the president's most ardent defenders. For months during the impeachment battle, Mr. Meadows was a ubiquitous face on television arguing forcefully that the president had done nothing wrong, appearances that cemented his relationship with Mr. Trump.First elected in 2012, Mr. Meadows announced in December that he did not plan to seek re-election, hinting at the time that he might work for Mr. Trump in some capacity. ""My work with President Trump and his administration is only beginning,"" he said.Mr. Mulvaney, 52, a former Republican congressman from South Carolina, served as chief of staff for more than 14 months in an ""acting"" capacity without ever formally being given the title. Mr. Mulvaney brushed off the snub by telling people that everyone in Mr. Trump's White House was effectively in the job on an acting basis, but the seeming lack of faith or respect invariably made it harder for him to impose authority.Witnesses placed Mr. Mulvaney at the heart of the events that led to Mr. Trump's impeachment for pressuring Ukraine to incriminate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats. Mr. Mulvaney carried out Mr. Trump's order to suspend $391 million in aid to Ukraine, an action declared illegal by the Government Accountability Office. Some advisers later told the president that Mr. Mulvaney had helped ensnare him in impeachment, even though he was following Mr. Trump's wishes.At a news briefing in October, Mr. Mulvaney contradicted the president's denial that he had imposed a quid pro quo on the assistance to benefit his own political fortunes. Mr. Mulvaney told reporters that the White House had withheld aid to Ukraine in part to force Kyiv to commit to investigating a widely debunked theory that Ukraine intervened in the 2016 presidential election on behalf of the Democrats, a story that American intelligence agencies have called Russian disinformation.""Absolutely. No question about that,"" Mr. Mulvaney said. He added, ""That's why we held up the money. ""Later that afternoon, Mr. Mulvaney issued a written statement trying to take it back, denying any quid pro quo between the aid and the investigation.The conflicting statements bolstered Democratic critics and dismayed Republican defenders, who were relying on his assurances that the aid suspension was not tied to his demands that Ukraine investigate Democrats. Mr. Mulvaney defied a House subpoena to testify, but House managers prosecuting Mr. Trump in the Senate played his comments from the briefing repeatedly as part of their case.Fiona Hill, a former White House aide, told House investigators last fall that Mr. Mulvaney had been involved in arranging a White House visit for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that was tied to whether he would conduct the investigations sought by Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. She testified that Mr. Mulvaney was working with Gordon D. Sondland, who was then the ambassador to the European Union.John R. Bolton, then the president's national security adviser, was alarmed at the machinations and ordered Ms. Hill to report the matter to a White House lawyer. ""I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,"" Mr. Bolton told her to tell the lawyer.Unlike his predecessor John F. Kelly, a retired Marine general who left in late 2018, Mr. Mulvaney made a point of not trying to control the famously mercurial president and instead let Trump be Trump. Mr. Kelly said in October, as the House was pursuing its Ukraine inquiry, that he had previously warned the president that such an approach would mean that ""you will be impeached.""As Mr. Trump's first budget director, Mr. Mulvaney helped enact $1.5 trillion in tax cuts, the president's signature legislative victory, and rolled back environmental and other regulations. But he was frustrated in his attempts to pare back spending and wound up presiding over a period of rocketing budget deficits that are projected to top $1 trillion a year for the next decade.During Mr. Mulvaney's time as acting chief of staff, the economy remained strong, and by the end of his tenure, Mr. Trump's approval rating had risen to 49 percent in Gallup's poll, the highest of his presidency. He made a point of using Camp David to build ties with lawmakers and aides who otherwise previously felt neglected.Mr. Mulvaney recently told an audience in Britain that he regularly conflicted with the president over various decisions but made a point of keeping that private. ""I disagree with the president every single day,"" he said. ""You just don't hear about it -- that's not my job.""Reporting was contributed by Maggie Haberman from New York, and Annie Karni, Katie Rogers, Michael D. Shear and Sheryl Gay Stolberg from Washington.PhotographRepresentative Mark Meadows, left, a stalwart defender of the president, will take over for Mick Mulvaney, above, who will become a special envoy for Northern Ireland.

| Jump to first hitAs President Trump holds daily briefings, Mr. Biden has kept a low profile, worrying Democrats who feel the president needs to be challenged more robustly.With President Trump providing daily televised briefings and governors like Andrew M. Cuomo emerging as national leaders during the coronavirus pandemic, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is still grappling with how to position himself as a prominent voice on a crisis that is pushing traditional politics to the background.Mr. Biden has been confined over the last week to an unusually small role for the likely -- though not yet completely certain -- nominee of a major political party. His public comments have been sparing and, for the most part, restrained. He is now ramping up a public schedule, beginning with an appearance on ABC's ""The View"" on Tuesday, and his aides said he would offer remarks on camera in some fashion each day.But Democratic strategists, some state officials and even some of his own aides have said that Mr. Biden needs to be more visible at a time when Americans are looking for leadership. The challenge for Mr. Biden, they say, is to find ways to draw sharp contrasts in leadership style with Mr. Trump while showing sensitivity to the severity of the crisis, and to break through when the nation is focused on more immediate concerns than November's election.Jim Margolis, a veteran Democratic strategist, said Mr. Biden had ""walked that line really well, but it's hard.""""The task is, are you able to cut through?"" Mr. Margolis said. ""Are you able to cut through when Americans are consumed by a virus that is in the news, and that's all that's being discussed, whether on the Senate floor, the White House briefing room or in emergency rooms?""Some Democrats have been perplexed at why Mr. Biden has not used his newfound free time to blitz television news shows, many of which are enjoying high ratings with so many people confined to their homes. He did not do any of the Sunday morning news programs and has also been absent from daytime cable news, which has been dominated by the daily briefings of Mr. Trump and Mr. Cuomo.On Monday, a day after one of his own donors asked how he could become a bigger part of the national conversation, Mr. Biden gave a speech that was streamed live from his home in Delaware in which he criticized Mr. Trump's response to the virus as too slow and insufficient, and pressed him to act like the ""wartime president"" he says he is.But his address offered a reminder of the continuing challenge he faces in getting attention, even when he does speak out. CNN, Fox News and MSNBC did not air his speech, instead showing a briefing by Mr. Cuomo of New York.""The whole country is focused on one issue and one issue only,"" said Teddy Goff, who served as a top digital strategist for the campaigns of President Barack Obama in 2012 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. ""It's certainly going to be very difficult to break through on other issues. But it's essential for the person who's highly likely to be our Democratic nominee to have a strong voice on this issue.""Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said, ""These are uncharted waters for any campaign but our campaign is ready to carry Joe Biden's message forward through innovative virtual events and digital outreach.""""Vice President Biden's voice represents competence, strength and empathy,"" he added, qualities he said the nation was craving ""as we confront unprecedented challenges.""Mr. Biden has reached out to the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi; the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer; Mr. Cuomo; and Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington, among others, to express his concern and solicit their thoughts about how to confront the pandemic, according to Democrats familiar with the conversations.But advisers to Mr. Biden have acknowledged the need for a more robust public presence than the former vice president has managed since his victories in last Tuesday's primaries, describing the process of finding the right tone and format for Mr. Biden's message as a work in progress. His campaign has assured political donors and other supporters that it is testing different approaches and formulating a strategy for using TV and digital options for projecting his personality and delivering criticism of Mr. Trump.Mr. Biden intends to significantly increase his public activity this week, according to an aide familiar with his plans: In addition to appearing on ""The View,"" he plans to call into radio shows and take questions from reporters, and he is likely to hold a virtual town hall and some kind of question-and-answer session on social media. Additional television appearances are in the works.Mr. Biden's direct rebuke of the president on Monday morning was by far his sharpest set of comments on camera since the virus began to spread in the United States. ""Let me be clear: Donald Trump is not to blame for the coronavirus, but he does bear responsibility for our response,"" he said. ""And I, along with every American, hope he steps up and starts to get this right.""Mr. Biden's reluctance to take a more prominent role as the crisis deepened reflects in part his personal instincts and sense of political boundaries, according to his advisers and close allies. A more than 40-year veteran of the legislative and executive branches, he is deferential to his party's current leaders and does not want to complicate their already difficult tasks at a moment of crisis.That kind of calculation has surfaced before in this campaign. Last year, for example, he was reluctant to push for Mr. Trump's impeachment in part because he did not want to put pressure on Ms. Pelosi and members of her caucus. This left him in the odd position of being the last of the major Democratic candidates to call for impeachment, even though the charges involved Mr. Trump pressing for an investigation into Mr. Biden and his son.Mr. Biden still has the unresolved matter of the Democratic primary, though the party's major institutions have continued to swing behind his candidacy even amid the quasi-national lockdown. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees endorsed Mr. Biden on Monday, and another major union, the American Federation of Teachers, backed him on Sunday.Complicating matters for Mr. Biden is the reality that, for the first time in decades, he is campaigning for office without an existing role in government, of the kind he had as a senator when he ran for vice president during the 2008 economic meltdown. Mr. Biden released a plan to address the coronavirus this month, but unlike many of the senators and governors who competed against him for this year's Democratic nomination, he has no active position from which to shape policy.For much of the 2020 campaign, that detachment from daily governing was an asset to Mr. Biden, freeing him from the confines of a day job managing a state or casting votes on legislation. Now, however, it has left him further from the center of action than former rivals like Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California, or his lone remaining competitor, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Mr. Biden's answer so far has been, in part, to build a kind of government-in-exile, showcasing the policy experts he would draw upon in the White House and seeking to present a contrast with Mr. Trump's approach. A public health advisory committee Mr. Biden named this month was something of a model: His advisers are said to be assembling a far larger network of policy experts than the one he employed throughout the Democratic primary.Those experts may begin to take a larger role as surrogates for the campaign on television and online. The Biden campaign was encouraged by the response it got over the weekend to a four-minute video it posted featuring Ron Klain, a former chief of staff to Mr. Biden who coordinated the Obama administration's response to Ebola. The straightforward, policy-heavy presentation, which unpacked the current pandemic and pinned heavy responsibility on Mr. Trump for his response, got more than four million views on Twitter.But Mr. Biden's absence from public view made him the subject of taunts on Twitter, where hashtags like #WhereIsJoe have been used to skewer him, including by Trump campaign officials. ""Is Ron Klain now the Democrat candidate for president?"" Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, wrote on Twitter on Saturday.And during a virtual fund-raiser on Sunday, Mr. Biden fielded a question about his limited visibility. ""What I'm concerned about is that we see Donald Trump every day with this crisis giving his press report,"" a donor said, according to a pool report. ""And I would just love to see you more. Like, how do we get more of you and less of him on our airwaves?""To help Mr. Biden reach the public even while he is hunkered down, his campaign turned a room in his house into a makeshift television studio. He spoke on Monday from a lectern bearing a Biden sign, just as if he were on the campaign trail.The nation's ""focus, for at least the short term, is not going to be on the presidential race,"" said Mr. Margolis, the veteran Democratic strategist. Still, he continued: ""Four weeks from now, you have to make sure you're engaging in a campaign that is going to be decided this year. He does not have the opportunity to sort of sit back and wait three months to see where the whole thing lands.""Jonathan Martin and Katie Glueck contributed reporting.Thomas Kaplan reported from Washington, and Katie Glueck from New York.PhotographJoseph R.

| Jump to first hitThe West Virginia Democrat, who dashed President Trump's hopes for a bipartisan acquittal, said his vote to convict was not about politics.WASHINGTON -- Senator Joe Manchin III votes with President Trump more than any other Democrat in the Senate. But his vote last week to convict Mr. Trump of impeachable offenses has eclipsed all of that, earning him the rage of a president who coveted a bipartisan acquittal.In the days since Mr. Manchin, a West Virginian who was one of the few swing votes on impeachment, supported Mr. Trump's removal, the president has laced into the senator with a zeal that is startling even by his standards.He called Mr. Manchin a ""puppet Democrat Senator"" who was ""weak & pathetic."" He gave the senator a new nickname: ""Joe Munchkin."" He suggested that Mr. Manchin was too stupid to understand a transcript of his telephone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, the central piece of evidence in the case. And to add insult to injury, he took credit for the senator's signature legislative achievement: a bipartisan bill to secure miners' pensions.On Monday, Mr. Manchin made clear that he had had enough.""The people of America and the people of West Virginia want some adults in the room,"" he said in an interview, but he said that Mr. Trump was not behaving like one. Then, the senator -- who at 6-foot-3 is roughly the same height as Mr. Trump, though considerably thinner -- took his own shot.""Munchkin means that you're small, right?"" he said. ""I'm bigger than him -- of course he has me by weight, now, he has more volume than I have by about 30 or 40 pounds. I'm far from being weak and pathetic, and I'm far from being a munchkin, and I still want him to succeed as president of the United States.""Mr. Trump's litany of insults reflects his dashed hopes of counting a Democratic defector among his supporters on impeachment, a crucial piece of the president's claims that impeachment was a partisan ""hoax"" so extreme that it had no legitimacy. And it underscores his disappointment that Mr. Manchin, who has at times broken with his party to support parts of the president's agenda, refused to back him during this particular fight. Given the politics of West Virginia, a state Mr. Trump won with 68 percent of the vote in 2016, Mr. Manchin was among a very small group of Democrats who were seen as possible votes to acquit.But Mr. Manchin said he did not base his choice on electoral politics.""I knew the politics of my state,"" the senator said. ""If I was going to make a political decision, I'd have voted to acquit.""Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, the only Republican to vote to convict Mr. Trump, said much the same thing, and has been relegated to Mr. Trump's enemies list as a result.""The president is entitled to say whatever he thinks,"" Mr. Romney said on Monday in a brief hallway interview in the Capitol. ""I'm not going to try to direct what he says.""Democrats accused Mr. Trump of abusing his oath of office and obstructing Congress by trying to get Ukraine to help him win re-election and then covering up his actions. Central to the case was the phone call in which he asked Mr. Zelensky to ""do us a favor though"" and investigate his political rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination.Days before the final verdict in the impeachment trial, Mr. Manchin stood up in a closed-door lunch with his Democratic colleagues and delivered an impassioned speech about the dilemma he faced.He was struggling, Mr. Manchin told his colleagues, and quoted from a statement made by Robert C. Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat who spent more than half a century in the Senate until his death in 2010. During President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial, Mr. Byrd warned that the Senate might sink ""further into the mire because of this partisanship.""There was some applause and very little pushback, according to two people with knowledge of the exchange. Mr. Manchin, who has long prided himself on working across party lines, later repeated Mr. Byrd's words on the Senate floor, warning that ""there will be no winners on this vote.""In that sense, he was right; the vote has certainly not been a winner for him.""It has been incredibly hot,"" said Hoppy Kercheval, a conservative West Virginia talk show host, describing the reaction to Mr. Manchin's vote. ""I got more texts about Manchin's vote than anything I've talked about in a year -- most of them angry and some of them unrepeatable.""Mr. Manchin, a former governor, has long had a reputation for bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. According to the website FiveThirtyEight, Mr. Manchin has voted with Mr. Trump 53 percent of the time. His votes, though, are hard to predict.At the outset of the administration, Mr. Trump courted Mr. Manchin and tried to persuade him to become a Republican. But Mr. Manchin stuck with Democrats in voting against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and against Mr. Trump's tax bill. Then he crossed party lines to become the lone Democratic vote in favor of confirming Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.Some Democrats said Mr. Manchin's guilty vote on impeachment surprised them. He had floated the possibility of a censure in the days before the final vote. In the interview, he said he thought it might be a way to get some bipartisan consensus that Mr. Trump's call with Mr. Zelensky was hardly ""perfect,"" as the president had repeatedly said.""I don't think there was a person among those 100 senators who believed the president had a perfect phone call and didn't do anything wrong. I believe they all know something was wrong,"" he said. ""I thought censure would be the way we could get a majority of the vote, and I couldn't even get one Republican to sign on.""Mike Plante, a Democratic strategist in West Virginia, said he took the talk of censure as an indication that Mr. Manchin was thinking of voting to acquit.""People were pleasantly surprised and happy that he took this step,"" Mr. Plante said, referring to Democrats. ""He clearly recognized that this was more than politics as usual. This was history, and he did not miss that moment.""But Nick Casey, the former chairman of the West Virginia Democratic Party and a close Manchin ally, said he was not surprised. ""Joe has never been shy about going into the belly of the beast if he does something that he is very comfortable with. And if people disagree with him, that's their right. He got elected to make decisions, and he made one.""His vote caused a bit of a dust-up between Mr. Manchin and the state's other senator, Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican. In an interview on Fox News last week, she said the vote was ""not being received well here at home"" and said that Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, had probably ""just pulled the noose a little tight and said, 'Come on, everybody, we're going to jump off this cliff together.""'The suggestion rankled Mr. Manchin, who made his own appearance on Fox News the next day to push back. ""Shelley knows me well enough that no one can pull my chain, tie a noose around me or any of that.""In the Capitol on Monday, Ms. Capito -- and many other Republicans -- said they had no interest in getting in the middle of a dispute between Mr. Trump and Mr. Manchin.""That's between him and the president,"" she said. ""I don't agree with Joe's vote -- he knows that -- but everybody's entitled to their opinion and I just think we need to move on.""At 72, Mr. Manchin, who won re-election narrowly in 2018, has not said whether he will run again in 2024. Mr. Plante said his vote to convict the president could make it harder for him to do so. But Mr. Manchin says he is comfortable with his decision.""I've only taken two oaths since I've been a senator,"" he said. ""One was to protect and defend the Constitution and the other was to do impartial justice, and I think I did. I can sleep on that.""Nicholas Fandos and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.PhotographSenator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a swing vote on impeachment, drew President Trump's fury after the trial ended.

| Jump to first hitAs the primary race becomes a battle of all against all, and the field suddenly seems to be constricting, the divisiveness and negative attacks are rising.No one has tagged a rival with a bully-boy nickname like ""Sleepy"" or ""Liddle.""But as push comes to shove in the Democratic primary, candidates and their surrogates have descended to a level of personal animus that was rare before the era of President Trump.On Monday, Joseph R. Biden Jr. launched a digital ad in South Carolina saying Bernie Sanders ""can't be trusted"" after weighing a 2012 primary against ""our first African-American president,"" Barack Obama.After Pete Buttigieg attacked Mr. Sanders's victory in Nevada, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York lectured Mr. Buttigieg on Twitter, saying ""not to be so smug when you just got your ass kicked.""And lest last week's Democratic debate recede into history (it was just five days ago), one memorable and searing moment was a highly personal exchange in which Mr. Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar dripped contempt for each other, with Ms. Klobuchar saying, ""I wish everyone was as perfect as you, Pete.""As the primary race becomes a battle of all against all, ""Hunger Games""-style, and the field suddenly seems to be constricting, the divisiveness and negative attacks are rising. Mr. Sanders's commanding win in Nevada -- he earned 24 pledged delegates as the final results were tallied Monday, with Mr. Biden taking nine and Mr. Buttigieg, three -- has triggered alarm among some center-left Democratic officials and voters. His moderate challengers have sought in vain to push one another to the exits to consolidate the anti-Sanders vote.Past presidential primaries certainly had their share of negative campaigning. But much of the intraparty warfare used to be waged behind the scenes -- through ""oppo dumps"" of compromising research against opponents or anonymous criticism in newspaper stories. Today the combination of social media democratization and Mr. Trump's habit of lobbing nasty personal attacks have removed the filters.""Candidates always tried to stay above it and never get down deeply in the mud,"" said Joe Lockhart, a former press secretary for former President Bill Clinton. ""Trump has changed that. He's modeled the idea that the presidential candidates are the ones to make the sharpest attacks, and there's no bottom.""On Saturday night, after Mr. de Blasio, a surrogate for Mr. Sanders, tweeted at Mr. Buttigieg, saying ""Dude, show some humility,"" Mr. Lockhart immediately replied to the New York mayor, ""Who cares what you think?""Four or five years ago, Mr. Lockhart said in an interview, he would have had to phone a reporter to weigh in, and the mainstream press, acting as gatekeeper, might or might not have quoted him.Now, ""there's the ability for people to have their own platforms,"" he said. ""I tweeted it, and got back to my dinner.""David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, lamented that the last debate, which smashed records as the most watched Democratic presidential debate ever, was so intensely negative. ""My worry is that everyone looked so mad at each other,"" he said. ""When every person on the stage has their oppo ready to go and delivers it with such ferocity, you may win that individual skirmish, but you're giving away the bigger picture -- the need for people to be inspired.""Yes, there are many examples of Democratic rivals turning negative in past primary races. Strategists for Hillary Clinton in 2008 dangled Mr. Obama's youthful drug use. In 2016, Mrs. Clinton accused Mr. Sanders of smearing her for receiving donations from rich people.But those digs feel pretty innocent compared to this year, when a burst of gloves-off negativity seems to have been triggered by the prospect of a staunchly leftist nominee in Mr. Sanders, the late entry of Michael R. Bloomberg and a fierce fight over which moderate candidate ought to be Mr. Sanders's leading foil.On Sunday night, Mr. Sanders praised Fidel Castro for Cuba's literacy program on ""60 Minutes."" Many responses from fellow Democrats were searing, including two congresswomen from Florida with sizable Cuban electorates. ""As the first South American immigrant member of Congress who proudly represents thousands of Cuban Americans, I find Senator Bernie Sanders' comments on Castro's Cuba absolutely unacceptable,"" Representative Debbi Mucarsel-Powell, one of the Florida congresswomen, said on Twitter.Fernand Amandi, a pollster and political consultant in South Florida, went further: ""Democrats, nominating this man will absolutely re-elect @realDonaldTrump and end our Constitutional republic,"" he wrote.With seven Democrats set to appear in another presidential debate on Tuesday in South Carolina, the negativity is unlikely to let up. Mr. Buttigieg previewed that he would continue to try to undermine Mr. Sanders as a high-risk choice. On Monday, he tweeted that after Mr. Sanders's ""60 Minutes"" interview, it would be disastrous to nominate the self-described democratic socialist ""after four years of looking on in horror as Trump cozied up to dictators.""On election night in Nevada, Mr. Buttigieg, who has been the most aggressive in taking on Mr. Sanders, said his rival ""believes in an inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans.""Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, is also highly likely to be a broad target again. At the debate last week, Elizabeth Warren pushed Mr. Bloomberg hard over derogatory comments he had made about women, and his settlements with former employees that kept some women from discussing such incidents. The blowback led Mr. Bloomberg later to release three women from nondisclosure agreements.Not everyone is unhappy about a fierce primary fight.Former Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia said it was entirely reasonable that candidates were probing one another's vulnerabilities. ""Senator Sanders, the current front-runner, has not faced true sustained scrutiny in either of his runs for president,"" Mr. McAuliffe said. ""So it's much better to understand his electability now in the primary than to not know until he's facing Donald Trump's smear machine.""And Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist, was glad for the new tenor of the primary. It reveals who has the steel for the coming showdown of the general election, he said.""It's one thing to tell people about your agenda, it's another to show people how hard you'll fight for it, but that's what candidates are starting to do, and it's about time,"" said Mr. Ferguson, who worked for Mrs. Clinton in 2016.""Democrats want a nominee who will be the general to lead us into battle against Donald Trump,"" he continued. ""They're not going to promote someone to that role unless they've proven they can win a few skirmishes first.""PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at the debate last week in Las Vegas. Mr. Biden has been attacking Mr. Sanders's trustworthiness as the South Carolina primary approaches.

| Jump to first hitHis placement behind his leading rivals in the caucuses on Monday dealt a damaging blow to his campaign. Some party officials say it was a long time in the works.
DES MOINES — Maybe it was the threat of bad weather. Maybe it was a seating assignment debacle. Maybe it was a struggling campaign organization that still hadn’t found its footing.
But as Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke at a major Iowa Democratic Party dinner in November, one thing was clear: His support appeared tepid compared with the vocal cheering sections of top rivals. The reception angered Mr. Biden and his top aides — and it left little doubt about his standing, three months before the nominating process in the Democratic presidential race would begin: The former vice president was in deep trouble in Iowa.
Two days after the dinner, Mr. Biden ripped into his campaign chairman, Steve Ricchetti, according to a person familiar with the conversation. And at the Biden headquarters in Philadelphia, senior officials sternly told staff members they needed to step up their performance.
The dinner’s damaging optics marked the beginning of a flurry of changes: Trusted aides were deployed to Iowa sooner than anticipated. Mr. Biden rescheduled time with donors to make space for a bus tour in Iowa. Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa and his wife, Christie Vilsack, major players in Iowa Democratic politics, announced their Biden endorsements.
It was too late.
Mr. Biden’s performance in the Iowa caucuses on Monday dealt a damaging blow to the former vice president; with well over 90 percent of the results counted by Wednesday night, he trailed Pete Buttigieg and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, with Senator Amy Klobuchar not far behind.
“I am not going to sugarcoat it,” Mr. Biden said Wednesday as he campaigned in New Hampshire. “We took a gut punch in Iowa.”
Certainly over the past year, Mr. Biden has proved far more resilient than many expected. He has led national polls for months despite verbal gaffes, scrutiny of his long and sometimes controversial record in Washington, and a relentless assault from Republicans over his son’s dealings in Ukraine. The slow drip of vote totals in Iowa — and a swirl of other major news events — may blunt the attention on Mr. Biden’s challenges. And Iowa is an overwhelmingly white state, while Mr. Biden’s biggest political strength is with black voters, whom he is counting on for support in later-voting, more diverse states.
But he now faces jittery donors, an uncertain landscape in upcoming Democratic contests and a sharp challenge to the central argument of his campaign message: that he is the party’s strongest candidate to win a general election.
Interviews with more than a dozen advisers, allies and Iowa strategists show that Mr. Biden was late in focusing on Iowa, put together an organization there that fell well short of his top rivals’ and that his core pitch about electability and experience wasn’t enough to persuade voters who wanted a fresh face or more boldly progressive ideas.
Mr. Biden was also a less-than-inspiring presence on the trail, according to some voters, struggling at times in the homestretch to deliver crisp, energetic, on-message performances.
A late start proves costly
When Mr. Biden announced his candidacy on April 25, some of his chief rivals had already been running for months.
His late start had long-lasting consequences, according to some of his supporters.
“He could have been here sooner and more aggressively,” said Mr. Vilsack, who became Mr. Biden’s top surrogate in the state. “Because this is all about relationships.”
“It was frustrating that they weren’t seeming to reach more people,” added Susan Judkins, a member of the Clive City Council. “Some of the other campaigns had been getting momentum. They had hired staffers who are known to Iowans, who had an ability to influence.”
When he did get to the state over the summer and into the fall, Mr. Biden’s team produced carefully managed events. He traveled with a phalanx of staff, sometimes used teleprompters and typically spoke from behind rope lines. None of that prevented a spree of verbal stumbles in Iowa in August — but according to some of his allies, it did keep Mr. Biden from showing off his biggest strength: his retail politicking skills.
“I’ve had that conversation at least since the end of May, beginning part of the summer, that Joe would do better and has always done better meeting with people,” said State Representative Bruce Hunter, a staunch Biden ally who said he made that case to Mr. Biden’s state campaign leadership. “He needed to get out more, talk to smaller groups of people, listen to them, give his vision one-on-one to people.”
Yet no amount of glad-handing could remedy an organization that even his supporters here found frustrating.
“His campaign is not a good campaign,” Roxanna Moritz, the Scott County auditor and a Biden supporter, said late last month. “They’re not embedding loyalty to the organization, he doesn’t do groundwork.”
She said that the campaign was “not returning phone calls, no follow through.”
“It’s kind of sad because I really do think he is the right person,” she added.
By the fall, Mr. Biden’s advisers felt that their campaign organization in Iowa had steadied — but events in Washington took him down a detour that no one could have foreseen, or prevented.
On Sept. 21, more than 1,000 Biden supporters assembled at the Polk County Steak Fry, featuring the kind of chummy interaction in which Mr. Biden is at his best.
But their efforts were overshadowed by news that President Trump had asked Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, a story that would consume the campaign for months. That night, a Des Moines Register poll revealed that Mr. Biden had slipped from first place in Iowa, overtaken by Ms. Warren of Massachusetts.
Mr. Biden spent the next weeks grappling with the best way to respond to the Ukraine controversy. And party officials continued to describe his Iowa organization as scattershot, an issue thrown into sharp relief at the party dinner in November, the Liberty and Justice Celebration.
Mr. Biden’s team said that it had around 1,200 people in the arena, many of whom went on to become precinct captains and dedicated volunteers. But the empty seats and the smaller and less boisterous Biden sections spread throughout the arena cut a sharp contrast with the loud, unified crowds of Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., in a major test of organizational strength.
More damaging than the evident differences in crowd strength was what many Iowa Democrats were seeing for the first time in person: a once-fiery candidate who was looking his age compared with a number of his younger rivals.
A key endorsement, and some advice
Mr. Biden’s campaign could do little to alter the presentation of a candidate who was given to meandering into verbal cul-de-sacs even in his prime.
But they concluded that they needed to better display Mr. Biden’s strong interpersonal skills, and to connect with more moderate voters who live in rural areas.
Mr. Vilsack, the former governor, had long advocated that approach, joining with his wife to advise their old friend to spend time in small towns during a private conversation last spring.
After spending months meeting with candidates, the Vilsacks — who supported Mr. Biden in his first presidential campaign, in 1987 — informed Mr. Biden in a phone call that they would endorse him, impressed with his rural policy proposal, his empathy and his “capacity to take a punch.”
Behind the scenes, they offered the campaign leadership two major pieces of advice.
“One, you need to be out there in all parts of the state,” Mr. Vilsack said. “And two, you need to spend time with voters in a way that they will get to know you.”
After Thanksgiving, the Vilsacks joined Mr. Biden on a bus trip, called the “No Malarkey” tour, across rural parts of the state where the Biden campaign saw chances to accrue delegates.
The trip revealed strategic openings for the campaign, officials said. They spotted an opportunity with Latino voters in Storm Lake and were reminded to accentuate Mr. Biden’s advantage with Catholics in Dubuque.
The problem: Those lessons were arriving with just weeks to capitalize on them. Other candidates had already spent many months trying to win over the state’s Democratic caucusgoers.
“Had he done the ‘No Malarkey’ tour in the summertime, you may never have seen that Elizabeth Warren bounce,” said Representative Ami Bera, Democrat of California, who supports Mr. Biden.
Jesse Harris, a senior Biden Iowa adviser, said the timing was designed to coincide with when caucusgoers intensified their focus on the race. “The vice president did spend quite a bit of time in the state,” he said. “Obviously, he got into the race a bit later than the other candidates, so two or three months behind when he first visited the state compared to others. But we were actively here in Iowa.”
“The bus tour,” he added, “was a very visible extension of what we were already doing.”
Disappointing some supporters
As 2020 arrived, there were some encouraging developments, building on what the campaign saw as post-bus tour momentum.
On Jan. 2, Representative Abby Finkenauer, a Democrat who in 2018 had flipped an eastern Iowa district, endorsed Mr. Biden, signaling that candidates in the toughest races believed Mr. Biden was their safest bet at the top of the ticket. Representative Cindy Axne, a Democrat from another competitive Iowa district, later followed suit.
And tensions with Iran propelled national security matters into the spotlight, playing into Mr. Biden’s message of experience.
Yet even as he continued to land high-profile endorsements, Mr. Sanders of Vermont was on the rise, expanding his progressive support and seeking to cut into Mr. Biden’s base of blue-collar workers by attacking his record on Social Security, pointing out that he had occasionally entertained freezes to the program. The specter of a possible conflict with Iran allowed Mr. Sanders to continually remind voters that Mr. Biden had approved the use of force in Iraq.
A New York Times/Siena College poll released late last month found that even in eastern Iowa — home to many white working-class voters with whom Mr. Biden expected to be strong — he was struggling.
Ahead of the 2016 campaign, David Plouffe, Barack Obama’s former campaign manager, had warned Mr. Biden, according to an article in The Atlantic, “Do you really want it to end in a hotel room in Des Moines, coming in third to Bernie Sanders?”
In the final weeks before the 2020 Iowa caucuses, Mr. Plouffe’s warning was starting to sound prescient.
Recognizing the need to win new supporters, Mr. Biden’s Iowa director, Jake Braun, floated a deal over dinner in Des Moines with an adviser to Ms. Klobuchar of Minnesota. The two moderate Democrats should form an alliance, Mr. Braun suggested a week before the vote, and urge their supporters to back the other if one of them did not advance to the final round in a precinct.
Ms. Klobuchar’s camp quickly shot down the prospect when the story leaked, and Mr. Braun, who had already been marginalized by Mr. Biden’s national campaign, found himself isolated by his enraged superiors, who had warned him not to freelance, according to a person familiar with internal discussions.
Sue Dvorsky, a former Iowa Democratic chair, had backed Senator Kamala Harris of California. After Ms. Harris dropped out, Ms. Dvorsky said she was inclined to support Mr. Biden, whom she and her husband had met when he ran for president in 1987.
But Ms. Dvorsky was appalled at the state of Mr. Biden’s organization, which was lacking precinct captains even in her own heavily Democratic community. Last week she endorsed Ms. Warren.
“This has been a sloppy effort that was always aimed at a general election,” she said of Mr. Biden’s organization, deeming it worse than his first two Iowa campaigns. “Right now, they’re bringing in hundreds of people from out of state — not to be canvassers but to be precinct captains.”
Even some of Mr. Biden’s high-profile supporters were perplexed by the campaign’s choices, which included dispatching a number of his former Senate colleagues, all of them white men over 70, to stump for him in the Iowa campaign’s final days.
On the Saturday before the caucuses, Ms. Judkins had an uneasy feeling about the decision her state was about to make. She had spent the day knocking on doors with a host of prominent Biden supporters from across the country. She came away impressed by what her colleagues had told her — that Mr. Biden had more support and organizational strength in later-voting states. She wished they had come to Iowa sooner.
“I said to my husband, ‘I feel like all of these people from around the country are coming in to try to save us from ourselves,’” she said when they went out that evening. “Here we are, going out dancing. Kind of like the Titanic, the ship going down.”

| Jump to first hitA victory in Massachusetts would not just give Mr. Sanders a significant share of the state's 91 delegates but also inflict a symbolic blow to his closest ideological rival.SPRINGFIELD, Mass. -- Bernie Sanders landed in Elizabeth Warren's home state on Friday night, stood before thousands of screaming fans and asked them to help him win it.As Ms. Warren was campaigning hundreds of miles away in South Carolina, where voting in the state's primary began Saturday morning, Mr. Sanders had departed for parts north, hoping to extinguish her candidacy -- or at least deliver a stinging embarrassment.With the race entering a critical phase, Mr. Sanders is looking ahead to big states like California and Texas to amass an insurmountable delegate lead next Tuesday, while also setting his sights on less glossy, but still delegate-rich states including Virginia and North Carolina.Yet a victory in Massachusetts, where Ms. Warren was first elected to the Senate in 2012 and re-elected in 2018, would not only give Mr. Sanders, the senator from neighboring Vermont, a significant share of the state's 91 delegates but also inflict a symbolic blow to his closest ideological rival, as he pushes to categorically establish himself as the standard-bearer of the liberal left.His rally in Springfield, and one in Boston on Saturday, are clear signs of his take-no-prisoners approach to his 2020 campaign. If that means beating Ms. Warren in Massachusetts, so be it.""People don't get their own states walled off for them,"" said Jeff Weaver, a top strategist to Mr. Sanders.Mr. Sanders has similarly added an event in Minnesota, the home state of Senator Amy Klobuchar, though her continued presence in the race is largely viewed as bleeding votes from other Sanders rivals rather than hurting him.In a show of force Mr. Sanders rallied more than 13,000 people at the Boston Common on Saturday, according to his campaign. Referring to himself as ""a U.S. Senator from your neighbor up north,"" he expressed confidence in his ability to win Massachusetts.""If we have the largest voter turnout in the history of Massachusetts primary -- we can win here in Massachusetts, we can win the Democratic nomination,"" he said. He did not mention the South Carolina primary.So far, Mr. Sanders has advertised more heavily than Ms. Warren in her home state, deployed about a dozen staff members, set up four field offices, had 1,500 volunteer events and organized canvassers to knock on 50,000 doors just last weekend, according to his campaign. Mr. Sanders even used his Twitter platform to amplify a local zoning and redevelopment fight in East Boston this week.In an apparent nod to the urgency of the situation, a super PAC supporting Ms. Warren announced late Thursday that it was buying up television time in Boston to give her a last-minute boost.Ms. Warren has declined several times to call Massachusetts a must-win state -- twice in a CNN town hall on Wednesday and again Saturday morning while campaigning in Columbia, S.C. Asked about Mr. Sanders's presence in the state, she told reporters: ""I know that Massachusetts is a very progressive state and progressive ideas are very popular. And so I'm sure that's why Bernie is campaigning there.""In Springfield, Mr. Sanders's supporters were relishing the possibility of a win. Lindsay Sabadosa, a state representative in Massachusetts and co-chairwoman of the Sanders campaign in the state, almost mockingly appropriated some of Ms. Warren's own rhetoric as she introduced him, saying she was ""counting down the days until election night.""""Not only because I am ready for a new president -- and let me tell you, I am ready for a new president -- but because I am ready for a new president who believes in big, bold structural change and who has the courage, the passion and the plans to make it happen,"" she said.There has been limited polling in Massachusetts. One survey, from the University of Massachusetts Lowell, taken after the New Hampshire primary but before Mr. Sanders won Nevada, showed a statistical dead heat, with Mr. Sanders at 21 percent and Ms. Warren at 20 percent. Another, from the radio station WBUR, showed Mr. Sanders opening a lead, with 25 percent to Ms. Warren's 17 percent.Advisers to Ms. Warren, who has no plans to appear in Massachusetts until voting on Super Tuesday, said that her time and money is best spent elsewhere, especially as she sits close to the crucial 15 percent threshold to qualify for delegates in big states like California and Texas. She is scheduled to make appearances in those states in the coming days.If Mr. Sanders is looking for knockout blows heading into Super Tuesday, Ms. Warren is more focused on accumulating delegates wherever she can. The delegate margins in Massachusetts are likely to be insignificant enough that her campaign is willing to risk a symbolic defeat here if it means winning delegates elsewhere.As she chases delegates elsewhere, she is firing up a surrogate and volunteer operation at home. Late Friday, Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts endorsed her.""This is her home turf,"" said Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, who endorsed Ms. Warren a year ago. ""I think Senator Warren has been underestimated plenty of times in the past and I think she does best in the most critical moments.""Still, there are causes for concern and even Mr. Kennedy was cautious about forecasting an outright victory. ""No doubt she'll put forth a strong showing,"" he said.For much of 2019, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, the two leading liberals in the race, worked almost in tandem at the debates, batting away more moderate rivals and rarely disagreeing with each other.But then in January, in their most significant breach of the primary, Ms. Warren confirmed a news media report that Mr. Sanders had told her in a private meeting that a woman would not be able to win the White House -- he denied saying such a thing -- and she confronted him after a debate that month and accused him of calling her a liar.Mr. Sanders went on to finish in a virtual tie for first in Iowa, then carried the next two states, and he has been building momentum in the polls across the country.In the New Hampshire primary, on Feb. 11, Ms. Warren did not finish higher than fourth in any of the precincts that border Massachusetts. And in population-dense Nashua, she finished in fifth.In 2016, Mr. Sanders won 48.7 percent of the vote in the Massachusetts primary, losing narrowly to Hillary Clinton. He was strongest in the more working-class areas of western Massachusetts, carrying more than 70 percent in some precincts that bordered his home state of Vermont.Mrs. Clinton's entire margin of victory -- which was a little more than 17,000 votes -- was from Boston, where she outpaced Mr. Sanders by nearly 20,000 votes.Mr. Sanders has another advantage: He has run more than $3.4 million in television ads in the Massachusetts markets, mostly in Boston; much of it came in advance of the New Hampshire primary in an attempt to reach voters in the southern part of that state. Ms. Warren has run about one-fifth as many ads: $700,000 worth and none since the New Hampshire primary.In recent weeks, Mr. Sanders has spent about $400,000 on television ads in Boston, Springfield and Providence, R.I.On Thursday, Sanders volunteers began organizing a four-day ""Berniepalooza"" in Worcester, Mass., complete with musical acts and door-knocking across the state. ""Canvass all day, party all night, and repeat,"" says the event invitation on Facebook.What the Sanders campaign does not have in Massachusetts is a formal state director, after Joe Caiazzo, who was moved to Massachusetts from New Hampshire, left at the end of last year. Shannon Jackson, who oversaw the Sanders victory in New Hampshire, is now in charge of the northeastern region of the country. The campaign moved New Hampshire staffers over to Massachusetts after that primary.Perhaps the biggest challenge for Ms. Warren is that the race features such a fractured field. The UMass Lowell poll showed five candidates with double-digit support, including Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Michael R. Bloomberg, the self-funding former mayor of New York City. Ms. Klobuchar was at 9 percent, as well.""One-on-one -- if it was Elizabeth Warren vs. Bernie Sanders in the primary -- she'd win comfortably,"" said Barney Frank, the former Massachusetts representative. ""But with the way it's worked out, it's not going to be that easy for her. Again, because she has all this competition for votes.""Mr. Frank added that the idea of a homegrown presidential candidate is not as exciting in Massachusetts as in some other states.""Having a presidential candidate from your state is not a novelty if you live in Massachusetts,"" he said. ""You're talking John Kerry, Michael Dukakis, Ted Kennedy, Mitt Romney. The thrill is gone with that.""Astead W. Herndon contributed reporting from Columbia, S.C.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders deployed about a dozen staff members, set up four field offices and had 1,500 volunteer events in Massachusetts.

| Jump to first hitThe decision suggests that the Sanders campaign is largely ceding another Southern state to Joseph R. Biden Jr. and going all-in on the Midwest instead.BURLINGTON, Vt. -- Senator Bernie Sanders has canceled a planned rally in Jackson, Miss., and will instead travel to Michigan on Friday, a striking indication that his presidential campaign is shifting its focus to the Midwest and largely ceding another Southern state to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., according to people familiar with the plans.After holding a rally in Phoenix on Thursday night, Mr. Sanders had been scheduled to travel to Jackson on Friday for a rally focused on racial justice.The change in plans suggests that Mr. Sanders will not challenge Mr. Biden for the support of black voters in the South -- a vital base in the Democratic Party -- and is instead going all-in on the Midwest as he tries to compete with Mr. Biden for working-class voters there. Black voters in the South have overwhelmingly backed Mr. Biden to this point, and on Super Tuesday this week their support lifted him in states like Alabama, North Carolina and Virginia.In Alabama, Mr. Sanders won only 9 percent of black voters, compared with 72 percent for Mr. Biden, according to exit polls. Mr. Biden outperformed Mr. Sanders among black voters in Virginia by more than 50 points, and by 40 points or more in Texas and North Carolina. In several states, Mr. Sanders came in third among black voters, behind not only Mr. Biden but also Michael R. Bloomberg.Mr. Bloomberg quit the race a day later, and Mr. Sanders's ideological rival on the left, Senator Elizabeth Warren, announced on Thursday that she was dropping out as well, effectively making the Democratic contest a two-man race between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden.The shift in Mr. Sanders's schedule was also an acknowledgment that he had not improved his standing among black voters in the South four years after his first run for president. In 2016, he faced criticism for his inability to organize support from African-Americans, a weakness that contributed to his loss to Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary.Speaking to reporters in Burlington on Thursday, Mr. Sanders acknowledged the scheduling change but said his campaign was sending staff members to Mississippi, which votes next Tuesday, along with Michigan and four other states. Michigan is the biggest prize of that day, awarding more than three times the pledged delegates of Mississippi.""If possible, I will try to get to Mississippi,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""You can't go every place.""""We're very proud of the fact that we have strong support in the African-American community,"" he added. ""We are going to be working with the African-American community, the Muslim community, in Michigan, and in every state in the country.""Asked if he saw a path forward for his campaign without winning Michigan, Mr. Sanders said he did. ""Every state is important,"" he said. ""Michigan is very, very important.""He also acknowledged Ms. Warren's exit from the race, crediting her with running a ""strong, issue-oriented campaign"" that ""changed political consciousness in America.""""I would simply say to her supporters out there, of whom there are millions, we are opening the door to you, we would love you to come on board,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""Together I think we can win this primary process.""Sanders aides are confident that Mr. Sanders lines up favorably against Mr. Biden in the industrial Midwest, and they have already laid out plans to highlight Mr. Biden's record on trade, which includes voting for the North American Free Trade Agreement. While many blue-collar voters say they feel a connection to Mr. Biden, many have also grown increasingly suspicious of free trade in the Trump era.In an interview, Faiz Shakir, the campaign manager for Mr. Sanders, said the campaign was considering running an ad in Midwestern states like Michigan and Ohio that will emphasize Mr. Biden's record on trade, and Mr. Sanders has already added blistering remarks about Mr. Biden into his stump speech.""I will be talking in Michigan about the fact that Joe supported disastrous trade agreements,"" Mr. Sanders said Thursday.At an event in Phoenix on Thursday night, his first rally since Super Tuesday, Mr. Sanders laced into Mr. Biden for his record on trade, the Iraq war and Social Security, as he has done recently.But he also opened two new lines of attack, knocking Mr. Biden for his past votes for the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy that prohibited openly gay people from serving in the military and for his past support for the Hyde Amendment, a measure that bans federal funding for most abortions.""When you've got two candidates, unlike when you have 18 candidates, it is possible to really contrast the views of the candidates,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""That's what I'm going to do.""There was a brief disruption at the rally in Phoenix when a man in the crowd unfurled a Nazi flag bearing a swastika, before he was quickly removed. ""The senator is aware of the flag with the swastika on it and is disturbed by it,"" said Mike Casca, a campaign spokesman. Mr. Sanders is Jewish.A crucial part of Mr. Sanders's argument has been the idea that he is the most electable candidate, able to defeat President Trump in a general election by appealing to the same working-class white voters who helped hand Mr. Trump his victory in 2016. But among aides and advisers, there has been a growing recognition that his claim hinges on his ability to demonstrate this strength in Midwestern states during the primary.Mr. Sanders's disappointing performance on Super Tuesday -- he won only four states to Mr. Biden's 10 -- has only increased the sense of urgency inside his campaign.At a news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Sanders said he was ""disappointed"" in the Super Tuesday results. And in an extraordinary concession, he admitted that his campaign had not managed to generate the soaring turnout among young people that he had banked on to secure the nomination.While Mr. Sanders has managed to draw support in high numbers among other demographic groups, including Latino voters, his deficit with black voters in the South was central to his losses on Super Tuesday.Rather than cite his own shortcomings, however, Mr. Sanders has pointed to his opponents' strong connections with African-American voters. In an interview on Wednesday night with Rachel Maddow of MSNBC, he suggested that Mr. Biden was benefiting from his relationship with former President Barack Obama -- and used a parallel argument to explain his deficit in 2016 as well.""We're running against somebody who has touted his relationship with Barack Obama for eight years,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""Barack Obama is enormously popular in this country in general and the African-American community. Running against Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton was enormously popular.""""It's not that I'm not popular,"" he added. ""Biden is running with his ties to Obama and that's working well.""He also said he was generally doing well among voters of color, including Latinos, and with younger black voters.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders is turning his focus to Michigan, a ""very, very important"" state in the race.

| Jump to first hitMs. Warren's campaign and her allies, convinced her message is being ignored, see a path forward -- and they say writing her off would be a mistake.RENO, Nev. -- A bad month for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts keeps getting worse. She finished in a respectable third place in the Iowa caucuses, but a results-tallying meltdown muddled what could have been a good evening. New Hampshire was better at logistics but worse for her candidacy, considering she ended up closer to candidates who dropped out after the primary than those who finished on top.On Sunday, Ms. Warren had a cold so severe it threatened to sideline one of the country's most famous persisters.""People told me, 'You have to cancel your day in Reno,""' Ms. Warren said, hoarse and barely audible. ""I said, 'Reno has been left out of way too many conversations.""'Ms. Warren and her team feel the same. She is not cratering or surging, neither the most likely to win nor at risk of immediately dropping out, a 40-degree day surrounded by candidates who are hot and cold. Her staff members and plenty of allies argue that as a result, she is being ignored by the news media and some voters during a pivotal moment in the primary, and she is at risk of becoming less relevant in the nominating process -- something her campaign is now trying to reverse.When her caucus-night speech in Iowa was cut off, her campaign aides complained privately to cable networks. When her speech after the New Hampshire primary was not carried live at all, they took their criticism public.""Elizabeth hasn't been getting the same kind of media coverage as candidates she outperformed,"" read a recent fund-raising email to supporters. ""We can't count on the media to cover our campaign fairly, so we're taking our case directly to voters.""If the campaign is trying to rally supporters at a time when Ms. Warren's candidacy hangs in the balance, it is also trying to move on from some recent political events: Her much-touted campaign organization did not show a dramatic payoff in the first two contests, and polling in Nevada, South Carolina and Super Tuesday states has shown little improvement among the black and Latino Democrats she once thought could spring her to the nomination.Straining themselves to avoid criticizing the candidate or campaign, Ms. Warren's most loyal admirers are trying to reframe the New Hampshire outcome in the most flattering light possible: More than two dozen of them, in interviews at events throughout Nevada, argued her fourth-place finish was an aberration, not a blow to the campaign's core message that should force reflection or correction.Few admitted disappointment in the outcome of the first two contests and a growing sense of pessimism about Ms. Warren's electoral prospects. But many of her die-hard backers, the true believers, have gone on the offensive, arguing that the only trouble she faces is that political observers are prematurely writing off the campaign. They saw further evidence of that on Tuesday, when an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll listed the results of hypothetical general-election matchups against President Trump for five candidates, but not Ms. Warren, even though she had outpolled some of them.At events in Nevada, backers rattled off talking points, highlighting polling that showed her with more support among nonwhite voters than Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. They noted her large staff on the ground in states that vote on Super Tuesday. They criticized the ""corporate media"" in ways that echoed supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.""She's a female candidate, and the media hasn't taken her seriously,"" said Matt Newton, 46. ""They give so much attention to the male candidates.""Pat Campbell-Cozzi, 76, said flatly: ""New Hampshire doesn't matter. I know where she'll be after the final vote.""Heather McGhee, the former president of the progressive think tank Demos, said it was up to these grass-roots supporters to reverse the direction of Ms. Warren's candidacy.""Her supporters have been the ones to have her back and make that rallying cry,"" said Ms. McGhee, who is close to Ms. Warren's team.""Even in New Hampshire, these voters are very fluid,"" she said. ""Forty eight percent decided in the last two days, and that just means the race is very much up for grabs.""In some ways, this dynamic brings Ms. Warren's campaign back to where it started. When she announced her presidential run, she was considered a political figure in the shadow of Mr. Sanders on the left and fresher faces toward the center, such as former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas and Senator Kamala Harris of California.Supporters would complain about her being ignored, as male candidates such as Mr. O'Rourke commanded major early attention. Questions loomed about whether Ms. Warren could raise enough money to keep her large organizing staff afloat.Throughout the summer, she used policy to help set the tone of the race, shaping the early debates and leading other candidates to face questions about her proposals. But as voting has moved from a hypothetical to a reality, and the primary has stopped being a contest of ideas, Ms. Warren has struggled to adjust.Fund-raising concerns have returned, and the campaign has set a goal of raising $7 million before the Nevada caucuses. In a recent video, Ms. Warren told supporters: ""I need to level with you: Our movement needs to raise critical funds so I can remain competitive in this race through Super Tuesday.""Ms. Warren currently ranks fourth among the Democratic presidential candidates in mentions on cable news, behind Mr. Sanders, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mr. Buttigieg, according to the Internet Archive's Television News Archive.She has frequently brushed off questions that ask her to reflect on her own media coverage, saying that she tries not to read stories about herself and her campaign.""Elizabeth is third in delegates, has over a million grass-roots donors, and is drawing thousands of people to her events,"" said Kristen Orthman, Ms. Warren's communications director. ""The pundits have consistently been wrong about this primary and that's why it's important for people to organize for and support the candidate they believe in rather than the candidate the coverage says is on top.""On Monday, Ms. Warren showed no signs of the annoyance that has rankled her supporters, energetically pitching herself to union voters, hosting a town hall event in Henderson, Nev., and attending a Latino market.Her schedule in Nevada includes events with the actress Yvette Nicole Brown, the former cabinet secretary Julián Castro, and Representative Deb Haaland of New Mexico. More campaign staff members and surrogates have hit the television circuit in recent days, including black and Latino supporters who aim to serve as community validators for voters with whom Ms. Warren needs to develop trust.Supporters and allies are doing their part to generate excitement, New Hampshire be damned. On Monday, which was Presidents' Day, Ms. Warren's supporters helped make #PresidentWarren a national trending topic on Twitter.Organizations that are supporting Ms. Warren have blasted out emails with subject lines like ""Warren the Warrior Wonk Returns -- and people LOVE it,"" sent after Ms. Warren criticized one of her favorite targets, Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor and a presidential rival.In a move that cheered her supporters, Ms. Warren went after Mr. Bloomberg even more forcefully on Tuesday, responding to the news that he had qualified for a Democratic debate for the first time.""It's a shame Mike Bloomberg can buy his way into the debate,"" she tweeted. ""But at least now primary voters curious about how each candidate will take on Donald Trump can get a live demonstration of how we each take on an egomaniac billionaire.""One undecided voter who attended Ms. Warren's event in Reno said her performance in New Hampshire had sent a troubling message, considering that the state shares a border with Massachusetts.""It was concerning -- do they know something I don't?"" Kristin Ritenhouse, 49, said of New Hampshire voters. ""Because my neighbors like me.""Jocelyn Waite, 66, a caucus captain who also attended the rally, recited the campaign email that was critical of press coverage almost word for word. Ms. Waite said the last week had taught her that ""corporate media doesn't want"" Ms. Warren to win.""Aren't there supposed to be three tickets out of Iowa? She was third and that wasn't good enough,"" Ms. Waite said. ""And then, in New Hampshire, third was good enough for Klobuchar.""Grievance can be a powerful motivator for political campaigns, bonding supporters against a common enemy, driving small-dollar donations and volunteers, and helping to create an organic network of support, particularly online and on social media.President Trump has, in the extreme, railed against the news media and other political enemies. Democratic candidates like Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden have also tried to unite supporters through rhetoric that downplays the significance of traditional political gatekeepers, though they have never approached the president's tenor.But the tactic can also be a sign of a campaign in decline. Supporters of Ms. Harris, Mr. O'Rourke, Mr. Castro and Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York all criticized outside factors, such as media coverage and the debate rules set by the Democratic National Committee, before their favored candidates exited the race.Martha Zimmerman and Natalie Buddiga, who attended Ms. Warren's rally in Reno, both said they felt she was being counted out of the race too early. But they also admitted to a sense of despair that was quietly setting in.""I just don't run into other Elizabeth Warren fans, and I'm always meeting these Bernie die-hards,"" said Ms. Buddiga, 25, who wore a shirt that read ""The Future is Female.""Ms. Zimmerman, 29, a self-described voracious consumer of political media, said the past week had been difficult. While sexism cannot be separated from analysis of Ms. Warren's candidacy, she said, neither could the reality of her performance in New Hampshire.In recent days, she considered changing her vote to Mr. Sanders, a candidate she felt had a better chance at the nomination.She decided against it.""We've got to stand with our girl,"" she said. ""We have to persist like she would.""PhotographElizabeth Warren on Saturday in Nevada. Her most loyal admirers say her fourth-place finish in New Hampshire was an aberration.

| Jump to first hitFor Elizabeth Warren, the historic number of women in the 2020 field and the Democrats who supported them, the question will linger.WASHINGTON -- In the end, the pink wave carried two white men ashore.Since Donald J. Trump won the presidency, women's rage has fueled the Democratic Party. Women created new political organizations, led protests, ran for office and voted for Democrats more than they ever had before. A record number of female lawmakers now serve in Congress. After years of being considered a political liability, Speaker Nancy Pelosi has emerged as a party icon and, in 2020, multiple women ran for president.For the first time in history, Americans saw a diverse group of female leaders pursuing the country's highest office, an elite sorority that included former prosecutors, senators, a combat veteran and even a self-help celebrity.And, for the first time in history, a majority of Democratic voters rejected them all. As the party moves toward picking a nominee, the last man left standing will be, most certainly, a man.It's a situation that has left some prominent Democratic women frustrated to still be fighting battles they hoped had been settled years ago.""The narrative that somehow women are less electable than men seems to still be an issue. It's very disgusting really,"" said Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, who was one of Senator Kamala Harris's campaign co-chairs. ""In 2020, we should have a woman as our commander in chief.""That's a view shared by many of the female candidates, who struggled to explain how, after the year of the woman, no women remained as a serious contender for the nomination.""One of the hardest parts of this,"" said Senator Elizabeth Warren, her voice shaking as she announced the end of her campaign on Thursday, ""is all those little girls who are going to have to wait four more years. That's going to be hard.""Senator Amy Klobuchar described feeling a ""kind of obligation"" to the girls who would approach her at events.""This is how I reconcile some of the fact that I'm not up there anymore. It's that you also see women with power,"" she said in an interview Wednesday night. ""They ended up by not choosing the women, but that doesn't mean the women are going to go away.""Ms. Harris was far less optimistic: ""The reality is that there's still a lot of work to be done to make it clear that women are exceptionally qualified and capable of being the commander in chief of the United States,"" she told reporters on Capitol Hill on Thursday.As the campaign moved across the country, the debate over that simple and strangely enduring question -- can a woman win? -- happened in book clubs and college dorm rooms, on debate stages and at town hall meetings. For supporters of Ms. Harris, the question included asking about the greater challenges black women face.After Ms. Warren announced her bid at the end of 2018, Democratic strategists fretted over whether the misogyny they argued helped cause Hillary Clinton's defeat in 2016 could take down another woman nominee.Early comparisons to Mrs. Clinton were unavoidable for the women running in 2020, even though they had little in common other than their gender and party.Like Mrs. Clinton and every other person who has ever run for president, the female candidates made strategic miscalculations, struggled with fund-raising, building support and the rigors of the campaign trail.Any missteps heightened the doubts that voters already harbored.At events for Democratic candidates over the past year, many women said that they were more aware than ever of sexism in their own lives and in the culture at large, because of the #MeToo movement and heightened focus on gender parity. All of that awareness, though, became an obstacle to electing a female president. They knew how sexist the world was, some said, and they couldn't take the risk.As they waited for Ms. Warren to arrive at a rally in San Antonio last week, Kathleen Chandler and Amanda Cardoza vividly recalled the moment when Mrs. Clinton lost and how it spurred them to get more involved in politics. Ms. Chandler, 34, held an election night party, she recounted, ordering cookies with pictures of Mrs. Clinton's face. Deflating balloons clung to her ceiling for a month after the defeat; she couldn't bear to take them down.Now, Ms. Chandler saw Mr. Trump's victory as a sign that Democrats must pick a woman as their nominee. She voted for Ms. Warren.""Women as leaders can heal better, and our country's broken,"" she said as she fed her young son a bottle. ""It's infuriating that the women are dropping and we're going to be stuck with white men.""But Ms. Cardoza, 38, took a different lesson from Mrs. Clinton's loss. The high school teacher, who wore earrings modeled after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's collar, was torn between Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders.""America hates women,"" she said, ""I'm sad to say that I think that's what it is.""Like Ms. Cardoza, female voters worried the most about the viability of female candidates. Eighteen percent of Democratic women said that a woman could not win the White House, compared with 7 percent of men, according to a CNN poll in January.In the Super Tuesday contests, Ms. Warren ranked third among female voters, losing to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Mr. Sanders by more than 10 percentage points. She did, however, win 30 percent of white college-educated women, the largest share held by any of the candidates, according to exit polls.""We are so hungry to replace the occupant of the White House that a certain portion of Democratic Party was not willing to take the perceived risk of having a woman lead the ticket,"" said Gov. Kate Brown, the first female governor of Oregon in more than two decades, who questioned whether gender was influencing voters' decisions at a private meeting with Democratic governors after the Iowa caucuses. ""It's as straightforward as that.""When asked, many women bristled over the idea that they would back a candidate because of their gender.""I'm not going to vote for someone simply because we share identity,"" said Hassani Scott, 24, as she watched Super Tuesday results at a watch party sponsored by Mr. Biden's campaign in Los Angeles. ""It's more practical voting for Uncle Joe.""At least a few of the Democratic women elected to Congress in 2018 said they didn't take gender into account when they made their choice.Representative Chrissy Houlahan, a freshman congresswoman from the Philadelphia suburbs, was wooed by multiple presidential candidates for her support before endorsing Mr. Biden, a candidate she saw as a near-native son of her home state.""When I was looking at the field, I was looking for people who shared the values of my community. I wasn't necessarily evaluating on gender,"" she said in an interview two days before Ms. Warren dropped out of the race. ""In my lifetime I absolutely believe we will have a female president. But I would assume not this time.""Other female politicians cited more practical factors: The challenge of raising money from donors who said they liked a particular candidate, but just weren't convinced she should be -- or could be elected -- president. The double standard that research shows female politicians face around issues like ""likability"" and traits that voters prize in male politicians but not in women, including ambition and aggression.In her remarks on Thursday, Ms. Warren described talking about sexism as ""the trap question for every woman,"" forcing female candidates to either look like a ""whiner"" or deny a reality widely known to ""about a bazillion women.""""I promise I'll have a lot more to say on that subject,"" she added.Yet as the race progressed, some of the most prominent women in the party seemed to have very little to say. Ms. Pelosi and Mrs. Clinton declined to endorse or even more subtly signal a possible female heir. At her weekly news conference on Thursday, Ms. Pelosi acknowledged an ""element of misogyny"" in the presidential race.""Every time I get introduced as the most powerful woman in the United States, I almost cry, because I wish that wasn't true,"" she told reporters.Women's organizations also largely stayed out of the fight. Emily's List, the powerful political action committee that backs Democratic women who support abortion rights, endorsed Ms. Warren three days before she ended her bid.While those kinds of endorsements don't necessarily move votes, they provide a powerful signal, said Amanda Litman, executive director of Run for Something, which encourages young Democrats to seek political office.""They create the permission structure,"" said Ms. Litman, whose candidates are predominantly female. ""The people who were most fired up and doing the work in 2018 were the so-called 'resistance moms,' but I don't think the 'resistance moms' knew where to go this time around.""Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily's List, said backing one female candidate over another would have meant the possibility of hurting one woman's path to the nomination -- an outcome that the group couldn't countenance.""This is a new era. Prior to this we'd only endorsed in two presidential primaries and it was the same woman twice,"" Ms. Schriock said. ""Not in a million years, if you asked me four years ago, did I think four senators were going to run at the same time four years later.""Those four senators charted four different paths when it came to putting their experience as a woman in politics at the center of their appeal to voters.Senator Kirsten Gillibrand leaned into an unabashedly feminist message, gaining little traction for what she called a ""woman plus"" campaign platform. Ms. Klobuchar talked about the double-bind of being a woman in politics. Ms. Harris highlighted her barrier-breaking career, recounting on the campaign trail being asked to describe ""what it's like to be the first woman fill-in-the-blank.""When she began her campaign, Ms. Warren refused to engage in a debate around her ""likability."" In January 2019, she dismissed the discussion as a distraction, saying that she would ""keep fighting on the issues because I think that's what matters most.""Yet over the course of her nearly 14-month bid, she came to address gender more directly: Attacking Michael R. Bloomberg for derogatory comments about women, accusing Mr. Sanders of lying in his denial that he told her a woman was not electable in 2020, and describing the discrimination she faced during one of her pregnancies.In the final days of her campaign, she began introducing herself as ""the woman who would defeat Donald Trump.""But by then, voters were done asking whether a woman could win. They had already decided the answer was no.Katie Glueck contributed reporting from Los Angeles.PhotographFour women qualified for the November debate, including Tulsi Gabbard, Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris.

| Jump to first hitAs the liberal Bernie Sanders tightens his grip in Iowa, more traditional Democrats remain split among his four leading competitors, or are unsure altogether of whom to support.BETTENDORF, Iowa -- As they streamed out of the ballroom following a Scott County fund-raising banquet Saturday night, one after the other Iowa Democrats admitted that they still had not decided whom to support just over a week before the state's presidential caucuses.But by not mentioning his name as they rattled off their short lists, they made it clear whom they would not support: Senator Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist from Vermont who has taken the lead in recent polls.Instead, every one of the 30 still-undecided Democratic activists here rattled off some combination of the same four names -- Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.As Mr. Sanders tightens his grip on the party's young and left-wing voters in Iowa, more traditional Democrats, the ones who happily sit through marathon banquet dinners to hear the candidates and their representatives, remain split between his four leading competitors or remain unsure altogether about whom to rally behind.""I have told my colleagues all along: Bernie Sanders can win with 27 percent of the vote here,"" said Representative Dave Loebsack, an Iowa Democrat supporting Mr. Buttigieg, alluding to his fellow lawmakers, many of whom are deeply uneasy about running with Mr. Sanders on top of the ticket.The fracture among mainstream Democrats here carries profound implications for a primary that has already unsettled the party establishment and prompted late entrants into the race.Mr. Sanders is threatening to seize control in the early states, taking narrow but clear polling leads in Iowa and New Hampshire and increasingly menacing Mr. Biden's advantage in national polls. With his mammoth online fund-raising operation, Mr. Sanders appears to be in a position of financial strength unmatched by any other candidate besides Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City.Mr. Sanders's endurance, and his apparent rise in the earliest primary and caucus states, reflects both the loyalty of his core supporters and their conviction that Mr. Sanders would bring the same fighting resilience to the general election. But even among many liberals who admire Mr. Sanders's campaign, or some of his policy ideas, there is deep concern about the implications of nominating a candidate from the left whom President Trump is sure to portray as extreme.""I think that Bernie is just a bridge too far for the country,"" said Bonnie Campbell, a former Iowa attorney general who is supporting Mr. Biden. Ms. Campbell said she would have no difficulty supporting Mr. Sanders in the general election, but added, ""I can tell you, I hear from friends and colleagues who say: 'Oh my God, what are we going to do if Bernie wins?""'But in Iowa, Democrats who hope to avert that outcome do not appear close to settling on another candidate as an alternative to Mr. Sanders. And if more moderate voters don't coalesce behind an alternative by next week's caucus, party traditionalists fear, Mr. Sanders could win Iowa with only a modest plurality, emboldening his leading rivals to remain in the race, and then notch another victory again a week later in New Hampshire. No Democrat in modern times has lost contested races in both Iowa and New Hampshire and claimed the nomination.The early primary and caucus outcomes could have an outsize impact on later primaries, including the large states voting in March, some of which begin collecting mail-in and early ballots in the immediate aftermath of Iowa. If a candidate like Mr. Sanders were to seize momentum next week, it could help him build a head start in states like California and Texas.It is a scenario that is deeply alarming to establishment-aligned Democrats, if not unfamiliar. Four years ago, convinced Donald Trump could not win the presidency, they watched with delight as he snatched the Republican nomination without winning majorities because his more traditional rivals divided the vote and refused to bow out.The Democrats in this race have been as reluctant to target Mr. Sanders as the Republicans were to target Mr. Trump four years ago; in each case they were skeptical of his staying power and believed they had more to gain by attacking other rivals.Even now, as Mr. Sanders takes a lead in the first two early states, his opponents have not delivered a sustained argument against his candidacy, and remain reluctant to take him on: while Mr. Buttigieg drew attention for warning in a fund-raising solicitation that a Sanders nomination would be too risky, he notably declined to amplify his rhetoric in television interviews over the weekend. The closest he has come to confronting his rival on the left is to make oblique references to the often-bitter 2016 primary between Hillary Clinton and Mr. Sanders.""Most of us would agree the less 2020 resembles 2016 the better -- in all respects,"" Mr. Buttigieg said in a brief interview. Each of the would-be Stop Sanders candidates has built enough political strength to justify forging ahead: Mr. Biden remains the national front-runner, with unmatched support among black voters; Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren both have double-digit support in New Hampshire polls, and sizable war chests; Ms. Klobuchar has the thinnest operation beyond Iowa of the group, but over the weekend she earned the endorsement of New Hampshire's influential Union Leader newspaper.Should all four move forward from Iowa, with their perceived strengths and weaknesses, it could make it difficult for any of them to become a rallying point for voters uneasy about Mr. Sanders.Complicating matters further for traditionalists, and making this race potentially even messier than Mr. Trump's primary, is the presence of Mr. Bloomberg, who is not contesting the traditional early states in February but has already poured more than $270 million in advertising into later contests and made clear to allies that he will remain in the race should Mr. Sanders come roaring into March.Mr. Bloomberg was on Ms. Klobuchar's mind as she left the dinner here Saturday. She was asked if she would remain in the race if she did not break into the top three in the caucuses, which has often been the number of viable candidates who leave the state.Even if you're in fourth, she was asked?""You think it's only going to be down to four candidates even by New Hampshire?"" she said before answering the question. ""No, it's not.""Then, pointing to Mr. Bloomberg, she explained why the Democratic vote may remain splintered.""Why would I get out while he's still in?"" Ms. Klobuchar demanded.With nearly 40 percent of Iowa voters indicating in a new New York Times-Siena College poll that they were still not certain about whom to support, Mr. Sanders could still suffer a reversal of fortune here.That's in part because of the state's complex, multiphase caucusing process, which allows supporters of underdog candidates to shift to stronger contenders. If Mr. Sanders has the most enthusiastic base of support in Iowa, he may be less well positioned to expand his bloc in later rounds should moderate voters rally to one of the four other leading candidates.And it's Ms. Klobuchar whom Iowa Democrats are watching most closely. If she does not reach 15 percent in most precincts, her supporters could determine the statewide winner if they migrate mostly to one candidate.Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, Mr. Biden's most prominent supporter in the state, was blunt about why Ms. Klobuchar's backers should support the former vice president.Mr. Biden has the best chance of winning the general election, he shares Ms. Klobuchar's pragmatic politics and ""Joe is going to need a running mate,"" Mr. Vilsack said.A more urgent concern for Mr. Vilsack was the prospect of Iowa producing a muddled result, a scenario that's more likely this year because the state party, for the first time, is releasing raw vote totals from the initial round of balloting as well as the final results and delegate allocations.""If I had to make one prediction, there will be a split decision and that'll have repercussions,"" he said. ""Because whoever quote-unquote wins can claim that they won, and talk about it going into New Hampshire.""So while they still hope to best Mr. Sanders in Iowa or New Hampshire, several of Mr. Sanders's rivals have begun emphasizing their strengths in states later in the calendar.Mr. Biden's advisers and surrogates have been stressing his support among minority communities that become important starting with the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 22, while Ms. Warren's campaign circulated a memo last week detailing its preparations in the March primaries that will award most of the delegates that will settle the Democratic nomination.And in a conversation with volunteers before a town hall-style meeting in Davenport on Sunday, Ms. Warren reiterated her determination to compete into March and beyond, telling supporters she already has staff in 30 states, according to a volunteer who attended the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity.""We all know that this is very likely to be a long nomination process,"" said California Assemblyman David Chiu, who on Sunday was opening a campaign headquarters in San Francisco for Ms. Warren and said of her campaign: ""They are going to put up a tremendous fight here in the state.""That phase of the race is also when Mr. Bloomberg, with his vast personal fortune, could become a more urgent factor, either rising as an obstacle for Mr. Sanders or further fracturing the party's moderate wing.In California, Mayor Robert Garcia of Long Beach, who endorsed Mr. Biden this month, said he expected the former vice president to consolidate support there ""once it becomes clear that there's a few candidates left.""But gathering support around just a few candidates could also be difficult in California, Mr. Garcia noted, because the state's mail-in ballots would list the names of candidates who falter or withdraw over the course of February.""There are going to be a lot of candidates in California, because they are going to be on the ballot,"" he said. ""There will be some drop-off, but they're all competitive here and that's going to continue.""PhotographBernie Sanders is leading polls in Iowa and New Hampshire with the support of left-wing voters.

| Jump to first hitHe's gaining, and he has some considerable advantages he lacked in 2016.At this point in 2016, Bernie Sanders was competitive in Iowa but had no clear path to the nomination. Four years later, he finds himself in an enviable position: rising in the polls, enjoying the most resources, and facing relatively few attacks from his campaign rivals.A CNN/SSRS poll on Wednesday found him leading Joe Biden nationwide, 27 percent to 24 percent. In an average of polls, Mr. Biden still leads by about six percentage points, but his advantage over Mr. Sanders has been cut in half over the last three months.Mr. Sanders's position may be even better in the early states. The Selzer poll, Iowa's most highly awaited survey, shows him with a narrow lead in Iowa. Other polls show him gaining, though split on exactly where he stands in a divided field. He also remains well positioned in New Hampshire, giving him a chance to sweep the two early states.Large elements of the Democratic establishment strongly oppose Mr. Sanders, who is not a Democrat, raising the possibility of a vigorous campaign to stop him if he emerges as a front-runner. But it is clear that if he wins the early states, he will not face the obstacles that made it all but impossible for him to win the nomination in 2016.Mr. Sanders's current standing might be surprising considering his circumstances as recently as a few months ago. He had a heart attack in October. He seemed stuck in third place in national polls, with around 15 percent support. Well-known candidates with just 15 percent support do not usually go on to win. A factional rival for support on the left, Elizabeth Warren, had steadily gained in the polls.But the events of that same period opened a path for Mr. Sanders.In one sense, Ms. Warren's rise in the polls might have gone too well. Her standing began to falter around the time she matched Mr. Biden in national polls, which invited scrutiny from the news media and her opponents. Her position on ""Medicare for all"" funding and her weak standing in hypothetical polling matchups against the president offered avenues for attack. At the same time, Pete Buttigieg surged to the lead in Iowa; he and Ms. Warren promptly clashed, preventing either from solidifying a strong position in the state.In most elections, conflict between these two idealistic liberal candidates would have been good news for the establishment favorite, Mr. Biden. But he never emerged as a classic establishment front-runner, someone with a daunting number of endorsements and superior resources. He found himself outspent, in some cases by a wide margin, by lesser-known rivals at exactly the point in the race when an establishment front-runner would have been expected to spend lots of money to overpower his rivals.Mr. Biden's weak elite support has done more than simply deprive him of the resources to capitalize on his opening in Iowa. It has led many elite supporters to seek an alternative, empowering rivals who have weakened Mr. Biden further. Some have gone to Mr. Buttigieg, who has raised far more money than Mr. Biden.One elite supporter -- Michael Bloomberg -- has actually entered the race, and could sap Mr. Biden's support on Super Tuesday on March 3. Well-timed endorsements at Mr. Biden's expense could plausibly push another rival, Amy Klobuchar, into contention in Iowa.Throughout all this, Mr. Sanders has gone relatively unscathed. His position in the polls -- just behind the front-runners, without obvious momentum -- gave his opponents no incentive to attack. And he received less scrutiny from the news media than he might have otherwise. His supporters were the likeliest to say they had made up their minds, offering even less reason for a rival campaign to attack him. Yet Mr. Sanders outraised all of his opponents, giving him the resources to push ahead while squabbles -- such as between Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg -- weakened others.These are the kinds of conditions that often contribute to late movement in primary contests and, indeed, Mr. Sanders has steadily risen in national and early state polls.His lead in the Ann Selzer/Des Moines Register/CNN poll nearly two weeks ago marked the moment when these conditions no longer clearly held. But his opponents largely declined to attack Mr. Sanders at the most recent debate. Ms. Warren's allegation that Mr. Sanders told her that she couldn't win the general election because she was a woman was not pursued vigorously at the debate or thereafter.With just under two weeks to go until the Iowa caucuses, it remains unclear whether Mr. Sanders or anyone else has a meaningful lead in the state. But Mr. Sanders faces fewer obstacles than he did in 2016. Hillary Clinton was a juggernaut who consistently held around 50 percent support in national polls throughout the race and an overwhelming lead among black voters.This time, it's conceivable that Mr. Sanders will face a split field after Iowa and New Hampshire, with as many as four rivals positioned to claim a strong showing in the two early states and with Mr. Bloomberg spending hundreds of millions of dollars on his own behalf.Mr. Sanders's position among nonwhite voters is also better today than it was in 2016. Polls suggest he is leading among Hispanic voters, who will play a meaningful role in Texas and California on Super Tuesday.He still trails Mr. Biden among black voters, but he is far more competitive among them than he was four years ago. A recent Washington Post/Ipsos poll gave Mr. Biden a lead of 48 percent to 20 percent lead among black voters, less than Mrs. Clinton's commanding 80-20 advantage.The Sanders gains are driven by strength among younger black voters, who back him by 12 points. Over all, his weakness among black voters is an obstacle, but not an insurmountable one.At this point, his main weakness is arguably among white voters, at least as judged against his performance in 2016 or the performances of prior outsider, ideologically consistent candidates. In 2016, he won New Hampshire by a wide margin and essentially fought Mrs. Clinton to a draw in Iowa while badly trailing in national polls.Of course, he could still lose both states. But if he wins, he will face far greater scrutiny. As Ms. Warren can attest, front-runner status brings a different kind of treatment from the news media and rival campaigns, which can halt or reverse a candidate's gains. The breadth of the opposition to Mr. Sanders among Democratic elites increases the likelihood of a vigorous attempt to halt his momentum.There is no reason to assume that he can build a winning coalition in the face of heightened scrutiny or a concerted effort to stop his campaign, even if he wins Iowa.But as the recent polling shows, there's also no reason to assume he can't.PhotographBernie Sanders during a rally Saturday in Manchester, N.H., a state where he remains well positioned, giving him a chance to sweep voting there and in Iowa.

| Jump to first hitThe former governor of Massachusetts carried out a long-shot primary campaign focused on appealing to moderate Republicans.WASHINGTON -- A day after President Trump officially racked up enough delegates to become the presumptive 2020 Republican nominee for president, former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, his last Republican challenger, ended his campaign.""The reason that people all over the world look to the United States for leadership, as they do, is our dedication to the rule of law under our Constitution,"" Mr. Weld said in a statement announcing the suspension of his campaign. He did not address Mr. Trump by name, but he added that if a president does not observe the rule of law, ""we will truly have lost our compass.""Mr. Weld's announcement came in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, and aides said he planned to make no appearances or conduct any interviews because he did not want to distract from coverage of the crisis.Brad Parscale, the president's campaign manager, on Tuesday night credited Mr. Trump's victory in the primary to ""his response to the coronavirus and a ""broad and strong economy,"" even as markets plunged and a global recession appeared inevitable.Mr. Weld, whose long-shot campaign had been based on appealing to moderate voters in New Hampshire who might support a libertarian in favor of abortion rights and legalized marijuana, held out even after attracting just 9.1 percent of the vote in that state, under the double-digit threshold to win any delegates. His decision to stay in the race was more about providing voters who dislike Mr. Trump with a place to cast a protest vote, rather than harboring any realistic hope of wrestling the nomination from the president.Mr. Weld was the first Republican to announce a challenge to Mr. Trump, in February 2019, and the last to drop out. The field of contenders at one point included former Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina and former Representative Joe Walsh of Illinois.""I applaud Bill Weld for doing this for the right reasons in the first place and hanging in there as long as he could,"" said Sarah Longwell, a Republican strategist who has been working to oppose Mr. Trump from within the party. ""It was important that somebody stood up and made the case against Trump.""Lucy Caldwell, who served as an adviser to Mr. Walsh, said, ""There's no doubt in my mind that Bill Weld, Joe Walsh and Mark Sanford will be remembered as having been on the right side of history when so few Republicans were.""Intraparty challenges against an incumbent president always face long odds. But the collective failure to launch by any Republican candidate underscored Mr. Trump's grip on the party, with his approval rating among Republicans remaining in the high 80s.Mr. Trump's re-election campaign consistently dismissed all three candidates as unserious, even as it meticulously worked with state parties behind the scenes to shut down primaries and deprive any other candidate of oxygen. When Mr. Trump did acknowledge them on Twitter, he referred to them disparagingly as ""the Three Stooges.""The small ""Never Trump"" movement of Republicans, meanwhile, has recently been more focused on supporting the Democratic candidacy of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and getting center-right voters registered in the Democratic primary election.PhotographFormer Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts staked his hopes on New Hampshire but failed to crack double digits there.

| Jump to first hitBernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar hit the 2020 campaign trail on Saturday during a break in the impeachment trial.MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa -- Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar dashed back to Iowa for a frenzied burst of campaigning on Saturday after a week in which they were confined to Washington for the impeachment trial of President Trump.Their appearances took place amid signs of growing strength in Mr. Sanders's candidacy, particularly a New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers released Saturday that showed him leading the field in Iowa. Given the fears of some Democrats that he could be portrayed as too far to the left to defeat Mr. Trump, his show of strength is likely to alarm some of his detractors as much as it pleases his own supporters coming so close to the Feb. 3 caucuses.Pete Buttigieg's campaign sent a fund-raising email on Saturday warning that ""Bernie Sanders could be the nominee of our party,"" followed by another email that cast doubt on Mr. Sanders's ability to beat Mr. Trump. And former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in a tweet took an implicit jab at Mr. Sanders over his campaign's promotion of an endorsement from Joe Rogan, the popular podcast host who has been criticized for comments he has made on race and about transgender people.Mr. Sanders, sounding a bit congested, made it to Iowa in time to attend a rally in Marshalltown with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and the filmmaker Michael Moore.He made no mention of his poll showing, but he didn't have to.""We're taking on the establishment, and the establishment is getting a little bit nervous,"" he told a modest but enthusiastic crowd.But he did take a swipe at the impeachment trial for scrambling his campaign plans.""As you well know, we have had to radically change our schedule in the last week -- kind of toss it into the garbage can and begin anew,"" he said. ""But we are going to be back here in Iowa in the next week every moment that we possibly can.""Mr. Sanders plans to hold events across the northwestern part of Iowa on Sunday before the trial resumes on Monday.Before he settled into his familiar talking points, Mr. Sanders also issued something of a warning, suggesting he was aware of the renewed attacks from rivals as he continued to display strength in Iowa and other early voting states.""In the last week of a campaign, a lot of stuff is going to be thrown around -- that's what happens in campaigns,"" he said. ""But I would hope that this state, New Hampshire and the country does not lose focus on what are the most important issues.""The day also brought good news for Ms. Warren, who returned to Iowa for the first time since the impeachment trial with a town-hall-style event at a middle school in Muscatine. ""Good not to be in Washington,"" she told reporters.She was working her way through her selfie picture line when the news broke that she had received the coveted endorsement of The Des Moines Register. In other endorsements Saturday, The New Hampshire Union Leader backed Ms. Klobuchar, and The Sioux City Journal in Iowa gave its support to Mr. Biden.Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who has struggled to gain traction in the primary race and has also been tethered to Washington because of the impeachment trial, traveled to New Hampshire on Saturday and planned to campaign there through the weekend.Two other leading contenders, Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, were not stuck in Washington this past week. Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., arrived in Iowa for the beginning of a 10-day sprint across the state before the caucuses. His first stop was a town-hall-style event before about 300 people inside of an old opera house in Fort Dodge.Mr. Buttigieg began his remarks by reminding the audience that, after 13 months of candidate events, they were in ""the final days"" of the race in which he has outlasted a handful of adversaries who began the race better-known and better financed than the mayor of South Bend.After a town-hall-style event in Storm Lake, he was asked about his campaign's reference to Mr. Sanders in one of the fund-raising emails as ""a risk we can't take.""""I believe that we should be very mindful that one of the worst risks we can take at a time like this is to recycle the same Washington-style political warfare that brought us to this point,"" he said. ""If we believe it's important to win, then the best thing we can do is put forward a candidate who offers something new, something different and something that will break us through the dynamics that have gotten us into this era that's just got to change.""Mr. Biden flew to Iowa after beginning his day with an event in Salem, N.H. Speaking in an elementary school gym, Mr. Biden alluded to the impeachment trial that is playing out in Washington and reminded the crowd that he had come under relentless attack from Mr. Trump.""My guess if you go back and turn your TV on today, you're going to find the name 'Biden' mentioned many, many, many times,"" Mr. Biden said. ""I wonder why he doesn't want to run against me.""Mr. Biden also received a boost on Saturday when he picked up the endorsement of Representative Cindy Axne of Iowa, a freshman Democrat who unseated a Republican incumbent.""He is who I believe is the one sure bet to beat Donald Trump,"" Ms. Axne said in an interview.Ms. Axne hails from the kind of swing district that was key to the party's takeover of the House in the 2018 midterm elections, and will be crucial to its continued control of the chamber.Ms. Axne appeared with Mr. Biden on Saturday night at an event in her district in Ankeny, a suburb of Des Moines.""It's not just that Joe's been there, and he's been in the Situation Room,"" she told the crowd in Ankeny. ""We also need somebody who's running on a message of hope, a message of unification of this country.""Mr. Biden has now been endorsed by two of Iowa's three Democrats in Congress. Representative Abby Finkenauer, another freshman who flipped a Republican-held seat in 2018, endorsed him in early January. The state's other House Democrat, Representative Dave Loebsack, has endorsed Mr. Buttigieg.Ms. Axne's district includes Iowa's most populous city, Des Moines, and covers the southwestern corner of the state. President Barack Obama won the district in 2012, but Mr. Trump carried it in 2016. Two years later, in the midterm elections, Ms. Axne unseated a two-term Republican, David Young.Ms. Axne said she believed that Mr. Biden would drive turnout in districts like hers, and emphasized the importance of protecting the Democratic majority in the House.She also nodded to what she suggested was Mr. Biden's broad appeal. ""I truly believe that there are Iowans that would have some difficulty with some of the positions by other people running in this party,"" she said.Sydney Ember reported from Marshalltown, and Thomas Kaplan from Salem, N.H. Shane Goldmacher contributed reporting from Muscatine, Iowa; Reid J. Epstein from Fort Dodge, Iowa; and Maggie Astor from Ankeny, Iowa.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont looks on as he is introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York during a campaign event on Saturday in Marshalltown, Iowa.

| Jump to first hitHollywood stars are making their way to Iowa and South Carolina. Will they change anyone’s mind?
SUMTER, S.C. — Bernice Harris was with her granddaughter Saturday afternoon when they heard a surprising rumor: Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was going to visit their city later that day, holding a rally at an African Methodist Episcopal Church.
But when Ms. Harris arrived at the church, Mt. Pisgah A.M.E., it became clear that there had been a mistake. Mr. Sanders was not in Sumter, but in Iowa. The event was a question-and-answer session, attended by only about 50 people. And playing the role of septuagenarian keynote was Danny Glover, the activist and actor perhaps best known, at least by the Sumter crowd, for the “Lethal Weapon” films.
“I thought Bernie Sanders would be here, and I wanted to hear him one-on-one,” said a confused Ms. Harris, 68, a caregiver.
“But you know what,” she said, looking on as Mr. Glover conducted a selfie line in front of a large campaign banner, “he represented Bernie well.”
As voting in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary inches closer by the day, candidates are increasingly sharing top billing with a wide array of stars, clearly aware that celebrities can often connect with audiences that the candidates themselves can’t reach..
In the last week, Judy Sheindlin, the retired family court judge better known as Judge Judy, opened for former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, joining him over the weekend as he stumped in Texas.
Martin Sheen, the actor who played a fictional president on the television drama “The West Wing,” announced at a recent climate rally that he was supporting Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. On Monday, the singer and actress Mandy Moore campaigned for former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg in the vitally important caucus state of Iowa. And on Tuesday, the comedian and actor Dave Chappelle endorsed the entrepreneur Andrew Yang and announced he would perform two shows in South Carolina later this month to benefit Mr. Yang’s campaign.
Over the weekend, Mr. Glover toured rural communities in South Carolina on behalf of Mr. Sanders, pitching black voters in Hartsville, Dillon and Mullins on his vision of a political revolution.
At times, he related to the audience, often made up of older black voters, in ways Mr. Sanders would find hard to replicate, referencing his upbringing in the A.M.E. church or his family’s roots picking cotton in the South. With Mr. Glover speaking, Mr. Sanders’s slogan of “not me, us” meant something different. It was targeted directly at black people.
At the stop in Sumter, Mr. Glover told a crowd that Mr. Sanders was the 2020 embodiment of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s political ideology.
“If Dr. King was with us today, at 90 years old last year, he would be voting for Bernie Sanders,” Mr. Glover said.
In a later interview, Mr. Glover questioned whether celebrities have extraordinary persuasive power.
“I honestly don’t know, but I don’t abdicate my responsibility as a citizen because I make movies and people like to go to my movies,” he said. “And there are other people supporting him I know — Mark Ruffalo, Susan Sarandon — we can’t wait to get together and campaign for Bernie.”
The 2020 candidates are all seeking political and celebrity endorsements, and proudly announcing them when they land, but the value of big-name fans has not yet seemed to translate into broader support.
Senator Kamala Harris of California, who had more endorsements from the Congressional Black Caucus than anyone in the Democratic field, was also a leading candidate on the Hollywood front. Mindy Kaling, the comedian and actress, put out a cooking video with Ms. Harris in November, just weeks before she dropped out of the race. Former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas had stars like Beyoncé and Frank Ocean in his corner during his 2018 challenge to Senator Ted Cruz. His presidential campaign lasted less than eight months.
In South Carolina, voters attended Mr. Glover’s stops for a variety of reasons. While there were some gawking fans, eager to see an actor whose career stretched back decades, the focus was undoubtedly political. Even in his introduction, Mr. Glover’s political activism got more attention than his film work.
Jannie Lathan, 69, attended the Hartsville event and said she viewed the event no differently than when any campaign comes to town: It was “an opportunity to get informed.” Sue Catanch, 74, was direct: She was planning to vote for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and seeing Mr. Glover did nothing to change that.
“Bernie Sanders isn’t a Democrat. He’s too liberal. And Joe Biden will beat Trump,” Ms. Catanch said flatly. “And Danny Glover did not really answer those questions.”
She decided against a photo with Mr. Glover — choosing instead to shake his hand — because the pictures were being taken in front of a “BERNIE 2020” banner.
Ms. Lathan said she understood the sentiment, and this election was too important to get caught up anything but the issues.
“We’re not about to fall for the okie-doke,” she said. “This is not about a popularity contest.”
An endorsement, more than anything, can send a signal. If high-impact ones from elected officials come with the added political benefit of volunteers or increased fund-raising, the best celebrity endorsements pull cultural weight. Campaigns package them for larger resonance, hoping for a viral online moment or an opportunity to drive more grass-roots donations.
When Ms. Warren earned the endorsement of the soccer star Megan Rapinoe, it came as the candidate was emerging as the only woman in the race’s top tier. In a phone call between the two, a video of which has nearly 2 million views on Ms. Rapinoe’s Twitter account, they discuss gender equity and allude to the ongoing fight for increased wages for the national women’s soccer team.
Critics say that because celebrities in music and film are overwhelmingly liberal, their endorsements create a bubble effect, in which the chattering cultural class is out of step with the electorate at large.
President Trump, who spent years as a pop culture icon himself, was mostly shunned by the Hollywood class during his 2016 run. He won anyway.
In the Democratic primary, Mr. Biden has opted for political and celebrity surrogates whose names largely reflect an earlier era, including John Kerry, the former Democratic nominee, and the Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan. He remains the primary’s front-runner.
But Mr. Sanders, in particular, continues to hold a unique cultural footprint, and the celebrity endorsements to match it. He is helped by sky-high name recognition, off the back of his insurgent presidential run in 2016. His support among young voters and progressives also plays out in the Hollywood sphere — he tweeted photos with the singer Ariana Grande, 26, and released an endorsement video with Emily Ratajkowski, 28, an actress and model.
Cardi B, 27, the Bronx-born rapper, interviewed Mr. Sanders in a video released this summer.
“Don’t you ever feel, like, scared that these people that run drug companies and schools, you know it’s all a business, and it’s like, are you scared that you will get so many powerful people upset?” she asked.
“Cardi, that’s what I’ve been doing my whole life,” Mr. Sanders replied.
In South Carolina, Mary Williams, 75, a retired educator from Sumter, said she had heard Mr. Sanders was popular with young voters. But she added that celebrities, and even black celebrities, would not be able to convince her to blindly back a particular candidate.
“Of course it’s nice to see and meet him,” Ms. Williams said of Mr. Glover. “But hey — I’m a star myself.”

| Jump to first hitMost of the leading Democratic presidential hopefuls took part in speeches, a march and a rally in the state capital, before heading to an Iowa forum focused on minority communities.COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Several Democratic presidential candidates briefly put aside their recent sparring on Monday and marched arm in arm through the streets of South Carolina's capital to honor the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., whom they later invoked in speeches about America's past and future that were rich with election-year overtones.As the six-block march began from the Zion Baptist Church to the State House, where a Confederate flag once flew over the dome, Senator Bernie Sanders looped an arm through Senator Elizabeth Warren's elbow, as the two joined other candidates in singing ""We Shall Overcome"" for part of the trip. Representative Tulsi Gabbard and Senator Amy Klobuchar each locked elbows with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as well.The sight of Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren shoulder to shoulder -- after a week in which they argued over their recollections of a private conversation about whether a woman could win the presidency -- delighted Lisa Ray Clarkson, a retired teacher from Norfolk, Va., who was at the march.""That means they have gotten over their differences and the Democratic Party is reuniting,"" Ms. Clarkson said as she walked alongside the procession to the State House, where several thousand people converged.It was a hopeful sentiment for a Democratic field that has become noticeably more fractious in the final weeks before the Feb. 3 caucuses in Iowa, where Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., are bunched tightly in polls and campaigned on Monday afternoon.In addition to the Warren-Sanders argument, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have been criticizing each other's records, with Mr. Sanders trying to cut into Mr. Biden's support among older voters and black voters by portraying the former vice president as open to cuts in Social Security. Mr. Biden has denied that and demanded an apology from Mr. Sanders, who has stood firm.On Monday in Iowa, Mr. Biden, who over the course of his career has at times supported Social Security freezes, vowed, ""There will be no compromise on cutting Medicare or Social Security.""Tensions also flared on Monday after the Sanders campaign circulated an op-ed written by Zephyr Teachout, an associate professor at Fordham Law School and a former New York political candidate, that accused Mr. Biden of having a ""big corruption problem."" Ron Klain, a top Biden adviser, responded on Twitter: ""There are a lot of legitimate issues to debate in 2020. But the only two campaigns ever to call @Joebiden ""corrupt"" are Trump and Sanders. What does that tell you?""Mr. Sanders took the step of apologizing to Mr. Biden in an interview with CBS News. ""It is absolutely not my view that Joe is corrupt in any way. And I'm sorry that that op-ed appeared,"" Mr. Sanders said in the interview, which went online Monday night. Ms. Teachout is a longtime Sanders supporter whom the Vermont senator backed in a congressional race in 2016.Mr. Biden suggested he had accepted Mr. Sanders's apology, writing on Twitter: ""Thanks for acknowledging this, Bernie. These kinds of attacks have no place in this primary. Let's all keep our focus on making Donald Trump a one-term president.""The four leading candidates in the polls are competing hard in South Carolina, particularly for support from black voters, who will make up a majority of the Democratic primary vote in the state on Feb. 29. Mr. Biden has a strong lead in South Carolina polls and is widely favored among black voters. None of his rivals took him on frontally on Monday, but instead sought to make the case to African-Americans and others in South Carolina about how the next president could benefit their interests.Mr. Sanders, addressing the enthusiastic crowd on a cold day at the State House, reminded onlookers of Dr. King's legacy of courage and opposition to the Vietnam War, which the 78-year-old Vermont senator also denounced. While Mr. Sanders has been trying to draw a contrast with Mr. Biden on their records on military action, he focused more on Monday on President Trump.""If we do not allow Trump and his friends to divide us up by the color of our skin, or where we were born, or our sexual orientation or religion, if we stand together there is nothing we cannot accomplish in the fight for racial justice, social justice,"" Mr. Sanders said.Ms. Klobuchar, of Minnesota, invoked Dr. King's comment that Americans are ""all tied in a single garment of destiny -- what affects one directly affects all indirectly,"" and said that rising hatred across the nation would ultimately wound everyone.""It coarsens our civic life. You can see it in the senseless racist shooting of worshipers in Charleston, you can see it in that rabbi's home and stabbing, you see it in that bombing of the mosque in Minnesota, you see it at the riot in Charlottesville,"" she said.Addressing Mr. Trump directly over his comment in 2017 that ""both sides"" were to blame for the violence in Charlottesville that killed Heather Heyer, who was protesting a white supremacist rally there, Ms. Klobuchar said: ""And no, there are not many sides to blame, Mr. President, when one side is the Ku Klux Klan. There is only one side, and that is the American side. That is it. That is all.""Before the march and State House speeches, several candidates told a breakfast gathering of predominantly black voters that they were committed to advancing Dr. King's legacy and that defeating Mr. Trump in November was a crucial step toward that goal.""My campaign revolves around the image of the first day that the sun comes up over South Carolina and our country and Donald Trump is no longer the president of the United States,"" Mr. Buttigieg said at the Columbia Urban League's annual King breakfast. ""I raise the image of that sunrise because it will bring forth the burning question Dr. King posed in the summer of 1967: Where do we go from here?""""Because on that day our country will be even more polarized and torn up than it is now,"" said Mr. Buttigieg, who is one of the top-polling candidates in Iowa but is struggling in South Carolina and among black voters. He urged action to combat disparate treatment by race in the health care system and to address environmental pollution disproportionately affecting African-Americans, who make up a majority of the Democratic primary electorate in the state.Former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, the only black candidate still in the Democratic field, took a different tack, telling the breakfast audience, ""If we are really going to deliver a future for our children and grandchildren consistent with the values of equality, opportunity and fair play, to which Dr. King and the Urban League served as examples, then we're going to have to start rejecting false choices.""""Prosperity and justice can live alongside each other,"" he said. ""The notion that you have to hate business to be a social justice warrior or hate police to believe black lives matter are ridiculous.""After the South Carolina events, most of the candidates flew quickly to Iowa to attend the 2020 Iowa Brown & Black Democratic Presidential Forum on Monday afternoon.Mr. Biden, who repeatedly noted his commanding lead in polls with African-American voters over all, objected when moderators at the event noted Mr. Sanders's strength with younger black voters. He also spoke about his heartfelt connection to black Americans, while acknowledging that he could not ""fully understand"" their experience.""I know enough to know and see the pain, you can see the pain in people's eyes,"" he said. ""I'm not saying, 'I am black.' But I want to tell you something. I have spent my whole career with the black community.""""They know me,"" he said firmly. ""They know where my heart is. And they know what I've done.""Mr. Buttigieg was pressed about his mayoral record in South Bend, specifically regarding his decision to fire a black police chief and his handling of racial divisions within the department. At times, the questioning even seemed contentious, as Mr. Buttigieg refused to go into detail about specific personnel decisions.Mr. Buttigieg acknowledged fault on one point: the decrease in the number of black police officers during his tenure.""This is an area where I've admitted it's not where I wanted to be,"" he said.Mr. Sanders faced a question about the president's wall on the southern border, and whether it would be a powerful statement if the existing barrier were taken down. ""I don't know, maybe the answer is yes,"" he said, adding that if it cost ""billions of dollars to tear it down, maybe the money would be better spent on child care in this country.""Mr. Sanders also spoke about his immigration plans, which include a moratorium on deportations, and said there could be exceptions to the moratorium if an undocumented immigrant were convicted of a ""terrible, terrible"" crime.But he noted that his immigration stance could leave him open to attack in a general election. ""This is an issue, of course, something Trump will jump all over,"" he said.The forum ended on a lighter note when Ms. Klobuchar was asked about the last time she had smoked marijuana.""Uh, you'd have to go back to college days,"" she said to laughter.Reporting was contributed by Jonathan Martin from Columbia, S.C., Lisa Lerer from Washington, and Katie Glueck, Jennifer Medina and Astead W. Herndon from Des Moines.PhotographDemocratic presidential candidates marched arm in arm during a Martin Luther King Jr. Day event in Columbia, S.C., on Monday.

| Jump to first hitHollywood stars are making their way to Iowa and South Carolina. Will they change anyone's mind?SUMTER, S.C. -- Bernice Harris was with her granddaughter Saturday afternoon when they heard a surprising rumor: Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was going to visit their city later that day, holding a rally at an African Methodist Episcopal Church.But when Ms. Harris arrived at the church, Mt. Pisgah A.M.E., it became clear that there had been a mistake. Mr. Sanders was not in Sumter, but in Iowa. The event was a question-and-answer session, attended by only about 50 people. And playing the role of septuagenarian keynote was Danny Glover, the activist and actor perhaps best known, at least by the Sumter crowd, for the ""Lethal Weapon"" films.""I thought Bernie Sanders would be here, and I wanted to hear him one-on-one,"" said a confused Ms. Harris, a 68-year-old caregiver.""But you know what,"" she said, looking on as Mr. Glover conducted a selfie line in front of a large campaign banner, ""he represented Bernie well.""As voting in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary inches closer by the day, candidates are increasingly sharing top billing with a wide array of stars, clearly aware that celebrities can often connect with audiences that the candidates themselves can't reach..In the last week, Judy Sheindlin, the retired family court judge better known as Judge Judy, opened for former Mayor Michael R.

| Jump to first hitAs the 2020 candidates vie for support in South Carolina, Mr. Steyer has been criticized for hiring black lawmakers or their companies. Records show the Sanders campaign has done the same.COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Last April, just as the 2020 presidential campaign was getting underway, Senator Bernie Sanders trumpeted a breakthrough in his campaign's quest for black voters' support in South Carolina.Mr. Sanders was honored to have been endorsed for the Democratic nomination by seven black members of the South Carolina legislature, he announced in a tweet.One of the lawmakers, records show, owned a company that was already being paid by the Sanders campaign. Another would soon be added to the payroll as a vendor.By the end of 2019, consulting companies operated by the two lawmakers, Representative Wendell Gilliard of Charleston and Representative Terry Alexander of Florence, had collected a combined total of almost $150,000 from Mr. Sanders's presidential effort, according to federal campaign records.Campaigns regularly enter into financial dealings with companies and business owners as they build out operations in primary states; they also seek the endorsements of popular lawmakers of all races, some of whom also work in public relations, consulting or similar fields where payments can be routed.This practice takes place in both political parties and, while many leaders find it unseemly, it continues unabated.Even legal and fully disclosed payments, however, can raise questions about whether endorsements are heartfelt or driven by financial considerations.That dynamic is evident in South Carolina, where presidential candidates will compete in the primary Feb. 29, the first test in a Southern state. Black voters may make up more than 60 percent of the Democratic electorate there.Payments to endorsers in the state became an issue last week when a supporter of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. made thinly veiled suggestions that a rival candidate, Tom Steyer, had traded cash for endorsements by making payments to State Representative Jerry Govan, the head of the South Carolina Legislative Black Caucus.Federal Election Commission records showed that the Steyer campaign had paid Mr. Govan more than $40,000 since September, when Mr. Govan endorsed Mr. Steyer. The payments to a company associated with Mr. Govan, Govan Agency L.L.C., were for ""community building services.""The disclosures about Mr. Steyer's payments also prompted a disdainful tweet from Bakari Sellers, a former state legislator and one of the state's most sought-after surrogates. ""Confused, so we're OK with Steyer paying $10K a month for endorsements?"" Mr. Sellers wrote on Friday, adding, ""Presidential candidates shouldn't be paying legislators for their endorsements.""Mr. Steyer, however, was hardly chastened: On Wednesday his campaign said he had hired Gilda Cobb-Hunter, the longest-serving member of South Carolina's House and an influential African-American leader who rarely endorses in presidential races. Ms. Cobb-Hunter will be a senior adviser to the campaign, a move that was first reported by The Associated Press.A longtime ethics advocate in South Carolina, John Crangle, questioned whether such arrangements posed a real problem, noting that such work does not influence bills pending before the legislature and is not prohibited by state law. Mr. Crangle is a lobbyist for the South Carolina Progressive Caucus, which does not endorse candidates.""If legislators were banned from taking consulting fees or legal retainers, I would guess that 75 percent would resign,"" Mr. Crangle said.Ms. Cobb-Hunter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The arrangements by Mr. Sanders's campaign -- as well as recent history -- reveal that such consulting deals are fairly commonplace in South Carolina.In 2007, Hillary Clinton defended her South Carolina presidential campaign against allegations of endorsement-buying after her campaign entered a $10,000-a-month consulting contract with state Senator Darrell Jackson, a Columbia lawmaker and pastor who also operated a consulting company.""Senator Jackson was someone who was involved in my husband's campaigns,"" Mrs. Clinton said at the time. ""He was someone we turned to for political advice and counsel and I'm proud to have him on my team.""At times the practice can cross legal boundaries: A former Iowa state senator was sent to prison in 2017 after a federal investigation revealed he had taken more than $70,000 from Ron Paul's presidential campaign and that the money had been paid to an audio-visual production company to hide the payment from public view. Three former aides to Mr. Paul were also convicted of public corruption charges.Mr. Sanders's campaign said it was pleased with its connection to the two South Carolina lawmakers. ""We're proud that two leaders who endorsed in 2016 are not only supporting the senator again in 2020 but also working hard to help us win,"" said a statement issued on behalf of the campaign by Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator and a campaign co-chair.Several current and former black elected officials expressed concern, though, that payments to officials who also endorse candidates, however legal, could create the impression that their support can be bought.""I'm 75 years of age, and all my life you've had candidates come into the predominantly black community and dropping out a few dollars or a lot of dollars to a few people,"" said Bernice Scott, a former member of the Richland County, S.C., council who supports Mr. Biden. ""Call it consulting or whatever they want to call it, I wouldn't do it. It puts a bad taste in everybody's mouth.""Mr. Steyer, a billionaire who is largely self-funding his campaign, has spent lavishly in South Carolina on advertising and staff and has also retained Harold Mitchell, an environmental activist and former state senator from Spartanburg who starred in an ad for Mr. Steyer, endorsing the former hedge fund manager.The payments by Mr. Steyer to Mr. Govan prompted a series of charges and countercharges in South Carolina last week. State Senator Dick Harpootlian, a longtime Biden supporter, called Mr. Steyer ""Mr. Moneybags"" in a tweet last week, hinting that the arrangement with Mr. Govan was a cash-for-endorsement trade-off and alleging that Mr. Govan had previously intended to support Mr. Biden.Mr. Govan, of Orangeburg, accused Mr. Harpootlian of ""throwing mud,"" and so did members of the black caucus, who organized an impromptu news conference at the South Carolina State House to demand that the Biden campaign disavow Mr. Harpootlian's statement.Extending the controversy, Mr. Steyer raised the issue during the Democratic primary debate on Friday night. ""Joe, I'm asking you to come with me and the legislative black caucus and disavow Dick Harpootlian and what he had to say,"" Mr. Steyer said. ""It was wrong. And I'm asking you to join us. Be on the right side.""Mr. Biden retorted: ""I'm asking you to join me and join in the support I have from the overwhelming number of the members of the black caucus. I have more support in South Carolina in the black caucus and the black community than anyone else, double what you have or what anyone else has.""Mr. Sanders interjected: ""I don't think that's quite right.""In its statement, the Sanders campaign emphasized its efforts to reach out to black voters in South Carolina by hiring black staff members, holding events in black-owned venues and paying black vendors, such as caterers.Payments by the Sanders campaign to the two lawmakers were contained in 2019 campaign records filed with the Federal Election Commission. They show that Mr. Sanders's campaign began paying TA Network, Mr. Alexander's company, for political consulting in the second quarter of last year, with total payments of $90,000 for the year.""I've been an elected official 28 years and I've worked on state, local and federal campaigns for those 28 years,"" said Mr. Alexander, whose primary job is as pastor of Wayside Chapel Baptist Church in Florence. He added that elected officials in South Carolina, white and black, had been performing such consulting work for a long time.""It becomes an issue now, questionable, when black folks are part of the game,"" he said.The records show that Mr. Sanders's campaign also hired WGG Consulting early last year for ""event planning"" and ""consulting/political strategy,"" with disbursements to WGG reaching $56,500 by year's end.WGG is operated by Mr. Gilliard, a former union activist who said he had been a passionate supporter of Mr. Sanders since Mr. Sanders endorsed Jesse Jackson for president.""As a young black man back in the 1980s, I read that a white man from a predominantly white state like Vermont had actually endorsed a black man for president,"" Mr. Gilliard said, adding that his consulting agreement with Mr. Sanders was above board.""No more pat on the back and given a bale of cotton and saying thanks for your services. Those days are gone,"" Mr. Gilliard said.Stephanie Saul reported from Columbia, and Jonathan Martin from Manchester, N.H.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders, left, and Tom Steyer, below left, at events in Columbia, S.C.

I'm Nick Corasaniti, your host on Tuesdays for our coverage of all things media and messaging, writing to you from Las Vegas , where the leading Democratic presidential candidates are set to debate tomorrow night.Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.To most supporters of Pete Buttigieg, the tweet probably seemed innocuous: A senior adviser to Mr. Buttigieg, Michael Halle, simply noted that the candidate's military record would be an asset in Nevada.But critics say Mr. Halle's tweet also served as a Bat Signal to VoteVets, the super PAC supporting Mr. Buttigieg's candidacy, with an unmistakable directive: Run ads in Nevada on this issue.""Pete's military experience and closing message from Iowa work everywhere especially in Nevada where it's critical they see this on the air through the caucus,"" Mr. Halle wrote on Feb. 5.The Federal Election Commission prohibits political campaigns from coordinating activities with outside groups -- the super PACs, political nonprofits and dark-money groups that can collect unlimited contributions. But campaigns have been exploiting a loophole for years by using public digital communications, largely on social media platforms, to get around the regulations.The argument is that if a campaign says or posts something in public, for everyone to see, and a super PAC just happens to also see it and take action, then it's fair game. Whether or not VoteVets acted on Mr. Halle's message, it certainly carried out his wishes: The group cut an ad highlighting Mr. Buttigieg's military service within about a week of the tweet and has spent roughly $300,000 to keep it on the air in Nevada over the past week.But a campaign finance watchdog group filed a complaint on Tuesday, alleging that Mr. Halle's tweet ran afoul of federal regulations. Though the F.E.C. allows super PACs to use ""publicly available"" information to create ads, the complaint said the agency did not allow ads to be created and distributed at the ""request or suggestion"" of a candidate or his agent.""It was the Buttigieg campaign's obvious and detailed request for super PAC support here that crossed the legal line,"" said Brendan Fischer, the director of the federal reform program at the Campaign Legal Center, the watchdog group that filed the complaint.VoteVets has said it does not coordinate advertising with the Buttigieg campaign, and the Buttigieg campaign did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. But Chris Meagher, a campaign spokesman, issued a statement on the same day Mr. Halle sent his tweet that acknowledged that the campaign welcomed VoteVets advertising on the issue.""Pete is the only candidate who isn't a millionaire or billionaire,"" Mr. Meagher said at the time. ""And if the largest progressive veterans group wants to help spread the word about his service, we welcome it.""Mr. Fischer said the Buttigieg campaign had erased plausible deniability. ""They also effectively acknowledged that the request and suggestion was directly tied to VoteVets,"" Mr. Fischer said. ""I think that's what sets this apart.""The dust-up is yet another example of the written-on-the-fly rules that govern digital campaigning, particularly when it comes to the actions of outside groups.Most of this kind of public coordination has involved the expensive task of television advertising. Campaigns have increasingly been dumping extensive footage of campaign rallies or old biographical videos on their YouTube pages. Super PACs or other groups can then download the footage, cut their own ads and use their own money to put them on the air, saving campaigns millions of dollars.This has occasionally led to some humorous viewing. In 2014, the campaign of Senator Mitch McConnell dropped nearly two and a half minutes of footage of the senator signing papers, sitting on a couch with his wife, and giving awkward smirks at the camera (which spawned a meme known as #McConnelling).In 2016, the presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz posted nearly 15 hours of footage to YouTube, including outtakes and off-camera coaching from the candidate to his mother. Viewed in a vacuum, it appeared to be largely worthless bloopers. To a super PAC, it was endless footage.Some campaigns have taken public coordination with their super PACs to the extremes. Carly Fiorina, a Republican candidate for president in 2016, relied on her super PAC to stage events, provide signage and staff the sign-up table, on top of advertising.Under F.E.C. rules, Ms. Fiorina's super PAC could not call the campaign headquarters for a future schedule. So Ms. Fiorina's campaign created a public Google calendar, which it updated weeks into the future, showing the events she had planned.Even the super PAC's name, Carly for America, was itself an evasion of an F.E.C. regulation that prohibits super PACs from using a candidate's name as part of their own. But the group claimed ""Carly"" was merely an acronym for Conservative, Authentic, Responsive Leadership for You.The F.E.C. hasn't shown an eagerness to enforce many campaign finance laws for the past decade, and it has lacked a quorum of commissioners since September. The Campaign Legal Center's complaint is unlikely to be resolved for at least two to three years, Mr. Fischer said.So, with less than five days to go before caucus day, the $290,000 in additional ad reservations that VoteVets has in Nevada is likely to remain unchanged.Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We'll try to answer it. Have a comment? We're all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com .Also, for any of our readers who have a super PAC: My culinary experience and closing appetite from Iowa work everywhere, especially in Nevada, where it's critical I eat at Tacos El Gordo repeatedly through the caucus.Ad of the week: A viral video worth millionsWe often consider something an ad only if it has money behind it. But sometimes a campaign-generated video can carry the weight of a political ad with no money behind it at all.Michael R. Bloomberg has already spent more money on a presidential campaign than anyone else in history, plowing $338.7 million into traditional media, according to Advertising Analytics, a tracking firm. (Former President Barack Obama spent $338.3 million in the 2012 campaign, the firm said.) And yet, this week his team found particular success with a video it posted for free online.The video, which catalogs vitriolic messages sent by some of Bernie Sanders's online supporters, has been viewed more than four million times on Twitter and generated a news cycle's worth of earned media coverage about the growing spat between the two candidates.The message: The Democratic candidates for president are rarely aggressive in their social media attacks on one another. Their supporters, however, can be a different story, and a subset of Mr. Sanders's online supporters has become notoriously known as ""Bernie Bros.""Mr. Bloomberg's campaign decided to attack them head-on in its first wholly negative assault on a Democratic rival for president. It ran a rapidly accelerating highlight reel of some of the threats and abusive comments doled out by a selection of Sanders supporters, and framed the Vermont senator as responsible for their actions. After a clip showing Mr. Sanders calling for ""civil discourse"" at Liberty University in 2015, the ad goes black, with just text on the screen, flipping from ""Really?"" to ""Really.""(Mr. Sanders has said that ""anybody making personal attacks against anybody else in my name is not part of our movement."")The takeaway: Though the online trolls supporting Mr. Sanders have been making waves for years, Mr. Bloomberg's video was posted to Twitter in the wake of reports that leaders of a powerful Nevada labor union were inundated with online abuse and harassment after they chose not to endorse a candidate in the caucuses there.Other candidates, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, soon weighed in, saying Mr. Sanders had to do more to rein in his online army. Mr. Sanders shot back at Mr. Bloomberg, saying at a rally in Nevada that Mr. Bloomberg was no different than President Trump when it came to using their personal fortunes to advance a ""corrupt political system."" But the topic of ""Bernie Bros"" was trending online and spiking in Google searches.Swipe right for low-dollar donationsCovering digital campaigning for years now, we've seen our fair share of creative fund-raising pitches.There are the sky-is-falling desperation emails, perhaps most egregiously used by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2014 (spawning the ""emails from the D.C.C.C."" meme).The heartfelt, downtrodden plea, like Joe Biden's text message that simply starts with ""Please?""The blunt email with nothing but a donate button, like this one from Cory Booker.And now, thanks to Tom Winter, we have the mock dating-profile pitch.Mr. Winter, who is a candidate for Montana's lone congressional seat, sent out an email with pictures from a supposed Tinder profile, featuring the candidate clutching two dogs and appearing shirtless. His interests included ""health care"" and ""talking policy,"" and he favored ""big mountains"" over ""big corporations.""The email, sent out on Valentine's Day, quickly garnered some viral attention.The campaign played coy on Tuesday, however, over how many supporters swiped right to donate. Mr. Winter's team would not say how much he had raised, but did note that the campaign saw a 300 percent spike in donations after the email was sent out.Thanks for reading.

| Jump to first hitFor some college students who support Mr. Sanders, leaving campus means more time to phone bank, and a captive, if skeptical, audience at home.With the country in crisis mode, Melat Eskender, 19, has assumed battle position: In her parents' living room making phone calls for Senator Bernie Sanders, with quarantine rations of Flamin' Hot Cheetos at her side.The coronavirus outbreak has scattered college students across the country. Thousands left their campuses to return to their childhood bedrooms, as universities have announced that they are moving to remote learning and recommending, or requiring, that students leave. For many, that can mean a wistful sense of time lost with friends and school rituals missed, not to mention cabin fever. But there's an upside, as Ms. Eskender put it: ""Being isolated in my home and not having classes, it gives me time to focus on this campaign.""Ms. Eskender, a Yale freshman from Columbus, Ohio, believes that the Covid-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on Mr. Sanders's strengths as a candidate, both in his health care-focused policy platform and leadership style. ""I don't see him as an authoritative leader, I see him as a healer,"" Ms. Eskender said. ""His policies and leadership are what the country need right now.""For many young Sanders supporters, recent weeks have brought a sense of angst and grief: Their preferred candidate's shot at the nomination has rapidly declined, as the country has been swept into a public health disaster. And the coronavirus pandemic has underscored their belief in Mr. Sanders's ""Medicare for all"" plan, just as his chance of election seems more elusive than ever. He is behind former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, who ended Tuesday with victories in Florida, Illinois and Arizona -- and overtures to the Sanders base in remarks over a livestream from his home in Delaware. ""Let me say especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you.""Many of those young voters, though, aren't so ready to move on.""It feels like everything is so dark and spiraling quickly for our country,"" said Kathe McCormick-Evans, 23, a Sanders supporter in Cambridge, Mass. ""Coronavirus feels really scary and uncertain and I was previously feeling a lot of hope around Bernie and the primaries. Seeing him fall in the polls is just another reminder that things are slowly falling apart.""Before the world was completely upended -- a.k.a., earlier this month -- Ms. McCormick-Evans defended Mr. Sanders's merits in a ""heated"" group chat with family and friends who supported Senator Elizabeth Warren, in the days leading up to the Massachusetts primary. She fended off accusations that supporting Mr. Sanders was sexist, and told her mom how excited she would be to live in a country led by a Democratic Socialist. Now the pandemic feels to her like proof of the country's leadership crisis, but the unease of the moment makes it hard to hold onto the hope she had just weeks ago, when she cast her ballot.It's a blow to the young people fueled for months by the sense of possibility they felt in his candidacy. But a belief in the underdog is something endemic to the Sanders base, and many are intent on transferring their anxieties into action.Ruth Geye, 21, a college student in New York, was disappointed to see her senior spring cut short when New York University announced on March 9 a move to remotely hold classes. But she quickly realized that going back to Shaker Heights, Ohio, meant closer proximity to family members she can enlist in campaign work for Mr. Sanders. ""My parents pride themselves on doing a lot of driving people to the polls, but given that won't be a thing, maybe I can channel that energy into making calls for Bernie,"" Ms. Geye said.For Ms. Geye, the pilgrimage home to her boomer parents was a reminder of the generational fissures that Mr. Sanders's campaign exposed. While she was able to persuade her mom to pledge support for Mr. Sanders in the now delayed Ohio primary, it took some convincing.Earlier in the primaries, they disagreed especially on the role of female representation. Ms. Geye's mother liked the idea of supporting ""a very smart woman"" like Ms. Warren, while Ms. Geye's view on gender was more straightforward: ""I truly don't care.""She wasn't impressed by Joe Biden's commitment to selecting a female vice president at Sunday's debate, the first since Ms. Warren dropped out of the race, nor deterred by Mr. Sanders' lack of a commitment.Like other young female Sanders supporters, voting for a woman doesn't feel pressing -- especially at a time of social, economic and now public health crisis.""Seeing yourself in political leaders only goes so far,"" Ms. Geye said. To ensure her mom's support for Mr. Sanders, she reached deep into her political arsenal: ""I told her the only way I could afford grandchildren was the world Bernie was working toward. So I may have leveraged grandchildren, but it worked.""That desperate times call for desperate measures is a view almost axiomatic to some Sanders supporters. And some feel that in upending work, school and economic routines, the coronavirus outbreak could make voters more sympathetic to Mr. Sanders's message of remaking government and a larger social safety net. Mr. Sanders made the point himself during Sunday night's debate, telling viewers that the pandemic exposes ""dysfunctionality"" in the country's health care system.Kirsten Gronlund, 24, who is in self-isolation in her East Village, New York City, apartment, said amid her fears about the coronavirus, she's also held on to hope that it could be a catalyst for ""sweeping, fundamental changes to American life."" The anxieties of quarantine make it challenging for her to focus on day-to-day work, she said, but more meaningful to talk to voters about a brighter vision for the country's future.""It's hard to focus on work when everything feels so apocalyptic,"" she said. ""It feels like we're so helpless watching world leaders scramble and flail. But something like organizing for real political change feels like an appropriate response.""The coronavirus quarantines could even offer Sanders phone-bankers a logistical boost. Shivam Shukla, 20, a student at University of South Florida, said he thinks people might be more willing to answer his calls for Sanders and engage rather than hanging up immediately, since many are home and lacking social interaction.Mr. Shukla realizes that the weeks ahead will be rocky for the Sanders campaign, but he's known since the start that the campaign would be an uphill battle. ""It was always going to be a tough ride, but if anytime now is the time to pitch health care for all,"" he said. So he's stocked up on M&M packets and decked out his parents' Tampa home with cutouts of Mr. Sanders. ""My bedroom looks kind of like a campaign office,"" he said.Some young Sanders supporters say they're already seeing the effects of their quarantine campaigns. Katelin Penner, 19, a sophomore at Wesleyan, moved back in with her parents in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, for the remainder of the semester. Since returning home she has been phone-banking for Mr. Sanders from her bedroom, but she's living in a house divided; her parents and sister support Mr. Biden. For months, she's argued with them over policy and electability to no avail -- until last weekend.Watching the news on coronavirus in her living room, Ms. Penner's mother turned to her and said she was beginning to see the appeal of Medicare for all.""I think coronavirus might make it a more palatable idea,"" Ms. Penner said. And fortunately, she added, she has more than a month left at home before the New York primaries.PhotographOn March 2, supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders gathered in Salt Lake City. From now on, they must band together online.

| Jump to first hitSupporters of the former vice president say he can win back union members who rejected Hillary Clinton. But he must overcome some hard feelings first.On the campaign trail, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has highlighted the first two years of the Obama administration as a time when he helped enact sweeping legislation to widen access to health care and revive the economy, accomplishments most Democrats revere.But to many union officials, those years were a disappointment -- a time when the administration failed to pass a labor rights bill that was their top priority and imposed a tax that would affect many union members' health plans. And they partly blame Mr. Biden.""They were in the driver's seat for the first two years, and what did they get done from a labor perspective?"" said Chris Laursen, the president of a United Automobile Workers local in Ottumwa, Iowa, with nearly 600 members. ""Joe Biden is complete status quo.""Since Mr. Biden began his third campaign for the presidency last April, his supporters have portrayed him as the Democrat best positioned to win back union members who deserted the party in 2016 in crucial industrial states.There is some basis for that claim. Mr. Biden, who has longstanding ties to many labor leaders, quickly gained an endorsement from the politically powerful firefighters' union, and just won an endorsement from the ironworkers' union. Polls frequently show him leading other Democratic candidates in battleground-state matchups against President Trump.But for many labor voters -- even white, blue-collar union members whose votes skewed toward Mr. Trump -- the reaction to the former vice president has been more mixed. They frequently cite his policy centrism, which many associate with his time in President Barack Obama's White House.A mid-January poll by SurveyUSA showed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont surging to within three points of Mr. Biden among union households nationally. The combined support of Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has generally outpaced Mr. Biden's among union households since August.The Biden campaign declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Mr. Obama. A campaign surrogate, former Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis, called Mr. Biden ""a champion for organized labor"" and said, ""It's easy to take more extreme positions on issues when no one holds you accountable for actually enacting them.""The reservations of union members could be a bigger problem for Mr. Biden than they were for Hillary Clinton during her 2016 Democratic race against Mr. Sanders. Some large unions, including the American Federation of Teachers, endorsed Mrs. Clinton, though many members later supported Mr. Sanders.In the current cycle, many of these unions have skipped an early endorsement, making it easier for individual members and in some cases locals to support their own candidates. The teachers' union in Los Angeles has endorsed Mr. Sanders, as has the Ottumwa local of the United Food and Commercial Workers, whose 1.3-million-member international endorsed Mrs. Clinton before the 2016 Iowa caucuses. A large Pennsylvania local of the food workers' union has endorsed Mr. Biden.While the Labor Department recently reported that union membership last year fell to a record low -- 10.3 percent of the work force -- labor endorsements can still be critical because of the role of unions in educating members about candidates and canvassing for them on the ground.Mr. Laursen, the U.A.W. local leader in Ottumwa, estimates that more than half his members -- who are primarily workers at a John Deere plant -- backed Mr. Trump in 2016. But he says many of those who oppose the president's re-election are supporting Mr. Sanders over Mr. Biden.And the skepticism toward Mr. Biden among union voters may be even more pronounced in the less white, less male parts of the labor force.Nicole McCormick, a West Virginia music teacher who helped organize a statewide walkout that made national headlines in 2018, said she worried that Mr. Biden wasn't ""willing to push for the things that we as Americans look at as radical, but the rest of the world looks at and is like, 'We did that 50 years ago.""' She cited expanded access to unions, universal health care and paid parental leave as examples.(Mr. Biden has proposed wide-ranging labor-law reforms, though his plan isn't as ambitious as Mr. Sanders's or Ms. Warren's in some respects. He supports paid family leave.)Keon Liberato, the president of a Philadelphia-based local of more than 200 workers who maintain and construct railroad tracks, said many of his members preferred Mr. Sanders. Mr. Liberato said his members, both African-American and white, knew Mr. Biden as a friend to railroad workers, but tended to believe that taking health care off the bargaining table under Mr. Sanders's Medicare for All plan ""would be huge for the American people.""In voicing their concerns about Mr. Biden, union officials frequently cite dismay over the Obama years. They acknowledge a number of accomplishments, including the economic stimulus, the rescue of Chrysler and General Motors, and elements of the Affordable Care Act, as well as a variety of pro-labor appointments and regulations. But they express reservations about the administration's focus on deficit reduction, its ties to Wall Street, and especially its efforts to lower barriers to foreign competition.""I was really disappointed with his trade policies,"" said Nick Diveley, a U.A.W. member in Ottumwa, who supported Mr. Obama in 2008. ""That's what pushed me to Trump."" Mr. Diveley said he was open to voting for someone other than Mr. Trump in the fall but called Mr. Biden ""just another established Washington guy.""Union members and leaders also grumble about the so-called Cadillac tax on expensive health care plans that the Obama administration sought as a way to rein in wasteful spending. ""It was an egghead Ivy League idea, that people overuse health care,"" said D. Taylor, the president of the hospitality and casino workers union UNITE HERE, which helped lead the unsuccessful fight against the tax.(The union was supportive of the law and the administration over all; the tax was recently repealed.)And some complain that the Obama administration delayed action on labor's top priority -- a bill that could have expanded their ranks by making it easier to unionize through a sign-up process called card check, rather than a secret ballot -- partly so that it could focus on health care.""He failed to fight for our priorities and stand up for the main reason we endorsed him -- card check,"" said Norwood Orrick, a telecom technician and member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in Tampa, Fla. ""It was discussed a lot in my immediate circles of activists.""Beyond any single policy, there are complaints that the Obama administration sometimes treated labor as an interest group to be managed rather than a partner in making policy. Ana Avendaño, a former senior official at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., recalled a White House meeting on immigration that the federation's president, Richard Trumka, attended.""They sat him at one of the corners of the table,"" squeezed between two other people, Ms. Avendaño said. ""He couldn't even open his pad. In D.C. terms, it was a show of disrespect.""A spokesman for Mr. Trumka said: ""While President Trumka worked with and respected President Obama, he felt there were times when the president tried to split the difference between Main Street and Wall Street. That did not serve him or us well.""Some labor officials and union members see the more pragmatic approach of the Obama years, and Mr. Biden's moderate reputation, as a selling point. ""Our guys lean 55 percent Republican,"" said Thomas Hanify, president of the Indiana firefighters' union. ""Over all for my members, Warren and Bernie Sanders are a little extreme.""And many prefer Mr. Biden's approach to health care, voicing concern that Mr. Sanders would do away with insurance plans that unions have worked hard to negotiate.Other labor leaders, while citing shortcomings of the Obama presidency, say Mr. Biden was an advocate for their interests within the administration. Teachers' unions were furious after Mr. Obama publicly embraced the firing of the entire faculty of an underperforming school in Rhode Island in 2010. But Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said Mr. Biden helped resolve the situation.""We started having a fairly heated argument, me and the vice president, at an A.F.L. meeting,"" Ms. Weingarten said. ""But he heard what I was saying.""Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser to Mr. Biden during his vice presidency, said the same was often true on trade and other issues, including labor-law reform, which faced a complicated path in the Senate. ""I know for a fact where Biden is on these things,"" Mr. Bernstein said. ""But he was part of an administration that at times very much pleased the unions, and at other times very much pissed them off.""(As a senator, Mr. Biden supported some free-trade legislation, like the North American Free Trade Agreement.)But many labor officials regard Mr. Biden as essentially a sympathetic face for unfriendly policies he was either powerless to reverse or personally advanced. One cited Mr. Biden's role in leading the negotiations with Republicans over a long-term deficit-cutting deal that could have led to cuts in programs like Social Security and Medicare.Mr. Biden, whose record on Social Security has been a subject of sparring with the Sanders campaign, says he supports an expansion of benefits for many retirees.Frank Flanders, the political director of the food workers' local in Ottumwa, said that he was skeptical of Mr. Biden's views on trade and his more hawkish foreign policy views, and that he regarded Mr. Biden as a ""corporate Democrat.""""I think we had a lot of Trump voters in the general, for the most part it's because he wasn't Hillary,"" said Mr. Flanders, describing how his members voted in 2016. ""It's also a concern I have about a Biden candidacy.""PhotographChris Laursen, the president of a U.A.W. local in Iowa, said most of his members backed President Trump or Bernie Sanders.

| Jump to first hitAhead of the South Carolina primary and Super Tuesday, candidates are increasingly invoking Mr. Obama as they court black voters. He isn't playing favorites, but he does worry about uniting the party.WASHINGTON -- Barack Obama has not set foot in South Carolina recently, but he has become a flash point among the Democratic presidential candidates as they compete for black voters in Saturday's primary there and in the bigger, diverse Super Tuesday contests next week.In statements and a campaign ad over the past few days, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has accused Senator Bernie Sanders of disloyalty against the nation's first black president for considering a primary challenge against Mr. Obama in 2012. Mr. Sanders insists he didn't consider it.Former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has spent about $22.4 million so far on two national television ads featuring several photos of him with Mr. Obama, something Mr. Biden has sought to undercut by questioning whether the two men were close.Other candidates have praised Mr. Obama on the airwaves and debate stages as well as in early primary and caucus states this month, a sharp turnaround from the criticism that some 2020 contenders lobbed last year at his record, especially on immigration. The new embrace is a measure of his popularity with black voters 12 years after his last contested election in South Carolina, where he beat Hillary Clinton in a rout that cemented, once and for all, his standing with black voters nationwide.Mr. Obama hasn't tried to referee how the current candidates are using his name, image or record, and he has studiously avoided playing favorites. He does have opinions about the race, several of his allies say, but has made it clear that he sees his main role as unifying the party after a nominee is selected and helping ease tensions among warring supporters.As Mr. Sanders's campaign gained steam a few weeks ago, Mr. Obama said he would enthusiastically support any of the candidates. But he added that the task of uniting the party around Mr. Sanders ""could be difficult,"" according to an associate who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe a private conversation.Mr. Obama has imposed no restrictions on Democratic candidates who want to hug him for political gain, regardless of their history or ideological orientation. Five Democratic candidates -- Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden, Tom Steyer and Senator Elizabeth Warren -- have seized on the opportunity, using Mr. Obama's words or likeness in their ads. And just about everybody, surrogates and other candidates alike, have invoked him on the stump.""I think it would be political malpractice for any of the candidates not to closely associate themselves with the most popular person in the Democratic Party,"" Valerie Jarrett, one of Mr. Obama's closest friends and advisers, said in an interview. ""South Carolina was one of the biggest and most important days of our campaign. People will always remember that.""It is not just Democrats citing Mr. Obama. A pro-Trump super PAC aired a deceptive TV ad earlier this week manipulating a 1995 Obama audiobook to make it appear that Mr. Obama was accusing Mr. Biden of betraying black voters. On Wednesday, Mr. Obama's lawyer sent a cease-and-desist letter to the group's executive director after Mr. Biden's campaign alerted him to the problem.Mr. Obama, who offered Mr. Biden's team basic strategic advice before he entered the race last year, speaks more often with his former vice president than with other candidates, and called to buck up Mr. Biden after his humbling loss in the Iowa caucuses, according to a person briefed on the exchange. The two men also spoke on Tuesday ahead of the South Carolina debate, The Times reported.In South Carolina, Mr. Biden has intensified his Joe-hearts-Barack strategy, weaponizing the president's popularity as a battering ram to punish Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bloomberg for making Mr. Obama sweat for their support in 2012.In a recently unearthed audio recording of a 2016 speech, Mr. Bloomberg claimed to have given Mr. Obama a ""backhanded"" endorsement. Mr. Sanders, a Vermont independent who clashed with the administration on health care and other issues, referred to Mr. Obama in a 2011 radio appearance as a ""disappointment,"" and, according to a recent article in The Atlantic, even flirted with a primary challenge before being talked out of the idea by his friend Harry Reid, the former Democratic leader of the Senate.""He wanted a primary. He said we should primary Barack Obama, someone should, and, in fact, the president was weak and our administration was in fact not up to it,"" Mr. Biden said during Tuesday's contentious Democratic debate in Charleston, shortly after cutting an online ad calling out Mr. Sanders for his actions eight years ago.Representative Cedric Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana, a Biden backer and a recent chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, said that Mr. Obama was ""still very, very significant for African-American voters,"" and that other candidates were misrepresenting history as they try to win over black Democrats.Mr. Richmond added that it was ""hypocrisy"" for Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Sanders to run ads saying they were ""BFFs"" with Mr. Obama ""after refusing to help out Obama when he needed them.""A Biden adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss campaign strategy, said the campaign's view was that the attacks on Mr. Sanders over Mr. Obama were less likely to have an impact than the campaign's criticism of Mr. Bloomberg, who is not on the ballot in South Carolina. Mr. Sanders, the person said, has locked in many of his supporters, but Mr. Bloomberg, a former Republican who could siphon off moderate support in Super Tuesday states, is more vulnerable to charges of disloyalty.Mr. Sanders, for his part, has repeatedly said that he views Mr. Obama as a historic ""icon"" with whom he had policy disagreements, and has insisted he never planned to challenge him.But aides who worked for Mr. Obama's re-election campaign said they believed the threat was real and had fueled fears that such a challenge could sap much-needed support from the party's progressive wing. ""He should be held accountable,"" Patrick Dillon, a senior adviser to Mr. Obama's 2012 campaign aide, said of Mr. Sanders. ""It was clear he was up to something.""Mr. Sanders and Mr. Obama, while not close, are on amiable terms, and the senator has called the former president in recent weeks to update him on his campaign, and to keep their lines of communication open, according to aides to both men.Mr. Obama, in turn, has expressed admiration for Mr. Sanders's tenacity and small-donor fund-raising operation and his political acumen, but he has also acknowledged the magnitude of the challenge of getting other Democrats to fall into line quickly behind Mr. Sanders if he wins, a person in his orbit said.Mr. Obama and Mr. Bloomberg also have a complicated history, but their relationship is tempered by their past collaborations. The Bloomberg and Obama teams worked closely on a range of initiatives when both men were in office -- especially on gun control and climate change.The two men spoke briefly after Mr. Bloomberg announced he was running for president in November, with Mr. Obama gingerly questioning his late entry into the race, a person with knowledge of the exchange said.The former mayor had an open line of communication to Ms. Jarrett, who served as Mr. Obama's intergovernmental liaison in the White House. That back channel has remained open, and Mr. Bloomberg's team has taken steps to mitigate any toll that his recent actions and statements might have on their relationship.Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, has reached out to members of Mr. Obama's team, especially Ms. Jarrett, to explain the former mayor's change of heart on the city's much-criticized stop-and-frisk policing strategy and his use of nondisclosure agreements at his media company, she said.The impact of the friction remains an open question, but people around both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bloomberg say they believe that the threat posed by President Trump will overshadow the squabbling and slights.""We love Barack Obama, but I'm not sure all of this has as much influence on voters as it might have if we weren't facing a massive threat from Donald Trump,"" said Stephen K. Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia and a Bloomberg supporter. ""He's a symbol of pride, and a reminder of how things were in a better time.""In reality, many black voters in South Carolina warmed slowly to Mr. Obama, who was still a little-known freshman senator from Illinois when the 2008 race began. One of Mrs. Clinton's biggest assets heading into the state that year, or so it was assumed at the time, was her husband, former President Bill Clinton, who was widely popular with black voters.That changed, in part, as Mr. Obama campaigned aggressively in South Carolina in 2007 and 2008 and then won the Iowa caucuses. Mr. Clinton also made a mistake of attacking Mr. Obama in the days leading up to the South Carolina primary, dismissing Mr. Obama's antiwar position as a ""fairy tale"" and comparing him to a past black presidential candidate, Jesse Jackson, who lost in 1984 and 1988.Mr. Obama is dead set on avoiding that kind of mistake, his allies say, and has been unsettled by the vitriol vented at this week's debate.""The spirited debate is fine,"" Ms. Jarrett said. ""But he'd prefer they avoid the low blows, and not bait one another quite so much.""Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting.PhotographFormer President Barack Obama is ""the most popular person in the Democratic Party,"" Valerie Jarrett, one of his advisers, said.

| Jump to first hitThe gap between the Trump campaign’s boosterism and the reality of a nation under siege from a deadly contagion can be jarring.
On Sunday, hours before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned against any gatherings of 50 people or more, a measure designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus, President Trump signed an email to his millions of supporters.
“Tonight is going to be a bad night,” Mr. Trump began.
The email was not referring to the pandemic. It was about Sunday’s Democratic presidential debate.
“A bad night for Crazy Bernie and Sleepy Joe Biden,” Mr. Trump wrote. “For the first time, the American people will get to watch these two losers battle it out on national television.”
If Mr. Trump has used appearances in the White House briefing room this week to warn about the seriousness of the spreading coronavirus, the Trump campaign’s wide-reaching digital arm has mostly charged forward in email communications with supporters as if it were still operating in a virus-free world.
There has been the usual mix of dinner promotions with the president (just donate “ANY AMOUNT in the NEXT HOUR”), fund-raising gimmicks (“a short-term DOUBLE-MATCH”) and slashing attacks on Democrats — messages that could have been crafted for any other news cycle in any other campaign year.
But the normal elements of the campaign have been frozen indefinitely: Rallies have been canceled, primaries postponed, fund-raisers shelved, door-knocking deferred.
The president and his advisers are reckoning with the new reality of how to execute a digital-dominated campaign in the age of a pandemic, as are the two Democratic candidates, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.
Among the thorny questions facing strategists as the 2020 campaign migrates increasingly online: How does one ask supporters confined to their homes, and potentially unable to work, to dig into their wallets for donations? What crosses the line between motivational and tone-deaf? And just how much of business as usual should be upended as the offline country grinds to a halt?
“This is a weird time for campaigns,” Rob Flaherty, Mr. Biden’s digital director, wrote in an email to supporters on Wednesday, asking them to help “think through what this brave new world looks like” in a survey.
The Biden and Sanders campaigns have addressed the coronavirus more often and directly than Mr. Trump in their emails to supporters, and both continued to solicit contributions as the crisis has deepened, though Mr. Sanders stopped on Wednesday as he reassessed his candidacy.
So far Mr. Trump’s campaign stands alone in trying to create his own virtual reality, mostly ignoring the virus (with the exception of one email and text message a week ago linking to C.D.C. guidance), belittling Democrats and bashing the media even as the outbreak has upended almost every facet of American life.
Some public health officials said that, given the partisan divide on how seriously Americans are taking the virus threat, Mr. Trump could have made an impact with more and earlier messages, including to his extensive email list, encouraging people to stay home and practice social distancing.
In an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll last week, more than two-thirds of Democrats worried an immediate family member would catch the coronavirus, compared to only 40 percent of Republicans.
“If he — in his political vehicle — if he was telling them this was really serious, you need to take this seriously, you need to understand what social distancing is, you need to stay home, you need to wash your hands, it would be a real benefit,” said Diana Dooley, a former secretary of the California health and human services agency. “He had this opportunity to do that through his political machinery.”
The frequency of Trump campaign emails has slowed in recent days. But the tenor has remained the same: The campaign has hawked a signed “Keep America Great” hat, sold “Trump Luck of the Irish Whiskey Glasses” for St. Patrick’s Day and offered an exclusive “gold card” membership for donors of $35 and up. One email on Wednesday bragged about “record-low” unemployment figures, as administration officials raced to stave off a massive hike in joblessness. On Thursday, Mr. Trump’s campaign asked the “patriots” on his list to hit a “MASSIVE” $2 million fund-raising goal.
The gap between the Trump campaign’s boosterism and the unsettling reality of a nation under siege from a deadly contagion can be jarring, even if it goes unseen by most Americans — unless they are among the millions who have opted to receive Mr. Trump’s online campaign missives.
“You’ll never hear it from the Lamestream media and their Democratic Partners, but America is WINNING like never before,” read a campaign email last Friday, the same day that schools were closed, sporting events postponed and Mr. Trump himself declared a national emergency.
Josh Holmes, a top Republican strategist and former chief of staff to Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, noted that Mr. Trump’s digital apparatus had raised “astronomical” sums for Republicans and said the campaign should be cautious of adjustments.
“If it’s not broken, don’t fix it if it’s still performing,” he said.
“The digital component to these campaigns is more essential now than ever,” he added, “because you have all of these high-dollar gatherings that have come off the books and there is no real way to replace those revenues.”
Up and down the ballot, candidates and political party committees are seeking to find the right balance, as email fund-raising has evolved into an essential source of campaign cash.
“One of the first things you learn in digital comms is you really have to read the room,” said Emmy Bengtson, a Democratic digital strategist, adding that campaigns are constantly adjusting pre-written emails, tweets and messages to account for world events. “No one wants to be tonally off.”
The No. 2 Republican in the Senate, John Cornyn of Texas, who is up for re-election this year and facing a Democratic challenge, announced he was “suspending all campaign-related activities” on Tuesday. But many others continued to ask for donations and search for new supporters, including through advertising on Facebook.
The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has told small donors that its decision to call off traditional fund-raisers during the crisis “will cost us money” and urged them “to compensate for this shortfall.”
Meanwhile, a Democratic group called Pacronym planned to spend $2.5 million attacking Mr. Trump for his “incompetence” in responding to the virus.
Mr. Biden, who announced at Sunday’s debate that he had raised $33 million in the first half of March, by far his best stretch of the campaign, has continued to gingerly ask for money as the health and financial crises have gotten worse.
In an email on Tuesday, Mr. Biden wrote that “in keeping with the latest guidance from the C.D.C., I am emailing you from home in Wilmington.” He both asked for money and thanked poll workers in Florida, Illinois and Arizona who had spent the day trying “to clean and disinfect voting booths.” “Even during crises, democracy presses on,” read an earlier Biden campaign message.
The Sanders campaign has not sent any fund-raising emails since his lopsided losses on Tuesday, but it did send out four messages during debate day on Sunday. All four mentioned the evolving health crisis at least once as they sought contributions. Mr. Sanders raised $2 million that day.
Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden, said the campaign was “balancing twin imperatives” of directing people to proper public health guidance and highlighting the need for the democratic process to continue.
“The work of the campaign doesn’t completely shut down, because participating in elections is a core part of our democracy,” she said.
The Trump campaign declined to comment on its online messaging. But Republicans who work with the campaign said that those behind the messages generally refuse to let political custom or niceties dictate their behavior, regardless of blowback.
The ultimate and perhaps only metric that may lead to a shift is simply whether the aggressive tactics stop working, and donations slow.
Last week, the Trump campaign circulated a clip of the Republican strategist Karl Rove waving a printout of a Biden campaign email on Fox News and accusing Mr. Biden of exploiting the coronavirus to raise money.
The email contained the full text of a nearly 2,500-word speech Mr. Biden had delivered on the virus; only below that was a typical disclaimer and donation button.
In a statement last week about the 2020 campaign migrating increasingly online, Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump’s campaign manager, claimed a “huge advantage” over the Democrats.
“The Trump campaign’s data and technology operation is the most sophisticated in history, so we’re better positioned to virtually engage voters than any other campaign,” Mr. Parscale said, highlighting a “national week of training” that would be done virtually.
As the severity of the outbreak has become more apparent, the Trump campaign and its surrogates have used Twitter to try to cast the president as leading with “decisive action” throughout 2020, even as virus updates have been almost absent from email communications.
The Biden campaign this week incorporated public health concerns about the coronavirus into its call scripts — the recommended text for volunteers to read to potential voters.
“During this pandemic, we are calling on all voters to follow social distancing guidelines to slow the spread of COVID-19,” said one script used in Illinois. “Hand wash before and after voting, don’t touch your face, ensure your machine is being cleaned, stand 6 feet away from others on line.”
Mr. Biden has used the crisis to lash out at Mr. Trump’s leadership, though his emails have struck a decidedly more reluctant tone in requesting financial support than the president’s.
“Even me sending you these emails asking for money feels different, and difficult,” wrote Mr. Biden’s online fund-raising director on Monday, adding, “And fund-raising? That all has to happen online now, to people like you through emails like this one.”

| Jump to first hit(Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)Good morning.We're covering the latest in the coronavirus outbreak, the growing scrutiny of Michael Bloomberg, and President Trump's trip to the Daytona 500.Americans carry virus from ship to planeFourteen Americans who were evacuated from a cruise ship in Japan today were found to have the new coronavirus shortly before they boarded a chartered flight to the U.S.American officials had initially said they wouldn't allow infected people to board evacuation flights from the ship, the Diamond Princess, which has been quarantined in Yokohama for more than 10 days. The infected passengers were placed in a specialized isolation area of the plane, and all passengers will be quarantined upon reaching the U.S.Here are the latest updates and maps of where the virus has spread.Related: More than 1,000 passengers left another cruise ship in Cambodia over the weekend after assurances that the vessel was disease free. One of them later tested positive for the virus, leaving health officials scrambling to assess the scale of the problem.Quotable: Amid the outbreak, some Asian-Americans have felt suspicion just for sneezing. ""Instead of 'Bless you' or 'Are you OK?,' their reaction is an instant state of panic,"" said Aretha Deng, a university student in Arizona.Another angle: Toilet paper has been sold out across Hong Kong for weeks after rumors that manufacturers in mainland China would cease production amid the outbreak. A deliveryman was robbed today at knifepoint of more than $100 worth of toilet paper.Excavating Michael Bloomberg's pastHe is skipping the first four nominating contests in the Democratic primary, but the former mayor of New York is increasingly becoming a target as his rivals focus on his wealth and his record on race and inequality.""Sixty billion dollars can buy you a lot of advertising, but it can't erase your record,"" Joe Biden said on Sunday.Among other instances, a recording from 2015 surfaced last week in which Mr. Bloomberg defended New York's stop-and-frisk police searches: ""We put all the cops in minority neighborhoods. Yes. That's true. Why do we do it? Because that's where all the crime is.""Mr. Bloomberg later apologized for the practice.Another angle: Bernie Sanders is a longtime supporter of ""Medicare for all,"" but that signature policy is a liability with the largest labor union in Nevada, whose caucuses are Saturday.Tech companies push back on China limitsThe Trump administration says it wants to protect national security by restricting the flow of technology to China. American tech companies say they support such efforts, but they also worry that new rules from Washington could undermine them instead.The Commerce Department is considering a sweeping proposal that would allow the U.S. to block transactions between American companies and their Chinese counterparts. Companies that specialize in microchips, artificial intelligence, biotechnology and other advanced technologies say such plans could siphon away expertise, research and revenue.Another angle: Executives from Alphabet and Facebook are among those meeting with European officials as the E.U. debates digital policy, including rules on how companies can use artificial intelligence. A first draft of the A.I. policy is set to be released this week.Chicago's exodus of black familiesMore than 200,000 black residents have left Chicago in the past two decades, driven out by segregation, gun violence and rising rents, among other factors. At the same time, white, Latino and Asian residents have flowed in.Lori Lightfoot, the city's first black mayor in decades, has vowed to stem the loss of longtime residents, many of whom arrived during the Great Migration, when millions of African-Americans moved north during the mid-20th century.Our reporter met one black family whose three generations are a living symbol of what the nation's third-largest city has kept and lost.Quotable: ""It's an American tragedy,"" said the Rev.

It focuses on sowing doubt about Western governments and institutions.Neil MacFarquhar, our national correspondent who wrote the article, was previously The Times's bureau chief in Moscow. The following conversation with him has been condensed and edited for clarity.You wrote that one Sputnik station shares a frequency with a smaller jazz station in Kansas City. What's it like to be listening to Charlie Parker one minute and propaganda the next?You get roughly, ""This is Radio Sputnik, broadcasting live from Washington, D.C., the capital of the divided states of America.""The station that has the Sputnik frequency is fairly strong, while the station broadcasting jazz is relatively weak. If you're by the more powerful transmitter, you get Radio Sputnik.Is this kind of propaganda relatively unprecedented in U.S.-Russian relations?It depends on your interpretation of ""propaganda."" There have previously been radio broadcasts of foreign owned and financed radio stations into the United States.But part of the change is the more sour mood between the two capitals. Under Vladimir Putin, there has been a much more concerted effort to undermine Western institutions.The Facebook campaigns focused on the 2016 election and other things we've heard about were direct attempts to influence specific groups of people, so it was more manipulative. This is much more subtle.It's not old-school propaganda. It's American hosts -- before they got to Sputnik, they were fairly down on the United States from the left or right -- trying to paint the U.S. as damaged goods.Is it jarring compared to other radio stations on the dial?It's talk radio, so they're riffing off headlines about impeachment, Kobe Bryant, coronavirus, that kind of thing. The bureau chief in Washington says they'd like to have a station in New York, but the cost is bigger than their budget allows.That's it for this briefing. See you next time.-- ChrisThank you

| Jump to first hitMany Super Tuesday voters across the nation made last-minute decisions, sometimes on the way to the polls. Even afterward, some weren't sure they had chosen correctly.CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- After all the debates and forums, after the candidate surges, withdrawals and endorsements, voters in large numbers across the country finally had to land on a choice on Tuesday.But for Democrats who had long hoped for the field to narrow and the options to sharpen, there was still mass uncertainty as people in 14 states from the Eastern Seaboard to the Pacific Coast went to the polls.Voters picked among five candidates, and many made last-minute decisions -- some on the way to the polls -- and expressed doubts and anxieties about whether their choice was the right one.The hesitations reflected the weaknesses of the candidates, who were exposed by 10 debates and four sometimes indecisive state caucuses and primaries, not to mention the prospect that the eventual winner will face the break-all-the-rules style of President Trump, who on Monday night in Charlotte, N.C., mercilessly taunted Joseph R. Biden Jr. for his age and verbal misfires.""I'm worried about our country, I don't think we have a perfect candidate this time -- we don't have a Barack Obama,"" said Justin Faircloth, a real estate investor and musician in Charlotte. He made up his mind on Tuesday morning to vote for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Doubts lingered. ""I'm concerned with Biden, Warren or Sanders, whether they can really make it happen,"" he said.In Massachusetts, less than a mile from Senator Elizabeth Warren's home, Sibylle Kim said she deeply admired her senator but doubted Ms. Warren's electability, so she voted for Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City.But even as Ms. Kim entered her polling place in Cambridge, she acknowledged that she wasn't sure that Mr. Bloomberg was the right choice, either. ""I've never felt this unconvinced,"" she said.The questions to be answered on a day with nearly a third of delegates at stake were whether Mr. Biden's comeback was real, whether the Sanders juggernaut would prove unstoppable and whether a new top contender -- Mr. Bloomberg or Ms. Warren -- might arise.Mr. Biden's commanding victory in South Carolina on Saturday and his endorsement by three former presidential candidates on Monday -- an effort to bring moderates together and halt Mr. Sanders -- swayed some voters.""I think that changed the trajectory of the race: Biden went from somebody I was skeptical about, you know, his chances, to somebody who I could see winning,"" said Matthew Pershe, a graduate student who voted in Arlington, Va.Mr. Pershe called himself ""kind of a Never-Trump Republican"" who was looking for a moderate Democrat he could support. He was initially interested in Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, but when both dropped out in recent days and endorsed Mr. Biden, that settled it. ""I knew Biden was the one we should probably rally around instead of Bloomberg,"" he said.Virginia and North Carolina, states with many suburbanites and large numbers of black voters, were the places to look for whether Mr. Biden could pull out victories to keep things close with Mr. Sanders, who has enjoyed strong support in the Western states of California and Colorado.In Colorado, where Mr. Sanders won by 20 percentage points in the 2016 primary elections, Democrats dropping off their ballots at a motor vehicles office in the north Denver suburbs overwhelmingly said they were supporting Mr. Sanders.Melanie Labonte, 44, a Canadian immigrant who works at an affordable-housing nonprofit, said she was voting in her first primary, and supported Mr. Sanders because she agreed with his condemnations of corporate greed and supported his ""Medicare for all"" plan. Her husband has multiple sclerosis, and Ms. Labonte said they had run out of his medication some months and had to scramble at the start of each year to arrange his prescriptions.""This system is very frustrating,"" she said.Some progressives were upset by the groundswell of late-breaking establishment support for Mr. Biden, saying it was a sign that party elites were again trying to deny Mr. Sanders the nomination, after his defeat in 2016 by Hillary Clinton.""It's probably going to backfire, just like it did with Hillary,"" said Robin Killingsworth, a retired computer-support worker from Adams County, north of Denver, who was voting in his first primary on Tuesday. ""The Democratic establishment seems to be screwing us around.""Mr. Sanders's strength with Latinos was expected to be a major factor in the Super Tuesday states of California, Texas and Colorado. At another voting site in Adams County, which is about 40 percent Hispanic, José and Mayela Garcia Alba pulled up in their rattling bronze sedan to vote for Mr. Sanders. The couple run a small housecleaning business and obtain their health coverage through Medicaid, and said they did not know when -- or if -- they would be able to afford to retire. They liked Mr. Sanders's proposals to expand public health care and cut high prescription costs.""The conditions now are primed for a person like Bernie,"" said Mr. Garcia Alba, 62.Texas has the second-largest number of delegates to award on Tuesday, after California, and Mr. Biden was hoping to keep it close there, especially after winning the endorsement on Monday of former Representative Beto O'Rourke, who ran a brief presidential campaign and nearly won a Senate seat in Texas in 2018. Four years ago, Mrs. Clinton defeated Mr. Sanders in the state among not only white and black voters but also Latinos.In Kashmere Gardens, a historic but struggling black neighborhood in Houston, Victor R. Denson, 55, voted for Mr. Biden.""I remember how he did with Obama,"" Mr. Denson, an Army veteran who is a student at the Thurgood Marshall School of Law at Texas Southern University, said of the former vice president. ""I voted for Obama, and I think he would lead us the same way, and take us away from what Trump is doing. And I didn't want Bernie because Bernie, I feel like he's a socialist. And Elizabeth Warren, I don't think that America is ready for a lady president right now. I'm just going to ride with Joe.""As in every Super Tuesday state, the great unknown was Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire who is on the ballot for the first time and has saturated airwaves, the internet and countless highway crossroads with his ads. On one median in Charlotte, Bloomberg campaign workers had seemingly decided to plant all their surplus signs: Scores dotted a few dozen yards.There was some evidence that the former mayor's vast spending had made an impact. Al Rogers, a retired cable splicer for phone companies in Charlotte, voted for Mr. Bloomberg. He said his TV spots were as seductive as those for a 2020 Cadillac. ""I hate to say it, but a political ad is almost like an ad for a new car: It's going to do this and it's going to do that,"" he said.In other words, sold.Reporting was contributed by Jack Healy from Denver, Farah Stockman from Cambridge, Mass., Michael Wines from Arlington, Va., and Manny Fernandez from Houston.PhotographIn Lathrop, Calif., a small city that is just south of Stockton, Rose Orosoco has hosted a polling place in her garage for about 30 years.

| Jump to first hitIt's going to be a wild year. We're here to help.As 2020 approached, we faced one of the wildest political moments in decades: A historically crowded Democratic primary, an impeachment and an unpredictable president. And that was all before an American airstrike killed a top Iranian commander and upended the Middle East.Yeah, it's going to be that kind of year.Expect January to be dominated by the three I's -- Impeachment, Iran and Iowa. With so much going on in Washington, on the campaign trail and across the globe, we thought it was time to inaugurate a new newsletter feature: a Monday Mailbag.Yes, I know we've been asking you for your questions about politics for months. And while we've responded to many of you individually, we haven't always been exactly diligent about answering all of them.Well, New Year, New Newsletter! Our crack researcher Isabella Grullón Paz went through hundreds of your emails and came up with a few questions that seemed to resonate for several readers. (Some have been condensed for space.)Margaret Steiner had this astute question about President Trump's impeachment trial in the Senate:I am confused. You talk about the centrist Republicans, the retiring Republicans and the swing state Republicans up for re-election, three groups you say to watch. You say they could form a coalition and ""overpower"" McConnell to ""set the rules"" and decide who will be a witness. How do the senators do any of this if, as you state later, they ""cannot talk""?While senators are prohibited from speaking during the actual impeachment trial, they have a fair amount of power when it comes to setting the terms of the proceeding. Under Senate rules, it takes only a simple majority to call a witness or request new evidence. Since Republicans hold 53 seats, if four Republicans joined with Senate Democrats, they could have some serious influence on the process.This question is particularly relevant today, given the announcement by John R. Bolton, the former White House national security adviser, that he would be willing to testify at the trial if subpoenaed. Mr. Bolton is a potentially vital witness with firsthand information about the president's actions and conversations regarding Ukraine.Democrats want him to testify; Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has resisted the idea. But if four Republicans broke with Mr. McConnell, Mr. Bolton could be compelled to testify -- making those Republicans pretty powerful, indeed.We also got a ton of questions about the Democratic primary. Those are a little easier to answer after this weekend, when the polling gods graced us with our first piece of real data on the race in weeks.What did we learn from the CBS News surveys of Iowa and New Hampshire? Senator Bernie Sanders is surging, Senator Elizabeth Warren is slipping in New Hampshire, and Joe Biden, the former vice president, seems to be gaining ground in Iowa.James Levinson wants to know whether Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren could team up to take on Mr. Biden:If Sanders and Warren conclude that neither can beat Biden, and if they also conclude that the enactment of their largely common policies is more important than which of them is in the White House, is there a way they could join forces?The idea of a joint Sanders-Warren ticket is the dream of many liberals.There are no signs that it will happen.While the two senators have abided by a de facto nonaggression pact, they are not in frequent communication and there's no indication that their camps have discussed any joint effort.But outside of their orbits, in the larger progressive universe, discussions are happening about how to avoid splitting the liberal vote and nominating a more centrist candidate. Whether these develop into a more formal strategy will depend on how the primary plays out over the next several months. So, that's definitely something to watch this spring.Lisa Adams asked:Will Michael Bloomberg be able to participate in the Democratic presidential debates? If so, when, and under what circumstances or criteria?Mr. Bloomberg will not be on the stage next week because he hasn't met the party's requirement that 225,000 people donate to his campaign. (He's self-funding his run for president and not accepting donations.) But that could change by the following debate in February, if the Democratic National Committee changes the qualification standards -- which officials have said is possible.Speaking of campaign finance, Charlene Fitzpatrick wants to know how much money matters, anyhow.It seems like the competition for the presidency is a competition for fund-raising instead of ideas or plans. Does a president win even if his fund-raising isn't competitive? And what is all that money spent on anyway? Why do we do this to ourselves?Like endorsements or polling, fund-raising totals offer another way to assess the candidates' standing in the race. A candidate who is low on cash may struggle to fund a campaign operation for the long haul -- or even in the shorter haul, as the 15 candidates who've dropped out of the primary have found.But it's far from a perfect predictor: In 2016, Hillary Clinton outspent Mr. Trump by nearly two to one, and we all know how that turned out.The money is spent on the kind of things you'd probably expect -- office space, staff salaries, lawyers and especially advertising -- but also on things you might not expect. Like, say, Uber rides, car repairs and paella.As for ""why do we do this to ourselves?"" Honestly, Charlene, I ask myself that every day.Drop us a line!We want more questions for our Monday Mailbag! Send us yours at onpolitics@nytimes.com (and please include your current city or town). Or, just let us know what's on your mind.Cory Booker becomes a Wing manNick Corasaniti , your Tuesday newsletter host, followed Cory Booker today to a place neither of them would normally be invited. Here's his report:Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey sat before a nearly all-female audience on Monday at a New York City branch of the Wing, a women's club and co-working space, and was asked a question: Why shouldn't the next president be a woman?Mr. Booker responded by saying that his ""heart, soul and spirit fought harder than ever before"" to elect Hillary Clinton in 2016. But right now, he said, ""I believe I have the best message and reason and, frankly, the right stuff it takes to be the president.""He quickly added, ""If I'm president of the United States, whoever my vice president will be, she will be amazing.""See what he did there?The often exuberant Mr. Booker brought his always-turned-up-to-11 delivery to the Wing, speaking unprompted about topics like ""menstrual equity"" -- the idea that menstrual products should be affordable and not taxed -- and his fight to make tampons free for women in prisons.He also delivered a rare near-obscenity (he often relies on the phrase ""dagnab"") when discussing his efforts to protect the right to an abortion.""This is not an issue that men should say, 'Oh, I understand this issue because I have a wife, I have a daughter,""' he said. ""No. You have a freaking body. And this is an attack on someone's body and the ability to control the sanctity of your body.""Mr. Booker was the first cisgender man invited to speak at the Wing, which was founded three years ago in New York and has since grown to more than 12,000 members at over a dozen locations in the United States and abroad.The club said it was bringing in presidential candidates to discuss ""women's issues that so often get left out of the debates,"" after some of the early Democratic debates last year featured little discussion of topics like reproductive rights and the gender pay gap.""The lesson for me has always been that when women are driving the conversation, different questions get asked, different decisions get made,"" said Audrey Gelman, one of the founders of the Wing. ""We felt like we're sort of missing an opportunity to make sure that those questions get asked, and so that was the reason to do it.""Ms. Gelman said the Wing had no plans to endorse a candidate in the Democratic primary, and was working with other 2020 campaigns to host a similar event. Many of her members, she said, were eager to hear from Senator Elizabeth Warren.... SeriouslyFormer Gov. Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, a Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat, is moving forward with a second presidential bid, according to WPRI in Providence. His last attempt was short-lived and perhaps best remembered for his proposal to switch the United States to the metric system.Early signs point to Mr. Chafee's running as a libertarian, in an ongoing effort to complete his tour of America's biggest political parties.Were you forwarded this newsletter?

| Jump to first hitThe gap between the Trump campaign's boosterism and the reality of a nation under siege from a deadly contagion can be jarring.On Sunday, hours before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned against any gatherings of 50 people or more, a measure designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus, President Trump signed an email to his millions of supporters.""Tonight is going to be a bad night,"" Mr. Trump began.The email was not referring to the pandemic. It was about Sunday's Democratic presidential debate.""A bad night for Crazy Bernie and Sleepy Joe Biden,"" Mr. Trump wrote. ""For the first time, the American people will get to watch these two losers battle it out on national television.""If Mr. Trump has used appearances in the White House briefing room this week to warn about the seriousness of the spreading coronavirus, the Trump campaign's wide-reaching digital arm has mostly charged forward in email communications with supporters as if it were still operating in a virus-free world.There has been the usual mix of dinner promotions with the president (just donate ""ANY AMOUNT in the NEXT HOUR""), fund-raising gimmicks (""a short-term DOUBLE-MATCH"") and slashing attacks on Democrats -- messages that could have been crafted for any other news cycle in any other campaign year.But the normal elements of the campaign have been frozen indefinitely: Rallies have been canceled, primaries postponed, fund-raisers shelved, door-knocking deferred.The president and his advisers are reckoning with the new reality of how to execute a digital-dominated campaign in the age of a pandemic, as are the two Democratic candidates, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Among the thorny questions facing strategists as the 2020 campaign migrates increasingly online: How does one ask supporters confined to their homes, and potentially unable to work, to dig into their wallets for donations? What crosses the line between motivational and tone-deaf? And just how much of business as usual should be upended as the offline country grinds to a halt?""This is a weird time for campaigns,"" Rob Flaherty, Mr. Biden's digital director, wrote in an email to supporters on Wednesday, asking them to help ""think through what this brave new world looks like"" in a survey.The Biden and Sanders campaigns have addressed the coronavirus more often and directly than Mr. Trump in their emails to supporters, and both continued to solicit contributions as the crisis has deepened, though Mr. Sanders stopped on Wednesday as he reassessed his candidacy.So far Mr. Trump's campaign stands alone in trying to create his own virtual reality, mostly ignoring the virus (with the exception of one email and text message a week ago linking to C.D.C. guidance), belittling Democrats and bashing the media even as the outbreak has upended almost every facet of American life.Some public health officials said that, given the partisan divide on how seriously Americans are taking the virus threat, Mr. Trump could have made an impact with more and earlier messages, including to his extensive email list, encouraging people to stay home and practice social distancing.In an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll last week, more than two-thirds of Democrats worried an immediate family member would catch the coronavirus, compared to only 40 percent of Republicans.""If he -- in his political vehicle -- if he was telling them this was really serious, you need to take this seriously, you need to understand what social distancing is, you need to stay home, you need to wash your hands, it would be a real benefit,"" said Diana Dooley, a former secretary of the California health and human services agency. ""He had this opportunity to do that through his political machinery.""The frequency of Trump campaign emails has slowed in recent days. But the tenor has remained the same: The campaign has hawked a signed ""Keep America Great"" hat, sold ""Trump Luck of the Irish Whiskey Glasses"" for St. Patrick's Day and offered an exclusive ""gold card"" membership for donors of $35 and up. One email on Wednesday bragged about ""record-low"" unemployment figures, as administration officials raced to stave off a massive hike in joblessness. On Thursday, Mr. Trump's campaign asked the ""patriots"" on his list to hit a ""MASSIVE"" $2 million fund-raising goal.The gap between the Trump campaign's boosterism and the unsettling reality of a nation under siege from a deadly contagion can be jarring, even if it goes unseen by most Americans -- unless they are among the millions who have opted to receive Mr. Trump's online campaign missives.""You'll never hear it from the Lamestream media and their Democratic Partners, but America is WINNING like never before,"" read a campaign email last Friday, the same day that schools were closed, sporting events postponed and Mr. Trump himself declared a national emergency.Josh Holmes, a top Republican strategist and former chief of staff to Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, noted that Mr. Trump's digital apparatus had raised ""astronomical"" sums for Republicans and said the campaign should be cautious of adjustments.""If it's not broken, don't fix it if it's still performing,"" he said.""The digital component to these campaigns is more essential now than ever,"" he added, ""because you have all of these high-dollar gatherings that have come off the books and there is no real way to replace those revenues.""Up and down the ballot, candidates and political party committees are seeking to find the right balance, as email fund-raising has evolved into an essential source of campaign cash.""One of the first things you learn in digital comms is you really have to read the room,"" said Emmy Bengtson, a Democratic digital strategist, adding that campaigns are constantly adjusting pre-written emails, tweets and messages to account for world events. ""No one wants to be tonally off.""The No. 2 Republican in the Senate, John Cornyn of Texas, who is up for re-election this year and facing a Democratic challenge, announced he was ""suspending all campaign-related activities"" on Tuesday. But many others continued to ask for donations and search for new supporters, including through advertising on Facebook.The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has told small donors that its decision to call off traditional fund-raisers during the crisis ""will cost us money"" and urged them ""to compensate for this shortfall.""Meanwhile, a Democratic group called Pacronym planned to spend $2.5 million attacking Mr. Trump for his ""incompetence"" in responding to the virus.Mr. Biden, who announced at Sunday's debate that he had raised $33 million in the first half of March, by far his best stretch of the campaign, has continued to gingerly ask for money as the health and financial crises have gotten worse.In an email on Tuesday, Mr. Biden wrote that ""in keeping with the latest guidance from the C.D.C., I am emailing you from home in Wilmington."" He both asked for money and thanked poll workers in Florida, Illinois and Arizona who had spent the day trying ""to clean and disinfect voting booths."" ""Even during crises, democracy presses on,"" read an earlier Biden campaign message.The Sanders campaign has not sent any fund-raising emails since his lopsided losses on Tuesday, but it did send out four messages during debate day on Sunday. All four mentioned the evolving health crisis at least once as they sought contributions. Mr. Sanders raised $2 million that day.Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden, said the campaign was ""balancing twin imperatives"" of directing people to proper public health guidance and highlighting the need for the democratic process to continue.""The work of the campaign doesn't completely shut down, because participating in elections is a core part of our democracy,"" she said.The Trump campaign declined to comment on its online messaging. But Republicans who work with the campaign said that those behind the messages generally refuse to let political custom or niceties dictate their behavior, regardless of blowback.The ultimate and perhaps only metric that may lead to a shift is simply whether the aggressive tactics stop working, and donations slow.Last week, the Trump campaign circulated a clip of the Republican strategist Karl Rove waving a printout of a Biden campaign email on Fox News and accusing Mr. Biden of exploiting the coronavirus to raise money.The email contained the full text of a nearly 2,500-word speech Mr. Biden had delivered on the virus; only below that was a typical disclaimer and donation button.In a statement last week about the 2020 campaign migrating increasingly online, Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump's campaign manager, claimed a ""huge advantage"" over the Democrats.""The Trump campaign's data and technology operation is the most sophisticated in history, so we're better positioned to virtually engage voters than any other campaign,"" Mr. Parscale said, highlighting a ""national week of training"" that would be done virtually.As the severity of the outbreak has become more apparent, the Trump campaign and its surrogates have used Twitter to try to cast the president as leading with ""decisive action"" throughout 2020, even as virus updates have been almost absent from email communications.The Biden campaign this week incorporated public health concerns about the coronavirus into its call scripts -- the recommended text for volunteers to read to potential voters.""During this pandemic, we are calling on all voters to follow social distancing guidelines to slow the spread of COVID-19,"" said one script used in Illinois. ""Hand wash before and after voting, don't touch your face, ensure your machine is being cleaned, stand 6 feet away from others on line.""Mr. Biden has used the crisis to lash out at Mr. Trump's leadership, though his emails have struck a decidedly more reluctant tone in requesting financial support than the president's.""Even me sending you these emails asking for money feels different, and difficult,"" wrote Mr. Biden's online fund-raising director on Monday, adding, ""And fund-raising? That all has to happen online now, to people like you through emails like this one.""PhotographRecent fund-raising emails from the Trump campaign offered a chance to dine with the president or to get a signed hat.

| Jump to first hitA federal filing showing spending through December provides the most detailed description yet of how Mr. Bloomberg deployed his wealth in a quest for the presidency. The bulk went to advertising.DES MOINES -- Michael R. Bloomberg put more than $200 million of his personal fortune into his presidential campaign by the end of December, with the overwhelming bulk of that sum going to a mammoth advertising campaign on television and online, according to Mr. Bloomberg's first campaign finance disclosure with the Federal Election Commission.But Mr. Bloomberg's wealth financed a huge array of campaign expenditures, many of them unusual or unheard-of for candidates of normal means, including millions of dollars in polling before Mr. Bloomberg even entered the race; $1.5 million for office space; about $700,000 for rental apartments for campaign staff; and nearly as much on travel by private jet.The figure comes as little surprise to those who have tracked Mr. Bloomberg's television advertising, and the total price tag for his candidacy has soared far higher in the month since the end of the reporting period. But the filing on Friday is the most detailed description yet of how Mr. Bloomberg has deployed his personal fortune in a quest for the presidency that only started in late November.Since then, Mr. Bloomberg has climbed into the high single digits in national polls, largely on the strength of an onslaught of campaign commercials with no precedent in Democratic politics.In addition to Mr. Bloomberg, other presidential candidates also filed their fund-raising reports on Friday, which covered the fourth quarter of 2019 and gave a snapshot of their financial resources entering 2020.Among the leading candidates in the Democratic primary, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont had the largest war chest at the start of January, $18.2 million, even after spending $50 million in the fourth quarter. Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., entered the month with $14.5 million, while Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts had $13.7 million and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had $8.9 million.Federal records show Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, spent $132 million on television advertising, far overshadowing the campaign spending of the other Democrats in the race. In total, the Bloomberg campaign had spent $188 million by the end of December.In addition to that sum, the campaign disclosed it had nearly $33 million in additional invoices to be paid in the next filing period, meaning that it had committed resources worth more than $220 million within his first five weeks as a candidate.Mr. Bloomberg's spending has largely defined his candidacy: His advertising has introduced him quickly to voters across the country who may have known little about him, and his vast fortune has made him an attractive candidate to some Democrats intrigued by the idea of attacking President Trump with an unlimited budget.Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, called the extraordinary use of Mr. Bloomberg's personal wealth a ""down payment' in a statement.""Our first month's filing represents a down payment and commitment in all 50 states to defeat Donald Trump, and it shows we have the resources and plan necessary to take him on,"" Mr. Sheekey said.But in a party defined in no small part by concerns about inequality and economic power concentrated in the hands of the wealthy, Mr. Bloomberg's fortune -- estimated at well above $50 billion -- is also a source of discomfort to many Democrats, and his lavishly funded candidacy has drawn sharp criticism from populist liberals, like Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren.Mr. Bloomberg's finances are largely opaque, and they are almost certainly the most complex of all the Democratic presidential candidates. He has not released any tax returns since entering the Democratic primary, and his campaign has postponed filing a personal financial disclosure form until late March, after many of the states he is contesting will already have voted.The way that Mr. Bloomberg has structured some of his payments offers limited visibility into his spending, including $15 million paid to his company, Bloomberg L.P., that mostly covered the period before he declared his candidacy, and another $12 million to Hawkfish, a technology firm he formed last year.Still, the report offered a partial window into just how many consulting firms and strategists Mr. Bloomberg is employing and how much some his longtime advisers are paid.One of the biggest payments went to Doug Schoen, a longtime pollster for Mr. Bloomberg and a Democratic strategist who has appeared often on Fox News. He was paid $3.2 million for polling and is owed nearly $4 million more -- for a total of almost $7.2 million in less than two months.Bill Knapp, a media strategist for Mr. Bloomberg, formed a new consulting firm, MRB4USA LLC, to work on the 2020 bid, according to campaign officials. That company billed the Bloomberg campaign for more than $2.8 million in November and December. Another media strategy firm, Siegel Strategies LLC, named for the ad-maker Jimmy Siegel, was paid nearly $1.5 million.Beyond Mr. Schoen, Mr. Bloomberg has assembled a team of pollsters who have also been paid handsomely. Mr. Bloomberg has paid $700,000 to Global Strategy Group and $133,000 to Brilliant Corners, the firm run by Cornell Belcher, a former pollster for Mr. Obama. The campaign also paid $692,000 to Marathon Strategies, a consultancy founded by a Democratic strategist, Phil Singer.One of Mr. Bloomberg's paid consultants was also identified as a top endorser and as his ""national political chair:"" Michael Nutter, the former mayor of Philadelphia. Mr. Nutter's company has billed the Bloomberg campaign for $15,000 of services.Mr. Bloomberg's report also indicated the fluid relationship between the people and resources deployed for his campaign and those nominally attached to his private company. The report included $12 million in payments to Mr. Bloomberg's company, Bloomberg LP, that were listed as prepayments for campaign expenses. A campaign aide said those funds, and several other expenditures linked to Bloomberg LP, were intended to cover expenses the company would incur as a result of the campaign, including compensation for corporate employees who have shifted over to his political operation.But it was unclear how many people that money was used to pay, and the F.E.C. report offered no way to verify exactly how the money was used.In addition on Friday, a super PAC supporting Mr. Biden announced that it had raised $7.6 million ""to date,"" and revealed some of its donors -- those who had given a combined $3.7 million in 2019 -- for the first time.The largest contributor, George Marcus, a California real estate investor, gave $1 million.A dozen other donors gave at least $100,000, including: the investor Bernard L. Schwarz; Alan Leventhal, founder of Beacon Capital Partners; Joe Kiani, founder of Masimo; and Barry Gorin, the C.E.O. of a leading commercial real estate company. Executives with The Blackstone Group combined to add another $200,000.Mr. Biden has pledged not to accept contributions from the fossil fuel industry but his super PAC, which cannot legally coordinate with the campaign, is not bound by that edict. The super PAC received $50,000 from Richard Slifka, who was listed as an executive with the Global Petroleum Corp.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.PhotographMichael R. Bloomberg in Miami on Sunday. His first filing with the F.E.C. shows that he spent $132 million on TV ads so far.

| Jump to first hitMr. Sanders had mostly avoided going on the offensive in 2019, but with his standing in the polls rising, he saw an opening to criticize Mr. Biden on the Iraq war and Social Security -- and he took it.DES MOINES -- When Joseph R. Biden Jr. released a video on Tuesday night suggesting that Bernie Sanders's campaign was engaging in ""dishonest attacks"" over Mr. Biden's record on Social Security, it created an opportunity that some Sanders advisers had hoped for months would come.The Sanders campaign's in-house advertising team had already created a video attacking Mr. Biden's record on Social Security but had not released it, waiting for the right moment, aides said. Internally, some feared it might be perceived as negative campaigning. But after watching Mr. Biden's video, Mr. Sanders and his advisers agreed: It was go time.The decision to release the video, which used Mr. Biden's own words from years ago about freezing Social Security, constituted part of a striking shift for Mr. Sanders. Through much of 2019, he had resisted mounting forceful attacks on Mr. Biden, seeing it as a risky tactic and counter to Mr. Sanders's policy-focused brand. Though some of Mr. Sanders's aides have been in attack mode for months, firing salvos on social media at Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, Mr. Sanders has largely avoided going on offense himself, dodging questions from reporters meant to instigate and distancing himself from supporters' negative comments.Yet as the Iowa caucuses approach, with his advisers urging him to be more aggressive, a resurgent Mr. Sanders has been more assertive against Mr. Biden, infusing his campaign with a harder edge.""When people want to attack, we will counterpunch, and we will counterpunch very aggressively,"" Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, said in an interview Wednesday.Social Security, he added, ""was one of the areas that we had always planned on having a distinction that never fully got an opportunity to air itself.""""Now,"" he said, ""we're having that opportunity.""Using the airstrike that killed one of Iran's top military commanders as an opening, Mr. Sanders has ramped up his criticism of Mr. Biden's vote to authorize the war in Iraq. And he has begun highlighting Mr. Biden's record on Social Security, a new line of attack that Mr. Sanders's advisers believe will help him appeal to older voters, particularly African-Americans -- Mr. Biden's most devoted constituency -- and women.The intensifying attacks have coincided with strong showings for Mr. Sanders in several recent polls. A national poll conducted for CNN that was released on Wednesday showed Mr. Sanders with a narrow lead ahead of Mr. Biden. It was the first time Mr. Sanders has led nationally since Mr. Biden entered the race last April, though his lead was within the poll's margin of error. (A second national survey conducted by a different pollster shows Mr. Biden in front.)Mr. Sanders's offensive has also led to more frequent sparring, and heightened tensions, between the campaigns.Over the weekend, Mr. Biden accused the Sanders campaign of deliberately distorting his record on Social Security, prompting Mr. Shakir to issue a scathing attack on Mr. Biden. On Monday, Mr. Sanders apologized to Mr. Biden after a top surrogate for the Sanders campaign published an op-ed that claimed the former vice president had ""a big corruption problem.""Mr. Biden later thanked Mr. Sanders on Twitter for the apology, adding: ""These kinds of attacks have no place in this primary. Let's all keep our focus on making Donald Trump a one-term president.""The truce was short-lived. Mr. Biden continued to fund-raise off the candidates' clashes.And on Tuesday night, there were the dueling videos over Social Security. ""Bernie's campaign is not telling the truth,"" Mr. Biden's video said.Mr. Sanders's video, which he quickly tweeted out on Tuesday night in response, features Mr. Biden saying in the past that he wanted to freeze federal spending including Social Security. ""When I argued if we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well,"" Mr. Biden says. The video then cuts to Mr. Sanders declaring: ""We are not going to cut Social Security, we're going to expand benefits.""In his decades serving as a senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden at times supported freezes and proposals that worried some Social Security advocates. He has also released a plan that calls for strengthening Social Security and expanding certain benefits.On Wednesday morning, in an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" Mr. Biden demurred when asked if the attacks from the Sanders campaign were dishonest. But in suggesting that his past statements on Social Security were being taken out of context, he invoked Mr. Sanders's record on gun control, an area that has previously drawn scrutiny for the senator from Vermont.""It's like my going back and pointing out how Bernie voted against the Brady Bill five times while I was trying to get it passed when he was in the House, or how he voted to, you know, protect gun manufacturers,"" Mr. Biden said. ""It's the only group in America you can't sue. I mean, he's made up for that. He's indicated that was past.""Mr. Biden was referring to Mr. Sanders's opposition in the 1990s to a bill that required background checks for gun purchases, as well as his 2005 vote for a bill that shielded gun manufacturers and dealers from liability lawsuits.As a group of reporters congregated around Mr. Biden at a campaign event in Mason City, Iowa, on Wednesday, Ed O'Keefe of CBS News pressed Mr. Biden on why his campaign had continued to criticize Mr. Sanders, even after Mr. Sanders had apologized for his surrogate's op-ed. ""Why wasn't his apology enough?"" Mr. O'Keefe asked.Mr. Biden responded sharply.""Why why why why!"" Mr. Biden repeated, briefly grabbing Mr. O'Keefe's lapels. ""You're getting nervous, man! Calm down. It's O.K. He apologized for saying that I was corrupt. He didn't say anything about whether or not I was telling the truth about Social Security.""Mr. Sanders's newly combative posture has been met with some relief inside his campaign: With the two men competing for an overlapping slice of working-class voters, some top aides have been quietly urging Mr. Sanders to draw more explicit contrasts with the former vice president. Not only would such an offensive help Mr. Sanders whittle away at Mr. Biden's support, some advisers believe, but it would also satisfy supporters and donors to Mr. Sanders who crave a fight. Some also think he pulled punches against Hillary Clinton in 2016, to his detriment.Since the fall, they have encouraged him to go after Mr. Biden aggressively on the debate stage, a strategy Mr. Sanders followed tepidly. During the debate last week in Des Moines, some advisers had prodded Mr. Sanders to confront Mr. Biden on Social Security and were frustrated the topic did not come up.Mr. Sanders seemed to telegraph his willingness to engage in rougher campaigning during a question-and-answer session with reporters this month in Iowa City.""We will contrast records -- nothing wrong with that,"" he said. ""That is what a serious campaign is about.""Aides say Mr. Sanders has been true to his word, highlighting differences in his record while adhering to his longstanding opposition to personal attacks.""Senator Sanders's career has been one of saying, 'I can win on the merits of our positive argument and the values and the vision that we have for this country,""' Mr. Shakir said, adding that to the extent the campaign has gone after other candidates, ""we have done so on record and on the issues.""""What he has always felt very strongly is, we don't do negative character attacks,"" Mr. Shakir said.There have been other instances of sniping between the two campaigns. Earlier in the race, with the Iowa caucuses a distant date on the horizon, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden took aim at each other over health care, with both arguing that their position was the only one that made sense. Mr. Sanders backs ""Medicare for all,"" a single-payer program that would eliminate private insurance, while Mr. Biden views such a proposal as too costly and complex and instead favors fixes to the existing health care system and the addition of a public option.Mr. Sanders has also criticized Mr. Biden over his support for the North American Free Trade Agreement from almost the moment Mr. Biden jumped into the race.But unlike those clashes, which played out before many voters had tuned into the race, their recent fights have taken place in the caldron of primary season, with media attention at a high point and their fate in the Iowa caucuses at stake.On Wednesday, Sanders officials marveled that Mr. Biden was perpetuating an argument they believe only favors them. Protecting Social Security is a perennial issue in general election campaigns because it affects so many voters and polls as a top priority, especially with the sort of older caucusgoers Mr. Biden is counting on in Iowa. But it has scarcely come up in this contest, in part because so much of the Democratic debate has centered on health care.Mr. Sanders's aides had all but given up hope that their relentless baiting of Mr. Biden on the topic would draw a response. Then a voter raised the issue with Mr. Biden over the weekend, prompting him to accuse the Sanders campaign of doctoring a video against him, which revived the issue.Still, it was unclear whether the former vice president's campaign wanted to fully engage on the fight -- until Tuesday, when it released the video condemning Mr. Sanders's attacks. That spurred Mr. Shakir to pronounce it the first negative commercial of the primary.And it was all the prompting Mr. Sanders needed to return fire.Reporting was contributed by Katie Glueck from Mason City, Iowa; Jonathan Martin from Dubuque, Iowa; Thomas Kaplan from Washington; and Matt Stevens from New York.PhotographA CNN poll that was released on Wednesday showed Senator Bernie Sanders with a narrow lead over former Vice President Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitMr. Biden has largely relied on the perception that he is the best-positioned candidate to beat President Trump.Welcome to Poll Watch, our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election .Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s presidential campaign has been defined by what it's not as much as by what it is. He hasn't made waves with big-ticket policy proposals, and he has mostly avoided skirmishing with his Democratic rivals.And so, nine months into his campaign, Mr. Biden is in a remarkably similar position to where he was when he began: He's the presumptive front-runner, despite a lack of agenda-setting plans or breathless enthusiasm from supporters.Poll results can help us understand why. For one thing, Democratic voters appear to want a candidate who they think has a good chance of beating President Trump more than one whose policy views sync up perfectly with their own.In a Monmouth University poll last month, this question was put to likely Democratic primary voters nationwide: Would you prefer a strong nominee who could defeat Mr. Trump, even if you disagree with that candidate on most issues -- or a candidate with whom you see eye to eye, but who would have difficulty overcoming the president?Almost twice as many respondents chose the candidate with a better chance of winning.Polls suggest that Mr. Biden's support is built largely on these very voters, who are seeking an experienced leader to reverse the Trump administration's policies.In a CNN poll last month, 40 percent of likely Democratic voters who responded said they thought Mr. Biden would be the strongest candidate against Mr. Trump. Only 16 percent pointed to Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mr. Biden's closest rival.Democrats across demographics tend to agree that beating Mr. Trump is the main priority. As a result, Mr. Biden has built a remarkably broad coalition of voters, with support cutting across race, gender and educational background.But a degree of insecurity still lingers. The former vice president has faced strikingly few challenges from his rivals or from debate moderators in recent months -- a boon to his candidacy that could evaporate if his opponents' tactics change.""A core part of his support has never been driven by enthusiasm for him -- it's driven by a sense that he's the safe choice,"" said Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute.""Unlike Sanders, whose core support is very much gung-ho for him and knows what they signed up for, Biden's supporters are looking for the strongest candidate,"" Mr. Murray added. ""He has so far survived that examination, but that doesn't mean it can't change over the next few weeks.""Indeed, Mr. Biden's support dipped for weeks in the fall amid a surge from Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who was seen as possibly more capable of uniting the moderate and left wings of the Democratic Party. But her polling numbers began to waver after her support for ""Medicare for all"" drew criticism, and much of Mr. Biden's support appeared to stabilize.Democratic voters have grown more liberal over the past two decades, but moderates now feel more alienated from an increasingly ideological Republican Party than they did a generation ago. As a result, moderate voters still tend to lean Democratic, and they make up a big enough share of the party to play a decisive role in choosing its nominee.""You have a lot of Democrats who are not beholden to an ideological position but feel comfortable with him,"" Mr. Murray said of Mr. Biden. ""They're coming from all walks of life.""About as many women support Mr. Biden as do men, and he is the most popular candidate among black Democratic voters -- a key constituency, particularly in the primaries. (Mr. Sanders has encroached on that lead, however, and now trails by less than 10 points among African-American voters and other nonwhite voters, according to some national polls.)Just as crucially, Mr. Biden's numbers are as strong among white voters without college degrees as they are among those with a higher education. That puts him at a distinct advantage over Ms. Warren and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., two of his strongest opponents.And while Mr. Biden's supporters tend to be slightly more moderate than other candidates' backers, they are generally paying attention to the same issues. They are most likely to list health care as their main policy concern, with climate change second, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released this week. Those results are consistent with the party's voters at large.Mr. Biden has also benefited from the fact that Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to be looking for a leader with solid political experience, according to a multilevel analysis of voter preferences published this month by Monmouth. Mr. Biden, who was first elected to the Senate 48 years ago, is by far the most popular candidate among Democrats who prioritize experience in a nominee: Forty-four percent of such voters back him, the Monmouth analysis found.Finding an experienced leader matters particularly to voters of color, especially women of color, the study found.Mr. Biden's one major vulnerability is among young people. Polls of Iowa, New Hampshire and the nation at large consistently find him polling below 20 percent among voters under 50.And if he does not rack up decisive victories in the earliest-voting states over the coming two months, he could be vulnerable to the growing challenge of Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, who entered the race in late November and is not competing in the earliest states.Polls show that Mr. Bloomberg is strongest among older voters, black people and moderate or conservative Democrats -- all crucial elements of Mr. Biden's coalition.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has continued to stay on top of many polls, in large part by presenting himself as the best option to beat President Trump.

| Jump to first hitWe usually tell stories. This called for something different.From the start of the coronavirus outbreak, ""The Daily"" has devoted several episodes to the epidemic, recounting the story of the virus's journey across China and exploring how the Chinese government's approach seemed to worsen the crisis.By the middle of this week, as the virus started to spread across the Middle East and Europe, we debated the best way to tell the story. We typically build episodes around a narrative, emphasizing characters, drama and ideas. But this situation was different. The virus had become an epidemic on an increasingly global scale. It required something else.Executive producer Lisa Tobin proposed the audio equivalent of an F.A.Q. about the coronavirus, a break in our normal form. Our producer, Alexandra Leigh Young, who works closely with The Times's Science desk, hunted for the right guest: somebody who could explain the disease in simple terms and put the epidemic into historical context.Soon enough, Alexandra was on the phone with Donald G. McNeil Jr., a reporter with decades of experience covering epidemics from SARS to MERS to Zika. We asked him every question we had about the coronavirus. Why is this virus so contagious? How does it spread? Who gets it? Who dies from it? Is there a cure?And of course, this: Just how scared should we be?Donald did not mince words.""If things don't change, a lot of us might die,"" he told us.He had chosen his words carefully.""I spend a lot of time thinking about whether I'm being too alarmist or whether I'm being not alarmist enough,"" he said in the interview.Many of you have written to us -- and Donald -- to say how grateful you were for his explanations.As the epidemic spreads and, according to public health officials, likely intensifies in the United States, we will keep trying to find ways to document and explain it in ways that are calm, candid and lucid, no matter what the information may be.Talk to Michael on Twitter: @mikiebarb .The question of masksWe asked Donald G. McNeil Jr., our reporter on Thursday's episode about the coronavirus , for some clarity about what we should and shouldn't be doing with masks.Do masks work?It depends. Masks keep the droplets from a sick person's coughs and sneezes in so that others don't catch them.But flat surgical masks don't help people stay healthy, because air can get in around the edges, and because they encourage people to fiddle with their faces to adjust their masks.More important than a mask is washing your hands a lot, using hand sanitizer and keeping your fingers away from your eyes, nose and mouth. You're more likely to pick up the flu from touching some surface than from a droplet drifting through the air.Should I buy masks?Don't go buy N-95 masks. The country's limited supply of N-95 masks will be needed by doctors and nurses, who have to change masks frequently, or they risk spreading the virus from infected patients to uninfected ones.The only non-medical people who need to wear masks are sick people, not well ones. Anybody who's sick would ideally stay inside, and if they have to leave the house, wear a mask.People who really feel better wearing a mask should wear the big cloth ones that cover their whole chin and the bottom of their face. (You can even sew your own.) These masks are harder to stick a finger inside and risk touching your nose or mouth. Plus, you can wash and reuse them.You can find the latest updates on the coronavirus here , and more information about how to prepare here .Indecision in South CarolinaOn today's episode of ""The Field,"" producers Clare Toeniskoetter and Annie Brown traveled to South Carolina with Astead Herndon, a politics reporter for The Times. The team met with black community leaders, whose support is crucial for winning the state's primary.As Astead points out in the episode, ""Year after year, black voters have largely coalesced around a singular Democratic candidate."" And yet, this doesn't seem to be the case in South Carolina.Clare has been following the campaign trail through Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and now South Carolina. ""Over the past year, candidates have directed much of their energy on the early voting states,"" she told us. ""In spite of this, we're still seeing so many undecided voters.""Annie agreed. ""Something that's so fascinating is how many people don't know who they're voting for as they're driving to the polls. Ultimately, they have to make a game-time decision. The forces that drive them in the voting booth are kind of mysterious.""You can listen to the story here or by searching for ""The Field"" wherever you get your podcasts.On 'The Daily' this weekMonday: ""This is the first time that a major investor has genuinely taken on the issue of climate change.""

| Jump to first hitSurvey results suggests their views and priorities are far more alike than different, despite labels like moderate or progressive, centrist or liberal.The four Democratic candidates at the top of the polls heading into the Iowa caucuses have been paired by pundits into what they like to call lanes. It's a highway analogy, as in ""stay in your lane."" One, seen as more progressive and liberal, contains Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The other, consisting of Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, is more centrist and moderate.But do most voters actually think this way? Our research suggests otherwise. Ideological labels -- whether people think of themselves as a liberal or moderate -- do distinguish candidates' supporters. But when it comes to specifics, most Democratic voters have remarkably similar views on policies and prioritize these issues in roughly the same ways.We interviewed more than 150,000 people around the nation, tens of thousands of whom intend to vote in the Democratic primaries and caucuses. Our data come from the Democracy Fund + U.C.L.A. Nationscape Project and include questions on 41 policies currently being debated. The data span the last six months and cover issues like whether to increase taxes on households earning more than $250,000 a year, or whether transgender people should be prohibited from serving in the military.As we looked at similarities and differences of views among Democratic supporters of six candidates seeking the presidential nomination for president, we found an impressive amount of consensus, regardless of whom they support.In addition to asking people whether they agree with policy outcomes, all of them also answered a series of questions that allowed us to measure the importance they attach to each issue. Here's how that worked: Each person saw two randomly selected collections of up to four policy positions, and we asked them to choose which collection of outcomes they preferred. All of them did this 10 times and, in the course of doing so, revealed which positions they prioritized and which ones were relatively less important.We compared the outcomes across supporters of the four Iowa front-runners, as well as Amy Klobuchar (although we had less data on her supporters). Despite differences in the demographics of people who support them and their ideological labels, there were few differences in the beliefs and priorities of the candidates' supporters.All of the candidates' supporters wanted to impeach Mr. Trump and placed that issue in the top five priorities among the 41 things we asked about. (We wrote about the prominence of this previously.) But it is not the only thing Democratic voters agree on.All of the candidates' supporters believe that preventing a complete ban on abortion is a top priority, with support ranging from 82 percent among Ms. Klobuchar's backers to 91 percent for Mr. Buttigieg's, and with priorities ranging from first to fourth in importance.Not separating children from their families at the border is a popular issue, too. In terms of priorities, it's the most important issue for supporters of Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders and comes in second for Mr. Biden's voters, fourth for Ms. Warren's group and eighth for Ms. Klobuchar's.Other top issues with tremendous support among these candidates' backers and with high-priority status include not building a border wall, not banning Muslims from entering the country, offering a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers and doing background checks before gun purchases.Perhaps surprisingly, one thing that's not a top priority for anyone's supporters is health care. We offered voters four chances to prioritize health care by asking them about enacting ""Medicare for all""; providing all Americans with the option to buy government-run health insurance; subsidizing health insurance for lower-income people not receiving Medicare or Medicaid; and providing government-run health insurance to all Americans.Enacting Medicare for all is the one health-related policy that voters put in the top half of the 41 issues we asked about, but there weren't significant differences across the candidate groups: No one's supporters put it in the top 10.Mr. Sanders's supporters may place slightly more importance on subsidizing low-income health care relative to the others, and Ms. Warren's supporters join them with respect to the importance of providing government-run insurance to everyone, but these differences are not big, and the issues still rank lower than many other policies.A few interesting differences emerged. The fifth-most important issue for Mr. Buttigieg's supporters is investing in a big, technology-based solution to climate change -- something that all Democratic voters want (almost 90 percent across all the candidates' supporters) but that no other bloc thinks is a priority. Similarly, supporters of Ms. Klobuchar stood out by ranking 12 weeks of paid maternity leave as the most important issue.But examples like these were rare. When most people agree on policies, vote choice may largely turn on other factors, like a perception that a candidate is more dedicated to fighting for those policies; the probability of beating an incumbent president in the general election; a wish to give a new generation the chance to run things; the hope of putting a woman in the White House.Of course, similarities across voters on policy preferences don't imply similarities across candidates, and some voters will care about the distinctions even if, on average, everyone's supporters want the same things. What's clear is that policies aren't driving division among most of the supporters of these candidates. If there is a fight for the future of the Democratic Party, it doesn't appear to be playing out in terms of what voters want from their government. On that, no matter whom they may vote for in the primary, Democratic voters appear to be driving on a one-lane road.Lynn Vavreck, the Marvin Hoffenberg Professor of American Politics and Public Policy at U.C.L.A., is a co-author of ""Identity Crisis: The 2016 Presidential Campaign and the Battle for the Meaning of America.""

| Jump to first hitAmerican politics were rewired after the Great Recession. The current crisis could shake things up again.Hi. Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Lisa Lerer, your host.Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.During the Great Recession, with the economy in free fall, Congress rushed to pass the largest bailout and stimulus measures in American history. Those decisions helped stabilize the American economy but shook up the political landscape, birthing the conservative Tea Party movement and revitalizing progressive politics.The $2 trillion economic stabilization package expected to be finalized this week makes the $700 billion Wall Street bailout in 2008 and the $800 billion stimulus bill in 2009 look like pocket change.Like the Great Recession, this current national crisis could have political implications that reverberate far longer than the public health and economic impacts. Activists on both the right and the left say this mind-boggling amount of government spending could rewire our politics, perhaps in extraordinary ways.""This crisis is exposing a lot of problems and vulnerabilities and injustices,"" said Sarah Miller, head of the American Economic Liberties Project, a new organization dedicated to pushing government to confront corporate power. ""Now, this bill is really laying them out into the sunshine for the public.""For critics of the legislation, the devil is in the details. Sure, the bill includes something for everyone: loans and grants for corporations and small businesses, increased unemployment benefits for workers who are laid off or working fewer hours, and direct payments of $1,200 per adult and $500 per child for low- and middle-income individuals and families.But the biggest portion of spending -- more than $500 billion -- goes to large corporations and industries. Provisions include $32 billion for the airline industry, $17 billion for ""businesses critical to maintaining national security""-- a category seen as intended at least partly for Boeing -- and a tweak to federal tax law sought by restaurants and retailers that could save their industries $15 billion a year.Some companies owned by the family of President Trump's son-in-law and White House adviser, Jared Kushner, could benefit. And despite Democratic efforts, Mr. Trump's companies would not be prohibited from benefiting from some elements of the bill.And that may be only the first round of spending.""Everything about this is deeply concerning,"" said Jenny Beth Martin, a co-founder of one of the first Tea Party organizations, the Tea Party Patriots. ""There are going to be so many unintended consequences from the month of March 2020. It will be years before we sort out what just happened.""Yet, for Tea Party supporters like Ms. Martin, the situation is complicated. For years, they excoriated big government, helping to elect a new class of lawmakers determined to slash spending.That is, until Mr. Trump took office.Mr. Trump's incoming chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and his departing acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, both tied their congressional careers to the Tea Party movement. Now, Mr. Mulvaney, Mr. Meadows and other Tea Party politicians are top supporters of the administration -- and of the record-breaking level of spending pushed by the White House, even before the coronavirus crisis.All have been cautious not to use the B-word (bailout) or even the S-word (stimulus) when it comes to describing the economic stabilization package.Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, a group that helped fund and organize Tea Party activists, drew a firm distinction between the 2008 bailout and today's package.""This is very different than in 2008-2009, which was an abject cronyistic bailout,"" said Mr. Phillips, who said he had discussed the package on town-hall-style events conducted via telephone with thousands of his group's supporters. ""The American public gets that this is a very different situation. It affects almost everyone.""That position may be hard to maintain if the money becomes, as critics fear, a ""slush fund"" for big corporations. Senate Democrats successfully maneuvered to include more oversight and transparency in the legislation, but how the Treasury Department handles the distribution of the funds will be closely watched, particularly as average Americans struggle to survive the crisis.During the previous administration, the Wall Street bailout came to be associated with President Barack Obama even though it was passed under his predecessor. Some liberal activists unhappy with the program were reluctant to drive their economic message against a president popular with progressives.They will face no such hesitation this time around, with Mr. Trump's administration providing an easy foil and prominent leaders of the movement -- like Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York -- already making their case.""We see this giant slush fund that Steven Mnuchin has a lot of authority over with limited strings attached,"" Ms. Miller said, referring to the Treasury secretary. ""This was a bill that fundamentally restructures our economy, and while it does provide some critical help, it also is going to exacerbate these massive imbalances of economic power.""Coronavirus ad wars continueSuper PACs supporting Democrats have clearly struck a nerve with their ads on the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus.In Tuesday's newsletter, we took a look at the roughly $12 million being spent by Democratic outside groups attacking President Trump for his comments this year playing down the severity of the coronavirus outbreak. One particularly stark ad came from Priorities USA, a major Democratic super PAC, showing the exponential curve of coronavirus cases trending upward as Mr. Trump's voice is heard saying that ""this is their new hoax"" and that ""we have it totally under control.""On Wednesday, the Trump campaign sent a cease-and-desist letter to television stations across the country, telling them to stop airing the ad from Priorities USA because it contained false representations of Mr. Trump's remarks, particularly the word ""hoax."" The president and his supporters have said that he was referring to Democrats' criticism of his response to the virus, not to the virus itself.In response, officials at Priorities USA announced today that they were expanding their ad buy, effectively thumbing their noses at the Trump campaign by spending $600,000 to air the ad in Arizona. The group previously announced it would spend $6 million to run the ad in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida.""The fact that Trump is going to such great lengths to keep the American people from hearing his own words adds to the urgency of communicating them far and wide,"" said Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, in a statement announcing the new ad buy in Arizona. ""Trump doesn't want voters to know the truth. We will not be intimidated.""The ""hoax"" remark, which was also featured in an ad by Unite the Country, a super PAC supporting Joe Biden, led Fox News to decline to air it, as we reported in yesterday's newsletter.Drop us a line!In my house, I'm suddenly an elementary schoolteacher, a chef and a sanitization specialist. (P.S.: I'm not great at any of it.)How has the virus changed the dynamics in your family life? Is Dad taking charge of bath time, after years of declining to take the lead?

One of our colleagues interviewed Shiri Kenigsberg Levi, the Israeli mother whose rant over distance learning went viral.From Opinion: Debating the coronavirus responseThe $2 trillion economic stabilization package is intended to mitigate the economic consequences of shutting down the economy. As Times columnist Bret Stephens told Gail Collins in The Conversation, a huge government intervention is what's needed now.""The biggest challenge right now is to keep people and businesses liquid, lest they go bankrupt,"" Stephens said. ""Millions of people are being shut out from their jobs. Businesses across the country are being shut out from their customers. All through no fault of their own, and all on account of government orders. So there's a moral obligation as well as an economic necessity.""But President Trump is seeking an early return to business as usual to jolt an economic recovery. The Editorial Board argues that, ""as the president's own health advisers warn, the worst of the coronavirus pandemic is yet to come,"" and that ""it's time for a national lockdown."" In other words, easing restrictions now would cost lives for the sake of potential economic gain. This trade-off, though, may not be quite what it seems.Times columnist Jamelle Bouie says that the Trump administration has convinced itself ""that an extended lockdown is more harmful than anything the virus can do."" Bouie concludes: ""Trump will sacrifice Americans to coronavirus if it will save the market and his prospects for re-election.""-- Adam Rubenstein...

| Jump to first hitEmboldened by his victory and determined to strike back, the president removed Mr. Sondland as ambassador to the European Union after the White House earlier on Friday dismissed Colonel Vindman.WASHINGTON -- President Trump wasted little time on Friday opening a campaign of retribution against those he blames for his impeachment, firing two of the most prominent witnesses in the House inquiry against him barely 48 hours after being acquitted by the Senate.Emboldened by his victory and determined to strike back, Mr. Trump ordered Gordon D. Sondland, the founder of a hotel chain who donated $1 million to the president's inaugural committee, recalled from his post as the ambassador to the European Union on the same day that Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a decorated Iraq war veteran on the National Security Council staff, was marched out of the White House by security guards.The ousters of Mr. Sondland and Colonel Vindman -- along with Mr. Vindman's brother, Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, an Army officer who also worked on the National Security Council staff -- may only presage a broader effort to even accounts with the president's perceived enemies. In the two days since his acquittal in the Senate, Mr. Trump has railed about those who stood against him, calling them ""evil,"" ""corrupt"" and ""crooked,"" while his press secretary declared that those who hurt the president ""should pay for"" it.Even as he began purging administration officials who testified in the House impeachment inquiry, Mr. Trump assailed a Democratic senator who he had hoped would side with him during the trial but did not and called on the House to ""expunge"" his impeachment because he deems it illegitimate.The flurry of actions and outbursts drew quick condemnation from Democrats, who said the president was demonstrating that he feels unleashed, and complicated the politics of impeachment for moderate Republicans who stood by him while arguing that he had learned his lesson and would be more restrained in the future.""There is no question in the mind of any American why this man's job is over, why this country now has one less soldier serving it at the White House,"" David Pressman, Colonel Vindman's lawyer, said in a statement. ""Lt. Col. Vindman was asked to leave for telling the truth. His honor, his commitment to right, frightened the powerful.""Colonel Vindman spoke publicly only once, after being ordered to under subpoena, Mr. Pressman added. ""And for that, the most powerful man in the world -- buoyed by the silent, the pliable and the complicit -- has decided to exact revenge.""Mr. Sondland took a more measured approach, confirming that he had been dismissed without offering any protest.""I was advised today that the president intends to recall me effective immediately as United States ambassador to the European Union,"" he said in a statement hours after Colonel Vindman's dismissal. ""I am grateful to President Trump for having given me the opportunity to serve, to Secretary Pompeo for his consistent support and to the exceptional and dedicated professionals at the U.S. Mission to the European Union.""Mr. Sondland and Colonel Vindman were key witnesses in the House impeachment hearings. Mr. Sondland, who was deeply involved in the effort to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into Mr. Trump's Democratic rivals, testified that ""we followed the president's orders"" and that ""everyone was in the loop."" Colonel Vindman, who was on Mr. Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, testified that it was ""improper for the president"" to coerce a foreign country to investigate a political opponent.It may have been untenable for them to keep working for a president with whom they broke so publicly, but the White House made no effort to portray the ousters as anything other than reprisals. Mr. Trump foreshadowed Colonel Vindman's fate hours ahead of time when asked if he would be pushed out. ""Well, I'm not happy with him,"" the president told reporters. ""You think I'm supposed to be happy with him? I'm not.""The president continued to assail lawmakers who voted for conviction, targeting Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, who bitterly disappointed Mr. Trump by sticking with his party. ""I was told by many that Manchin was just a puppet for Schumer & Pelosi,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. ""That's all he is!""Even as Mr. Trump flew to North Carolina to highlight his economic record, he called on the House to ""expunge"" his impeachment, an idea with no precedent or basis in the Constitution. ""They should because it was a hoax,"" he told reporters. ""It was a total political hoax."" And he accused Ms. Pelosi of committing a crime by ripping up a copy of his State of the Union address. ""She broke the law,"" he asserted.The president's critics had warned that he would feel unbound if acquitted, and some said the dismissals proved their point, quickly calling them ""the Friday night massacre,"" as Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, put it.""These are the actions of a man who believes he is above the law,"" said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the lead House impeachment manager. Mr. Schumer said the White House was running from the truth. ""This action is not a sign of strength,"" he said. ""It only shows President Trump's weakness."" Ms. Pelosi said, ""This goes too far."" At the Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. asked the audience to stand in support of Colonel Vindman.The White House would not discuss the Vindman decision. ""We do not comment on personnel matters,"" said John Ullyot, a spokesman for the National Security Council.Donald Trump Jr., the president's eldest son, celebrated the dismissals, offering mock thanks to Mr. Schiff. ""Were it not for his crack investigation skills, @realDonaldTrump might have had a tougher time unearthing who all needed to be fired,"" he tweeted.""The president had every right to make the moves that he did today,"" Representative Lee Zeldin, Republican of New York, said in an interview. ""Moving Lt. Col. Vindman, for example, is a good move based on the fact that there is a lack of trust. He disagrees with the president's policies."" As for Mr. Sondland, ""the president can recall an ambassador at any time with or without cause, and in the case of Gordon Sondland, the guy was a hot mess, anyway.""Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, expressed no regrets over Mr. Sondland's dismissal. ""Somehow I think America will be able to deliver foreign policy without Gordon Sondland,"" he said by text message.Other witnesses have left with less drama recently. Marie L. Yovanovitch, the ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled from her post last spring because she was seen as an obstacle to the president's plans, retired last month from the Foreign Service. William B. Taylor Jr., who replaced her in an acting capacity, was essentially brought back early, as well. And Jennifer Williams, a career official working for Vice President Mike Pence, quietly returned to the Defense Department.Several had already left government, like Fiona Hill, the Europe policy chief at the National Security Council, and Kurt D. Volker, the special envoy for Ukraine, who resigned days before testifying. But others remain, including George P. Kent at the State Department, Laura Cooper at the Defense Department and David Holmes at the embassy in Ukraine.Mr. Sondland began discussions with senior officials about leaving shortly after he testified in November, according to two people briefed on the matter. He believed that remaining would be unrealistic given his role in impeachment and hoped to exit gracefully.A decision on timing was postponed until after impeachment, but on Friday, State Department officials told Mr. Sondland that they wanted him to resign, the people said. Mr. Sondland relayed to them that he would not step down amid what was clearly a purge of impeachment witnesses and that he would have to be fired, they said. In response, State Department officials recalled him.Colonel Vindman's brother seemed to be collateral damage. Yevgeny Vindman, who goes by Eugene, worked as a lawyer for the National Security Council and had no role in the impeachment hearings other than showing up to sit behind his brother when he appeared in November. He was given no explanation for his dismissal ""despite over two decades of loyal service to this country,"" said Mr. Pressman, the lawyer. ""He deeply regrets that he will not be able to continue his service at the White House.""Both Vindmans, whose White House tours were scheduled to last until July, will retain their Army ranks and return to military service. Alexander Vindman, who had been expecting the move and had begun removing personal items, was told he would go to the Pentagon before moving to the National War College in July as originally planned. Yevgeny Vindman was more surprised and was told he would report to the office of the Army general counsel.Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said service members who return to the military would be welcomed back. ""We protect all of our persons, service members, from retribution or anything like that,"" he told reporters.Mr. Trump, on the other hand, has made clear his personal antipathy for both Vindmans. ""Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother, right?"" he said on Thursday during a rambling hourlong venting session at the White House, his voice dripping with disdain. ""We had some people that -- really amazing.""On Friday, Mr. Trump retweeted a message from a supporter advocating Alexander Vindman's dismissal: ""Vindman's behavior is a scandal. He should be removed from the @RealDonaldTrump White House ASAP to protect our foreign policy from his machinations.""Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican who voted to acquit the president but expressed hope that he would learn a lesson from the impeachment, said witnesses should not be punished. ""I obviously am not in favor of any kind of retribution against anyone who came forward with evidence,"" she said in Maine, according to The Portland Press Herald.Colonel Vindman has been subjected to virulent attacks on his patriotism on Fox News and social media. The president called him a ""Never Trumper,"" a term the colonel rejected. Fox aired a segment suggesting his service in the White House might amount to ""espionage."" And Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, attacked him on Twitter: ""How patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America's greatest enemy?""With impeachment over, Mr. Trump is debating additional personnel changes. Some advisers are encouraging him to part ways with his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who was involved in freezing security aid to Ukraine, which paved the way for impeachment.Other advisers are telling Mr. Trump to delay major changes until after the November election. Some hope that Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, will join the White House as a senior adviser. Mr. Meadows traveled with the president on Friday to North Carolina.Mr. Trump denied that Mr. Mulvaney would be pushed out in favor of Mr. Meadows. ""I have a great relationship with Mick,"" the president told reporters on Friday. ""I have a great relationship with Mark. And it's false.""Peter Baker and Michael S.

| Jump to first hitThe billionaire has deployed his corporation in service of his presidential bid, producing slick events and recruiting staff members with unusually high pay and other perks.MIAMI -- In a warehouse covered in murals in the Design District here, cater waiters served wine and platters of Cuban sandwiches, summer rolls and kosher pigs in a blanket. They wore all black but for red, white and blue T-shirts reading ""I Like Mike Bloomberg.""Before the candidate took the stage -- set against an oversize painting reading ""Mike 2020"" that a local artist had been paid thousands to produce in 36 hours -- the former mayor of Miami Beach, Philip Levine, introduced him.""We both started from nothing, and we made a few bucks,"" Mr. Levine said, proudly likening himself to Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who announced his run for president in November. ""But he's got more zeros at the end of his name than I do.""Mr. Bloomberg, the multibillionaire behind Bloomberg L.P., has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the race, paying to make his voice omnipresent on television and radio. He has deployed his corporation in service of his campaign, reassigning employees from the various arms of his empire and recruiting new ones with powerful financial incentives, including full benefits and salaries well above national campaign norms.Entry-level field organizing work for Mr. Bloomberg, for example, pays $72,000 annually -- nearly twice what other campaigns have offered. In under 12 weeks, Mr. Bloomberg's operation has grown to a staff of thousands, with more than 125 offices around the country and a roster of slick events featuring swag, drinks and canapés.Such spending has helped make Mr. Bloomberg an increasingly strong contender in the Democratic presidential primary. While Senator Bernie Sanders, the leading progressive, has emerged as a front-runner in an exceedingly tight race, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has faltered and several other candidates have splintered the moderate vote that Mr. Bloomberg hopes to capture in the Super Tuesday contests on March 3.In the first quarter of his campaign alone, Mr. Bloomberg, who is not accepting political donations, spent $188 million -- more than what numerous candidates in the race had spent combined. Seventy percent of that went toward advertising. Millions went toward rent, including for the campaign's Times Square headquarters as well as furnished apartments on Manhattan's East Side where some staff members are living.Millions more have paid a robust network of consultants, lawyers and campaign staff members -- some of whom are new to the speculative work of electioneering and are finding it oddly lucrative.'He's buying the ground war'For David Enriquez, a 23-year-old recent graduate of the University of Florida now acting as a field organizer for Mr. Bloomberg in Tampa, the pay came as a surprise. ""I was expecting 30,000 a year, essentially till March, so whatever that is,"" he said, referring to a salary that would have translated to $2,500 monthly. He is receiving more than twice that -- $6,000 a month -- and he expects his work will continue through November, given Mr. Bloomberg's pledge to support the Democratic effort to unseat President Trump regardless of whether his own name is on the ballot.""I was just going to pay the minimum payment on my credit card for an extended period, but when I found out what my salary was, I was like, 'Wow,""' Mr. Enriquez said.The campaign's pay for field organizers, the equivalent of $72,000 annually, is well above the $42,000 that other campaigns have offered. Bloomberg staff members have also been issued campaign-owned electronics, including Apple laptops and the latest-generation iPhones, which a spokeswoman said were distributed with cybersecurity in mind.""I was paid $15 a day as an organizer for Ted Kennedy in 1980,"" said Joe Trippi, a longtime Democratic strategist, referring to a rate that, adjusted for inflation, would amount to roughly $1,500 monthly today.Mr. Trippi called substantial pay such as what Mr. Bloomberg was offering plausible for a campaign's staff members in key early-voting states, like Iowa or New Hampshire, but highly unusual as a standard for employees across regions -- and even more so for the apparent sense of job security through the fall. ""That's never happened before,"" he said.Reflecting similar premiums, Mr. Bloomberg's state communications directors and state political directors uniformly receive $12,000 monthly, according to the campaign, while state press secretaries make $10,000 monthly and the campaign's national political director commands $30,000 a month, or $360,000 annually.""Everyone knows that campaigning is hard work, long hours and lousy pay,"" said Stu Loeser, a Bloomberg campaign spokesman. ""We can't change the first two, but we can do something about the third.""For employees working at the New York headquarters, the campaign also offers three meals daily and unlimited snacks in a central cafe that acts as a hub of the office. In late December alone, according to the campaign's first filing with the Federal Election Commission, it paid more than $16,000 to a sushi restaurant in Manhattan as well as roughly $200,000 to FLIK Hospitality, a catering company.James A. Thurber, a professor of government who founded the Campaign Management Institute at American University, said money was an unlikely motivator in campaign work, but he called some of Mr. Bloomberg's spending necessary.""Since he's gotten in so late, he's got to pay above-market salaries to get good people to jump in at all levels,"" Dr. Thurber said. ""You can't win a campaign on an air war,"" he said, referring to a blitz of advertising. ""You've got to have a ground war. He knows that, so he's buying the ground war.""Events with brie, fig jam and flatbreadsOn the ground, an aura of abundance has extended to Mr. Bloomberg's campaign events, where an array of shirts and buttons are laid out for the taking. On offer at recent rallies: ""I Like Mike""; ""Women for Mike""; ""Ganamos con Mike""; ""United for Mike,"" with a Jewish star; ""Mishpucha for Mike""; as well as permutations tailored to different states -- ""Florida for Mike,"" unembellished; ""Florida for Mike,"" decorated with palm trees.For a rally in New York City in January, Mr. Bloomberg rented out the very same Times Square hotel ballroom in which he had celebrated one of his mayoral victories, with a D.J. presiding and wine and beer and goat cheese puffs on hand for all.At a Philadelphia rally last week, more than 1,000 people were offered cheese steaks, hoagies and platters of honey-coated brie, fig jam and gourmet flatbreads. Michael Dacosta, who was posted up at one of the drinks stations, raved about the selection, expressing regret that he had eaten at Papa John's beforehand. ""I think it's classy,"" said Mr. Dacosta, a New Yorker who'd paid $55 to have ""Let's Get Bloomin Again"" embroidered on his bomber jacket but also grabbed a ""PA for Mike"" shirt.""He's generous,"" Mr. Dacosta said, as colorful lights projected Mr. Bloomberg's name on a wall of the National Constitution Center, where the rally was held. ""I feel like it's a nightclub in here. This is what he needs to get people going.""The fanfare has also drawn some who don't plan to vote for the billionaire. ""Don't get me wrong, I like Mike Bloomberg,"" said Ramon Vivas, who attended Mr. Bloomberg's Miami rally in January and wore one of the free shirts bearing that message, along with two Bloomberg buttons. ""But I don't think he's going to get the nomination, and I support Bernie.""Still, Mr. Vivas said he thought the Democratic Party had ""moved too far to the left"" and called Mr. Bloomberg a good influence on the race, adding that at other rallies he'd attended, ""you typically have to pay for the T-shirts.""The large-scale painting that Cindy Franco, the Miami artist, produced -- a colorful streetscape decorated with the candidate's name and ""Miami Will Get It Done,"" a variation on the campaign's slogan -- was a central backdrop for little more than an hour.""I only had a day and a half to make it,"" said Ms. Franco, who worked round the clock in the Miami warehouse with security guards provided by the campaign on hand. ""They were always asking if I needed anything,"" she said, declining to specify exactly how much she was paid, but adding: ""It was a lot. They were very good to me."" (The campaign did not name the amount, which it will be required to report in its next federal filing.)A virtually limitless budgetDay-to-day, some Bloomberg campaign workers with prior political experience, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about their work for Mr. Bloomberg, described what they saw as an unfathomable luxury: the ability to brainstorm and act on their ideas without concern for costs. The campaign has, for instance, hired 70 staff members in Florida and opened field offices in Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands.But being forced to think about how to stretch dollars in politics can have its advantages, Mr. Trippi said, recalling that in 2004 -- when he worked for Howard Dean's campaign, which broke the record at that time for Democratic presidential fund-raising -- ""a lot of the things we pioneered were exactly because we had to be that creative.""Nonetheless, he added, laughing: ""Picking between the advantage of being a little bit more creative with your money, versus having the money to do whatever you want to do -- most campaigns would pick having more money.""Dr. Thurber, the American University professor, said that self-funding a campaign could make it difficult to know a candidate's true popularity. ""When you've got a lot of money, you can try all kinds of strategies and tactics, and also have the money to measure whether they're working or not,"" he said. ""But in a primary, small donors are really the invisible measure of how excited people are about you.""Financially invested supporters, no matter the size of their donations, also tend to be more loyal and engaged, Mr. Trippi said. ""If I give $10 to a candidate, I'm much more likely to stay with them and do other things, like call my friend about them,"" he said. ""There's buy-in.""Mr. Bloomberg has crisscrossed the country hoping for emotional buy-in. He has come and gone on a schedule, reflecting a candidate famously focused on efficiency. A Bloomberg L.P. plane has often been waiting to shuttle him to the next destination, with pilot costs and in-flight catering expenses also figuring into the recent report to election authorities.For some younger staff members, the degree to which the campaign's finances are unusual has not necessarily registered. ""I wasn't surprised because I actually didn't know how much field organizers make,"" said Jordy Portugal, a 22-year-old who recently graduated from Columbia University and lives in Queens.Mr. Portugal said that he had weighed joining the Bloomberg campaign or accepting a job at a media company that would have paid him a salary amounting to roughly $4,700 a month -- significantly less than what he now makes placing calls and canvassing voters for Mr. Bloomberg.""Bloomberg's pay has helped me,"" he said. ""But I don't have any prior experience to look at it and say, 'Wow, these are amazing benefits and experiences,""' he said, adding that the food the campaign provided reminded him of a stint working at a tech company. ""This was more an opportunity for me to make an impact.""For other supporters, the depth of Mr. Bloomberg's coffers is central to his appeal.""I can't tell you the pleasure of having someone call me and ask, 'Who are important people in the community?""' said Patricia Halfen Wexler, a venture capitalist who spoke in support of Mr. Bloomberg at one of his recent rallies, ""and to not have to think, 'Who can give money?""'PhotographMichael R.

| Jump to first hitCan a woman win in 2020? Answering the electability question with election results.DES MOINES -- After nearly an hour, the question that progressives had been fearing finally arrived. Senator Bernie Sanders laughed. Senator Elizabeth Warren did not.""I didn't say it,"" Mr. Sanders insisted, with Ms. Warren turning his way, as he denied her explosive account that he told her privately in 2018 that a woman could not win the presidency.""Bernie is my friend,"" Ms. Warren replied firmly, disputing his memory, ""and I am not here to try and fight with Bernie. But, look, this question about whether or not a woman can be president has been raised and it's time for us to attack it head-on.""All through this Democratic primary, voters have worried aloud about the thorny subject of electability, wondering if a woman -- even a woman they might support -- would be able to defeat President Trump.In her exchange with Mr. Sanders on Tuesday, Ms. Warren hoped to turn the issue on its head, noting that of all those onstage, only the women, Ms. Warren and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, had won all of their major elections and later observing that the party's success in the 2018 midterms was powered largely by female candidates and voters.She also made it known that no one else here had defeated a Republican incumbent in the last three decades, a statistic Mr. Sanders moved to rebut, citing his House victory in 1990.""Wasn't that 30 years ago?"" she asked, turning to the crowd like an actor breaking the fourth wall in a sitcom.""I beat an incumbent Republican congressman,"" Mr. Sanders repeated, emphasizing that 1990 was indeed 30 years ago.""I don't know if that's the major issue of the day,"" he concluded.But the context was.In seeking to defuse any concerns about a potential female nominee, Ms. Warren appeared to see no option but to extend, if not expand, a feud her advisers claim she never wanted.Since the beginning of the primary campaign, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have proceeded with a patina of comity, focusing on their mostly shared policy goals and reminding anyone who would listen about their ostensibly genuine mutual admiration.""Bernie and I have been friends for a long, long time,"" Ms. Warren said last month in Ottumwa.""Elizabeth Warren is a very good friend of mine,"" Mr. Sanders told reporters last weekend in Iowa City.But competitive campaigns tend to test the definition of the word.Perhaps this moment, or something like it, was always going to come -- the natural consequence of a contest with these stakes, of two candidates fighting for so many of the same voters.It was easy enough to project friendship and allegiance all last year as dual progressive dreamers, tag-teaming to make the case against the more incremental politics of a front-runner like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. It is quite another thing to see the current state of the primary -- with wide-open races in Iowa and New Hampshire and, in theory, room enough for only one liberal standard-bearer as the calendar turns -- and maintain a fully united front.Sunday was fraught: Ms. Warren said she was ""disappointed"" in Mr. Sanders amid reports that his campaign had distributed a script to volunteers instructing them to depict Ms. Warren as out of touch.Monday was worse: CNN reported that Mr. Sanders told Ms. Warren during a private meeting in 2018 that a woman could not win the presidency. Mr. Sanders forcefully denied having made the remarks. Ms. Warren said that Mr. Sanders had in fact raised doubts about a woman's electoral viability.""I thought a woman could win; he disagreed,"" she said in a statement on Monday. ""I have no interest in discussing this private meeting any further because Bernie and I have far more in common than our differences on punditry.""Entering Tuesday's debate, progressive groups had spent the preceding 48 hours in something approaching full-scale panic, alarmed that a skirmish between two largely like-minded candidates would serve only to benefit more moderate alternatives like Mr. Biden and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.The question of whether a woman can defeat Mr. Trump has been the long-whispered soundtrack of much of this Democratic primary, invoked constantly in voter interviews among even supporters of candidates like Ms. Warren and Ms. Klobuchar.Ms. Warren had not directly addressed gender as forcefully as she did Tuesday night, when she vowed, in her closing statement, to become ""the first woman president of the United States of America.""She has more frequently talked about Aunt Bea -- a wonder woman in her life -- who made an appearance in an exchange about child care.It was a story she has told many times before, but the circumstances on Tuesday made it newly resonant.""If I hadn't been saved by my Aunt Bea, I was ready to quit my job,"" Ms. Warren said. ""And I think about how many women of my generation just got knocked off the track and never got back on.""As late as last week, it seemed as if the debate was shaping up primarily as a clash between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden. Since an American airstrike killed Iran's top military commander, the two men have been sparring over foreign policy. Mr. Biden has seized on the escalating tension to highlight his experience while Mr. Sanders has used it as grounds to promote his longtime focus on international diplomacy. Mr. Sanders, a vocal opponent of the war in Iraq, has also repeatedly and aggressively hit Mr. Biden on his vote to authorize it.The sparring over foreign policy has delighted Mr. Sanders's advisers, who have long ached for direct conflict with Mr. Biden: Not only is he a moderate foil to Mr. Sanders's democratic socialism, but he also in many ways represents the establishment Washington that Mr. Sanders loathes.Mr. Biden was bracing for the fight. But when it came time for Mr. Sanders to go on offense, he settled occasionally for jokes.""I would not meet with -- absent preconditions -- I would not meet with the, quote, 'supreme leader,' who said 'Joe Biden is a rabid dog, he should be beaten to death with a stick,"" Mr. Biden said about the leader of North Korea.Mr. Sanders butted in: ""Other than that, you like him?""""Other than that, I like him,"" Mr. Biden confirmed.As ever on Tuesday, Mr. Biden presented himself as the candidate Mr. Trump fears most. ""I've been the object of his affection now more than anybody else in this stage,"" he said.While Mr. Biden is not an enviable debater on his best day, he seemed to largely survive the evening without a significant misstep -- no small thing as he continues to lead most national polls and edges into contention in surveys of Iowa and New Hampshire, where he has long struggled.That no candidate has yet emerged as a decisive front-runner in Iowa has made voters' decisions here all the more complicated as they strain to identify someone who can defeat Mr. Trump. Only 40 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers have made up their minds, according to a Des Moines Register poll released last week; nearly half said they could be persuaded to support another candidate, and 13 percent said they did not have a first choice.Of course, the locals have also found excitement in the stress, making the proceedings on Tuesday the hottest ticket in a cold town. Leaving a restaurant on Sunday, several Iowans asked a Buttigieg campaign official if he could help them get into the event hall. The official demurred.The debate on Tuesday went forward against the relentless din of Washington news, from the Iran affair to a looming Senate impeachment trial that could sideline half of the candidates onstage. (The forum also excluded the Democrat most ubiquitous in television advertising: Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor who is not competing in the early-voting states.)The candidates and moderators did not wind toward Mr. Trump's congressional fate until nearly the end. There was talk of the Constitution. There was talk about duty. ""Some things,"" Ms. Warren said, ""are more important than politics.""And some seemingly unimportant actions can appear politically meaningful.At the end of the evening, as the candidates wrapped up more than two hours of televised talking with several minutes of televised farewells, Mr. Sanders extended his hand to Ms. Warren. She did not reciprocate, beginning a brief conversation that ended without a handshake. Mr. Sanders raised two open palms -- as if to say: enough of this -- and walked off.Sydney Ember reported from Des Moines, and Matt Flegenheimer from New York.Sydney Ember reported from Des Moines, and Matt Flegenheimer from New York.PhotographElizabeth Warren, second from left, and Bernie Sanders, fourth from left, sparred over the issue of electability on Tuesday night.

| Jump to first hitWhile members of his administration tried to convey a calm and steady response, President Trump hosted another free-form political rally where he accused his enemies of stoking panic.NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. -- Larry Kudlow, the president's chief economic adviser, stood in the White House briefing room on Friday urging the public -- and the plunging financial markets -- not to panic over the coronavirus outbreak, while Vice President Mike Pence spread a similar message to officials and residents at an event in Florida.Later, as the authorities revealed a second person in California had been found to be infected with the coronavirus without having any known risk factors, President Trump suggested the panic over the issue was being manufactured by his enemies.In South Carolina on Friday night at his latest freestyle ""Keep America Great"" rally, the president accused Democrats of treating alarm over the coronavirus as ""their new hoax,"" and said the news media was in ""hysteria mode"" over his administration's handling of the outbreak, continuing an attempt to shift blame for a public health crisis onto his political adversaries.""Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus,"" Mr. Trump told a crowd of supporters, who roared in response. ""They can't even count their votes in Iowa.""""We have 15 people"" with the virus ""in this massive country, and because of the fact that we went early,"" referring to an earlier decision to close American borders to travelers from China, ""we could've had a lot more than that.""The president added that ""so far, we have lost nobody"" to the coronavirus.""It doesn't mean we won't,"" he said.(By late Friday, two more unexplained cases of the coronavirus had been confirmed in the West, one in Oregon and one in Washington State.)Mr. Trump, who overnighted this week in India and who, according to his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, has barely slept since, spent nearly 90 minutes mixing his views about the coronavirus with insults about the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.He also sprinkled in free-associative rants about his popularity with black voters and topics further afield. The president at different points mused about the Rev. Al Sharpton's weight -- ""He looked better when he was heavy"" -- and the Academy Awards -- ""Seriously, the Academy Awards has gone way, way down in ratings. You know why? Because they started attacking us, and we don't believe in it anymore. That's why.""But he always found his way back to partisan politics.""On Jan. 31, I ordered the suspension of foreign nationals who have recently been in China from entering the United States,"" Mr. Trump said to loud cheers about his decision to seal the borders to travelers, ""an action which the Democrats loudly criticized and protested, and now everybody's complimenting me.""Experts have questioned the effectiveness of border closures and quarantines when so much about the coronavirus is unknown. Yet Mr. Trump appeared to tie his administration's response with his case for tighter immigration policies: ""We must understand that border security is also health security.""In recent days, the president has appeared more interested in his prospects for re-election than in conducting a measured response to a public health crisis. On Friday morning, Fox News -- usually a reliable ally -- drew Mr. Trump's ire for releasing polling that showed him faltering in matchups against potential rivals in November.""Worst Polls, just like in 2016 when they were so far off the mark, are the @FoxNews Polls,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Why doesn't Fox finally get a competent Polling Company?"" (At the rally, he remarked that the unnamed Fox pollster ""hates Trump's guts."")The Keep America Great rally in South Carolina, a state that Mr. Trump won handily in 2016, was intended to draw attention away from the Democratic primary, scheduled for Saturday. With both of the state's Republican senators, Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, in tow, the president became the latest national politician to visit a state that has been overwhelmed by them.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the billionaire businessman Tom Steyer, both running for the Democratic presidential nomination, are betting that South Carolina will revive their flagging campaigns, and the president had words for them.""I thought I knew all the wealthy people,"" he said of Mr. Steyer, whom he mocked as ""Mr. Impeachment."" He then teased Mr. Biden for mixing up the names of states he has visited. ""He did that like seven times,"" Mr. Trump said.""If I did that once, it would be the end of the road, right?"" he added. ""They'd say Trump has lost it.""He paused before saying, ""They like to say that anyway, I guess.""Mr. Trump poll-tested various candidates with the crowd -- ""We won't include Steyer, he's a loser"" -- before disparaging Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as a ""mean one"" and dismissing Michael R. Bloomberg as ""gone"" and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota as ""not going to happen."" The president then asked his supporters who they thought was the weaker candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont or Mr. Biden.""Who the hell is easier to beat? Crazy Bernie? Or Sleepy Joe?"" he said, before concluding that his best chances lie with Mr. Sanders.Among other topics, Mr. Trump assessed his own effectiveness with minority voters, regaling the crowd with a story about a ""love fest"" event at the White House at which he hosted African-Americans. His campaign recently announced a push to open storefronts in swing states targeting black voters with ""Woke""-themed merchandise and pamphlets.""One of the things I asked them,"" Mr. Trump said, ""I've been thinking about this for a long time -- great people, some of them are here tonight -- 'Do you like the name African-American or black?' And they said, 'Black!' all at the same time. True. I tell you. Because you say African-American or black. And they said almost, like, immediately, 'Black.""'On and off the rally stage, the president has zeroed in on Mr. Bloomberg for his performances in recent debates. Earlier Friday, Mr. Trump spread an unfounded Twitter rumor that Mr. Bloomberg was thinking of ending his presidential bid.""Shouldn't you be worrying about the coronavirus?"" Mr. Bloomberg replied on Twitter. ""Listen to your scientists. Prepare your people. Be the leader America needs. If only just this once.""The South Carolina rally was just the latest stop on Mr. Trump's grievance roadshow. He has visited every state that has held a primary or caucus so far this year, making trolling Democratic candidates a cornerstone of his re-election campaign strategy.Democrats say that this penchant to chase them around the map is evidence that Mr. Trump is not confident about his chances. But Erin Cassese, a political science researcher at the University of Delaware who studies the psychology of voters, said that the president was capitalizing on the anger felt by Republican voters who have been bombarded with messaging they do not necessarily agree with.""There's how much you like your own party and then there's almost how much you dislike the opposing party,"" Ms. Cassese said. ""I see Trump as riding the wave of negative partisanship by following Democrats through these early primary states. And the rally is kind of a pressure valve.""At the rally, Mr. Trump summoned Mr. Graham, a fervent defender of the president's, onstage for a round of praise.""Do you know why you're going to win?"" the senator asked Mr. Trump. ""You've been a damn good president."" Mr. Graham then thanked the president for putting up with what the senator described as never-ending obstacles, though Mr. Graham used an expletive instead.Later, as Mr. Trump spoke about immigration, he celebrated a federal appeals court ruling that determined that his administration would not have to provide funding to so-called sanctuary cities, and he recounted in grisly detail stories of an undocumented immigrant who had been arrested and charged with sexual assault and murder. He said the man was also a member of the MS-13 gang, a vicious criminal organization.""He should never have been in our country,"" Mr. Trump said as the crowd roared and started a ""Build the Wall"" chant. ""He should not have been allowed.""PhotographSupporters cheered as President Donald Trump took the stage Friday night for a rally at an arena in North Charleston, S.C.

| Jump to first hitMs. Warren is figuring out what candidates like Beto O'Rourke, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand have already learned: It's hard to appeal to both the center and the left of the Democratic Party.DAVENPORT, Iowa -- The voter asked Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts the question on many Iowans' minds: What did she have to offer besides her litany of policy proposals?At first, Ms. Warren responded with a story about her working-class upbringing, saying she intimately understood a family's day-to-day financial struggles. Then she gave a second answer, a more direct argument for her ability to beat President Trump.""I'm the only person who will be on the debate stage who's beaten a popular incumbent Republican anytime in the last 25 years,"" Ms. Warren said. ""In other words, I know how to fight, I know how to win, and that's what I plan to do.""The response, given at a rally in Davenport on Sunday, was a rare foray into horse-race politics from a candidate who has dismissed the importance of polls, rarely reads news coverage about herself and detests Beltway punditry. But it was part of a quiet recognition among her advisers and surrogates that, less than one month before the Iowa caucuses, Ms. Warren is being damaged by criticism and pressure from both moderates and liberals within the Democratic Party, whose doubts about her have fueled concerns about her ability to win.These worries have also filtered down to voters, who, in more than two dozen interviews during Ms. Warren's two most recent trips to Iowa, have expressed a growing fear that her candidacy is neither satisfying nor uniting the political factions in the party.""It's been a problem,"" said Peter Leo, the chairman of Iowa's Carroll County Democrats, who has endorsed Ms. Warren. ""She's getting hit from the left and the right.""Ms. Warren's conundrum is tied to the all-important notion of ""electability,"" the vague and sometimes discriminatory concept that has become paramount to Democratic voters who are motivated by defeating Mr. Trump.When Ms. Warren's campaign was riding high in the summer and early fall, the energy around her ideas was an implicit message to both liberals and moderates: She was the one who could win. But after a series of attacks, beginning on health care policy, she has lost ground as some voters have retreated to their ideological corners: the left-wing base that has rallied around Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and the moderate group of Democrats who have largely backed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. or former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.It has created a self-fulfilling cycle that Ms. Warren is now trying to break.Wallace Watson, a 52-year-old who attended her rally over the weekend in Dubuque, Iowa, said he decided to support Ms. Warren months ago because he saw her as the only candidate who could energize both voters who backed Mr. Sanders in 2016 and those who supported Hillary Clinton, the party's nominee. In recent months, however, he admitted that his faith in Ms. Warren had been tested.""I think she has long-term viability, but it's unfortunate that she has had press coverage in the last months of the year that has seemed to lessen her impact,"" Mr. Watson said. ""She needs to step up her campaign and make herself a viable candidate again. I'm hopeful she will.""Ms. Warren's campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this story. But in private conversations, her advisers acknowledge that this ideological squeeze is similar to one that doomed earlier candidates like former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas, Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Senator Kamala Harris of California. But unlike those candidates, who often made grand pivots in order to appease both sides, Ms. Warren is placing her bet on authenticity and hoping voters will reward her for being consistent.But she is still making minor tweaks to her strategy. She has appeared on more national television programs in recent days, including a rare appearance on the Sunday political talk show circuit. Adam Green, who leads the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and has advised Ms. Warren, said to expect her to ""make the case for electability"" against Mr. Trump in the coming month, aimed at ""scared progressives"" who are ""tentatively parked with others like Biden.""The campaign has also amassed a roster of energetic and potentially influential surrogates, including Julián Castro, the former cabinet secretary and presidential candidate, Representatives Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts and Katie Porter of California, and a collective of activists called ""Black Womxn For,"" all of whom are set to descend on Iowa in the coming weeks.These surrogates may go on the offensive in ways Ms. Warren has resisted. At their joint rally in Brooklyn on Tuesday, it was Mr. Castro -- not Ms. Warren -- who made the most explicit case for why she was better suited than her primary opponents to beat Mr. Trump.""More than any other candidate in this race, more than any other candidate that's going to be on that debate stage in a few days, Elizabeth Warren is the candidate who can unite the entire Democratic Party,"" he said. ""When you talk to people on the ground, you find that they like Elizabeth Warren. You find that they're willing to support her. You find that she has the best damn organization in these early states.""Ms. Warren's campaign has avoided setting expectations for its Iowa finish. But Sean McElwee, whose think tank, Data for Progress, has worked closely with Ms. Warren's campaign, said he thought she probably needed a first- or second-place finish in Iowa to unlock her numbers elsewhere -- and at a minimum, she must beat Mr. Sanders.""One of her advantages are that a lot of people are considering her,"" Mr. McElwee said. ""One of her disadvantages is that the people who are considering her are considering everyone else.""It will be an electoral tightrope walk of the highest order, as evidenced by the way the debate about Ms. Warren's health care plan consumed the final months of 2019. It started with the race's moderates, who pressured Ms. Warren into providing additional details about how she planned to pay for and transition to a ""Medicare for all"" system. When those details diverged from the outline in Mr. Sanders's bill, some members of the party's left flank accused her of political betrayal.Other issues have prompted a backlash against Ms. Warren in the early days of this year. After Mr. Trump ordered the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, one of Iran's top military commanders, Ms. Warren issued a statement that was rejected by some on the party's left, who said she had not sufficiently embraced an antiwar framework like that of Mr. Sanders. After she released a second statement, she faced criticism for not denouncing Mr. Suleimani in sufficiently harsh terms, even as other candidates who also adjusted their public remarks -- including Mr. Buttigieg -- escaped scrutiny.Last week, Ms. Warren surprised some of her own supporters by embracing the updated trade deal between the United States, Mexico and Canada, which was negotiated by Mr. Trump to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, saying it created some market stability for farmers. It was also a rare break between her and Mr. Sanders, who argued the bill would not stop the outsourcing of jobs and had lax environmental regulations.The Sunrise Movement, the nationwide group of young climate activists, said Ms. Warren's support for the agreement ""undermines her commitments to the Green New Deal."" Prominent online supporters of Ms. Warren, including leaders at the Working Families Party, the progressive group that endorsed her in September, boosted tweets about being ""heartbroken"" by Ms. Warren's decision.In his western Iowa county, Mr. Leo said, Ms. Warren had not lost support to Mr. Sanders, but to moderates like Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. He believes the Warren campaign should focus on persuading moderate Democrats who may have abandoned it over electability fears.""Forty percent of people are with the progressives. Forty percent of people are with Biden or Buttigieg. It'll be a sprint to that 20 percent,"" Mr. Leo said. ""It's an advantage that she's a lot of people's second choice. So when Pete or Joe or Amy isn't viable, that support can find itself to her.""Mr. McElwee, for his part, criticized the analysis of Ms. Warren's general election prospects, including a poll released by The New York Times in the fall. He said it helped create a narrative that Ms. Warren was a weak candidate against Mr. Trump, resulting in a campaign that is more reliant on good results in Iowa than ever before.At the same time, he cautioned Ms. Warren's campaign against outsourcing the all-important electability argument to surrogates and outsiders.""It's been baffling,"" Mr. McElwee said of the campaign's response to being attacked from both sides. ""They haven't really contested the question.""PhotographAbove, Ms. Warren campaigning in Maquoketa, Iowa, on Sunday. Left, a town hall in Dubuque.

| Jump to first hitThe dispute has led to negative attacks and doubts about party unity, exactly what Democratic leaders do not want to happen, for fear of handing an advantage to President Trump.WASHINGTON -- For a year they offered almost nothing but praise for each other in public, he paying tribute to her populism, she initially adopting his health care plan, and each supporting the other against moderates in the Democratic presidential debates and rebuking reporters who sought to stoke any suppressed rivalry.The alliance between Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders was an extension of their rapport in the Capitol, which was more about mutual interest than personal friendship, but it remained largely intact through 2019 despite highs and lows for each candidate -- even as they competed for the same set of voters.But that relationship has now ruptured in extraordinary fashion, over whether he told her in a private meeting in 2018 that a woman couldn't defeat President Trump. The breach runs a real risk of damaging liberal hopes of ultimately uniting Democratic Party factions around a progressive nominee in 2020.A sizable, loud swath of left-wing activists are now furious at Ms. Warren for criticizing and challenging Mr. Sanders over gender and for employing hardball campaign tactics this week. Meanwhile, some progressive women and backers of Ms. Warren are angry at Mr. Sanders for disputing her and for not denouncing the #NeverWarren campaign by some of his online supporters.Both candidates and their advisers have come to believe that the other camp is fighting dirty, according to interviews with campaign officials and surrogates. They have not spoken since their post-debate confrontation in Iowa on Tuesday night, and many liberals are starting to feel a painful sense that they've been here before.""We can't relive 2016,"" said Randi Weingarten, the head of the American Federation of Teachers, referring to the split between pro-Sanders liberals and other Democrats who wanted the party to unite behind his onetime rival, Hillary Clinton. ""Misinformation miscreants will have a field day with this.""Ill will between Sanders and Warren supporters is now exploding on social media, with angry memes, conspiracy theories and harassing commentary mostly aimed at Ms. Warren. Negative attacks and doubts about party unity are exactly what Democratic leaders do not want to happen in 2020, for fear of handing ammunition to Mr. Trump, as the heated contest between the Vermont senator and Mrs. Clinton did four years ago.Many Warren advisers and allies think the Sanders camp has long tolerated public attacks on her from his surrogates, and believe he is not reining in divisive and in some cases sexist attacks against her among Sanders supporters on Twitter.And the Sanders camp is even more frustrated over what they see as an orchestrated, dayslong campaign by Ms. Warren to revive her bid by suggesting Mr. Sanders is a misogynist.Sanders advisers believe Ms. Warren has hurt herself with the accusations but also put them in a no-win situation, in which they are unable to fully strike back for fear of appearing insensitive but risk incurring damage of their own without rebutting her claims.Ms. Warren's decisions at Tuesday's debate to openly challenge Mr. Sanders's denial of that remark, and then to confront him after the debate and refuse to shake his hand before the cameras, have also led Sanders supporters to believe that she is acting underhandedly.On Thursday, a handful of progressive groups, distraught over the tensions between the two leading liberal candidates, scrambled to tamp down the tensions, issuing a statement urging the two senators to halt their ""crossfire"" lest a moderate benefit from the hostilities.But even if one of them claims the nomination, the rupture between the two senators could be difficult to repair because of the nature of their two coalitions: If Mr. Sanders emerges as the nominee, he may find it difficult to energize the female Democrats who were already uneasy with him because of the 2016 race. And should Ms. Warren become the party's standard-bearer, she could find it hard to win back the most fervent Sanders backers, who hardly needed any further evidence to claim that the nominating process is stacked against him.

Mr. Sanders's closest adviser, Jeff Weaver, described the two candidates as ""senatorial friends, as that term is understood in Washington,"" and portrayed their recent squabble as a blip. ""It's not the height of their relationship, but I'm sure it will be fine,"" Mr. Weaver said.Describing what Mr. Sanders had told him about the 2018 conversation, Mr. Weaver said they discussed the ""challenges of women running in the era of Trump."" And he said it was Ms. Warren who broached the subject of whether a woman could run against Mr. Trump when the two met in private in December 2018.""She brought it up,"" Mr. Weaver said.Yet this week's report about that gathering, and Ms. Warren's assertion that Mr. Sanders had indeed told her a woman couldn't win, was only the match that sparked a conflagration that had been slowly building.The confrontation at the debate in Des Moines may have crystallized into a few tense moments on camera, but it had been simmering for more than a year. It can be traced to the weeks after a dinner at Ms. Warren's condominium in December 2018, when a decade-long alliance between New England progressives with a shared contempt for political artifice first became strained by their mutual ambition.Ms. Warren and her top advisers believed that Mr. Sanders might not run for president, according to people familiar with the discussions at the time, and that there was at least a chance the then-77-year-old Vermont senator would accept political emeritus status and crown Ms. Warren as the new leader of the left.At the same time, Mr. Sanders's supporters viewed Ms. Warren as politically damaged, perhaps beyond repair, by her decision to take a DNA test to prove her Native American ancestry.Yet both of those assumptions, which could have doubled as hopes, turned out to be misguided. By the end of 2019, it was clear that these two liberals were both blocking the other from consolidating the left in the Democratic primary -- and that their fragile peace could not last long.""This was their frustration boiling over,"" said former Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who has known both senators for years. ""She's frustrated by his rigidity and being attacked by his people for her effort to make what they both agree on politically more sellable. And he's understandably resentful that she comes along and becomes the darling of some on the left for advocating ideas he's been advocating since long before her.""Now, after months of Mr. Sanders instructing his aides not to be critical of Ms. Warren and Ms. Warren steadfastly refusing to utter anything negative about Mr. Sanders, the two are feeling upset and betrayed, allies said.A handful of progressive groups -- some supporting Mr. Sanders, some Ms. Warren and others neutral -- expressed their anxiety in an unusual joint statement Thursday that reflected the degree of alarm on the left.""Sanders and Warren, as well as their campaigns and supporters, will need to find ways to cooperate,"" wrote the leaders of eight liberal-leaning organizations. ""The crossfire amplified by the media is unhelpful and does not reflect the relationship between two Senate colleagues who broadly worked well together for most of the last year.""In fact, their working relationship dates to well before 2019.The two bonded when Ms. Warren, then a Harvard law professor and bankruptcy expert, came to Vermont for a town hall event in 2008 with Mr. Sanders, who two years earlier had been elected to the Senate. He called her ""one of the most knowledgeable and articulate writers in America in terms of what is going on in the middle class.""In 2012 it was Mr. Sanders's turn to cross the state line, and he stumped for Ms. Warren's Senate bid in western Massachusetts.They never became personally close, but their shared worldview brought them together in a Senate light on populists.When it became clear after 2016 that both harbored presidential ambitions, Ms. Warren was particularly careful to cultivate Mr. Sanders.She endorsed Keith Ellison, a top Sanders surrogate who was then a congressman, for Democratic National Committee chair, telling an adviser that she felt she owed it to Mr. Sanders, according to a Democrat familiar with the conversation. And before long she was appearing on Mr. Sanders's podcast and anecdotes were springing up in articles about how they shared meals in airports.Ms. Warren has also taken Mr. Sanders's side in his grievance about the 2016 election. In an interview with CNN in November 2017, when she was asked whether she agreed that the primary had been tilted in Mrs. Clinton's favor, Ms. Warren replied, ""Yes.""But tensions between the two have slowly grown since they entered the White House race, as they both pursue progressive voters and endorsements from left-wing leaders and groups.

It was not until Ms. Warren stopped saying ""I'm with Bernie"" on ""Medicare for all"" and devised her own plan that their relationship began to sour. Ms. Warren laid out a transition to a single-payer system, while Mr. Sanders repeatedly said he would do it ""in my first week of office.""""She tries to be a little flexible, says she wouldn't do it until her third year, and she gets attacked by him,"" said Mr. Frank, who has not endorsed a candidate but is friends with Ms. Warren.Now, after a head-spinning week, it's clear both campaigns would like to move on.Responding to a reporter who tweeted about trying unsuccessfully to get Mr. Sanders to comment on the post-debate argument, a Sanders adviser, David Sirota, sought to stoke a different story line.""I have a crazy idea: perhaps you should ask him about Joe Biden's 40 year crusade to cut Social Security and Bernie's own efforts to protect Social Security,"" Mr. Sirota wrote.Jonathan Martin reported from Washington, and Sydney Ember from Des Moines. Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting from New York.PhotographSenators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, above in July, have not spoken since a confrontation after Tuesday night's debate.

| Jump to first hitIn October 2015, Senator Bernie Sanders was whisked into Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s residence at the Naval Observatory for a breakfast of yogurt parfaits and caffeinated campaign advice from a vice president who had just announced his (temporary) retirement from presidential politics.The meeting, according to aides, lasted longer than expected, nearly two hours, with Mr. Biden discoursing on campaign strategy and a range of policy issues, and expressing admiration for a Sanders political operation that was waging an unexpectedly tough fight against Hillary Clinton.When Mr. Biden walked Mr. Sanders to his car, he clapped a hand on his shoulder and declared, ""Good luck, buddy!""The two septuagenarians will meet again Sunday night under much different circumstances for the first, and possibly final, one-on-one Democratic primary debate of 2020, in a near-empty CNN studio in Washington selected to replace an Arizona venue because of the coronavirus crisis. Depending on how the night goes, the confrontation could be either a swan song for Mr. Sanders, who has suffered a string of crushing primary defeats this month, or a chance for the onetime front-runner to reassert his rationale for extending the contest.Mr. Sanders, speaking after last week's losses in Michigan and three other states, telegraphed his intention to press Mr. Biden hard on health care, climate change and income inequality. Yet the actions of both men in the aftermath of Tuesday's primaries -- Mr. Biden set out a welcome mat for his rival rather than pressuring him to quit, and Mr. Sanders outlined tough terms for an eventual détente -- also shed light on a personal relationship that has remained sturdy, amicable and functional, a far cry from the acrimony that defined Mr. Sanders's relationship with Mrs. Clinton after their bitter duel four years ago.This no-frills personal connection, aides to both men say, could become an important factor in quickly uniting the party to confront President Trump, despite the wide policy gulf between the moderate Mr. Biden and the progressive Mr. Sanders.""I think both men know where this is likely going, and they both know how to approach one another,"" said David Axelrod, a longtime adviser to President Barack Obama who worked closely with Mr. Biden in the White House. ""Sanders, it seems to me, is a guy who wants to land the plane, and is asking Biden to show him some lights from the ground. There's nothing personal standing in the way of them getting together.""Mr. Sanders overlapped with Mr. Biden in the Senate for just two years, from January 2007, after his election, until Mr. Biden's ascent to the vice presidency in 2009. Mr. Biden was not around all that much. Then a senator from Delaware and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he spent much of 2007 prepping for his unsuccessful presidential campaign, the latter part of 2008 running with Mr. Obama and the rest of the time focusing on committee work.""They basically had zero interaction, but I can't recall Bernie ever saying a bad word about Biden, or vice versa,"" said David Krone, chief of staff to Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate majority leader from Nevada, who was close to Mr. Sanders.The two men have sparred, but not savaged each other, in previous debates. Mr. Biden recently told a person in his orbit that he thinks Mr. Sanders, while lacking an understanding of foreign policy, ""is basically a good guy."" One longtime Biden staff member summed up the former vice president's view in Baby Boomer cultural terms: In the mid-1960s, when both men were in college, Mr. Biden was a square, striving, law-school-bound ex-jock who would have seen Mr. Sanders as a noisy, strident, scraggly but basically benign campus archetype -- ""the hippie.""Mr. Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, has privately praised Mr. Biden as one of the few establishment senators to make him feel at home during his first few months in the Senate. (Mr. Obama, by contrast, later suggested in a memoir that Mr. Biden behaved a little arrogantly when he first arrived in 2005).But Mr. Sanders has not been shy about highlighting their policy differences over the years, especially his opposition to the Biden-backed bailout of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis and Mr. Biden's initial support for the war in Iraq.In brief remarks after his Super Tuesday defeats, Mr. Sanders slammed Mr. Biden on Iraq and on his support for ""disastrous trade agreements"" that he said had cost millions of jobs. ""You cannot beat Trump with the same old, same old kind of politics,"" he added. In subsequent days, he attacked Mr. Biden's record on abortion, same-sex marriage and the former ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy.Mr. Sanders's aggressive approach has, at times, angered Mr. Biden, who felt that Mr. Sanders had not acted quickly enough to muzzle supporters who posted racist and sexist attacks on two female officials of a Nevada union for opposing Mr. Sanders's signature ""Medicare for All"" plan in February. ""Disown them, flat disown them,"" Mr. Biden told an interviewer at the time. ""It's outrageous.""But Mr. Sanders, ever the ideology-impelled candidate, has taken pains not to personalize the fight.He has reiterated his belief that Mr. Biden can beat Mr. Trump and tempered his criticism on the trail, saying that ""Joe is a decent guy"" and referring to the former vice president as ""my friend.""Privately, he has vented his disgust over Mr. Trump's attempts to make a campaign issue of the business activities of Mr. Biden's son Hunter. Mr. Sanders has expressed his sympathy to the former vice president directly during joint appearances and to his own staff, people close to both men said.He has also pushed back on the perception, leveled by many former opponents, that he has tacitly encouraged supporters to scorch them by proxy. In January, he sought to distance himself from Zephyr Teachout, an ally from New York, who published an op-ed during the impeachment proceedings that accused Mr. Biden of contributing to a ""transactional, grossly corrupt"" political culture by not blocking Hunter Biden from joining the board of an energy company in Ukraine.""It is absolutely not my view that Joe is corrupt in any way,"" Mr. Sanders said, and then offered a fuller apology to Mr. Biden directly when the two marched in a Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. commemoration in South Carolina, according to a Biden aide.""Thanks for acknowledging this, Bernie,"" Mr. Biden replied on Twitter. ""Let's all keep our focus on making Donald Trump a one-term president.""The subtext of the Biden-Sanders relationship is the former vice president's belief that he could have limited Mr. Trump to zero terms had he, and not Mrs. Clinton, been the Democratic nominee in 2016.In that regard, Mr. Biden -- who waited for Mr. Obama to endorse Mrs. Clinton in June 2016 before following suit -- viewed Mr. Sanders as something of a stand-in for himself, according to a half-dozen people in his orbit. As the primaries dragged on, that feeling grew, and Mr. Biden became increasingly resentful of the full-court pressure to sit out the race that had been applied by Mr. Obama's top advisers, at the president's behest, according to several current and former advisers to Mr. Biden and Mr. Obama.That lingering sense of grievance is one of the things that this time around motivate Mr. Biden, whose once avuncular, now grand-avuncular, demeanor masks a fierce competitive streak. He is also known to have a hair-trigger temper -- which was on four-letter display last week when a construction worker in Michigan accused him of trying to confiscate his guns.And while Mr. Sanders is widely expected to be the aggressor at the debate, it is just as likely that Mr. Biden, who is feeling confident, will be the candidate who raises his voice the loudest on Sunday night, according to people who have worked with him over the years.""Bernie, I think, knows that he has to strike a balance,"" added Mr. Axelrod, who helped prepare Mr. Biden for his high-stakes vice-presidential debate with Paul D. Ryan in 2012. ""But Biden is the one who really needs to shorten his horns to keep the tone of this thing positive.""Sydney Ember contributed reporting.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R.

| Jump to first hit""It's not racist at all,"" the president said. But experts warned that the term could result in xenophobia.WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Wednesday defended his increasingly frequent practice of calling the coronavirus the ""Chinese Virus,"" ignoring a growing chorus of criticism that it is racist and anti-Chinese.""It's not racist at all,"" Mr. Trump said, explaining his rationale. ""It comes from China, that's why.""But the term has angered Chinese officials and a wide range of critics, and China experts say labeling the virus that way will only ratchet up tensions between the two countries, while resulting in the kind of xenophobia that American leaders should discourage. Asian-Americans have reported incidents of racial slurs and physical abuse because of the erroneous perception that China is the cause of the virus.""The use of this term is not only corrosive vis-à-vis a global audience, including here at home, it is also fueling a narrative in China about a broader American hatred and fear of not just the Chinese Communist Party but of China and Chinese people in general,"" said Scott Kennedy, a China expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.At the White House briefing on Tuesday, Mr. Trump told reporters that he was attaching ""China"" to the name of the virus to combat a disinformation campaign promoted by Beijing officials that the American military was the source of the outbreak.""I didn't appreciate the fact that China was saying that our military gave it to them,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I think saying that our military gave it to them creates a stigma.""Then in two tweets on Wednesday morning, he pointedly referred to the ""Chinese Virus."" When he was asked about the term during another appearance at the daily White House coronavirus briefing later in the day, he insisted that he was simply pointing out a fact: that the illness was first detected in China.Public health officials have tried to avoid names that might result in discriminatory behavior against places or ethnic groups since releasing more stringent guidelines for naming viruses in 2015. But after the briefing, the White House on Twitter criticized what it called ""the media's fake outrage,"" pointing to other illnesses that had been named after places, including the Ebola virus and the West Nile virus.Mr. Kennedy said that past language used by Mr. Trump and his administration had eliminated any benefit of the doubt. ""Given the Trump administration's long record of statements and actions on immigration, immigrants and issues of race,"" he said, ""use of this term can't but be interpreted as xenophobic and tinged with racist overtones.""At Wednesday's briefing, a reporter also asked the president what he thought of an unnamed White House official referring to the coronavirus as the ""Kung Flu."" Mr. Trump skirted that question before asserting that the Chinese ""probably would agree"" with the coronavirus as the ""Chinese"" virus, though Chinese officials have made it clear they do not.Medical historians and public health experts -- including some in Mr. Trump's administration -- have emphasized that pandemics have no ethnicity and stressed that associating them with an ethnic group can lead to discrimination.But since the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, Mr. Trump has repeatedly signaled in his public remarks that he viewed the virus as a foreign threat, and has repeatedly highlighted his early decision to close American borders to Chinese travelers.""We closed it down to China, the source, very, very early,"" Mr. Trump said to reporters on Tuesday. ""Far earlier than even the great professionals wanted to do. And I think, in the end, that's going to be -- that will have saved a tremendous number of lives.""But Yanzhong Huang, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, said Mr. Trump's travel measures fell far short of a comprehensive approach that would include testing and quarantines, and overall were ""too little, too late.""The virus most likely emerged in China in November or December, and it is clear that some travelers from China were already spreading the virus within the United States in January, before the restrictions went into place at the beginning of February, Mr. Huang said.Still, since the beginning of the outbreak, Mr. Trump and high-ranking administration officials have sought to pinpoint blame for the spread of the virus on China, and Beijing has responded in kind. The finger-pointing over which country has done less to contain the disease has caused tensions between the two nations almost daily.On Tuesday, the Chinese government announced that it would be expelling journalists from major news outlets, including The New York Times, in a response to the Trump administration's decision to limit the number of Chinese citizens working in the United States for five propaganda outlets.And last week, Zhao Lijian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, shared the conspiracy theory that the United States was behind the virus. ""It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,"" he said on Twitter. ""Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!""The darker turn in U.S.-China relations has spilled out into public spats and private mistrust. While both countries have said that the trade deal they signed in January remains on track, American officials have blamed China for mishandling the coronavirus epidemic, as well as for withholding exports of face masks and other protective medical equipment.And within the Trump administration, some officials who are China hawks have privately discussed a theory that the virus emerged not from a food market in Wuhan, as many news media reports have said, but from a nearby Chinese government laboratory, where virologists were carrying out research.That theory has been discussed on Fox News by Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, an ally of Mr. Trump's.Charlie Woo, the chief executive of Megatoys and the public policy committee chairman of the Committee of 100, an organization of prominent Chinese-Americans, said the administration's language was dividing the public during a national emergency.""This crisis requires science, facts and clear language, not fear-mongering, finger-pointing and xenophobia by our public servants,"" Mr. Woo said in a statement. ""We face a global pandemic that calls for a truly global, unified response. Attempts to ascribe the virus to one culture, ethnicity or country can only hinder this effort, alienating people who could instead collaborate and support one another.""Characteristically defiant in the face of criticism, the president's allies joined him on Wednesday in defending his references to a Chinese virus.Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president, said that Mr. Trump was just trying to be accurate. ""I think what the president is saying is that is where it was first started,"" she told reporters in the White House driveway.Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said on Twitter that ""I don't understand why China gets upset bc we refer to the virus that originated there the 'Chinese virus' Spain never got upset when we referred to the Spanish flu in 1918&1919.""The phrase ""Spanish flu"" is itself a misnomer: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say experts are still not sure where the disease originated.The language has also extended to the president's re-election effort. In a message emailed to supporters and posted on its website, the Trump-Pence 2020 campaign fueled the push to blame Beijing for the spread of the virus. It also accused former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic front-runner, of ""siding with the Chinese.""""America is under attack -- not just by an invisible virus, but by the Chinese,"" said the campaign appeal, which was dated Wednesday.It added: ""What is Joe Biden up to as all this is happening? Siding with the Chinese and attacking the presidential candidate China fears most: Donald Trump.""Perhaps no administration official has been as consistent in connecting the virus to China as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. In a press briefing on Tuesday, Mr. Pompeo six times referred to the coronavirus as the ""Wuhan virus,"" after the city that was the epicenter of the virus in China.Even as he said that ""now is not the time for recrimination,"" Mr. Pompeo also again accused China of initially playing down the threat posed by what is now a pandemic.""We know this much: We know that the first government to be aware of the Wuhan virus was the Chinese government,"" Mr. Pompeo said. ""That imposes a special responsibility to raise the flag, to say: 'We have a problem. This is different and unique and presents risk.' And it took an awful long time for the world to become aware of this risk that was sitting there, residing inside of China.""""The Chinese Communist Party had a responsibility to do this -- not only for Americans and Italians and South Koreans and Iranians who are now suffering, but for their own people as well,"" Mr. Pompeo said.Mr. Pompeo said the expulsions were just the latest example of how China wants to ""deny the world the capacity to know what's really going on inside of their country.""Government officials in China have publicly cast doubt on whether the coronavirus originated in Wuhan, as health authorities believe.But a senior State Department official said on Wednesday that President Xi Jinping of China in early January repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as the ""Wuhan"" illness, and that many Chinese citizens still do.Edward Wong contributed reporting.PhotographPresident Trump has sought to pinpoint fault for the spread of the novel coronavirus on China.

| Jump to first hitThe Sanders campaign appeared on the brink of a commanding lead in the Democratic race. But a series of fateful decisions and internal divisions have left him all but vanquished.
In mid-January, a few weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Senator Bernie Sanders’s pollster offered a stark prognosis for the campaign: Mr. Sanders was on track to finish strong in the first three nominating states, but Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s powerful support from older African-Americans could make him a resilient foe in South Carolina and beyond.
The pollster, Ben Tulchin, in a meeting with campaign aides, recommended a new offensive to influence older black voters, according to three people briefed on his presentation. The data showed two clear vulnerabilities for Mr. Biden: his past support for overhauling Social Security, and his authorship of a punitive criminal justice law in the 1990s.
But the suggestion met with resistance. Some senior advisers argued that it wasn’t worth diverting resources from Iowa and New Hampshire, people familiar with the campaign’s deliberations said. Others pressed Mr. Tulchin on what kind of message, exactly, would make voters rethink their support for the most loyal ally of the first black president.
Crucially, both Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane, consistently expressed reservations about going negative on Mr. Biden, preferring to stick with the left-wing policy message they have been pressing for 40 years.
The warnings about Mr. Biden proved prescient: Two months later, Mr. Sanders is now all but vanquished in the Democratic presidential race, after Mr. Biden resurrected his campaign in South Carolina and built an overwhelming coalition of black voters and white moderates on Super Tuesday.
While Mr. Sanders has not ended his bid, he has fallen far behind Mr. Biden in the delegate count and has taken to trumpeting his success in the battle of ideas rather than arguing that he still has a path to the nomination. His efforts to regain traction have faltered in recent weeks as the coronavirus pandemic has frozen the campaign, and perhaps heightened the appeal of Mr. Biden’s safe-and-steady image.
In the view of some Sanders advisers, the candidate’s abrupt decline was a result of unforeseeable and highly unlikely events — most of all, the sudden withdrawal of two major candidates, Senator Amy Klobuchar and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who instantly threw their support to Mr. Biden and helped spur a rapid coalescing of moderate support behind his campaign.
Mr. Sanders had been “on the brink of winning,” Mr. Tulchin argued, “until the most unprecedented event in the history of presidential primaries occurred.”
But interviews with more than three dozen Sanders aides, elected officials, activists and other people who worked with his campaign revealed a more extensive picture of his reversal of political fortune. Though Mr. Sanders climbed to a position of seeming dominance by mid-February, he and his inner circle also made a series of fateful decisions that left him ill positioned to win over skeptical Democrats — and sorely vulnerable to an opponent with Mr. Biden’s strengths.
Mr. Sanders proved unable to expand his base well beyond the left or to win over African-Americans in meaningful numbers. He failed to heed warnings from traditional party leaders, and even from within his campaign, about the need to modulate his message and unify Democrats. He allowed internal arguments to fester within his campaign, an ungainly operation that fragmented into factions beneath the only two real decision makers — Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane.
Though outwardly amiable, Mr. Sanders’s inner circle fractured between some long-serving counselors and relative newcomers, like Faiz Shakir, his campaign manager. Mr. Shakir and others regarded pleas from Mr. Tulchin and another pugilistic aide, David Sirota, to go on the attack against Mr. Biden as both futile and annoyingly predictable, while Mr. Shakir’s internal critics saw him as exceedingly territorial.
There were also serious operational mistakes: In South Carolina, the campaign effectively deputized a former Ohio state senator and loyal surrogate, Nina Turner, to direct strategy, rather than empowering a political strategist to run the pivotal early state. In private conversations, Mr. Sanders often touted his support from some younger African-Americans, seemingly missing the bigger picture.
And for all of Mr. Tulchin’s alarm in January about South Carolina, on the eve of the primary he was reassuring Mr. Sanders that a public poll showing him down over 20 percentage points in the state was “an outlier for good reason.”
In an email sent to Mr. Sanders and a group of senior aides, Mr. Tulchin reminded the senator that their internal polling had him trailing Mr. Biden by only four points. Two days later, the former vice president would win South Carolina by nearly 30 points.
Perhaps the most significant factor, as with every presidential campaign, was the candidate himself, and the stubborn ideological and stylistic consistency that both endeared Mr. Sanders to his supporters and limited his ability to build a majority coalition larger than his own progressive movement.
Mr. Sanders’s campaign declined to comment for this article.
It was Mr. Sanders’s persistent lashing of the “political establishment” that concerned Representative Peter Welch, a liberal Democrat and fellow Vermonter who was one of just a few members of Congress to endorse Mr. Sanders’s campaign.
Mr. Welch said he had reached out to the campaign last month to implore Mr. Sanders to ease up on that rhetoric, which Mr. Welch believed sounded exclusionary to ordinary people backing other candidates. After all, Mr. Welch said, there were “a lot of voters who are just everyday voters, who decided to vote for other Democrats.”
An Inner Circle Divided
It was late January when Zephyr Teachout, a liberal law professor allied with Mr. Sanders, wrote a column in The Guardian alleging that Mr. Biden had “a big corruption problem.” Mr. Sirota, the Sanders aide, who is known for his voluble and combative online persona, quickly blasted out her column to his large email list. A new phase of conflict between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden seemed to be underway.
But Mr. Sanders put a stop to it. “It is absolutely not my view that Joe is corrupt in any way,” Mr. Sanders told CBS News.
In private, Mr. Sanders’s campaign went further, according to two people familiar with the internal turmoil. As punishment for stirring the controversy, Mr. Sirota, who is based in Colorado, was barred from traveling for the campaign outside of visits to its Washington headquarters.
The conflict over Ms. Teachout’s column was part of a long-running debate within the Sanders campaign about what approach to take with Mr. Biden. A small group of advisers — including Mr. Tulchin, Ms. Turner and Mr. Sirota — regularly pleaded with Mr. Sanders to attack the former vice president.
But Mr. Sanders resisted, giving speech after speech scorching unnamed establishment Democrats but declining to pursue Mr. Biden directly. He ruled out several lines of attack against the former vice president because they touched on Mr. Biden’s role in the Obama administration, which Democratic primary voters revere.
Mr. Shakir and a second senior aide, Ari Rabin-Havt, took Mr. Sanders’s side and repeatedly reminded other campaign officials that Mr. Sanders was the ultimate decision maker on the campaign. In conversations with associates, both men agreed that it might make sense to criticize Mr. Biden in a sharper way. But they said Mr. Sanders could not be persuaded to do so: He and Jane liked the Bidens personally, and their word was final.
The fissures within the campaign leadership extended beyond how to deal with Mr. Biden.
In January, efforts by Ms. Turner and others to direct some campaign resources into Super Tuesday states fizzled against opposition from Mr. Shakir and others. Mr. Shakir was adamant that Mr. Sanders’s path to the nomination ran principally through Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, and the California primary on Super Tuesday.
There was also a running argument within the campaign about how to handle Senator Elizabeth Warren, with some advisers viewing her as a serious threat that needed to be quashed and others, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mr. Sanders’s most important endorser, urging the campaign to seek conciliation.
The dispute erupted publicly in January, when CNN reported that Mr. Sanders had told Ms. Warren in 2018 that he did not believe a woman could defeat President Trump, an assertion Mr. Sanders denied.
Mr. Shakir escalated the conflict, daring Ms. Warren on TV to call the report a “lie.” Jeff Weaver, a top Sanders adviser, took a different approach in his own TV appearance, suggesting there had been a misunderstanding — a step he told associates was aimed at calming things down.
But Ms. Warren stood by the account, and a clash between her and Mr. Sanders consumed the Democratic debate in Iowa. It would linger over both of them for the remainder of the race.
Revolutionary to a Fault
Despite the divisions within his campaign, Mr. Sanders cut a winning path through the first few states to vote, culminating with a landslide victory in Nevada on Feb. 22. In his speech that night, Mr. Sanders sounded a unifying note, focusing on his “multigenerational, multiracial coalition.”
Encountering a pair of reporters in a Las Vegas hotel that evening, Mr. Tulchin — strolling to dinner with Mr. Weaver — crowed that Mr. Sanders had delivered a speech worthy of the general election. Mr. Weaver was more subdued, noting that the primary fight was not over.
The speech turned out to be a blip between Mr. Sanders’s anti-establishment diatribes. And there was little aides could do to steer him in a different direction: The chief speechwriter on the Sanders campaign was Mr. Sanders.
For months, his political advisers and outside allies had quietly mulled a shift in tone — the possibility that Mr. Sanders might take even modest steps to show skeptical Democrats that he could unify the party.
But he has always been disdainful of the art of politics and had to be nudged into wooing even friendly Democratic leaders. As Ms. Warren relentlessly courted Ms. Ocasio-Cortez last fall, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez’s advisers had to prod Mr. Sanders’s aides into having him call her — a conversation that eventually led to her endorsing him.
Pushing Mr. Sanders to reach out to “establishment Democrats” whom he regularly taunted was even tougher — despite the best efforts of even some of his staunchest supporters on the left. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez repeatedly urged the campaign to broaden Mr. Sanders’s message and seek out new allies, outside his familiar base. (In a statement, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez denied any “tension or major disagreements” with Mr. Sanders.)
RoseAnn DeMoro, the former leader of the nurses union who was one of Mr. Sanders’s most ferocious surrogates in 2016, and the actor John Cusack, another ally, both pressed the campaign to refocus Mr. Sanders’s pitch on a general-election audience, people familiar with their entreaties said.
Mr. Cusack urged the Sanders campaign to address voters beyond its progressive base, proposing that the senator give a speech at St. Francis College in Brooklyn and citing its namesake’s connection to environmentalism and fighting poverty. “His campaign needs to create a unit that is charged with outreach to groups who do NOT identify as progressive, but have strong views that are aligned with his. EXPAND EXPAND EXPAND” Mr. Cusack wrote to top Sanders allies and advisers, in an email obtained by The New York Times.
Mr. Sanders was not interested in moving in that direction. Some advisers, who endured the divisive 2016 campaign, believed that it was only after seizing a dominant advantage that Mr. Sanders could attempt to make peace with a Democratic establishment that remained intensely wary of him.
Arriving in Charleston, S.C., ahead of the Feb. 29 state primary, Mr. Weaver said the campaign had not yet sought a working relationship with figures like the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi because they wanted first to demonstrate the full sweep of their coalition on Super Tuesday three days later. He reached for a Civil War analogy to explain the muscle-flexing strategy. Abraham Lincoln did not issue the Emancipation Proclamation, Mr. Weaver said, until after Union troops turned back the Confederacy at the bloody battle of Antietam.
In the weeks before Super Tuesday, Mr. Sanders had indeed refused to yield to critics who were searching for gestures of accommodation. In Nevada, leaders of the powerful Culinary Workers Union Local 226 were frustrated that Mr. Sanders did not speak out more forcefully when his supporters heaped abuse on predominantly female union leaders over their opposition to “Medicare for all.”
As Culinary officials were deluged with vitriol, including graphic and misogynistic messages, Mr. Sanders placed a phone call to the union’s secretary-treasurer, Geoconda Argüello-Kline, but they never connected.
“Our feeling was that Senator Sanders should have said something earlier and should have been stronger about it,” said Bethany Khan, a political strategist for the union.
And then there was Cuba: In February, Democratic officials in Florida reached out to propose convening some conversations between Mr. Sanders and Latino leaders in South Florida, many of whom were nervous about his rhetoric on socialism and revolution. The Sanders campaign showed tentative interest, people familiar with the conversations said.
Then, the day after the Nevada caucuses, CBS aired a “60 Minutes” interview in which Mr. Sanders stood by his past praise for certain policies of Fidel Castro’s government. Democrats across Florida, including prominent members of Congress, erupted in dismay.
Mr. Sanders stood his ground, including in a televised debate. And he made no attempt at private damage control: None of the lawmakers who rebuked him in public heard from Mr. Sanders or his senior aides.
His campaign eventually dispatched emissaries, including the actress and activist Cynthia Nixon, to meet quietly with Latino groups in Orlando after Super Tuesday, but they could not assure local Democrats that Mr. Sanders would change course before Florida’s March 17 primary.
“It may be authentic to Bernie, but it does not work in Florida,” said Alex Barrio, a Democratic activist in Florida who attended the meeting. “It’s conceding Florida in a monumental way.”
By the time Florida voted, however, the race was all but over.
Mr. Sanders’s campaign, like much of the political world, had not anticipated Mr. Biden’s roaring comeback after South Carolina’s Feb. 29 primary. Indeed, until then, Mr. Sanders’s campaign was expecting to win seven or eight of the 14 states voting on Super Tuesday and seize a solid delegate lead over the rest of the Democratic field.
So confident was Mr. Sanders that he would vanquish Mr. Biden that he spent valuable days trying to force two other candidates out of the race by campaigning in Minnesota and Massachusetts, the home states of Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Warren. He won neither.
Mr. Sanders had suddenly become a spectator in the campaign, powerless to stop a tectonic shift against him by the party’s moderate wing. Ms. Klobuchar called Mr. Sanders before announcing her endorsement of Mr. Biden, while Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg did not speak.
After being routed across the country, Mr. Sanders knew who to blame in an appearance on ABC’s “This Week.”
“What the establishment wanted was to make sure that people coalesced around Biden and try to defeat me,” Mr. Sanders said. “So that’s not surprising.”

Biden Jr.? Mr. Biden, 77, has touted his experience, particularly in the realm of foreign policy, and pledged to try to work with Republicans to pass a bipartisan agenda that is less revolutionary than palatable.Mr. Biden embraces fixes to the health care system and the addition of a public option rather than a full-scale overhaul. He has also proposed tuition-free community college for up to two years, but does not support tuition-free four-year public colleges.Mr. Biden offers a reset of sorts, but some of his detractors fault him for refusing to offer anything bigger. That's O.K. with you, though -- let's all just make an effort to get along again so we can stop worrying that American policy, foreign and domestic, is being conducted by tweet. In a ""battle for the soul of America,"" who wouldn't prefer Middle Class Joe as their commander in chief?Michael R. BloombergYou like big bucks, and you cannot lie! A latecomer to the Democratic primary campaign, Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, offers bottomless resources in his effort to win the Democratic nomination and retake the White House. And who better to go toe to toe with President Trump than a New York billionaire?A Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat, Mr. Bloomberg is defined less by ideology than many of his rivals are. He advocates core liberal causes, including gun control and battling climate change, but he is also a businessman who favors pragmatism. At 77, he is one of the oldest candidates in the race.Mr. Bloomberg is self-funding his campaign and is not accepting campaign contributions. His strategy for winning the primary includes bypassing the first four early nominating states and spending tens of millions of dollars on advertising in Super Tuesday states.Pete ButtigiegPete Buttigieg says he wants you to imagine the first day the sun comes up and Mr. Trump is no longer the president of the United States. Can you see it? Do you want change -- but maybe not too much change? Then Mr. Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Ind., is your kind of candidate. With his emphasis on American values, patriotism and unity, Mr. Buttigieg is running a campaign that is more thematic than heavy on policy details.But in this divisive age, his Midwestern centrism, intelligence and plain-spokenness -- not to mention the military experience -- may have convinced you that he just might be able to mend some of the country's ills. He was one of the first candidates to declare himself open to expanding the size of the Supreme Court. If elected, Mr. Buttigieg would be the youngest and first openly gay president.Amy KlobucharAmy Klobuchar has pitched herself as a Midwestern moderate, with the experience and record of electability that give her an advantage against Mr. Trump. For Democrats who worry the party is tacking too far left, Ms. Klobuchar is a viable, plain-spoken alternative to Joseph R. Biden Jr., Pete Buttigieg and Michael R. Bloomberg.A three-term senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar, 59, has built her campaign on the argument that she can win in a battleground region. She often touts her legislative record in the Senate and her ability to reach across the aisle to get things done. She is vocally opposed to some of the most-discussed liberal policy ideas, including tuition-free public colleges and ""Medicare for all."" If you care more about fixing the country's crumbling infrastructure than fighting over liberal purity tests, to say nothing of electing the first female president, then Ms. Klobuchar may be right for you.Bernie SandersWith an anti-establishment message that has remained largely unchanged for five decades, Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, wants nothing less than a political revolution -- and you probably do, too! A democratic socialist, Mr. Sanders, 78, is the lion of the liberal left and a champion of the working class, pushing for agenda items that have now become standard in the Democratic Party: raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, making public colleges tuition-free and eliminating the influence of big money in politics. His signature issue, ""Medicare for all,"" is a total reimagining of the health care system in America.You probably already know Mr. Sanders, who has inspired an intensely loyal fan base, but he can be a polarizing figure. Some voters still resent his run in 2016 against Hillary Clinton and blame the division his campaign helped sow for the election of Mr. Trump. But for those who support Mr. Sanders, he can do no wrong: He is authentic and honest and the only candidate who can excite enough voters to defeat Mr. Trump in November. If he wins, he would be the oldest president ever elected.Tom SteyerTom Steyer is a billionaire former hedge fund investor and impeachment crusader who casts himself as a populist outsider with pockets deep enough to defeat Mr. Trump. Effectively his own super PAC, he has promised to spend at least $100 million of his personal fortune on his presidential bid and has already spent millions on television advertising -- which may be how you got to know him. Mr. Steyer has called for decriminalizing border crossing and expanding the Supreme Court. He has embraced a wealth tax and has called for emergency action to address climate change.Unlike Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Steyer, 62, is not running as a moderate. So if you are a progressive who is open to nominating a rich businessman who can challenge Mr. Trump on economic matters, you might consider Mr. Steyer.Elizabeth WarrenOne thing is clear: You agree with Elizabeth Warren that it's time for ""big, structural change."" With her plan for (almost) everything, and her goal of maneuvering within the system to tilt power toward working people and away from corporations and the moneyed elite, Ms. Warren, 70, the senator from Massachusetts, wants wholesale change in a way that may be less alienating than the all-out ""political revolution"" of Bernie Sanders. She has embraced ""Medicare for all,"" a wealth tax and tuition-free public colleges.One of Ms. Warren's favorite words is ""fight,"" and she is ready for one. But she has struggled to assure voters that she can and would defeat Mr. Trump, which has given some Democrats pause. That doesn't bother you so much -- you're ready to elect the first female president.Andrew YangAndrew Yang is an entrepreneur and former tech executive with zero political experience, but that may make him perfect for you. An outsider who has taken on unusual political topics such as robots, Mr. Yang, 45, is known for proposing that the federal government give each American adult a monthly check for $1,000, regardless of income or employment status. He calls these payments the Freedom Dividend. A big part of his message is also warning against the perils of automation.Though he began his campaign in relative obscurity, he has taken off -- thanks in part to Twitter -- and is now raising money to rival many of his better-known opponents. Should he be elected, he would be the first Asian-American president.If you like Mr. Yang, there's a chance you liked Bernie Sanders in 2016. Like Mr. Sanders, Mr. Yang is running as an insurgent with a loyal following of supporters who are sick of Washington, and there is overlap between their supporters. Sound like you? Then put on your MATH hat and get ready to join the ""Yang Gang.""PhotographWord count: 1345Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitThe Democrats in Iowa are making a furious last-minute case against the president. So is a Tea Party hero.DES MOINES -- The line outside the Trump rally on Thursday night was perhaps not the safest space to try to conduct a Socratic dialogue about the nature of truth. But Joe Walsh -- former Tea Party congressman, former right-wing radio host, current Trump opponent -- leaned right in.""I'm a Republican and a conservative and I'm challenging Trump in the primary,"" he announced to a Trump supporter festooned in campaign-themed clothing. ""Let me ask you this: Has Donald Trump ever lied to the American people?""A nanosecond passed, while the supporter bristled at this unfamiliar scenario. ""Nothing comes to mind,"" he said.Mr. Walsh mentioned that President Trump, despite promising fiscal responsibility, had presided over an increase in the federal deficit greater than that under President Barack Obama.""I couldn't speak to that,"" said the supporter, who did not want to give his name, on account of not trusting reporters. ""Sometimes we say things and they might not be full of truth, but we all make mistakes. He's a straight guy. I love his tenacity.""Another supporter had been growing noticeably agitated as he heard this exchange. (He also did not want to give his name.) ""Let me ask you something!"" he said. ""Has Adam Schiff ever lied?"" he asked, referring to Representative Adam B. Schiff, a lead impeachment manager. ""What about 'Shifty Schiff'? You're like Adam Schiff"" -- he pointed at Mr. Walsh -- ""lying to the American people!""If it is hard to be a Democratic candidate in the crowded and uncertain 2020 field, it may be even harder to be a Republican trying to present a legitimate alternative to a president whose supporters won't entertain the idea of anyone else, and who is all but certain to be the party's nominee.Mr. Trump won Iowa with 51 percent of the vote in 2016 and still has high approval ratings from the state's Republicans. But if local party members were feeling rather left out this past week with so much focus on the Democrats -- all those candidates, all those events -- the president had swooped in to remind them that there was a new election coming up and that, as he said on Twitter, he was ""America's Greatest President."" And Mr. Walsh was there to present a countermessage: No, he wasn't.There used to be three Republican challengers -- Mr. Walsh, former Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts and former Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina -- but Mr. Sanford dropped out just two months after entering the race, and now there are two.The odds are never great for same-party challengers when an incumbent president runs for re-election. But the candidates say that as Mr. Trump has consolidated his hold over the Republican Party, things have gotten increasingly difficult. For one thing, the party has, in 37 states and territories, changed the rules for choosing delegates to the Republican National Convention, a move likely to limit dissenting voices on the convention floor.Also, many state Republican committees have canceled this year's primaries altogether; others have put up prohibitively difficult barriers for challengers to enter or said they would hold primaries with just a single name -- Donald J. Trump -- on the ballot.""They're behind Trump lock and key,"" Mr. Walsh said. When he showed up at the Republican National Committee in Washington last month to lodge a complaint about what he said was ""the disenfranchisement of millions of Republican voters,"" the guards wouldn't let him past the lobby.Mr. Weld gamely made his own voice-in-the-wilderness case to several dozen people at Cornell College in Mount Vernon, Iowa, on Saturday. He was joined by Jim Leach, a longtime member of Congress from Iowa and former chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, whose public endorsement of Mr. Weld seems like a daring move in the current climate. (""The only reason I can is that I am not an elected official,"" Mr. Leach said by telephone.)In a phone interview, Mr. Weld said he felt like ""a two-headed cow at the Iowa State Fair,"" a figure of curiosity on account of his uphill campaign. He said that many Republicans shared his view of the president but were afraid to say so.""The party may be redeemable, but the president is not redeemable,"" he said. ""He's gone too far in the direction of wanting to undermine democratic institutions to amass power for himself. ""He and Mr. Walsh have also been making their case to voters in one-on-one conversations in bars and coffee shops in Des Moines in the lead-up to Monday's caucuses. James Marren, who showed up at the Exile bar to talk to Mr. Walsh the other night, said that he had encountered the candidate before, at a veterans' group in Dubuque, and that he was a changed man from his days as a right-wing, pro-Trump radio host spouting incendiary conspiracy theories.""It was all Democrats and him,"" said Mr. Marren, 75, a Democrat so impressed by Mr. Walsh that he is talking him up to his Republican friends. ""He said that Trump's a liar and a traitor. He apologized for what he used to say on his radio show. He was amazing.""But at the Trump rally, it was a different story. Virtually everyone Mr. Walsh spoke to disagreed with virtually everything he said.When he mentioned Ukraine, a Trump supporter said that ""Obama got that started."" When Mr. Walsh pointed out that Mr. Trump had vowed to make Mexico pay for the border wall, but was instead using money from the United States military budget, another supporter first said that Mexico was indeed paying for it, in that there are fewer Mexicans crossing the border and thus fewer Mexicans sending ""American money"" back home. Then she said: ""Well, he would have made the Mexican government pay for it, but a lot of people are standing in his way.""After just a few minutes of these encounters, Mr. Walsh was beginning to seem like the most masochistic person in Iowa.""These are the people who listened to me on the radio"" when he was a darling of the right, he said. ""I can relate to why they voted for Trump. I voted for him in 2016. But then I saw that he lies damn near every time he opens his mouth.""The turning point for him was Mr. Trump's 2018 meeting in Helsinki with Vladimir V. Putin, the Russian president, in which Mr. Trump said he believed Mr. Putin's claim -- contrary to American intelligence -- that Russia had not interfered in the 2016 election. ""That was the most unpatriotic thing I've ever seen an American president do,"" Mr. Walsh said.Suddenly, in line, Mr. Walsh ran into an old neighbor from Chicago, Mark Weyermuller, who had supported him in his congressional days but had traveled to Des Moines on this occasion for the president.It was an awkward encounter. ""You know they've canceled the Republican primaries in 10 states,"" Mr. Walsh said.Mr. Weyermuller said that he had not heard that before but that it was ""sort of a goofy system.""""I'm happy for you, but I'm supporting Donald J. Trump,"" he said, and he moved on.Then there was Matt Locke, a.k.a. the Conservative Sharpshooter, a talk-radio and podcast host who had traveled from Texas to spend an evening listening to Mr. Trump.""You're a Tea Party guy, Joe,"" Mr. Locke said. ""What happened?""The two talked at loud cross-purposes about topics like corruption among Ukrainian prosecutors; Democrats who have foreign investments; and, once again, whether Mr. Trump has ever lied. (""I don't know,"" Mr. Locke said sarcastically. ""Has he?"") The discussion turned to the time Mr. Trump publicly invited China to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his family.""He wasn't serious!"" Mr. Locke said. ""He was joking. You gotta have a sense of humor.""The two agreed to vehemently disagree, and Mr. Walsh went off into the cold to find some other voters who also disagreed with him.""I don't mind Joe,"" said Mr. Locke, ""but he doesn't have a snowball's chance in hell.""PhotographJoe Walsh, a former Republican congressman, tried to find an audience outside President Trump's rally in Des Moines on Thursday.

| Jump to first hitJoe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, facing increasing pressure to slow the Vermont senator's rise before Super Tuesday, criticized his record on gun control and his chances against President Trump.LAS VEGAS -- The day after a Democratic presidential debate brought out the candidates' outrage at Michael R. Bloomberg, the focus turned back toward Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who leads polls of Nevada, California and the nation.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. spent Thursday hammering Mr. Sanders for past positions that were friendly to the gun industry. Mr. Bloomberg warned that nominating Mr. Sanders would be ""a fatal error."" And former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., said he found it hard to imagine that Mr. Sanders could defeat President Trump in a general election.""It would be a very, very tough sell,"" Mr. Buttigieg told a crowd of students at a televised event at the University of Southern California. ""I think it would be a tough sell with Mike Bloomberg, too. I'm saying we don't have to choose between these two options. I'm saying there is another way.""The attacks came two days before Nevada's caucuses, the third contest of the Democratic presidential nominating calendar, and the day after a bitter debate that highlighted the dire situation that Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg face. With Mr. Sanders favored to win in Nevada, they have limited time to try to stop his rise before the delegate-rich Super Tuesday contests on March 3 -- when Mr. Bloomberg and his $300 million advertising campaign await.Mr. Bloomberg was in one of those Super Tuesday states, Utah, on Thursday, telling voters in Salt Lake City that Mr. Sanders could not appeal to a broad enough array of people to win the White House.""If we choose a candidate who appeals to a small base -- like Senator Sanders -- it will be a fatal error,"" Mr. Bloomberg said. ""We need Democrats and independents and Republicans to win.""Both explicitly and obliquely, Mr. Biden and his campaign criticized Mr. Sanders's record on gun control on Thursday, releasing a biting video of the Vermont senator saying in 2012, ""I don't know that you hold a gun manufacturer responsible for what obviously a deranged person does.""In a speech at a Las Vegas community center later in the day, Mr. Biden implicitly criticized that position again, and more overtly jabbed Mr. Sanders for his past opposition to the Brady bill, which required background checks for gun purchases.Yet after the event, a reporter asked whether Mr. Biden believed that Mr. Sanders had changed his views on guns.""I do think he's changed his views,"" Mr. Biden allowed, ""and I'm happy for that.""By Thursday evening, however, he was prepared to hit Mr. Sanders's record more directly.""It's not so much what you say you believe now,"" he said at a CNN town hall. ""It's, what did you do and when did you do it? And the fact is, Bernie has had a very different record than me for a long time.""Mr. Biden spelled it out: ""He voted to exempt gun manufacturers from any liability. Zero. They can't be sued.""While Mr. Sanders's rivals sought to chip away at his popularity, he laid low on Thursday. He appeared at no public events and conducted interviews with three local TV stations in Las Vegas and Reno, his campaign said.In a brief exchange aired on CNN from his campaign hotel in Las Vegas, Mr. Sanders criticized the wealth of Mr. Bloomberg, who is worth more than $60 billion.""Mr. Bloomberg himself is worth more, one person, than the bottom 125 million Americans,"" he said.The Sanders campaign was relieved on Thursday that he had emerged from Wednesday's debate unscathed, a result that it attributed to his resilience and supporters' loyalty.""Senator Sanders's opponents have thrown everything they can at him since the launch of his campaign and they've failed to stop his campaign to build a political revolution because of his consistent, lifelong record of standing with the working class,"" said Mike Casca, a campaign spokesman.The Democratic candidates' urgency to contrast themselves with Mr. Sanders came as expectations grew among rival campaigns and political operatives that he was likely to win Nevada's caucuses on Saturday.Perhaps in an acknowledgment that they are not likely to emerge on top, Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts all plan to be out of the state when the caucus results start to be announced on Saturday afternoon.""I think Nevada is unfathomable,"" said David Axelrod, the architect of Barack Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. ""Second place is anybody's guess. And second place is meaningful by the unwritten measuring sticks that the punditocracy creates. Everybody is going to be watching who finishes second.""More critical to the campaigns than Nevada are the 16 states and territories with contests on Super Tuesday. And reliable public polling data is available in just a few of those states.In Texas, a recent University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll found Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders in a dead heat. In Virginia, a Monmouth University poll released this week found Mr. Bloomberg joining Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden in a statistical tie for first place. Mr. Sanders has led recent public polls of California, the biggest Super Tuesday prize on the map.Mr. Buttigieg exhibited unusual urgency on Thursday, sending a fund-raising appeal that for the first time issued a target he said the campaign must meet to stay afloat.""We are the best shot at defeating Donald Trump,"" he wrote. ""But the reality is, if we can't raise $13 million before Super Tuesday, we might never get that shot.""Hours before that please-help-or-we're-sunk appeal, Mr. Buttigieg's campaign released an unsigned ""state of the race"" memo that warned Mr. Sanders was on the verge of building a ""seemingly insurmountable delegate lead.""Mr. Buttigieg, who has struggled for months to attract black and Latino voters, found himself facing a sometimes skeptical audience in Los Angeles.Valerie Gutierrez, a junior at the University of Southern California who attended Mr. Buttigieg's event, said she was undecided but leaning toward voting for him, despite fears about his limited appeal.""The fact that he's not able to get the diverse minority group under his coalition is a bit worrisome for me, because I'm someone from a minority background,"" she said.Michael Sutter, a U.S.C. senior who said he had already voted early for Mr. Buttigieg, echoed the former mayor's warning that Mr. Sanders could not defeat Mr. Trump.""Bernie is a little bit too far out there,"" he said. ""He's going to scare people away.""Sydney Ember contributed reporting from Las Vegas, Giovanni Russonello from New York and Louis Keene from Los Angeles.

His campaign was relieved that he emerged from Wednesday's debate unscathed, a result that it attributed to his resilience and supporters' loyalty.

| Jump to first hitFor some college students who support Mr. Sanders, leaving campus means more time to phone bank, and a captive, if skeptical, audience at home.
With the country in crisis mode, Melat Eskender, 19, has assumed battle position: In her parents’ living room making phone calls for Senator Bernie Sanders, with quarantine rations of Flamin’ Hot Cheetos at her side.
The coronavirus outbreak has scattered college students across the country. Thousands left their campuses to return to their childhood bedrooms, as universities have announced that they are moving to remote learning and recommending, or requiring, that students leave. For many, that can mean a wistful sense of time lost with friends and school rituals missed, not to mention cabin fever. But there’s an upside, as Ms. Eskender put it: “Being isolated in my home and not having classes, it gives me time to focus on this campaign.”
Ms. Eskender, a Yale freshman from Columbus, Ohio, believes that the Covid-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on Mr. Sanders’s strengths as a candidate, both in his health care-focused policy platform and leadership style. “I don’t see him as an authoritative leader, I see him as a healer,” Ms. Eskender said. “His policies and leadership are what the country need right now.”
For many young Sanders supporters, recent weeks have brought a sense of angst and grief: Their preferred candidate’s shot at the nomination has rapidly declined, as the country has been swept into a public health disaster. And the coronavirus pandemic has underscored their belief in Mr. Sanders’s “Medicare for all” plan, just as his chance of election seems more elusive than ever. He is behind former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, who ended Tuesday with victories in Florida, Illinois and Arizona — and overtures to the Sanders base in remarks over a livestream from his home in Delaware. “Let me say especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you.”
Many of those young voters, though, aren’t so ready to move on.
“It feels like everything is so dark and spiraling quickly for our country,” said Kathe McCormick-Evans, 23, a Sanders supporter in Cambridge, Mass. “Coronavirus feels really scary and uncertain and I was previously feeling a lot of hope around Bernie and the primaries. Seeing him fall in the polls is just another reminder that things are slowly falling apart.”
Before the world was completely upended — a.k.a., earlier this month — Ms. McCormick-Evans defended Mr. Sanders’s merits in a “heated” group chat with family and friends who supported Senator Elizabeth Warren, in the days leading up to the Massachusetts primary. She fended off accusations that supporting Mr. Sanders was sexist, and told her mom how excited she would be to live in a country led by a Democratic Socialist. Now the pandemic feels to her like proof of the country’s leadership crisis, but the unease of the moment makes it hard to hold onto the hope she had just weeks ago, when she cast her ballot.
It’s a blow to the young people fueled for months by the sense of possibility they felt in his candidacy. But a belief in the underdog is something endemic to the Sanders base, and many are intent on transferring their anxieties into action.
Ruth Geye, 21, a college student in New York, was disappointed to see her senior spring cut short when New York University announced on March 9 a move to remotely hold classes. But she quickly realized that going back to Shaker Heights, Ohio, meant closer proximity to family members she can enlist in campaign work for Mr. Sanders. “My parents pride themselves on doing a lot of driving people to the polls, but given that won’t be a thing, maybe I can channel that energy into making calls for Bernie,” Ms. Geye said.
For Ms. Geye, the pilgrimage home to her boomer parents was a reminder of the generational fissures that Mr. Sanders’s campaign exposed. While she was able to persuade her mom to pledge support for Mr. Sanders in the now delayed Ohio primary, it took some convincing.
Earlier in the primaries, they disagreed especially on the role of female representation. Ms. Geye’s mother liked the idea of supporting “a very smart woman” like Ms. Warren, while Ms. Geye’s view on gender was more straightforward: “I truly don’t care.”
She wasn’t impressed by Joe Biden’s commitment to selecting a female vice president at Sunday’s debate, the first since Ms. Warren dropped out of the race, nor deterred by Mr. Sanders’s lack of a commitment.
Like other young female Sanders supporters, voting for a woman doesn’t feel pressing — especially at a time of social, economic and now public health crisis.
“Seeing yourself in political leaders only goes so far,” Ms. Geye said. To ensure her mom’s support for Mr. Sanders, she reached deep into her political arsenal: “I told her the only way I could afford grandchildren was the world Bernie was working toward. So I may have leveraged grandchildren, but it worked.”
That desperate times call for desperate measures is a view almost axiomatic to some Sanders supporters. And some feel that in upending work, school and economic routines, the coronavirus outbreak could make voters more sympathetic to Mr. Sanders’s message of remaking government and a larger social safety net. Mr. Sanders made the point himself during Sunday night’s debate, telling viewers that the pandemic exposes “dysfunctionality” in the country’s health care system.
Kirsten Gronlund, 24, who is in self-isolation in her East Village, New York City, apartment, said amid her fears about the coronavirus, she’s also held on to hope that it could be a catalyst for “sweeping, fundamental changes to American life.” The anxieties of quarantine make it challenging for her to focus on day-to-day work, she said, but more meaningful to talk to voters about a brighter vision for the country’s future.
“It’s hard to focus on work when everything feels so apocalyptic,” she said. “It feels like we’re so helpless watching world leaders scramble and flail. But something like organizing for real political change feels like an appropriate response.”
The coronavirus quarantines could even offer Sanders phone-bankers a logistical boost. Shivam Shukla, 20, a student at University of South Florida, said he thinks people might be more willing to answer his calls for Sanders and engage rather than hanging up immediately, since many are home and lacking social interaction.
Mr. Shukla realizes that the weeks ahead will be rocky for the Sanders campaign, but he’s known since the start that the campaign would be an uphill battle. “It was always going to be a tough ride, but if anytime now is the time to pitch health care for all,” he said. So he’s stocked up on M&M packets and decked out his parents’ Tampa home with cutouts of Mr. Sanders. “My bedroom looks kind of like a campaign office,” he said.
Some young Sanders supporters say they’re already seeing the effects of their quarantine campaigns. Katelin Penner, 19, a sophomore at Wesleyan, moved back in with her parents in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, for the remainder of the semester. Since returning home she has been phone-banking for Mr. Sanders from her bedroom, but she’s living in a house divided; her parents and sister support Mr. Biden. For months, she’s argued with them over policy and electability to no avail — until last weekend.
Watching the news on coronavirus in her living room, Ms. Penner’s mother turned to her and said she was beginning to see the appeal of Medicare for all.
“I think coronavirus might make it a more palatable idea,” Ms. Penner said. And fortunately, she added, she has more than a month left at home before the New York primaries.

| Jump to first hitSunday's debate will be the first one-on-one matchup between Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Bernie Sanders. So, how do they actually compare on policy?Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will debate one on one for the first time on Sunday, and Mr. Sanders, who is staying in the Democratic primary race despite a series of defeats, has already telegraphed his strategy.""Joe, what are you going to do?"" Mr. Sanders repeatedly asked at a news conference last week, ticking off a laundry list of issues he plans to press Mr. Biden on, including health care, student debt, climate change, mass incarceration, immigration and wealth inequality.Mr. Biden, for his part, has criticized Mr. Sanders on gun control and on his signature policy proposal, ""Medicare for all.""Here is where the two candidates stand on some of the issues each may raise.Heath careBidenOne of the biggest distinctions between the candidates is that Mr. Biden does not support a universal government-run health insurance program like ""Medicare for all."" Instead, he supports maintaining the private insurance system but adding a Medicare-like public option that anyone could sign up for -- a proposal that still goes well beyond the Affordable Care Act. He estimates his plan would cost $750 billion over a decade.Mr. Biden would also increase tax credits for people to buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. His plan doesn't specifically address medical debt.SandersOne of the bedrock principles of Mr. Sanders's campaign is that health care is a human right, and he is the torchbearer for Medicare for all. He estimates his plan would cost about $30 trillion over 10 years and would be paid for by new revenue of about $17.5 trillion, along with ""current federal, state and local government spending.""He also wants to eliminate $81 billion in medical debt.CoronavirusBidenThe new coronavirus has quickly become the most urgent problem facing the country, and Mr. Biden released a plan on Thursday calling for free testing, ""the elimination of all cost barriers to preventive care and treatment for Covid-19,"" and emergency paid leave for affected workers.He also wants to restore a White House office that oversaw responses to global health crises -- an office that the Obama administration created and the Trump administration eliminated -- and direct the Justice Department to combat price gouging for medical supplies.SandersMr. Sanders outlined his plan to address the coronavirus in a speech on Thursday. He called for a national state of emergency (which President Trump subsequently declared), emergency funding for paid sick leave, an expansion of community health centers and a mandate that all medications related to coronavirus be sold at cost.Student debtBidenMr. Biden wants to make two-year community colleges and ""other high-quality training programs"" debt-free, but would not cancel existing student debt the way Mr. Sanders is proposing. His plan would, however, forgive the remaining balance for people who paid 5 percent of their discretionary income (with the first $25,000 exempt) toward their loans for 20 years.SandersMr. Sanders wants to make all public colleges and universities free, cancel all student loan debt -- about $1.6 trillion owed by about 45 million Americans -- and cap student loan interest rates at 1.88 percent. He says he would pay for the debt cancellation with a tax on financial transactions like stock trades.Climate changeBidenMr. Biden's $1.7 trillion climate plan calls for 100 percent carbon-free energy and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It would end fossil fuel subsidies and subsidize clean energy, but envisions a continued role for fossil fuels for some time: It would not ban fracking, for instance. Mr. Biden also supports federal funding for carbon capture and sequestration programs that could, in theory, eventually offset some emissions.SandersMr. Sanders is a proponent of the Green New Deal, a sweeping resolution that calls for aggressive action to combat climate change, and has modeled his $16.3 trillion proposal on that plan. He calls for an immediate ban on fracking, for the electricity and transportation sectors to be carbon-free by 2030, and for the United States to end the use of fossil fuels no later than 2050.ImmigrationBidenMr. Biden wants to undo the Trump administration's hard-line immigration policies, reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.In contrast to Mr. Sanders, he would not decriminalize unauthorized border crossings, but he is calling for a 100-day moratorium on deportations and says he would deport only people who have committed a serious crime.SandersMr. Sanders has called for a moratorium on deportations pending a review of the current immigration system. He also supports the reinstatement and expansion of the DACA program, which protected from deportation people who were brought into the United States as children.In addition, he has backed the movement to abolish federal agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.Mass incarcerationBidenCriminal justice is a fraught issue for Mr. Biden, who helped pass laws, like the 1994 crime bill, that produced mass incarceration to begin with. He has made a stark reversal on the issue during this campaign, calling for incentives for states to shift from incarceration to crime prevention, an end to mandatory minimum sentences and the death penalty, and decriminalizing marijuana.In contrast to Mr. Sanders, however, he does not want to legalize marijuana.SandersMr. Sanders has promised to cut the national prison population in half and end mass incarceration. To do that, he wants to abolish the death penalty, three-strikes laws and mandatory minimum sentences, among other measures.Gun controlBidenMr. Biden supports an assault weapons ban, a voluntary buyback program and a ban on online gun sales, as well as a slew of proposals that are nearly universal among Democratic candidates now, like background checks and red-flag laws. He is also calling for incentives for states to enact gun licensing programs.SandersMr. Sanders, like Mr. Biden, supports an assault weapons ban, a voluntary buyback program and many other gun restrictions. But much like criminal justice for Mr. Biden, gun control is a difficult area for Mr. Sanders, politically speaking: Earlier in his career, he voted against federal background checks and legal liability for gun manufacturers.AbortionBidenMr. Biden has a long and complicated record on abortion. In the 1980s, he supported an attempt to let states overturn Roe v. Wade, and he supported the Hyde Amendment -- which prevents Medicaid from covering abortion in most circumstances -- until just last year.Today, however, he supports the same basic set of policies every major Democrat in the race did, including legislation to codify Roe v. Wade, repeals of the Hyde Amendment and the global and domestic ""gag rules,"" and a pledge to nominate only Supreme Court justices who support abortion rights.SandersMr. Sanders also supports legislation to codify Roe v. Wade, opposes the Hyde Amendment and the global and domestic gag rules, and has promised to nominate only Supreme Court justices who would uphold Roe v. Wade.HomelessnessBidenMr. Biden is proposing $640 billion over 10 years for affordable housing, as well as a ""bill of rights"" that would provide protections against eviction, foreclosure and predatory mortgages. He also wants to create tax credits for renters and first-time homeowners and expand the Section 8 housing voucher program.SandersMr. Sanders proposes spending $2.5 trillion to build about 10 million permanently affordable housing units. He also wants to implement a national rent control standard and spend $70 billion to repair public housing.Money in politicsBidenMr. Biden is calling for a constitutional amendment to make elections completely publicly funded, eliminating all private contributions -- a significant step beyond what Mr. Sanders has proposed. In the shorter term, he wants to put new restrictions on super PACs and publicly finance major parties' national conventions.SandersLike most Democrats, Mr. Sanders wants to overturn Citizens United -- the Supreme Court decision that prevents the government from banning political spending by corporations in elections -- and then pass a constitutional amendment that makes clear that money is not speech. He also wants to abolish super PACs and has called for a ban on corporate contributions to the Democratic National Convention.He has criticized Mr. Biden for accepting campaign contributions from billionaires.Wealth inequalityBidenMr. Biden wants to strengthen collective bargaining, hold corporate executives personally liable for anti-union efforts and enforce labor laws more strongly. He is also calling, like many Democrats, for a $15 minimum wage, and for higher taxes on corporations and wealthy investors.SandersMr. Sanders has suggested taxing the rich with a wealth tax and progressive estate tax while also enacting a federal jobs guarantee, doubling union membership and taking other steps to bolster the working and middle class. He also wants to break up big banks.PhotographClimate change, the cost of health care and gun control are just a few of the issues on which Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. have had significant differences.

| Jump to first hitThe move, which would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial, could enhance her chances of becoming vice president but could also anger liberals in California.Senator Kamala Harris is weighing an endorsement of Joseph R. Biden Jr., according to multiple Democratic officials familiar with her deliberations. Such a move could lift Mr. Biden's campaign and perhaps do even more to enhance Ms. Harris's chances of becoming vice president, but it could also anger her liberal base in California.An endorsement by Ms. Harris, if she wades into the primary race at all, would be unlikely to happen until after the Senate impeachment trial, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.Yet she and Mr. Biden, the former vice president, have remained in contact since she exited the race and had a long conversation in the immediate aftermath of her departure.""Senator Harris remains focused on the ongoing impeachment trial of President Trump,"" said Chris Harris, a spokesman for the senator. ""No decisions have been made about whether she will endorse, which candidate, nor when an endorsement decision will be made.""Democrats close to Ms. Harris said she wanted to carefully consider the potential impact of her endorsement; was mindful that two of her female colleagues, Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, were still in the race; and was uneasy about the prospect of backing a candidate only to see him or her lose California.Mr. Biden has lavished praise on Ms. Harris since she departed the race, predicting she would have a wealth of political opportunities in the future. And when asked directly if he would consider her as his running mate, he said, ""Of course I would.""A Biden-Harris rapprochement would represent an extraordinary turnaround in their relationship after she so memorably confronted him on the debate stage last summer. Yet their would-be alliance is less surprising on closer inspection.At the outset of the Democratic contest, they were collegial with each other. That was in large part because Ms. Harris served as state attorney general in California at the same time that Mr. Biden's son Beau was attorney general of Delaware, and the two young, ambitious Democrats had bonded. (Beau Biden died in 2015.)But Ms. Harris's friendship with the former vice president became badly strained after the first primary debate, in June, when she criticized him for his past opposition to school busing.Ms. Harris was trying to loosen Mr. Biden's grip on African-American primary voters, and her searing reference to her own childhood experience with integration might have been the high point of her campaign. But it came at the expense of an older, white candidate who was already fending off questions about his record on matters of race. And Mr. Biden was personally stung by her attack, his advisers said, because he considered her a friend.Yet Ms. Harris's surge in the polls did not last, and the two candidates never sparred again in the same way. By October, aides to both Democrats recall, they were getting along well when they ran into each other at the Des Moines airport before heading to Ohio for the debate there.More significant than their personal rapport, a Harris endorsement of Mr. Biden would be politically useful for both of them.A 55-year-old woman of African and Indian descent with law enforcement credentials, Ms. Harris was already likely to be on Mr. Biden's short list, should he emerge as the nominee. Yet she could bolster her chances to be his running mate if she backed his campaign at a critical time, particularly if he did not win in either Iowa or New Hampshire next month and needed a boost in Nevada and South Carolina. And even if she is not chosen for vice president, she would be a leading contender for a cabinet post, such as attorney general.For Mr. Biden, who is working to consolidate support from Democratic leaders as Senator Bernie Sanders's progressive candidacy gains strength, an endorsement from Ms. Harris would signal that party leaders were rallying behind his candidacy and offer him a well-known surrogate to stump on his behalf as the race goes on.The risk for Ms. Harris would be if she were to get behind Mr. Biden only to see him lose in California, which votes on March 3 as part of Super Tuesday. A survey of the state's Democratic voters, conducted this month by the Public Policy Institute of California survey, found that Mr. Biden was in second place to Mr. Sanders, of Vermont. But the poll highlighted the strength of the progressive bloc in the state: Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren combined were capturing 50 percent of the vote.Rose Kapolczynski, a longtime Democratic strategist in California, said Ms. Harris would not damage her prospects for re-election in 2022 by backing Mr. Biden. But if Democrats were to lose the presidency this fall, supporting him could shape how she was perceived by the left, were she to run again for president four years from now.""It just depends on where she wants to go,"" Ms. Kapolczynski said. ""Is she interested in vice president or a cabinet position? Or is she looking ahead to another campaign and how she'll be positioned then?""Bill Carrick, another California consultant and an adviser to Senator Dianne Feinstein, also said it would be unlikely that voters in the state would ""make a judgment about the Senate race next time out based on who she endorsed in the presidential race."" But Mr. Carrick added that Mr. Biden's multiracial coalition overlapped with Ms. Harris's own core base of support and that it would be logical for her to side with him.""She's going to have a lot of people allied with her who will be for Joe,"" he said.PhotographSenator Kamala Harris has yet to endorse a candidate in the Democratic presidential primary race, but she has stayed in contact with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden since she dropped out.
