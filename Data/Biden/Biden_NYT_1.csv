| Jump to first hitThe House impeachment managers sought to undercut the central elements of President Trump's defense, wading into a detailed defense of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.WASHINGTON -- House Democrats sought on Thursday to pre-emptively dismantle President Trump's core defenses in his impeachment trial, invoking his own words to argue that his pressure campaign on Ukraine was an abuse of power that warranted his removal.On the second day of arguments in the third presidential impeachment trial in American history, Democrats sought to make the case that Mr. Trump's actions were an affront to the Constitution. And they worked to disprove his lawyers' claims that he was acting only in the nation's interests when he sought to enlist Ukraine to investigate political rivals.In doing so, they took a calculated risk in talking at length about Mr. Trump's targets -- former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden -- and underscored the political backdrop of a trial that is unfolding only 10 months before the election and is likely to reverberate long after the verdict.""You know you can't trust this president to do what's right for this country -- you can trust he will do what's right for Donald Trump,"" said Representative Adam B. Schiff, the lead impeachment manager, said in an impassioned appeal as the clock ticked past 10 p.m. ""This is why if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Right matters and the truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.""The team of seven Democratic impeachment managers repeatedly attacked the idea that when the president withheld military aid from Ukraine and sought to secure a promise to investigate Joseph Biden, he was merely making a foreign policy decision to root out corruption in Ukraine.Mr. Trump has consistently suggested, without any evidence, that Mr. Biden pushed to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company with a long history of corruption that employed Hunter Biden on its board. Representative Sylvia R. Garcia, Democrat of Texas, spent nearly an hour debunking the claim, and said that, in fact, the opposite was true.The prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was ""widely perceived as corrupt,"" she said, and Mr. Biden was acting in accordance with official American policy, as well as the policy of the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international organizations in calling for his removal.Moreover, Mr. Shokin had already let the Burisma investigation ""go dormant,"" Ms. Garcia said, so his ouster ""would only increase the chance that Burisma would be investigated for possible corruption."" She asserted that neither the elder Mr. Biden nor his son had done anything wrong, and that American officials -- and Mr. Trump -- knew it.""Every single witness who was asked about the allegations again said that Biden had nothing to do with it and it was false; they testified that he acted properly,"" Ms. Garcia said, adding, ""There is simply no evidence, nothing, nada in the record to support this baseless allegation.""It was, in effect, a defense of one of the Democrats' leading 2020 presidential candidates and a potential challenger to the president. Mr. Schiff later volunteered that neither he nor his colleagues had a position on the Democratic presidential primary.Mr. Schiff also brought Mr. Trump into the chamber -- at least on video -- to use the president's own words against him, with a clip in which the president called both Bidens ""corrupt"" and called for Ukraine to start a ""major investigation"" into them.""The president has confirmed what he wanted in his own words,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""He has made it clear he didn't care about corruption, he cared only about himself. Now it is up to us to do something about it, to make sure that a president, that this president, cannot pursue an objective that places himself above our country.""But in focusing on the Bidens, Democrats took a strategic risk. Some Republicans have already threatened to call the Bidens as witnesses, even suggesting that they would insist on hearing from them as a condition of agreeing to subpoena John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser.Democrats have refused to consider the idea, and Mr. Biden has said he would not take part in any such swap. And on Thursday, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said he would not ""give in to that pressure"" from some of his colleagues to do so.But Mr. Trump's legal team said the Bidens were now fair game in the trial.""They have opened the door,"" said Jay Sekulow. ""It's now relevant.""Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, said the Democrats' arguments had made testimony from the Bidens vital.""If we're going to call witnesses,"" he said, ""it's now clear we absolutely must call Hunter Biden, and we probably need to call Joe Biden.""Mr. Trump seemed to be paying attention. At a Republican National Committee event on Thursday evening at the president's club in Doral, Fla., he told 400 people that the proceedings were ""impeachment lite"" compared with the trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999 and the case against President Richard M. Nixon in the 1970s.In laying out their case against Mr. Trump, the Democrats focused tightly on the first of two charges against him: that he abused his power by trying to compel a foreign power to help him win re-election in 2020 and withheld two official acts -- the provision of $391 million in military aid and a White House meeting with Ukraine's president -- in an effort to advance his illicit scheme.""President Trump exploited our ally, Ukraine, for his own political benefit to the detriment of American national security,"" said Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York. ""Is that conduct impeachable? The answer is categorically yes. The Senate must hold this president accountable for his abuse of power crimes against our Constitution.""Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said: ""Impeachment is not punishment for a crime. Impeachment exists to address threats to the political system.""""Impeachment is the Constitution's final answer to a president who mistakes himself for a king,"" he added.Democrats expect to wrap up their case on Friday with presentations aimed at proving the second charge: that Mr. Trump obstructed Congress by withholding documents and witnesses and otherwise working to conceal his behavior. On Saturday, Mr. Trump's defense team is expected to lay out its case.On Thursday, Mr. Nadler drew on quotes from Alexander Hamilton; from George Washington's farewell address; and from a 1792 letter to Thomas Jefferson from John Adams that warned of ""foreign intrigue and influence"" in arguing that Mr. Trump warranted impeachment and removal from office -- regardless of whether he committed a crime.""No president has ever used his office to compel a foreign nation to help him cheat in our elections,"" Mr. Nadler said, adding, ""It puts even President Nixon to shame.""Mr. Nadler also turned to Trump allies -- including Alan M. Dershowitz, the Harvard Law professor who is assisting in the president's defense, and Mr. Graham -- to make his case, using video clips of their comments from the Clinton impeachment trial to undercut Mr. Trump's defense.In one clip, Mr. Graham, an impeachment manager during the Clinton trial, explained why a ""high crime"" -- one of the criteria the Constitution sets forth for the impeachment and removal of a president -- does not necessarily require breaking a law.""When you start using your office and you're acting in a way that hurts people, you've committed a high crime,"" Mr. Graham said.Even before Thursday's session got underway, it was clear that Mr. Schiff, Mr. Nadler and the other managers had not changed the minds of many Republicans. Senate Democrats were privately expressing concern that they may not get the four Republican votes they would need to bring witnesses and documents into the trial.If they do not, the case could be over by the end of next week. Publicly, though, Democrats were putting on a good face.""I am more hopeful than ever that four conscientious, brave Republicans will come forward and tell Mitch McConnell you can't shut this down without witnesses, you can't shut this down without documents,"" said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, referring to his Republican counterpart.The rules of the trial require senators to ""keep silent, on pain of imprisonment,"" and after two lengthy days of first voting on motions on Tuesday and hearing oral arguments on Wednesday, Republicans were growing weary.Some complained that Democrats were simply reciting the same facts time and time again, more for the television viewing audience than for the audience in the chamber. Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, handed out fidget spinner toys to his colleagues, ostensibly to ease the boredom -- and to deliver a not-too-subtle dig at Democrats.""They spent a lot of time, they're well prepared -- I just don't think they have much to work with,"" said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri. ""They've got about a one-hour presentation that they gave six hours on Tuesday and eight hours yesterday.""But Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said the Democrats had good reason to be repetitive: Many senators -- not to mention the public -- did not pay close attention to the House inquiry. One Republican, Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, told reporters as much on Wednesday.""Senators didn't know the case,"" he said. ""They really didn't. We didn't stay glued to the television. We haven't read the transcripts.""Reporting was contributed by Michael D. Shear, Emily Cochrane, Nicholas Fandos, Peter Baker and Catie Edmondson from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.PhotographPresident Trump's lawyers have said he acted on policy.

| Jump to first hitA new study, which found that Americans were reluctant to use the word “she” to describe a hypothetical president, highlights the sneaky ways language illuminates bias.
It was a blip of a moment during the Democratic debate last week, one perhaps overshadowed by a long discussion of the prospect of a female president. Responding to a question about climate change, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said, “I will do everything a president can do all by herself on the first day.”
All by herself. Did you clock the use of that word?
A study released this month shows that you did — and that, in fact, it may have cost you a third of a second in reading time just now.
Her. It’s a three-letter pronoun that, despite the seemingly endless debate over whether a woman can become president, feels relatively benign. But what if its use, or an unconscious aversion to its use, had some small power to influence voter perception? Could something as simple as a pronoun reflect, or even affect, the way voters understand power?
That’s the question raised by the research, conducted by cognitive scientists and linguists at M.I.T., the University of Potsdam and the University of California, San Diego, who surveyed people during the run-up to the 2016 election. Wanting to understand how world events might influence language, the researchers hypothesized that the possibility a woman would be elected president at that time might override the implicit bias people had toward referring to the president as “he.”
But what they found was that Americans — even young, self-identified Democratic women who believed Hillary Clinton would win — were reluctant to use “she” even in the context of a hypothetical president.
“There seemed to be a real bias against referring to the next president as ‘she,’” said Roger Levy, a professor of brain and cognitive sciences at M.I.T. and one of the authors of the study.
When the researchers watched subjects in a reading setting — they were asked to read a short passage about the next president, pressing a button on a screen to reveal each word of the sentence — their bias was even more pronounced: The word “she,” when referring to the future president, made people cognitively stumble, leading to a “considerable disruption” in reading time, said Titus von der Malsburg, another author of the study and a linguist at the University of Potsdam, in Germany.
“People had difficulties reading ‘she’ even if the text had previously used ‘she,’ showing how persistent and deeply ingrained this bias is,” he said.
So could struggling to say or read the word “she” in the context of a president affect our willingness to vote for a woman?
“That’s of course the million-dollar question,” said Dr. von der Malsburg.
He noted that if people gravitated toward male language when talking about presidents, that could indirectly contribute to a culture in which women were not seen as typical candidates.
“And that, in turn, would likely influence election outcomes because women would have to do extra work to convince voters that they can do the job,” he said.
What lurks behind language?
When it comes to women in politics — and specifically, women in the presidency — often lurking behind language are unconscious assumptions about women in power.
“We are uneasy with the president as ‘she’ because encountering it forces us to have in mind a new conception of ‘president,’” the linguist Robin Lakoff said.
Dr. Lakoff, whose book “Language and Woman’s Place” helped create the field of gender linguistics in the 1970s, said that language tended to reflect the beliefs of a particular moment in time.
But it can also shape them.
Research has found that the use of the pronoun “he” can create a male bias in readers, that countries with gendered language have higher gender inequality and that even subtly sexist language may influence voters’ likelihood of supporting a particular candidate.
In recent years, some governments and organizations have started paying more attention to the power of words, taking steps to update or replace gendered terms.
In 2013, Washington State joined Florida and Minnesota in combing through its state codes and statutes to adjust terms like “ombudsman” (now “ombuds”) to be gender neutral. As Liz Watson, then senior counsel at the National Women’s Law Center, said at the time: “Words matter. Words help shape our perceptions about what opportunities are available to women and men.”
Administrators at Yale announced in 2017 that they would replace the words “freshman” and “upperclassman” with “first-year” and “upper-level” students, joining several other universities that have informally made the change. And the singular “they” — increasingly popular as both as substitute for “he or she” and as a gender-neutral pronoun for those who identify as nonbinary — was recently declared the “Word of the Decade” by the American Dialect Society.
That would seem like progress, said the historian Barbara J. Berg. Yet when it comes to the halls of power, she said, the masculine “remains the default in our language.”
It is popular these days to tell the story of Abigail Adams, wife of the founding father John, who urged her husband in a letter in 1776 to “remember the ladies.” Lesser known is that his reply, in a letter back, called her request “saucy.” (The word “she,” of course, does not appear anywhere in the Declaration of Independence, nor does the word “woman.”)
And while, over the years, words like “mailman,” “policeman” and “stewardess” have been replaced with terms like “mail carrier,” “police officer” and “flight attendant,” there are still plenty of phrases for which “he” connotes power. Think “manning the command post,” “maestro” or even “guy” as a way to describe expertise. “As in, ‘He’s a stats guy’ or ‘He’s a policy guy,’” said Philip N. Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland.
The 2018 midterm elections broke all sorts of records — and a historic number of women ran for office and won — and yet they also provided ample opportunity to hear (and see) the phrase “freshman congresswoman.” Doesn’t it sound sort of funny?
Deborah Tannen, a linguist at Georgetown University, described how she had recently spoken with a group of female judges, some of whom recalled being referred to as “sir” when on the bench. Presumably, Dr. Tannen said, the speakers were nervous — and “sir” was an attempt to show respect.
“‘Sir’ is associated with respect to an extent that ‘ma’am’ is not,” Dr. Tannen said, noting that she, too, had occasionally stumbled over such words.
Once, she recalled, at an event in which Michelle Obama was speaking, a friend remarked that “Dr. Biden” would also be in attendance.
“I thought to myself, ‘Oh, I didn’t know Joe Biden had a Ph.D.,’” she said. “And of course it was his wife, who I had met, and who I knew had a Ph.D. So even I do it, Dr. Tannen.”
And then there’s “Madam.” During the 1970s, feminists fought for the adoption of a female equivalent of “Mr.” — one that did not denote marital status — and were largely successful with the honorific “Ms.” But male presidents in the United States are often addressed as “Mr. President,” while a woman — if the way we refer to cabinet secretaries is any indication — would quite likely be “Madam President.”
“‘Madam’ could be a term of respect, but it’s also the head of a brothel,” said Dr. Berg, the historian. “So it’s like this constant subtle reminder of a woman’s status.”
A candidate who can ‘bring people with her’
But a new breed of candidates may be flipping that script.
During the recent Democratic debate, in addition to Ms. Warren’s use of “herself” in reference to the next president on more than one occasion, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said in her closing statement, “We need a candidate who is actually going to bring people with her.”
Senator Kamala Harris of California, who dropped out of the race late last year, often did the same when she was running. As California’s first female attorney general, she sifted through the language that was written into the law — statutes referring to the attorney general as “he” or “his” — and changed them.
“I’ve always been very aware that when it comes to women holding leadership roles, we are sometimes asking people to see what they have not seen before,” Ms. Harris said in an email. “As our government becomes more reflective of the people it represents and the voices at the table become more diverse, it is important for us to really check how we are creating and supporting an inclusive environment — and a big part of that is about how we use language.”
Of course, one might argue there’s something of a feedback loop: The language reflects the culture. The culture won’t change until there is a winning candidate who upends the old biases. But those running for that spot may be impeded by the incessant talking about gender.
The researchers say the United Kingdom may provide an encouraging case study.
In 2017, they replicated the study there, in the lead-up to an election to determine the next prime minister.
Theresa May was prime minister at the time and was expected to win — but she was not the first woman to hold that post. (That was Margaret Thatcher.)
When referring to the next prime minister, the British study participants were more likely to use the pronoun “she” than “he.”

| Jump to first hitAfter Mr. Biden's big wins on Super Tuesday Mr. Bloomberg endorsed him and said that he planned to remain involved in the 2020 presidential campaign.Michael R. Bloomberg dropped out of the presidential race and backed Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday, throwing the financial might of the Democratic Party's biggest benefactor behind the former vice president's campaign as Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont vowed to wage a long battle for the nomination.Mr. Sanders, regarded a week ago as having a clear upper hand over Mr. Biden, sounded chagrined after losses in states from Maine to Texas where he was hoping for huge turnout. There was a surge in voter participation, but it lifted Mr. Biden instead.Mr. Sanders now faces pressure to show he can expand his political base, and he acknowledged that he had not yet managed to transform the electorate with a wave of young people.The sudden shift in political momentum has redefined the Democratic race at breakneck speed. Since Saturday night, when Mr. Biden won South Carolina in a landslide, much of the Democratic establishment has aligned behind him. Two rivals, Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar, dropped out and endorsed Mr. Biden on Sunday and Monday; he won 10 states on Tuesday, including Texas and North Carolina; and Mr. Bloomberg backed him on Wednesday.Only Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts remains as a major candidate. Her campaign said on Wednesday that she was assessing her path forward in view of another night of dispiriting election returns, including a third-place finish in her home state, that left Ms. Warren without a single victory after a month of primaries and caucuses.Mr. Sanders said on Wednesday that he had spoken with Ms. Warren, who for months had been his most formidable rival from the Democrats' populist wing. But Mr. Sanders said he applied no public pressure on her to stand down and shared no knowledge of her intentions, if he had any.Some supporters have urged Ms. Warren to take her time, while others are pressing her to capitalize on her existing leverage by dropping out and endorsing Mr. Biden, according to Democrats who have spoken to her. But Ms. Warren made it clear to one supporter on Wednesday that she was not going to act hastily and that it may be at least another day before she makes up her mind.In a further boon to Mr. Biden, Mr. Bloomberg signaled in his concession speech that he intended to keep wielding his multibillion-dollar fortune against President Trump. The former New York City mayor had previously pledged to keep spending large sums of money to help Democrats in the general election, even if Mr. Bloomberg did not become the nominee. (The Sanders campaign has said it would not welcome that kind of help.)""I am cleareyed about our overriding objective, and that is victory in November,"" Mr. Bloomberg said, adding, ""I will not be our party's nominee, but I will not walk away from the most important political fight of my life.""Advisers to Mr. Bloomberg said on Wednesday that they had not yet settled on a detailed spending plan for the general election, but Mr. Bloomberg is said to be keenly interested not only in the presidential race but also in Democratic efforts to take full control of Congress. Members of his enormous campaign staff were told that it would take perhaps a week for final decisions about how Mr. Bloomberg might reorient his campaign machinery.Mr. Biden's campaign raced to harness his new momentum and Mr. Sanders sought to refocus his rattled political operation for a newly grueling fight. The Biden campaign has told allies that it is seeking to rapidly hire campaign staff to strengthen its presence in states where the former vice president has built little or no organized infrastructure because of his financial difficulties so far.Mr. Sanders's team is hoping that his more developed campaign apparatus might give him a chance to slow Mr. Biden's rise in the half-dozen states that vote next week, most significantly in the large swing state of Michigan. Addressing reporters in Burlington, Vt., on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Sanders described the Michigan primary as ""enormously important"" and said he had high hopes to win.Repeating a litany of criticism he leveled at Mr. Biden in his election-night speech Tuesday, Mr. Sanders indicated he would focus over the next week on attacking Mr. Biden's record of supporting what he described as ""disastrous trade agreements"" that had been particularly damaging to Midwestern states like Michigan. Mr. Sanders said several times that ""Joe is going to have to explain"" various other parts of his record, including his support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the 2008 bailout of the financial industry.Mr. Biden has not faced a sustained challenge in weeks, having been largely written off by his rivals after his embarrassing fifth-place finish in New Hampshire. It remains to be seen whether Mr. Biden will be able to fully extend the energy that has propelled his campaign over the last few days, and how deftly he might be able to grapple with a determined opponent like Mr. Sanders.But Mr. Sanders acknowledged that he was disappointed by the results from contests this week in 15 states and territories, two-thirds of which Mr. Biden won. And in a striking and uncharacteristic admission, Mr. Sanders conceded that his campaign had not managed to generate the soaring turnout among young people that he had been counting on to secure the nomination.""Have we been as successful as I would hope, in bringing young people in? And the answer is no,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""We're making some progress.""Campaigning in West Beverly Hills, Calif., on Wednesday, Mr. Biden brandished the breadth and diversity of his support to reject Mr. Sanders's accusations that he is an instrument of the political establishment.""The establishment are all those hard-working, middle-class people, those African-Americans, those single women,"" Mr. Biden said, referring to voters who turned out in force for him this week.Both Biden and Sanders supporters will be looking for victories next Tuesday in primaries and caucuses in Michigan, Missouri and four other states. Mr. Bloomberg's exit, and his immediate move to back Mr. Biden, had the potential to anger Sanders supporters, who have long regarded Mr. Bloomberg as a malignant force in the 2020 campaign, and stoke resentment among progressives that party power brokers were again taking aggressive steps to thwart Mr. Sanders.But Mr. Bloomberg's decision to leave the race came primarily from an unsparing assessment of his own feeble prospects.According to two people briefed on his deliberations, Mr. Bloomberg reached the decision to withdraw from the race on Wednesday morning, after meeting with his inner circle of advisers at the Upper East Side townhouse that is the headquarters of his political and philanthropic empire. Miles away was the Times Square campaign office where in just a few months he assembled an enormous team of aides in a late-starting bid for the presidency.Mr. Bloomberg's advisers had acknowledged to allies even on Tuesday evening that it was unlikely he would continue in the race, and by early Wednesday he was making calls to some of his top supporters to inform them of his decision. Appearing before supporters later in the day, Mr. Bloomberg said that the delegate math that would have earned him the nomination ""had become virtually impossible.""Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Biden spoke by phone on Wednesday morning, a person briefed on the call said. Shortly after Mr. Bloomberg announced his exit, Mr. Biden posted an appreciative tweet saying he would be counting on Mr. Bloomberg's help to defeat President Trump.Mr. Bloomberg's candidacy was unprecedented in its financial firepower, amounting to a no-expenses-spared effort to take control of a presidential race. His Democratic rivals accused him of seeking to buy the presidency, and Mr. Bloomberg often came close to embracing that idea: In his speeches, he frequently made allusions to his vast personal fortune and presented himself to Democratic voters as the candidate with ""the record and the resources"" to win the general election.But Mr. Bloomberg never escaped a set of serious political vulnerabilities that his advisers identified from the outset, including his long record of supporting stop-and-frisk policing and numerous accusations made by women about harassment and gender-based discrimination by Mr. Bloomberg and his company.Both issues came to the fore in the Democratic debate in Las Vegas last month that signaled the beginning of Mr. Bloomberg's downfall, as Ms. Warren left him reeling with a barrage of criticism about his conduct toward women. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, too, harried Mr. Bloomberg for his policing strategies in New York, questioning his sensitivities on matters of race in a manner Mr. Bloomberg defended stiffly and in incomplete or misleading terms.The campaign cost Mr. Bloomberg more than half a billion dollars in advertising alone. He also spent lavishly on robust on-the-ground operations, with more than 200 field offices across the country and thousands of paid staff. His operation dwarfed those of Democratic rivals who ultimately won states in which he had installed many dozens of employees and spent heavily on radio, television and direct mail ads.It also enabled his campaign to produce a staggering volume of attention-grabbing -- and, to some Democrats, cringe-inducing -- commercials and other activities aimed at antagonizing Mr. Trump. The same week Mr. Bloomberg wilted in the Las Vegas debate, his campaign ran advertisements on the city's huge electronic billboards taunting Mr. Trump: ""Donald Trump eats burnt steak,"" read one of them.Mr. Bloomberg used his wealth to assemble an enormous campaign team of over 2,400 staff members. He concentrated more than 100 offices in Super Tuesday states, where his infrastructure quickly exceeded that of his opponents. For instance, in Ms. Warren's home state of Massachusetts -- where Mr. Bloomberg himself grew up -- he established six field offices across the state, four more than Ms. Warren and five more than Mr. Biden, who ultimately won there.But as a full picture of the results came into focus on Tuesday, Mr. Bloomberg had won only a single contest, in the territory of American Samoa.Reporting was contributed by Katie Glueck from West Beverly Hills, Calif.; Sydney Ember from Burlington, Vt.; Jonathan Martin, Jeremy W.

| Jump to first hitA day after a deceptively edited video of him spread on social media, Joseph R. Biden Jr. cautioned that the Democratic nominee would be vulnerable to false information in the general election.ANAMOSA, Iowa -- As the Democratic presidential candidates fanned out across Iowa and New Hampshire on Thursday to address voters still scarred by President Trump's victory in the 2016 election, Joseph R. Biden Jr. argued that any Democratic nominee would be vulnerable to baseless criticism and disinformation in the general election.Mr. Biden's remarks in Iowa, at his first political event of the 2020 election year, came a day after a deceptive video of him circulated online, highlighting how campaigns are still struggling to combat false information on the internet.""You're going to see a lot more of not only my statements being taken out of context and lied about or altered, you're going to see whomever the Democratic nominee is, because that's how this guy operates,"" Mr. Biden said, adding that Democratic candidates would face unfair attacks from Mr. Trump ""if I were to drop out of the race tomorrow"" or ""if I were to drop dead tomorrow."" (There was no evidence that the video was connected to the president.)Mr. Biden's comment came in response to an event attendee who asked him about his ability to beat Mr. Trump, and also to clarify his remarks in the video, which had been misleadingly edited to wrongly suggest that Mr. Biden was making racist remarks. In fact he was emphasizing the need to change ""our culture"" around violence toward women.Still, the video spread rapidly on social media, amplified by many right-wing verified users on Twitter, including reporters at conservative news outlets, the former speaker of the Missouri House and Republican strategists, according to data compiled by Vinesight, a company that detects disinformation on social media. It is an online environment that alarms many Democratic voters who are gripped by anxiety over how best to defeat Mr. Trump.The president, who was impeached in the House of Representatives in connection with asking Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden, is comfortable only in a ""mosh pit,"" said Mr. Biden, who has faced months of false or exaggerated attacks from Mr. Trump and other Republicans.Still, he argued that the Democratic Party was in a far stronger position today to confront Mr. Trump than in 2016, noting support for the president's impeachment among some voters -- ""Hillary didn't have that advantage"" -- and saying that in the previous campaign, not everyone took Mr. Trump seriously.In response to the questioner, who also asked whether he was running a better campaign than Hillary Clinton had, Mr. Biden offered a wide-ranging answer and relitigated how Mrs. Clinton handled a debate after Mr. Trump was caught on tape bragging about making unsolicited sexual advances.He suggested that Mrs. Clinton could have changed the subject, pivoting to how she hoped to change voters' lives. Instead, Mr. Biden said, ""she did what every other candidate probably would have done"" by lacing into his character, yielding an ugly debate, and ""it all went down the drain."" Yet before that debate even started, Mr. Trump had invited several women who had made allegations against former President Bill Clinton to join him for a photo opportunity.Mr. Biden also noted sexism as he discussed the last campaign, which he called ""unfair,"" but added, ""That's not going to happen with me.""It was not just Mr. Biden who was ruminating on the 2016 election on Thursday; Mrs. Clinton's loss in the Electoral College was on the minds of other candidates as well as voters.At a campaign office opening in Plymouth, N.H., the entrepreneur Andrew Yang told voters: ""Donald Trump is our president today because he had a very simple message -- he said he was going to 'make America great again.' What did Hillary Clinton say in response? 'America is already great.""'""That did not quite work,"" Mr. Yang said. ""The problems are real. The struggles are real. Many Americans are being left behind. But Donald Trump's solutions were not what we need.""And Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, campaigning at a town-hall-style event in Concord, N.H., was asked by a voter whether she would work to unite the party around the Democratic nominee if it was not her. The voter noted how some supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont did not rally behind Mrs. Clinton in the general election against Mr. Trump.Ms. Warren began a lengthy answer by first committing to party unity: ""Every single person who is in the race for the Democratic nomination for president would make a far better president than Donald Trump,"" she said to applause.""I'm in all the way,"" she added, and started making the case for differences between the 2020 race and the 2016 campaign -- chiefly, in her telling, the palpably greater determination and intensity among Democrats to beat Mr. Trump.""What we have to remind ourselves is, 2020 is not 2016. The world has changed,"" she said, recalling the protest marches after Mr. Trump's inauguration and the Democratic victories in 2018 in the House of Representatives and key governorships, and in 2019 in Kentucky, Louisiana and Virginia.""We are getting stronger and we are in this fight,"" she said. ""2020 gives us this remarkable moment that is very different from '16 or '12 or '08 or however far you want to go back. This moment where Americans are off the sidelines.""Saying that ""the door is open a crack"" to an era of major reforms and the end of ""business as usual,"" she added: ""Think about it -- a nation that elects someone like Donald Trump is a nation that has got serious problems. Going back is not where we want to be. Our chance in 2020 is to look at that crack, drop our shoulder, run hard at it and build the America we want to be.""Asked for comment, a Republican National Committee spokesman, Steve Guest, said, ""Insulting half the country didn't work for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and it won't work for the Democrats in 2020, either.""Mr. Sanders, another leading progressive in the race, also waded into the debate over how to defeat Mr. Trump as he uncorked some of his fiercest criticism of Mr. Biden to date in an interview with The Washington Post.""It's just a lot of baggage that Joe takes into a campaign, which isn't going to create energy and excitement,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""He brings into this campaign a record which is so weak that it just cannot create the kind of excitement and energy that is going to be needed to defeat Donald Trump.""Mr. Sanders on Thursday reported an eye-popping fund-raising haul of more than $34.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, according to his campaign, ahead of Mr. Biden at $22.7 million -- Mr. Biden's strongest quarter to date -- as well as former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose campaign reported more than $24.7 million.Even as Mr. Sanders sharpened his attacks on Mr. Biden in the interview, he largely stuck to his familiar message on the trail in Iowa on Thursday, denouncing income inequality and championing his signature policy proposal, ""Medicare for all."" At a canvass kickoff in Grinnell, he jokingly named a young girl as his running mate.As he boarded his new campaign bus after that event, he briefly answered a question about his fourth-quarter fund-raising, calling attention specifically to the more than five million contributions his campaign had received since he entered the race. ""That tells me the kind of grass-roots support that we have and tells me why we're going to win the nomination and why we're going to defeat Donald Trump,"" he said.Reporting was contributed by Patrick Healy and Matt Stevens from Concord, N.H.; Sydney Ember from Muscatine, Iowa; and Nick Corasaniti from New York.PhotographJoseph R. Biden Jr. said at a campaign event in Anamosa, Iowa, on Thursday that voters were likely to see more of his statements ""being taken out of context and lied about or altered.""

| Jump to first hitWith the coronavirus as a backdrop, and with no audience in attendance, the two Democrats were at times feisty discussing their differences over health care. Mr. Biden also committed to choosing a woman as a running mate.Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders called for vastly more aggressive government action to battle the coronavirus but split over some of the details along familiar ideological lines on Sunday night, as the two Democrats tangled over the right to lead their party into a campaign overshadowed by the pandemic inflicting havoc on the country's economy and its social fabric.In their first one-on-one debate of the primary race, Mr. Sanders, a democratic socialist from Vermont, demanded sweeping economic reform and the creation of a single-payer health care system to address crises like the virus. Mr. Biden said he would call up the military to help and enact a ""multi-multi-billion dollar program"" of disease containment and economic rescue, and said that there were more issues at hand that could not wait on reinventing the health care system.Mr. Biden, the former vice president, said managing the coronavirus was ""like a war,"" while Mr. Sanders said it had exposed ""the dysfunctionality"" of the country's patchwork health care system.Yet on matters beyond the virus, the two men careened from making gestures toward party cohesion and personal comity to clashing over their divergent policy agendas and records in office.Mr. Biden repeatedly sought to play down criticism from Mr. Sanders and to play a unifying role. He offered lengthy praise for a proposal by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, his progressive former rival, to reform the bankruptcy code, and in a striking commitment he made an ironclad pledge to name a woman as his running mate. Mr. Sanders said that ""in all likelihood"" he, too, would choose a female running mate.But Mr. Sanders persistently challenged Mr. Biden over his positions on core Democratic issues, leaving the former vice president struggling to explain -- and in some cases misrepresenting -- his past record on matters like funding Social Security and the war in Iraq. And Mr. Biden also went on offense, especially over Mr. Sanders's history of praising leftist governments in Latin America.Still, with Democrats single-mindedly focused on defeating President Trump, and with the country as a whole dismayed by a growing pandemic, both candidates offered assurances of mutual support for the general election. ""It's much bigger than either of us,"" Mr. Biden said, vowing to campaign for Mr. Sanders if he were the nominee.""If I lose this thing, Joe wins -- Joe, I will be there for you,"" Mr. Sanders promised.Their sparring represented what may be the last vestiges of a once-uncertain contest that -- after his commanding victories over the past two weeks -- now clearly favors Mr. Biden. Indeed, the growing threat of the coronavirus, combined with the former vice president's significant advantage in delegates, lowered the debate stakes and might have rendered it most memorable for Mr. Biden's promise to choose a woman as his running mate.He has been widely expected to do so, but his pledge was sure to draw attention, fuel speculation about who the woman may be and generally tilt attention toward the general election and away from the primary race.The specter of the coronavirus pervaded their encounter from their first moments onstage: Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders declined to shake hands at the start and stood six feet apart from each other at a television studio in Washington, D.C., following the guidelines for social distancing prescribed by public health authorities. In deference to the same regulations, the debate took place without a live audience.Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders approached each other at first with caution, splitting over matters of policy but largely declining to go on the attack in sharp terms, before clashing in a feistier manner as the event wore on. Their early restraint was notable, because the debate was their first encounter since Mr. Biden reclaimed his once-wobbly status as the Democratic front-runner and Mr. Sanders lost the surging momentum he captured in the race for a time last month.Where the two men agreed was in deploring Mr. Trump's approach to the coronavirus, and in demanding a more far-reaching government strategy to contain the outbreak and patch up the economic wreckage it is causing. Mr. Biden argued that every resource of the government should be mobilized to limit short-term damage, while Mr. Sanders said that countering it would require a more drastic overhaul of economic and health care systems.""This is like we are being attacked from abroad,"" Mr. Biden said. ""This is something that is of great consequence. This is like a war.""Mr. Sanders called the coronavirus crisis an ""unprecedented moment in American history,"" and said it drew attention to the fact that the country lacked ""a system that is prepared to provide health care for all people.""In an early barb directed at Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders said it would take a direct confrontation with the insurance and pharmaceutical industries to remedy the situation, including enacting his proposal for a ""Medicare for all""-style system that he has championed.""Do we have the guts to take on the health care industry, some of which is funding the vice president's campaign?"" Mr. Sanders asked.But Mr. Biden pushed back aggressively on the notion that Mr. Sanders's signature proposal could mitigate the virus, invoking Europe's hardest-hit country.""With all due respect to Medicare for all, you have a single-payer system now in Italy,"" he said, arguing that such a system ""would not solve the problem.""Beyond their familiar disagreements on health care, Mr. Sanders leveled a larger critique of Mr. Biden's approach to leadership, accusing him of compromising too readily with Republicans and corporate interests. He also challenged the former vice president over decades' worth of votes on abortion, gay rights, foreign wars, bankruptcy regulation and retirement-security programs.At times, the debate became a kind of tense colloquy between longtime colleagues, as Mr. Sanders prodded Mr. Biden to account for his past positions.In the most heated moments, the two candidates scolded each other by name -- interjecting ""Joe!"" and ""Bernie!"" -- and showed visible exasperation. Mr. Biden laughed at one of Mr. Sanders's rebukes and muttered ""Give me a break"" when the Vermont senator urged him to disavow a super PAC supporting his campaign.""I won't give you a break on this one, Joe,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""You've condemned super PACs. You've got a super PAC. It's running negative ads.""Indeed, Mr. Sanders repeatedly forced Mr. Biden onto the defensive, leading the former vice president to play down or misstate portions of his own record. Challenged by Mr. Sanders for his role championing bankruptcy legislation backed by the credit card industry, Mr. Biden said he did not help write the legislation and ""made it clear to the industry that I did not like the bill"" -- though Mr. Biden was among its most vocal Democratic supporters.Pressed by Mr. Sanders about his past comments in the Senate suggesting it could be necessary to rein in Social Security and other popular entitlement programs, Mr. Biden gave a halting series of answers that prompted Mr. Sanders to urge him to ""be straight with the American people.""Mr. Biden was not shy about defending other elements of his record from his liberal rival: When Mr. Sanders dismissed the 2008 bailout of the financial sector as a gift to Wall Street executives, Mr. Biden chided him and argued that if the banks had not been stabilized the country would have plunged into ""a great depression.""""All those people Bernie said he cares about would have been in deep trouble,"" Mr. Biden said.Mr. Biden confronted Mr. Sanders with some of his past votes as well, including his opposition to some gun-control legislation.Two days before Florida's crucial primary, Mr. Sanders came prepared with an answer about recent comments that have set off a wave of criticism -- his praise for some elements of Fidel Castro's rule in Cuba. He vowed that as president he would ""put the flag down"" for ""democracy and human rights.""But when he was pressed by Mr. Biden and the moderators, Mr. Sanders returned to his longstanding position that it was possible to condemn authoritarians while also praising positive elements of their governments. He held up China, which he said had made significant strides in reducing poverty, a comment that prompted Mr. Biden to assail him for praising ""a dictatorship.""Even as they feuded, the candidates stopped well short of the kind of scorched-earth attacks that have characterized the climactic debates in past nomination fights, including both the Democratic and Republican primary campaigns in 2016.After one extended attack on him, Mr. Biden good-naturedly noted that he had tried to give Mr. Sanders ""credit for some things"" but that he was ""making it harder for me,"" causing the Vermont senator to smile.Both candidates highlighted their own new habits: online gatherings instead of in-person campaign rallies and no more handshaking -- and lots of handwashing. ""I'm using a lot of soap and hand sanitizers,"" Mr. Sanders said. Added Mr. Biden, ""I wash my hands God knows how many times a day with hot water and soap.""Mr. Sanders addressed a broader electoral issue in an interview on CNN after the debate, when asked if the primaries in four states on Tuesday should go on. ""That is a very good question,"" he said, adding that he was ""not sure it makes a lot of sense"" to have older people who are susceptible to the virus gathered at polling places.The debate showed Mr. Sanders in fighting form, and perhaps sounding further away from conceding than Mr. Biden's camp had hoped. After the debate, Anita Dunn, Mr. Biden's chief strategist, likened Mr. Sanders to a political demonstrator, saying the former vice president had spent the debate ""graciously dealing with the kind of protester who often shows up at campaign events, on live television.""The forum on Sunday was originally set to be held in Phoenix, before a live audience. But in a series of incremental announcements over the past week, CNN and the Democratic National Committee declared that there would be no live audience; that the debate would be moved to Washington; and that one of the planned moderators, Jorge Ramos, would be replaced because he might have been exposed to the coronavirus.The unusual circumstances reflected a larger freeze in the presidential campaign: Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have all but halted public campaign activity since last week's primaries.Both candidates are in their late 70s and could face the risk of contracting the virus themselves from prolonged exposure to large numbers of voters. Aides to Mr. Biden, 77, and Mr. Sanders, 78, have said that neither man has been tested for the virus or shown any symptoms of the disease.Amid the slowdown in campaigning, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have been trying to match their core themes to the moment of crisis. There is now a general view among all of the political campaigns -- including Mr. Trump's -- that the coronavirus could well redraw the existing contours of the presidential race. The crisis might undermine Mr. Trump's plans to run on promises of continued prosperity and instead focus public attention above all on the difficult process of managing a contagion and rebuilding a shaken economy.PhotographJoseph R.

| Jump to first hitFor the first time, Twitter applied its policy against fake and misleading videos and labeled one.WASHINGTON -- A manipulated video featuring Joseph R. Biden Jr. and spread by President Trump over the weekend has ratcheted up an online war that has put Twitter and Facebook in the middle of a debate over political speech.The campaigns have fought for months over misinformation targeting Mr. Biden, and the latest salvo has taken on greater import with his surge in the Democratic primaries.In response to such misinformation, the tech platforms have written new and diverging rules on political speech. On Sunday, Twitter tagged the video in question as manipulated content, while Facebook left the video intact without any flags about the false content.The video came from a stump speech by Mr. Biden on Saturday in Kansas City, Mo., where he appeared to struggle through a sentence and with halting words said, ""We can only re-elect Donald Trump.""But the rest of Mr. Biden's sentence was selectively edited out. In full, Mr. Biden was stressing the need for Democrats to unite against Mr. Trump.""We can only re-elect Donald Trump if in fact we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. It's got to be a positive campaign,"" he said.Through Saturday, manipulated video of Mr. Biden's words caught fire.Dan Scavino, Mr. Trump's assistant and the White House director of social media, shared a version of the video on Saturday on Twitter and Facebook.""Sleepy Joe in St. Louis, Missouri today: 'We can only re-elect @realDonaldTrump. #KAG2020LandslideVictory,"" Mr. Scavino wrote with a link to the video.Mr. Trump then retweeted Mr. Scavino's post late Saturday.""The video was not manipulated,"" Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump re-election campaign, said. ""Joe Biden really is that bad.""The video circulated throughout much of Sunday without a response from the social media networks. After users flagged the video to Twitter on Sunday, the company said it had determined that the video violated its rules against synthetic and manipulated video and labeled the video as manipulated content. By that point, it had been viewed more than five million times and retweeted more than 20,000 times.It was the first time that Twitter applied a policy announced in February against fake and misleading videos. Facebook, however, did not remove or flag the video as misinformation, angering the Biden campaign.""Facebook's malfeasance when it comes to trafficking in blatantly false information is a national crisis in this respect,"" Greg Schultz, Mr. Biden's campaign manager, said in a statement.""It is also an unconscionable act of putting profit above not just our country, but every country,"" he added. ""Facebook won't say it, but it is apparent to all who have examined their conduct and policies: They care first and foremost about money and, to that end, are willing to serve as one of the world's most effective mediums for the spread of vile lies.""Mr. Biden's campaign has complained about false online ads by Mr. Trump's re-election campaign before, beginning in October with an ad on Facebook and other social media outlets that asserted that Mr. Biden had bribed the Ukrainian government to stop an investigation into his son.Facebook refused to remove that video, saying false speech by politicians and their campaigns was permitted as an important facet to political discourse. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, reinforced that view with a speech on free expression at Georgetown University in October, in which he said that political speech was one of the most vetted forms of discourse and that it was important for the public to hear from politicians, including lies.In a statement on Monday, Facebook said, ""Fact checkers rated this video as partly false, so we are reducing its distribution and showing warning labels with more context for people who see it, try to share it or already have.""PhotographManipulated video from a speech by Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Kansas City, Mo., was spread over the weekend.

| Jump to first hitA weak showing in New Hampshire, some Democrats warn, could undermine his electability argument and accelerate a flight of donors and voters to his rivals.MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s fourth-place finish in Iowa and his wobbly standing here in New Hampshire are now testing the central premise of his candidacy -- that he is the Democrat with the strongest chance to defeat President Trump -- and forcing his team to scramble to prove that claim before voters move on to other candidates.The sudden reordering of the early primary race took on a heightened sense of urgency for Mr. Biden on Saturday as a new poll showed him sliding to 11 percent support in New Hampshire. Campaigning in the state just three days before its primary, Mr. Biden went on the offensive against his chief competitor for moderate Democrats, Pete Buttigieg, belittling his record as the former mayor of a small city, questioning his support from African-American voters and declaring, ""This guy's not a Barack Obama.""It was a striking departure from Mr. Biden's self-assured posture throughout most of the campaign. He has said he is ""the clear front-runner in the party."" His allies still cite his strength in general election polls constantly, and have even featured them in his television commercials. He has spent months targeting Mr. Trump rather than driving a sustained message at his rival Democrats, and his attempts to do so at Friday night's debate, while aggressive, did not appear to hurt them.Now Mr. Biden's campaign is confronting its greatest moment of peril to date, marked by worrisome polls, jittery donors and tensions within the staff.""If your whole theory of the case is that I'm the electable one and I can win, and then you lose in the first state and possibly the second state, it sort of blows your entire message,"" said Patti Solis Doyle, who served as Hillary Clinton's campaign manager in 2008.Another weak showing, some Democrats warn, could accelerate a flight of wealthy backers to his two most formidable moderate rivals: Mr. Buttigieg and Michael R. Bloomberg. It could also jeopardize the former vice president's strength in the later-voting, more diverse states he is counting on.In a sign that he knows his campaign is in trouble, Mr. Biden shook up his leadership team at the end of this past week, turning over effective control of the campaign to a longtime adviser, Anita Dunn (his current campaign manager, Greg Schultz, was spotted at a Democratic dinner in Washington instead of at Friday's debate). News of the shake-up leaked quickly and, in an illustration of the growing angst inside his campaign, a number of aides privately indicated how happy they were about the change, while others sought to downplay it.But no amount of staff reshuffling may address Mr. Biden's more fundamental challenge: The setup of the primary calendar means that Mr. Biden is faltering before he has even had a chance to compete in states where he has broader support, like Nevada and South Carolina later in the month.And without a turnaround, he will not have the money to compete on Super Tuesday on March 3, when 14 states, including California and Texas, go to the polls.Of the top four finishers in Iowa, Mr. Biden entered 2020 with the smallest amount of cash on hand -- less than $9 million -- and his January fund-raising total is expected to be less than half of the $25 million haul that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont announced on Thursday. Mr. Biden has been vastly outspent on television ads in New Hampshire, and this past week he shifted some ad spending to Nevada from a state with a later contest, South Carolina.Being forced out by money woes would be a humbling scenario for a former vice president making his third attempt at the White House, who entered the race with widespread name recognition, deep relationships across the party and the reflected glow of having served in the Obama White House.""The best way to prove electability is to do well in contests, and this was always a risk for him because he has hung his hat so strongly on the idea that he was the most electable candidate,"" said Dan Pfeiffer, who served as a top aide to Barack Obama. Referencing the New Hampshire contest, he said, ""The test for Biden is less about where he places and more about whether he shows strength as a candidate coming out of it.""A CNN/University of New Hampshire poll released Saturday, however, was not encouraging. It showed Mr. Sanders leading at 28 percent, Mr. Buttigieg at 21 percent and Mr. Biden a distant third at 11 percent.Troubled by Mr. Biden's poor showing in Iowa, a number of his top supporters have been urging his campaign to make changes: Have the former vice president do more news media interviews. Spend more time engaged in retail politics. ""Let Joe be Joe.""""He has to get out there more, so people see him and talk to him,"" said Mr. Biden's national campaign co-chairman, Representative Cedric L. Richmond of Louisiana, when asked what Mr. Biden needed to be doing differently. ""When he does that, he wins people over.""Last Wednesday, Mr. Biden appeared at a CNN town hall event and impressed many observers by speaking movingly about helping people who struggle with stuttering -- as he once did. Afterward, a prominent New Hampshire Democrat cornered him.That was great, State Senator Lou D'Allesandro recalled telling him, impressed by the connection with the audience. Do more of that.""He's got to get into full-court press mode,"" said Mr. D'Allesandro, a Biden supporter. ""He's got to be, every day, like he was at the CNN town hall meeting. If you want to be president, that's what you've got to do.""Yet Mr. Biden proceeded to go home to Delaware to prepare for Friday night's debate, taking two days off the New Hampshire trail at one of the most uncertain, high-risk moments of his campaign before returning for the debate and a busy final weekend push.Asked if he believed Mr. Biden was making that ""full-court press,"" Mr. D'Allesandro replied: ""I hope so. I'm trying to convince them that's what they should do.""While Mr. Biden was out of state, his chief rival for moderate votes in New Hampshire, Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., held an event with veterans and drew substantial media coverage.Several attendees fit the profile Mr. Biden is targeting: older, moderate, affiliated with labor and skeptical of far-reaching proposals like ""Medicare for all."" It was a sign of the fierce competition Mr. Biden faces for the centrist voters his allies had hoped he would own -- and at least at Mr. Buttigieg's event, a number of attendees who said they had been torn between the two candidates indicated that they were prepared to settle on the young former mayor.""I thought it would be an easy decision, where I'd supported Joe Biden in the past,"" said Steve Shurtleff, the New Hampshire House speaker, who has endorsed Mr. Biden. ""But I really gave a lot of thought to it. I decided to support the vice president, but I was very impressed with Mayor Pete.""Mr. Biden's campaign has been adamant that when they discuss electability, they are focused on the general election against Mr. Trump, arguing that the former vice president has the unique ability to both assemble a diverse coalition and to compete in the industrial Midwest. Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. Biden himself has suggested, struggles with voters of color, a bedrock of the Democratic Party; he did not register with black voters in a recent Quinnipiac University poll.""Joe Biden is a fighter,"" said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr. Biden's campaign. ""And he's going to fight for every last delegate throughout this contest as millions of Democratic voters weigh in on who can actually go toe-to-toe with Donald Trump, win in key battleground states, take the Senate and turn progressive plans into reality.""Mr. Biden is also supported by a super PAC, and his campaign said that Friday was his best debate day for online fund-raising, without specifying how much he raised.How Mr. Biden fares against his Democratic rivals in a nominating contest in a single state -- especially in the heavily white states of Iowa and New Hampshire -- is not necessarily predictive of how he would do in later contests, or against Mr. Trump in battleground states in a general election. But his loss in Iowa was not a narrow one. Of the 31 counties in Iowa that voted for Mr. Obama in the 2008 and 2012 elections only to flip to Mr. Trump in 2016, Mr. Biden won only one.Mr. Biden currently has a commanding lead in South Carolina with older African-American voters, a crucial part of the electorate there. But as Tom Steyer demonstrated with his repeated appeals at Friday's debate, others in the race are aggressively seeking to make inroads with Mr. Biden's base.""I still believe it's Biden's race to lose,"" said former Gov. Jim Hodges of South Carolina, who has endorsed Mr. Biden. ""Nothing in Iowa changed my mind on that. Very little in New Hampshire can change my mind. Now you know, if he performs poorly in New Hampshire and Nevada, that's not good, but I don't anticipate that's the case.""Campaigning in New Hampshire this past week, Mr. Biden seemed to understand it was time to make his argument more aggressively, and he has taken aim in particular at Mr. Buttigieg.At an event in Somersworth where teleprompters had been set up, Mr. Biden highlighted Mr. Buttigieg's relative lack of experience, in addition to faulting him for not appropriately crediting the accomplishments of what Mr. Biden likes to call the ""Obama-Biden administration.""He continued the attacks on Saturday, with his campaign releasing a digital ad drawing a cutting contrast between the responsibilities of running a small city and those of serving in the executive branch. Mr. Biden also repeatedly launched broadsides against Mr. Buttigieg on the campaign trail during the day.It is these kinds of feisty performances that some of his supporters had hoped to see.""Voters have to know the difference,"" Mr. Richmond said.Jim Demers, a New Hampshire lobbyist who was an early supporter of Mr. Obama's, said Mr. Biden was right to be more assertive in contrasting himself with Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders. Mr. Demers supports Mr. Biden after originally backing Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey.""People here want to see Joe Biden up for the fight,"" he said, ""so they're looking for that fire that they know he has.""Jonathan Martin contributed reporting from Manchester, and Stephanie Saul from Columbia, S.C.Jonathan Martin contributed reporting from Manchester, and Stephanie Saul from Columbia, S.C.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitDemocratic officials and some activists for the candidate say Joe Biden's Iowa organization is weak in some areas, which could hurt him on caucus night. Biden aides say they have plenty of boots on the ground.DUBUQUE, Iowa -- This city on the bluffs of the Mississippi River, which rose as a hub of furniture-making and brewing, ought to be a stronghold for Joseph R. Biden Jr. It is a blue-collar enclave with a Catholic heritage, aligning with his working class pitch to voters. Its 31-year-old, labor-connected congresswoman, Abby Finkenauer, has endorsed Mr. Biden.But as Dan Corken, one of Mr. Biden's most fervent volunteers, knocks on doors here, he is dubious about the candidate's prospects just days out from Monday's caucuses.""If you want to look at the Biden community in Dubuque, the average age is probably about 72,"" he said. ""I'm having difficulties imagining some of the people I'm talking to door-knocking getting out on February 3 in the cold to go caucus.""As Mr. Corken approached the first house on a list of potential Biden backers on Tuesday, a volunteer for Bernie Sanders swooped in and planted two signs in the yard before Mr. Corken reached the door.""We're all Bernie,"" a man at the door told Mr. Corken.Caucuses are low-turnout affairs, making grass-roots organizing an essential factor for doing well in Iowa. Well-tooled campaigns depend on a paid field staff and armies of volunteers to identify supporters, ensure they turn out and provide leadership in the many school cafeterias and churches that serve as caucus rooms.But according to nearly a dozen county Democratic chairs and Biden activists around the state, Mr. Biden's ground game has weak spots that threaten him with underperforming his polling in Iowa, where he has consistently been at or near the top.With center-left Democrats increasingly alarmed about Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, becoming the nominee, an effort to coalesce around the strongest moderate alternative -- widely seen as Mr. Biden -- could suffer a blow if the former vice president finishes in third or fourth place, and emerges from Iowa in a weak position.The age of many Biden supporters could also prove detrimental: In 2016 only 28 percent of caucusgoers were over 65, according to entrance polls. Close to four in 10 were under 45 and they strongly favored the insurgent outsider, Mr. Sanders.Besides having supporters who skew older, the Biden campaign has fewer activists like Mr. Corken, according to Iowa Democrats. His campaign also appears to have recruited fewer precinct captains -- the team leaders in each of more than 1,600 caucus sites -- who play a key role wooing undecided voters.Ann Fields, the Democratic chairwoman of Marion County, said that the campaigns of Senator Elizabeth Warren and of Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., had recruited caucus captains for all 17 precincts in her county southeast of Des Moines. Not so the Biden team. ""I would say if they're half full they're lucky,"" she said last week.In Des Moines County in eastern Iowa, Tom Courtney, the Democratic co-chairman, said last week he knew of ""only a few"" Biden precinct captains in his 16 precincts. Asked about the likelihood that a candidate's supporters would materialize on their own without an organizing staff, Mr. Courtney said, ""I've not seen it before.""His wife, Nancy Courtney, who is a Biden activist, said there was a ""slim chance"" Mr. Biden wouldn't reach viability in some caucuses, meaning his support would fall below a 15 percent threshold needed to earn delegates.""A lot of the campaigns have really good staffers and we only have one staffer in Des Moines County,"" she said. ""That worries me.""Pete Kavanaugh, Mr. Biden's deputy campaign manager, said the candidate had plenty of staff members, both paid and volunteer, to turn out supporters.""From the moment Vice President Biden announced his campaign, organizers and volunteers have been engaging Iowans in every corner of the state -- building a robust, grass-roots organization that will turn out our committed supporters on caucus night,"" he said. ""We will have an Iowan as a precinct leader representing the campaign and making the case for Joe Biden in all of Iowa's 1,678 precincts.""Organizing is the secret sauce in a caucus election, though it usually gets little attention as each new poll is seized upon as a sign of who is winning the horse race. Experienced Iowa strategists say a good ground game lifts a candidate's support by two to three percentage points on caucus night.While that may not sound like a lot, it helps explain some past caucus surprises, most recently in the 2016 race: Donald Trump, who led in Iowa polls by an average of 4.7 percentage points on caucus day, had a poor ground game and wound up second behind Ted Cruz, who had an extensive organizing effort.A New York Times/Siena College poll last week showed Mr. Sanders at 25 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers, with Mr. Buttigieg at 18, Mr. Biden at 17 and Ms. Warren at 15. Mr. Biden won among voters 65 and over, but Mr. Sanders was the favorite of those under 65.A Monmouth University poll on Wednesday showed a different order for the same top four: Mr. Biden at 23 percent, followed by Mr. Sanders, 21; Mr. Buttigieg, 16; and Ms. Warren, 15. Senator Amy Klobuchar broke into double digits at 10 percent.One of the crucial jobs of precinct captains is to win over backers of candidates who don't reach the 15 percent viability threshold, and who can realign for a second and final head-count behind candidates who are viable. That's a scenario that could be particularly crucial for Mr. Biden; if Ms. Klobuchar, for instance, doesn't reach 15 percent, Mr. Biden would seem to have a good chance to pick up caucusgoers looking for another centrist to support.But if a candidate lacks a precinct captain in a given caucus, that process is immeasurably harder.Mr. Corken, the Biden volunteer, will serve as a precinct captain in Dubuque, where he said 41 of the 45 precincts had Biden captains. A former high school and college basketball coach, Mr. Corken, 69, had never volunteered for a political campaign before Mr. Trump's election. His prod to activism was ""born out of fear or maybe just anger,"" he said. He did not want to sit back and watch ""what Trump was doing to the country, and now to the Constitution.""But as he walked between single-story houses on the city's west side, he confided his worry that candidates promising a revolution, like Mr. Sanders, are more likely to turn people out than a mainstream politician like Mr. Biden.""The Biden supporters are like me,"" he said. ""They believe we should turn the ship around, not scuttle the ship. Make the government work. Reach out to the Republicans.""At many doors, Democrats told him they were undecided, or didn't plan to caucus, or that they supported Mr. Trump. Bonnie Beacher, 62, was undecided.""Is Biden a possibility?"" Mr. Corken asked.""Could be,"" Ms. Beacher said.""May I just say, I think he can govern the country,"" Mr. Corken told her. ""This is no time for amateurs. He'd walk in the first day and make the government work.""""All righty, thank you,"" said Ms. Beacher, who appeared eager to close the door.Mr. Corken, who has canvassed Dubuque almost daily since the spring, said most Biden volunteers preferred to make phone calls, not trudge the city's hills. ""I know we don't have as many door knockers as the other campaigns,"" he said. ""Whatever the caucus results are, they're not going to be reflective of what the support for Biden is in this town.""Near the end of his route, he hit pay dirt. Tom Lange, who answered the door with his toddler son, said he was ""pretty firmly entrenched with Biden"" and would certainly attend his caucus.Another Iowan, Sue Smith, a retiree, also said she was likely to support Mr. Biden. ""He's been there, done some of it,"" she said.Asked if she would caucus, Ms. Smith said, ""Oh I don't know. When is it?""PhotographDan Corken walked through neighborhoods in Dubuque, Iowa, to canvass for the Biden campaign.; Some Democrats worry that the Biden organization has weak spots across Iowa that could hurt his chances on caucus night.

| Jump to first hitIn a stark moment of political de-escalation, Mr. Sanders signaled that he wants to press Joe Biden on issues but may not want to fight to the bitter end like he did against Hillary Clinton in 2016.It was a concession speech, of a kind: Addressing reporters on Wednesday, Senator Bernie Sanders bowed not to Joseph R. Biden Jr., who trounced him in a second consecutive week of primary elections, but to the reality of his political predicament. Stripped of his briefly held status as the Democratic front-runner, Mr. Sanders acknowledged that he was ""losing"" to Mr. Biden but stopped short of accepting defeat.That careful distinction -- between accepting Mr. Biden's dominance in the race, and yielding to him altogether -- now defines Mr. Sanders's candidacy, and perhaps the Democratic presidential race as a whole.For in Burlington, Vt., Mr. Sanders was more visibly humbled than at nearly any other point since he emerged as a national figure five years ago, during his insurgent challenge to Hillary Clinton. There was no defiant battle cry on Wednesday, no vow to fight Mr. Biden all the way to the Milwaukee convention in July, no allegation of election-rigging or insinuation of an establishment conspiracy like he memorably made in 2016.There was, instead, a matter-of-fact assessment of his own diminished position in the race, followed by an equally unsparing recitation of the policy challenges Mr. Sanders intended to put to Mr. Biden in the coming days.Reaching for a kind of moral victory, Mr. Sanders insisted that his campaign had ""won the ideological debate,"" but allowed that he had not persuaded most voters that he was the likeliest candidate to defeat President Trump.Taken together, it was a stark moment of political de-escalation. Some Democratic officials interpreted it as a signal that Mr. Sanders may not be thirsting for a fight to the bitter end, of the kind he waged against Mrs. Clinton in 2016. Even his criticism of Mr. Biden was largely implicit, framed in terms of questions -- about health care, climate change, immigration and more -- that seemed intended to push Mr. Biden to address the concerns of Mr. Sanders's political base.The great question of the Democratic race may now be whether there is anything Mr. Biden can do to assuage those concerns, and how Mr. Sanders might respond if he does.Representative Peter Welch of Vermont, who is supporting Mr. Sanders, said that the senator sent a clear sign about his political priorities by emphasizing that defeating Mr. Trump was a goal of overriding importance. While Mr. Welch said it was up to Mr. Sanders to decide when his campaign was over, he was already suggesting on Wednesday that Mr. Sanders consider going on a ""unity tour"" to bring the Democratic Party together.""At some point, we're going to have to unify to achieve the overarching goal of defeating Donald Trump,"" Mr. Welch said, calling Mr. Sanders a figure with unique potential to achieve that goal: ""Bernie, more than any other person in this country, can help Biden be the person who defeats Donald Trump.""But Mr. Welch and other Democrats cautioned that Mr. Biden should not expect a quick end to Mr. Sanders's candidacy, or apply too much pressure on Mr. Sanders in the hope of bringing about that outcome. So far, Mr. Biden has shown no inclination to attempt any coercive measures: In his victory speech on Tuesday evening, the former vice president hailed the energy and commitment of Mr. Sanders's supporters and offered himself to them as an ally, but made no suggestion that Mr. Sanders should stand aside.By no means is Mr. Sanders giving Mr. Biden a free pass, however. If his tone was more subdued and the content more clinical -- like a policy questionnaire distributed to officeseekers -- his remarks on Wednesday cataloged considerable skepticism of Mr. Biden and his competing political vision.""Joe,"" he asked, ""how are you going to respond to the scientists who tell us we have seven or eight years remaining to transform our energy system?""""What are you going to do to make sure that all of our people can go to college or trade school regardless of their income?""""What are you going to do about the millions of people who are struggling with outrageous levels of student debt?""Still, after Mr. Biden's string of wins on Tuesday night, both camps seem to recognize that the two men will most likely need to find ways to bring Democrats together behind Mr. Biden this fall. It is a dual challenge that does not play to either man's strengths: convincing a zealous collection of young and progressive voters that Mr. Biden -- an institutionalist moderate who speaks of record players and long-dead Senate colleagues -- is the man to meet the moment.For Mr. Sanders, who has spent the past year suggesting that any candidate besides himself would be insufficiently bold for the times, an eventual endorsement for Mr. Biden would not necessarily persuade admirers that an establishment Democrat should be trusted. It might take a more robust show of support from Mr. Sanders, and even then there is no guarantee that the affections of Mr. Sanders's base can be transferred.For Mr. Biden, who has antagonized Mr. Sanders as a non-Democrat out to diminish the presidency of Barack Obama, even a firm insistence that he understands what is driving Sanders voters will be viewed skeptically.But despite Mr. Biden's success during the last two weeks of primaries, he will need to make gains with some key Sanders constituencies -- not only younger liberals but also Latinos across several age brackets -- to build the most formidable coalition possible in the fall. And he will almost certainly need Mr. Sanders's help to get there.Some veterans of Mrs. Clinton's campaign would advise Mr. Biden not to expect much. Though Mr. Sanders officially endorsed Mrs. Clinton in 2016 and rallied for her, her aides generally viewed the endorsement as somewhere between dutiful and inadequate -- especially when weighed against the months of negative attacks from Mr. Sanders and his supporters depicting her as a corporate tool well after she appeared to have the nomination in hand.There is some reason to believe that this election might be different. Mr. Sanders appears to harbor much less visceral disdain for his opponent than he did in 2016, when he and his aides seethed constantly at the perceived coronation of Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Sanders has never attacked Mr. Biden's character or his personal ethics, even as a good number of his political allies have done so repeatedly.""It needs to be a two-way dance,"" said Brian Fallon, Mrs. Clinton's national press secretary four years ago, noting that even a progressive like Senator Elizabeth Warren had been found wanting by Sanders fans. ""What the courting looks like, what will actually satisfy large chunks of his movement, is a mystery. So much of that movement could not even find Warren as an acceptable alternative. So, what the heck can Joe Biden do?""Mr. Fallon did have a few ideas: namely, some policy drift toward Mr. Sanders's platform on climate or health care issues from the Biden camp if Mr. Sanders leaves the race.At the moment, the Sanders base appears in no mood to settle. Some of his top surrogates continue to tweet eagerly amid his defeats on Tuesday night about Mr. Biden's weaknesses and elevate any scrap of good news about Mr. Sanders, from his strength with young voters to his projected victory in North Dakota.""Nah, it's not over,"" wrote Shaun King, a civil rights activist and Sanders surrogate with over a million followers on Twitter.""Not over indeed,"" said Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator and national campaign co-chair for Mr. Sanders.""We are just getting started,"" tweeted Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, one of the senator's highest-profile endorsers.But there was also an awareness among Sanders allies that he has more at stake in this campaign than in 2016, and that the way his candidacy ends -- if indeed it ends in defeat -- could have far-reaching implications for the fate of the agenda he has championed and the movement he has built.""Whatever he does, he's going to go forward with a base of support that's going to continue to fight for issues,"" said James J. Zogby, a longtime Sanders ally who is the president of the Arab American Institute, in an interview on Tuesday night.Mr. Sanders, he said, had a longer legacy than a presidential campaign: ""He is a transformative figure in our political life.""It falls now to Mr. Sanders to square his grand stature, as an individual leader, with the perilous state of his presidential campaign. Mr. Welch, who has risen in Vermont politics alongside Mr. Sanders for more than three decades, urged his colleague not to bank on an astounding turn of fortune of the kind Mr. Biden enjoyed after the South Carolina primary.""We basically had a miracle in this election a couple weeks ago,"" Mr. Welch said. ""And Joe Biden was the beneficiary of that miracle.""For Mr. Sanders to expect another, he added, would be ""asking a lot of the higher powers.""Photograph""While our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability,"" Senator Bernie Sanders said Wednesday.

| Jump to first hitDiscussions with 60 Democratic officials found that three former candidates -- Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar -- were their leading choices, followed by Stacey Abrams.WASHINGTON -- With former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. now holding an all but insurmountable lead over Senator Bernie Sanders in the presidential primary contest, many Democrats have shifted their attention to a favorite quadrennial parlor game: the vice-presidential search.Mr. Biden has shown his hand in a big and unusual way for a front-runner, saying he would pick a woman as a running mate. That has opened the path for Democratic officials to start picking favorites -- from a socially safe distance.In discussions with The Times since Mr. Biden's big primary victories on Tuesday, 60 Democratic National Committee members and congressional and party leaders most frequently proposed three former rivals of Mr. Biden as his running mate -- Senator Kamala Harris of California, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Next up was Stacey Abrams, a former state House leader whose defeat in 2018 Georgia governor's race remains disputed by many in the party.Other popular suggestions included Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Representative Val Demings of Florida. The Democrats interviewed also proposed seven other women, including Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico.While de facto presidential nominees typically keep their list of potential running mates closely held, Mr. Biden has helped fuel speculation by eagerly rattling off names for months -- nearly all of them women. Even his wife, Jill, offered her take in a private fund-raiser earlier this month, praising Ms. Klobuchar and criticizing Ms. Harris's debate stage attack on her husband last summer.Mr. Biden, at various points, has suggested he might choose Ms. Abrams, Ms. Klobuchar, Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire or Sally Q. Yates, the former assistant attorney general whom President Trump fired three years ago.A female vice president would be historic: Only two women -- Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York in 1984 and Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska in 2008 -- have been nominated, and none have ever served in the White House. That barrier-breaking appeal could give Mr. Biden's candidacy a shot of energy, an acknowledgment of the role women have played in boosting the party during the Trump era.Prominent Democratic activists, officials and leaders have been vocal with their desires that the ticket include a woman, after the demise of the last major female candidate, Ms. Warren, who ended her campaign two weeks ago.""I've been predicting a woman on the ticket since 2017 and demanding it since Warren dropped out,"" said Christine Pelosi, a D.N.C. member from San Francisco who is the daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. ""It's really important to have the ability to lead America in the depression we will enter if we don't flatten the curve and find a cure. The best pick is the woman Joe or Bernie trusts the most to be president and commander-in-chief.""Some of the party's most liberal members and supporters of Mr. Sanders suggested that choosing Ms. Warren, a fellow liberal, would help Mr. Biden appeal to the progressive and young voters who have backed the Vermont senator in the primary. Choosing a moderate like Ms. Klobuchar, they say, would dampen general election enthusiasm.""Whoever ends up the nominee should pick Senator Warren,"" said Tefere Gebre, a D.N.C. member from Maryland who is executive vice president of the AFL-CIO. ""I would be less enthusiastic if it's the senator from Minnesota.""Yet, with the coronavirus upending every part of American society, including the presidential campaign, Mr. Biden may be forced to deviate from the standard playbook.Mr. Biden's running mate pick will be viewed through the lens of a public health and economic crisis, perhaps raising the stock of candidates who have more experience, or pushing him to consider someone from outside of government.""You could imagine some highly successful person from a different walk of life being considered, and that could expand the list a lot,"" said John Podesta, who as Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman was involved in her vice-presidential search. ""A college president or a medical professional, somebody who would send a pretty powerful signal that what you care about is strength, performance, a commitment to facts and sound decision-making.""Mr. Biden's campaign said it was beginning to build a team to conduct a ""vigorous vetting process."" Some close to the campaign say the team is in the early stages of compiling a list of potential running mates and then will vet them. Beyond his own experience as Barack Obama's vice president, Mr. Biden has a deep bench of aides to consult. One of his closest advisers, Ron Klain, helped do vice-presidential vetting for Al Gore in 2000.Mitt Romney cut his campaign's list of about 80 potential running mates to 20 in early April 2012. By late July, the list had been narrowed to five men, after the one woman under serious consideration, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, declined the campaign's invitation to be vetted. (Mr. Romney eventually chose Representative Paul Ryan.)Donald Trump's 2016 vetting process was less streamlined, but among those he interviewed during his search was Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa.Mrs. Clinton started with a list of 40 possible candidates, which was narrowed to nine who underwent a process of serious vetting, an interview and a campaign appearance with the candidate. While she considered a number of women to be vice president, only Ms. Warren advanced to the final stages of the process.For Mr. Biden, 77, a much younger woman could assuage concerns about his age and critiques about a primary process that started with the most diverse field in history and ended with two white men.Mr. Biden's campaign hopes the early announcement that he would select a woman will give his operation a shot of enthusiasm from voters, even as the presidential election heads into a deep freeze because of the coronavirus. On Thursday, his campaign sent a fund-raising appeal asking supporters to ""commit to standing with"" Mr. Biden and his future female running mate.By announcing he will pick a woman, Mr. Biden is aiming to give his ticket a modern-day balance in a party focused on issues of racial and gender representation. Past nominees have chosen running mates who provided geographic diversity (Lloyd Bentsen in 1988) or offered the promise of winning a key state (Mr. Ryan, from Wisconsin, in 2012). Mr. Obama, just four years into his Senate term, chose Mr. Biden in 2008 to ease concerns about his own relative lack of experience and help appeal to white working-class voters.Choosing Ms. Harris, 55, would not only provide not a gender balance but also would add a black woman to the ticket after black voters helped revive Mr. Biden's campaign in February. But as Jill Biden's recent criticism indicated, the memory of Ms. Harris's debate stage attack may hinder her chances.""I have to tell you that I'm a little torn in terms of my choices,"" said Alma Gonzalez, a D.N.C. member from Florida. ""If it were me and if I was Joe Biden, I would say to Senator Harris, 'Do you want to be on the Supreme Court or be my vice president?""'Presidential candidates rarely place public restrictions on their pick, preferring to keep options open so they can pivot their selection to suit the shifting dynamics of the campaign. Veterans of past vice-presidential searches said the most important elements have been how comfortable the nominees are with their would-be partners.And while past campaigns spent months vetting candidates and agonizing over running-mate strategy, there's very little academic research suggesting that the vice-presidential pick has a huge impact on winning the general election.""The first and most important criteria is, can this person help you win in November and will they at least not hurt you in November,"" said Mr. Podesta.For Mrs. Clinton, that meant ruling out candidates from states with Republican governors, like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio. If she won, her team feared that Mr. Brown could be replaced in the Senate by a Republican and shift the balance of the chamber away from her future administration.Unlike any nominee since Mr. Gore, Mr. Biden has a unique view into the selection process, having gone through it himself. While Mr. Obama started with a list of 20 candidates, he faced pressure to select Mrs. Clinton as his running mate and create a ""unity ticket."" After Mr. Obama rejected that idea, the choice came down to a ""coin toss"" between Mr. Biden and Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana. Mr. Biden was more energetic and enthusiastic in his interview, according to aides.In an interview earlier this month, Mr. Biden cited his close relationship with Mr. Obama as a model for his selection process, saying the president was able to trust him with key pieces of his agenda.""For me, the most important thing in choosing a vice president is whether or not the person is simpatico with me in terms of where I want to take the country,"" he said. ""It's really important that the next president is able to do what Barack was able to do with me.""PhotographSome of Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s former Democratic rivals are now among those in the mix to be his running mate, including Senator Kamala Harris of California, top, and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.

| Jump to first hitIn a stark moment of political de-escalation, Mr. Sanders signaled that he wants to press Joe Biden on issues but may not want to fight to the bitter end like he did against Hillary Clinton in 2016.
It was a concession speech, of a kind: Addressing reporters on Wednesday, Senator Bernie Sanders bowed not to Joseph R. Biden Jr., who trounced him in a second consecutive week of primary elections, but to the reality of his political predicament. Stripped of his briefly held status as the Democratic front-runner, Mr. Sanders acknowledged that he was “losing” to Mr. Biden but stopped short of accepting defeat.
That careful distinction — between accepting Mr. Biden’s dominance in the race, and yielding to him altogether — now defines Mr. Sanders’s candidacy, and perhaps the Democratic presidential race as a whole.
For in Burlington, Vt., Mr. Sanders was more visibly humbled than at nearly any other point since he emerged as a national figure five years ago, during his insurgent challenge to Hillary Clinton. There was no defiant battle cry on Wednesday, no vow to fight Mr. Biden all the way to the Milwaukee convention in July, no allegation of election-rigging or insinuation of an establishment conspiracy like he memorably made in 2016.
There was, instead, a matter-of-fact assessment of his own diminished position in the race, followed by an equally unsparing recitation of the policy challenges Mr. Sanders intended to put to Mr. Biden in the coming days.
Reaching for a kind of moral victory, Mr. Sanders insisted that his campaign had “won the ideological debate,” but allowed that he had not persuaded most voters that he was the likeliest candidate to defeat President Trump.
Taken together, it was a stark moment of political de-escalation. Some Democratic officials interpreted it as a signal that Mr. Sanders may not be thirsting for a fight to the bitter end, of the kind he waged against Mrs. Clinton in 2016. Even his criticism of Mr. Biden was largely implicit, framed in terms of questions — about health care, climate change, immigration and more — that seemed intended to push Mr. Biden to address the concerns of Mr. Sanders’s political base.
The great question of the Democratic race may now be whether there is anything Mr. Biden can do to assuage those concerns, and how Mr. Sanders might respond if he does.
Representative Peter Welch of Vermont, who is supporting Mr. Sanders, said that the senator sent a clear sign about his political priorities by emphasizing that defeating Mr. Trump was a goal of overriding importance. While Mr. Welch said it was up to Mr. Sanders to decide when his campaign was over, he was already suggesting on Wednesday that Mr. Sanders consider going on a “unity tour” to bring the Democratic Party together.
“At some point, we’re going to have to unify to achieve the overarching goal of defeating Donald Trump,” Mr. Welch said, calling Mr. Sanders a figure with unique potential to achieve that goal: “Bernie, more than any other person in this country, can help Biden be the person who defeats Donald Trump.”
But Mr. Welch and other Democrats cautioned that Mr. Biden should not expect a quick end to Mr. Sanders’s candidacy, or apply too much pressure on Mr. Sanders in the hope of bringing about that outcome. So far, Mr. Biden has shown no inclination to attempt any coercive measures: In his victory speech on Tuesday evening, the former vice president hailed the energy and commitment of Mr. Sanders’s supporters and offered himself to them as an ally, but made no suggestion that Mr. Sanders should stand aside.
By no means is Mr. Sanders giving Mr. Biden a free pass, however. If his tone was more subdued and the content more clinical — like a policy questionnaire distributed to officeseekers — his remarks on Wednesday cataloged considerable skepticism of Mr. Biden and his competing political vision.
“Joe,” he asked, “how are you going to respond to the scientists who tell us we have seven or eight years remaining to transform our energy system?”
“What are you going to do to make sure that all of our people can go to college or trade school regardless of their income?”
“What are you going to do about the millions of people who are struggling with outrageous levels of student debt?”
Still, after Mr. Biden’s string of wins on Tuesday night, both camps seem to recognize that the two men will most likely need to find ways to bring Democrats together behind Mr. Biden this fall. It is a dual challenge that does not play to either man’s strengths: convincing a zealous collection of young and progressive voters that Mr. Biden — an institutionalist moderate who speaks of record players and long-dead Senate colleagues — is the man to meet the moment.
For Mr. Sanders, who has spent the past year suggesting that any candidate besides himself would be insufficiently bold for the times, an eventual endorsement for Mr. Biden would not necessarily persuade admirers that an establishment Democrat should be trusted. It might take a more robust show of support from Mr. Sanders, and even then there is no guarantee that the affections of Mr. Sanders’s base can be transferred.
For Mr. Biden, who has antagonized Mr. Sanders as a non-Democrat out to diminish the presidency of Barack Obama, even a firm insistence that he understands what is driving Sanders voters will be viewed skeptically.
But despite Mr. Biden’s success during the last two weeks of primaries, he will need to make gains with some key Sanders constituencies — not only younger liberals but also Latinos across several age brackets — to build the most formidable coalition possible in the fall. And he will almost certainly need Mr. Sanders’s help to get there.
Some veterans of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign would advise Mr. Biden not to expect much. Though Mr. Sanders officially endorsed Mrs. Clinton in 2016 and rallied for her, her aides generally viewed the endorsement as somewhere between dutiful and inadequate — especially when weighed against the months of negative attacks from Mr. Sanders and his supporters depicting her as a corporate tool well after she appeared to have the nomination in hand.
There is some reason to believe that this election might be different. Mr. Sanders appears to harbor much less visceral disdain for his opponent than he did in 2016, when he and his aides seethed constantly at the perceived coronation of Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Sanders has never attacked Mr. Biden’s character or his personal ethics, even as a good number of his political allies have done so repeatedly.
“It needs to be a two-way dance,” said Brian Fallon, Mrs. Clinton’s national press secretary four years ago, noting that even a progressive like Senator Elizabeth Warren had been found wanting by Sanders fans. “What the courting looks like, what will actually satisfy large chunks of his movement, is a mystery. So much of that movement could not even find Warren as an acceptable alternative. So, what the heck can Joe Biden do?”
Mr. Fallon did have a few ideas: namely, some policy drift toward Mr. Sanders’s platform on climate or health care issues from the Biden camp if Mr. Sanders leaves the race.
At the moment, the Sanders base appears in no mood to settle. Some of his top surrogates continue to tweet eagerly amid his defeats on Tuesday night about Mr. Biden’s weaknesses and elevate any scrap of good news about Mr. Sanders, from his strength with young voters to his projected victory in North Dakota.
“Nah, it’s not over,” wrote Shaun King, a civil rights activist and Sanders surrogate with over a million followers on Twitter.
“Not over indeed,” said Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator and national campaign co-chair for Mr. Sanders.
“We are just getting started,” tweeted Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, one of the senator’s highest-profile endorsers.
But there was also an awareness among Sanders allies that he has more at stake in this campaign than in 2016, and that the way his candidacy ends — if indeed it ends in defeat — could have far-reaching implications for the fate of the agenda he has championed and the movement he has built.
“Whatever he does, he’s going to go forward with a base of support that’s going to continue to fight for issues,” said James J. Zogby, a longtime Sanders ally who is the president of the Arab American Institute, in an interview on Tuesday night.
Mr. Sanders, he said, had a longer legacy than a presidential campaign: “He is a transformative figure in our political life.”
It falls now to Mr. Sanders to square his grand stature, as an individual leader, with the perilous state of his presidential campaign. Mr. Welch, who has risen in Vermont politics alongside Mr. Sanders for more than three decades, urged his colleague not to bank on an astounding turn of fortune of the kind Mr. Biden enjoyed after the South Carolina primary.
“We basically had a miracle in this election a couple weeks ago,” Mr. Welch said. “And Joe Biden was the beneficiary of that miracle.”
For Mr. Sanders to expect another, he added, would be “asking a lot of the higher powers.”

| Jump to first hitDemocrats are avoiding using ads to attack each other, as they target voters intent on defeating President Trump.
Four years ago in Iowa and New Hampshire, a political circular firing squad erupted during nearly every prime-time commercial break. Republican presidential candidates and their allied super PACs unleashed a cacophony of personal, caustic attack ads as they sought to break through in a historically large field.
This year, with an even larger field on the Democratic side, the tone on televisions in Iowa and New Hampshire is decidedly different. Almost universally, the Democratic ads seek to address and quell a source of national anxiety — be it about President Trump, prescription drug costs, corruption, foreign policy or a changing economy.
And they’re doing it politely.
“Give people a fair deal and real economic power,” Tom Steyer, the biggest advertiser in Iowa, says in his most recent ad.
“Put humanity first,” intones Andrew Yang in his newest ad.
In total, Democrats spent nearly $30 million on the airwaves in Iowa and New Hampshire in 2019, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm.
Not a single candidate has run a negative ad on television targeting other Democrats.
The relatively placid ads of the 2020 Democratic campaign reflect the risk-averse primary contest, in which candidates have been loath to unleash any negativity on an opponent. Instead, they are channeling voters still unnerved by the 2016 election and so wholly concerned with defeating Donald Trump that any potential damage done during the Democratic primary could be viewed as unforgivable.
While Democratic voters in Iowa find negative advertising particularly off-putting, it appears that they want to both get rid of Mr. Trump and eradicate his confrontational approach to politics.
“In Iowa, those voters, they don’t like negative ads in general, and they don’t like them right now because Trump is so negative,” said Kelly Gibson, a Democratic media strategist who has advised both the Andrew Yang and Julián Castro campaigns. She added that the obsession with beating Mr. Trump had made Democrats overly anxious about the primary process, as well.
“The idea of cutting each other down somehow hurting us in the general election, whichever campaign did that would get a lot of pushback, pitchforks and torches from the voters,” Ms. Gibson said. “There’s just seemingly no tolerance for it.”
Also in play are memories of 2016, when the bitter campaign between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders left many supporters of Mr. Sanders alienated enough to stay home or vote for a third-party candidate.
In place of any negativity has been a focus on generally positive, biographical messaging. More than 25 percent of all ads in both Iowa and New Hampshire were either a general positive message or one about a candidate’s character, according to Advertising Analytics. In Iowa, the top issue was health care, addressed in about 9 percent of ads. In New Hampshire, it was the economy, also addressed in about 9 percent of ads.
There is also the tsunami of ads from Michael R. Bloomberg, who isn’t spending on ads in the first four early states but has dropped more than $165 million on television and digital ads in Super Tuesday states and beyond, according to Advertising Analytics. But Mr. Bloomberg has also not gone on the attack against other Democrats.
The apprehension toward negativity among the Democratic candidates has largely been evident in real time as well; when the debates have been marked by hostile attacks — Representative Tulsi Gabbard attacked Senator Kamala Harris’s record as prosecutor, Ms. Harris went after Joe Biden’s record on busing, to name a couple — other candidates are often quick to try to tamp down any bubbling anger.
“I did not come here to listen to this argument,” interjected Senator Amy Klobuchar at the sixth debate as a heated discussion over a fund-raiser at a wine cave boiled over. She added that the only way Democrats would win was “not by arguing with each other, but by finding what unites us in getting this done.”
The relative comity among the candidates on the airwaves comes after Republican presidential primaries in 2012 and 2016 that were overwhelmingly negative and seemed to signal a new era for presidential campaigns. With the injection of billions of dollars into such races after the Citizens United decision, leading to the proliferation of deep-pocketed super PACs, an explosion of negative advertising was becoming the norm. The so-called Eleventh Commandment popularized by President Ronald Reagan, which declared that “thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican,” seemed destined for history.
Indeed, at this point in the 2016 presidential primary, Republican candidates and outside groups had spent $55 million on ads, according to Advertising Analytics. But $22 million of that alone came from Right to Rise, the super PAC supporting Jeb Bush, which ran a torrent of negative ads about other candidates.
Larry McCarthy, the chief media strategist for Right to Rise in the 2016 campaign, said the nature of those races was what led to the early onslaught of negative advertising.
In the 2012 and 2016 Republican primaries, he said, “negative ads appeared earlier because the common wisdom was that if poll leaders Gingrich or Trump scored an early victory, they could use that momentum to get on a roll that couldn’t be stopped.” He added, “The ’20 Democratic race looks different, with Biden, Sanders, Buttigieg and Warren closely bunched, all thinking they have a chance to win or place in one of the first four states.”
The closest any ad came to a negative attack in the 2020 race was aired by a super PAC backing Cory Booker, the candidate whose defining message is one of harmony and unity.
“He’s a Rhodes Scholar, a uniter, a successful mayor,” a narrator says with a hint of sarcasm, as “Hail to the Chief” plays while a Pete Buttigieg photo montage appears onscreen. The images and soundtrack suddenly fizzle. “No, not that guy,” the narrator says, with a big “Not that guy” splashed across Mr. Buttigieg’s face. “It’s Cory Booker.”
The ad, backed by roughly $300,000 from the super PAC, “United We Win,” ran exclusively in Iowa. When he was shown the ad during an interview with CNN, Mr. Booker said he had not seen it, and was caught “off guard” by its existence.
“I celebrate the people who are in the race, and my campaign is not about tearing anybody down,” he said.
Another contributing factor to the lack of hostility on the airwaves can be attributed to the absence of major super PACs in the Democratic primary, as most of the leading candidates have sworn off any support from a super PAC.
“If you look in any advertising campaign, outside groups are the ones who are much more likely to go negative,” said Ken Goldstein, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco. “So if you remove them from the playing field, you remove a big well of money for negative ads.”
History, Dr. Goldstein noted, could also be guiding the campaigns in 2020. Though the 2008 and 2016 Democratic presidential primaries were contentious, neither featured a particularly negative attack ad. While Mr. Sanders released an ad in 2016 criticizing banks that corrupt politics with “speaking fees,” he made no mention of Hillary Clinton. In 2008, Ms. Clinton’s famous “3 a.m.” ad implied that Barack Obama wasn’t prepared for sudden foreign crises, but it made no mention of Mr. Obama.
In the 2004 campaign, however, Howard Dean and Richard A. Gephardt began trading attacks on the air in the months leading up to the Iowa caucuses. While the negative advertising was effective in bringing down both Mr. Dean and Mr. Gephardt’s poll numbers, neither candidate actually benefited. Instead, John Kerry, the eventual nominee, did.
“In any multicandidate race, there’s a danger in going negative in that your negative ad works in knocking down one of your opponents, but benefits a third opponent,” Dr. Goldstein said. “That’s even more the case now when you have five or six top candidates.”
But, he said, the cease-fire may not hold for long after a vast field begins to winnow.
“This is the case when it’s multicandidate,” Dr. Goldstein noted, “But if it’s Biden vs. Sanders or Buttigieg vs. Warren — if this is a two-person race — forget all that.”

| Jump to first hitThe senator's sweeping critique of coverage has more merit than we in the media like to admit.When a BuzzFeed News colleague and I sat down with Bernie Sanders in his Capitol Hill office in 2015, he started with a thank you -- for doing what you do to provide an alternative to the corporate media.We stammered a bit, and half apologized. We weren't really doing that, sir; our backers were venture capitalists. He'd have to find an alternative elsewhere.Bernie Sanders has been searching for that alternative to for-profit media for a long time. Back in 1981, when he became mayor of Burlington, Vt., he turned to his staff and said: ""We can't survive. We have to develop our own media.""And while some left-wing media outlets are now emerging, they're not going to flower in time to save his campaign.That became painfully clear last Wednesday when, after his stunning setback on Super Tuesday, Mr. Sanders bent the knee and submitted to a barrage of not particularly friendly questions from the most powerful progressive on TV, the MSNBC host Rachel Maddow.He had been avoiding the network, suspicious of its wealthy hosts and corporate owners. He told Ms. Maddow in mild exasperation that one of his challenges was ""taking on the corporate media, if I might say so.""It was clear the primary voting had shaken the Vermont senator's whole theory of the election -- that he could mobilize a huge new cohort of young people.At the same time, the events of the past week have validated much of his criticism of the media, the subject of a 1988 town hall with Mr. Sanders and the radical provocateur Abbie Hoffman. Mr. Sanders complained that Vermont's television stations had been ""prostituted by commercials."" (The video is a trip, and worth the click.)His main point: ""The media itself is as important a political issue as exists.""Mr. Sanders is right about that, and about two other big things: that much of the U.S. media still covers elections as if they're sporting events and that the affluent New Yorkers who run and appear on television networks are not inclined to like him. The narrative of Joe Biden's comeback was an irresistible story to the media -- one that often eclipsed the coronavirus, never mind discussion of health care or poverty -- on cable news in recent days.The distance between Mr. Sanders's supporters and media executives could be felt with particular intensity in the halls of MSNBC last week. After Chris Matthews, the beloved embodiment of MSNBC's establishmentarian centrism, compared Mr. Sanders's campaign to the Nazi invasion of France, Mr. Sanders's supporters began a drumbeat of criticism that helped lead to Mr. Matthews' ouster. When Joe Biden -- the Chris Matthews of politics -- emerged as the Democratic front-runner on Super Tuesday, the on-air relief at MSNBC was palpable.""What a whole lot of people here see,"" said one senior producer, ""is the same thing as Trump.""That perspective is widely shared in the news business: That Mr. Sanders -- and really any politician who is hostile, or even cranky, to the media -- is following in President Trump's footsteps.It's a canard. Mr. Trump is a star of the corporate media who hacked its commercial incentives to his advantage, delivering free lively entertainment to cable networks desperate for programming. Mr. Trump wants to control that media, and to discredit competing voices. Mr. Sanders wants to remake the media in a new model.""Trump knew how to weaponize that capitalistic greed against them, whereas Bernie's approach has been just to build those other channels,"" said Krystal Ball, a former MSNBC host who has emerged as a leading voice of the pro-Sanders left.Ms. Ball's morning show for The Hill website is one of a handful of signs that the media landscape is beginning to shift in Mr. Sanders's direction. The show, which she co-hosts with a young Trump-backing conservative named Saagar Enjeti, posted impressive numbers on YouTube, with more than 3.4 million hours watched over the last month.The show's fans span left- and right-wing populism. They include leftist insurgents at The Intercept like Glenn Greenwald, who on Twitter called the show a ""super-perky radical trans-ideological 21st Century subversive sequel to the Katie Couric/Matt Lauer morning Today Show in its heyday (minus all that unpleasantness)."" Among its right-wing admirers are Steve Bannon, Mr. Trump's former campaign adviser, who in an interview described Ms. Ball as ""hard core,"" along with the Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who texted that the two ""seem to understand, better than almost anyone else talking about it, what's really happening in American politics.""On Friday morning in their chilly Washington studio, over a standard-issue cable news glass table, hosts and guests denounced blind support for female candidates as ""lady boss yass queen feminism"" and sneered at ""woke tokenism.""It's a kind of anti-establishment ""Crossfire"" aimed at ""hating each other as American people less -- and hating the elites more,"" as Ms. Ball put it.The other outlet seeking to fill the space where ""the Trump and Bernie person meet"" is Vice, the new television chief, Morgan Hertzan, told me. He says he's remaking the company's channel (formerly known as Viceland) based on research that shows there's a news audience alienated from ""corporate media.""The goal is to create an outsider's network in stark contrast to MSNBC's inside conversation. Mr. Hertzan said the network was recruiting top progressives to host a new wave of shows and developing a weekly program with Anand Giridharadas, an MSNBC enfant terrible whose book, ""Winners Take All,"" denounces self-serving billionaire philanthropists.Mr. Giridharadas said he wanted to make TV that is a rebuke to cable news as it now exists. ""When you get to that level of television, everyone is prosperous at the table,"" he said in an interview. ""I'm not sure I've ever sat next to an uninsured person on television. I sit next to uninsured people on the subway all the time.""Vice and The Hill are not, in fact, socialist institutions. They are companies on the shaky edge of big American media. Their programming choices, echoing the YouTube success of companies like the The Young Turks and a handful of independent outlets, more likely mark the beginning of a new generation's dissent getting slickly packaged and sold to the mainstream.Vice will struggle with the decidedly old media problem of how to get cord-cutters to watch a cable channel. But Vice's research, from the expensive strategy firm Magid, found what populists everywhere are discovering: Angry outsiderism is a growth industry. The new Vice mantra, Mr. Hertzan said, is, ""The everything system is broken -- let's fix it together.""Mr. Sanders has his own plan for the media revolution. He wants to break up big media and tech conglomerates, increase funding for public media and empower journalist unions. An adviser, Robert McChesney, said in an interview that Mr. Sanders is ""open to"" the more radical idea of having the federal government provide a $200 ""citizenship news voucher"" to all Americans, who would then use the voucher to support public media outlets of their choosing.While Mr. Sanders's criticism of the media has more merit than most reporters like to acknowledge, the media has often gotten Mr. Sanders right, too. His weaknesses, from a rigid attachment to the battles of an earlier generation to his struggle to persuade older black Democrats to join his revolution, aren't media inventions. They're good, fair stories.And in 2020, far more than in 2016, the media has also captured his strengths: his consistency, his commitment to the poor, his deep popularity with young people. A top supporter of Mr. Sanders, New York's mayor, Bill de Blasio, offered an explanation for that in an interview.Capitalist ownership or not, the mayor said, ""There are plenty of journalists who are class traitors.""PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders has long been searching for an alternative to for-profit media.

| Jump to first hitJoe Biden's first two finishes sent his national poll numbers plummeting and put his donors on edge. He wants Nevada to begin his comeback, not accelerate his plunge.LAS VEGAS -- On Friday afternoon, Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s campaign manager, Greg Schultz, convened a conference call with supporters to outline a path forward following two bruising losses in Iowa and New Hampshire.The campaign, Mr. Schultz made clear on the call, was banking on finishing in at least second place in the upcoming Nevada caucuses, a contest that will offer the first major test of Mr. Biden's assertion that he can uniquely assemble a diverse coalition.Left unsaid: Nevada will also show whether Mr. Biden, the former vice president, can revive his campaign after his first two finishes sent his national poll numbers plummeting, put his donors on edge and jeopardized his standing even in his perceived firewall state, South Carolina.""First would be wonderful, but us getting a second place I think does the work that we need to do to win South Carolina,"" Mr. Schultz said. ""We win South Carolina, we're going to have ended the first four contests likely with a delegate advantage.""He added, ""I think the Democratic Party will sigh a collective sigh of relief when we finish second or better in Nevada.""With only days until Saturday's caucuses, Mr. Biden's campaign is racing to make Nevada the state that begins his comeback -- not the one that accelerates a plunge from which he never recovers.Yet such an outcome is hardly assured.Mr. Biden struggled to excite Democrats in Iowa and New Hampshire, a crucial factor in his early losses. But in Iowa especially, poor organizing played a significant role, raising questions about how he will fare in Nevada, which, like Iowa, also holds caucuses instead of a traditional primary election.""His ground game has been here a while and had staff here for a long time, but similar to Iowa, they took things a little for granted that he was the front-runner, that he had 99 percent name ID,"" said Megan Jones, a political strategist in the state who worked for Harry Reid, the former Nevada senator and Democratic majority leader. ""They have been quickly making up for lost time because they know it's a make-or-break situation.""Mr. Biden's campaign has redeployed staff from later-voting Super Tuesday states to lend extra manpower in Nevada and now says it has more than 130 staff members on the ground. He is leaning on a roster of high-profile endorsers in the state, and he is campaigning here day after day, putting a particular focus on outreach to voters of color.""He knows that he cannot take the minority vote, the African-American, Latino and Asian-American vote, for granted,"" said Representative Steven Horsford, Democrat of Nevada, who endorsed Mr. Biden last week. ""He will do something, once he's the president, to actually deliver for the American people and for voters of color who sometimes feel taken for granted and only get appealed to during an election. There are some candidates who literally right now are just now engaging in Nevada.""Mr. Biden has been airing television ads in Nevada focused on gun violence as well as on health care, but he has been significantly outspent by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, whose fund-raising has far outpaced Mr. Biden's. Mr. Biden also faces competition from the billionaire Tom Steyer, whose ad spending in the state dwarfs that of any other candidate.Mr. Biden is expressing a much sunnier outlook about how he will fare in Nevada compared with New Hampshire, where he predicted four days before the primary that he would ""probably take a hit."" At a fund-raiser in New York City last week, he said he expected to finish first or second in Nevada.At campaign stops over the past few days, Mr. Biden has not overhauled his message or unleashed sharpened attacks on his rivals, though he has put a fresh emphasis on certain key issues. He has highlighted his record on gun control, an important issue to many Democrats in a state where the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history took place. He has also assailed a 2005 law that shields gun manufacturers from liability lawsuits -- an implicit shot at Mr. Sanders, who voted in favor of it as a House member.In addition, Mr. Biden has stressed that his health care plan would allow union members to keep their current insurance -- a major contrast with Mr. Sanders, who advocates ""Medicare for all."" But he suffered a setback last week when the powerful Culinary Workers Union Local 226 announced it would not make an endorsement in the race, though the union's secretary-treasurer cited him by name at a news conference and said, ""We know he's been our friend.""At a campaign event over the weekend, Mr. Biden, apparently undeterred by the union's decision, cited his support from labor unions and then added, ""I know in their hearts the Culinary Workers are there -- in their hearts.""Mr. Biden can still be unfocused at times, a problem that has hindered him throughout the race. During a rally in the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson on Friday evening, he declared that he did not want to use the teleprompters that had been set up for him, and later wound up talking to the crowd about Chinese land that is polluted with the metal cadmium. A minute later, he brought up an obscure government agency, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA. And a minute after that, his speech was over.In those closing moments, he never mentioned the caucuses or explicitly asked attendees to support him.But his time on the campaign trail in Nevada has also shown the promise of more diverse states. During a visit to a Black History Month festival on Saturday, he was greeted with enthusiasm by attendees as he made his way through the crowd. Before he spoke onstage, the M.C. referred to him as President Biden and offered to serve as the host at his victory party.Mr. Biden was introduced by one of his newest endorsers, Mr. Horsford, who told the crowd that Mr. Biden ""has our back"" and added, ""I know it because he had Barack Obama's back as vice president for eight years.""And so far, there is simply not the same kind of widespread criticism of his Nevada caucus organization that dogged him in Iowa. He has been aided by Yvanna Cancela, a state senator who is working as a senior adviser to the campaign, and Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, a former Obama campaign official who ran former Representative Beto O'Rourke's presidential campaign and is assisting in a volunteer capacity.But the cloud of doubt resulting from his poor showing in the first two contests still lingers. Billy Vassiliadis, the chief executive of the marketing and advocacy firm R&R Partners, described a highly fluid race, with many voters still assessing which candidate stands the best chance of defeating President Trump. Mr. Biden's fourth-place finish in Iowa and fifth-place result in New Hampshire was jarring even to some independent-minded Nevadans, he said.""For the great majority of the voters, they don't dig deep and really consider the fact that Iowa and New Hampshire probably weren't the vice president's best playing field, and that the vice president needs a more sort of diverse voter base,"" he said. ""There was an expectation that the vice president was going to finish higher. When they saw that finish, it kind of shook what they were confident in.""Mr. Biden's allies have played down the significance of Iowa and New Hampshire, and insist that Mr. Biden remains poised to perform strongly in more diverse states like Nevada.""I love repositioning Joe Biden as the underdog,"" said Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, a national co-chair of Mr. Biden's campaign, offering a glass-half-full assessment of Mr. Biden's place in the race. ""Democrats love underdogs. Americans love underdogs.""And on the Friday call with supporters, Mr. Schultz pointed to changes the campaign was making, including engaging in more national news media interviews -- something a number of top supporters had encouraged post-Iowa -- and redirecting resources to Nevada and South Carolina.""I think we did not adequately prepare for the chaos that was going to be at the various caucus locations, and, you know, there's one candidate, in particular, whose supporters do not make things easy because of the antics they pull,"" he said, a reference to the supporters of Mr. Sanders. ""So we have intensified our precinct captain training for the Nevada caucus. We also have increased our legal presence.""Still, the poor early showings have created skepticism among some voters here. When Mr. Biden took questions from the audience at a campaign event in Reno on Monday, a supporter lavished praise on him, but then asked, pointedly: ""What the heck is going on with your campaign?"" Mr. Biden responded that it was ""a good question"" and ""a legitimate question,"" before noting Iowa's lack of racial diversity.Barbara Bell, 64, a retired county employee who came to the rally Mr. Biden held in Henderson, said the contests in Iowa and New Hampshire had left her concerned about his chances -- even as she struggled to discern what went wrong for him.""To me, they're little white states,"" she said. ""I don't know what gets to them or what turned them on. I can't figure it out.""Ms. Bell worried aloud about moderate Democrats splitting their votes among multiple candidates while Mr. Sanders thrives. She and her husband were a perfect example: She planned to support Mr. Biden, with Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota as her second choice, while he preferred Ms. Klobuchar over Mr. Biden.Asked her level of confidence that Mr. Biden would win the nomination, she responded, ""Well, it was a lot higher a month ago.""Thomas Kaplan reported from Las Vegas, and Katie Glueck from New York.PhotographVice President Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitSouth Dakota has four dead presidents carved in stone on Mount Rushmore. But good luck getting real, live presidential hopefuls to come visit.LE MARS, Iowa -- As the longtime owner of Archie's Waeside steakhouse, Bob Rand has a story about almost everybody who wanted to be, or was, president in the past few election cycles.Once, during the 2016 presidential race, Ben Carson and his campaign team showed up unannounced, and hungry. President George W. Bush's security detail shut down the highway so he could arrive safely in town. Bob Dole came to the restaurant during his bid for the presidency, walked into the cooler and cut his own steak from a side of beef.""It was the damnedest thing I ever saw in my whole life,"" said Mr. Rand, reminiscing in the wood-paneled dining room, as waitresses pushed metal carts loaded with plates of New York strip and homemade hash browns to diners in booths.Forty miles away, across the snowy terrain of bent cornstalks and grain silos, steak was also on the menu. Members of the local V.F.W. club were shooting pool at Whimp's Place, as diners sat before plates of tenderloin. The owner, Dan Radigan, could remember just one politician who pushed through the restaurant's door. ""I think Senator Thune was here once,"" he said.The key difference between the two steakhouses: geography.Whimp's is in South Dakota, where the Republican senator John Thune is from, and Mr. Rand's steakhouse is in Iowa, the center of the political universe during this time of the presidential election cycle with its caucuses set to take place Feb. 3. A robust lineup of presidential wannabes has swung by practically every steakhouse, cafe, bowling alley, brew pub and American Legion post in Iowa, from Wapello to Webster City, in past months.Across the state line, and across the nation, the question rings out each election cycle: Why does Iowa, a state of barely more than three million people, get all the attention? Since 1972, Iowa has held its nominating contests first, a result of a national Democratic Party decision to spread out the schedule among states. Because Iowa's process is so complicated, it had to start early.Candidates dutifully show up. But that doesn't mean they like it. Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren recently complained about Iowa's prominence in picking a candidate, and Julián Castro, before he dropped out of the race, said Iowa was ""not reflective of the United States"" and ""not reflective of the Democratic Party.""Elections, by their nature, highlight how much a person's ZIP code can determine how decisive his or her vote will be. The early states and the swing states are lavished with attention. Others states are largely ignored.That is particularly poignant in South Dakota, where the primary takes place in June. Far from the Iowa border in South Dakota communities like Rapid City, brushes with the presidency generally are limited to the bronze sculptures of 43 presidents scattered about town or the carvings of former presidents on the side of nearby Mount Rushmore.But on the state line, politically active citizens blanch when caucuses are days away and attention, for once, is focused on the middle of the country -- but not their slice of the middle of the country.""There's this flyover mentality that we're not important. We're ignored as a people and a voice, and Iowa's got this outsized attention,"" said Susan Almjeld, a music teacher who was sipping Old-Fashioneds with her husband, Paul, on a recent evening at Whimp's.Burbank, where the Almjelds live, is close enough to the Iowa border to be part of its media market. Residents are inundated with ads for candidates on their televisions and radios.Ms. Almjeld works at a school in Iowa, and, from time to time, has considered driving to see candidates in person. But a touch of bitterness sets in.""Sometimes I think, oh my God, they're only a half-mile away,"" she said, ""but then again I'm comfortable on my couch, and I'm not part of the caucuses anyway.""Other South Dakotans make the trek.Michelle Randall of Sioux Falls, S.D., has traveled to Iowa to snap a photo with almost every major presidential candidate this election cycle, in case they never make it to her home state.""By the time the primary comes to us the race is practically decided,"" she said. ""They say we're the forgotten ones, and we kind of are.""Ms. Randall has been in Elizabeth Warren's selfie line and saw John Delaney in a crowd of 22 people at Old 60 Steaks & Chops in Sheldon, Iowa. She was determined enough that she managed to snap a photo with Bill de Blasio during the New York mayor's long-shot campaign.""I drove in a snowstorm to see him in Sioux City,"" she said. ""It was right after he declared. That was in a bar. I was literally standing there having a beer with Bill de Blasio. He was very politician-y, all Mr. Common Man and everything. Didn't have a whole lot to say, just a little small talk. It was almost a little uncomfortable.""Ms. Randall has set rules for her quest: She won't drive more than two hours, except to see her favorite candidate, Pete Buttigieg, whom she has traveled to see several times and even knocked on doors in Iowa to rally support for him.At a recent town hall event in Orange City, Iowa, Ms. Randall heard Mr. Buttigieg tell the crowd of about 150, ""You will be deciding where our country heads next.""She's disappointed that she won't in fact be among those deciding when the state caucuses next month.""I wish I could be a part of it,"" said Ms. Randall, an insurance lawyer. ""But I have come to gain a respect for the people of Iowa who take the time to go out and see candidates.""Nebraskans, residents of another Iowa border state, also are stung by neglect this time of year. The feeling is acute in Omaha, a major city of half a million people with Fortune 500 companies, a minor league ballpark and a world-class zoo. It's just across the Missouri River from Council Bluffs, Iowa, population 62,000, where at least 11 Democratic candidates have visited in past months, some of them twice.Amy Klobuchar visited Omaha, and so did Mr. Castro, when he was in the race. A few candidates have sent surrogates to the city for events. But on a recent evening, the television screen was the place to see presidential candidates as Democrats gathered in a downtown Omaha bar to watch a debate taking place just 130 miles away in Des Moines.Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party, cautioned that Democratic candidates shouldn't write off her state, which holds its primary in May and which splits its Electoral College votes in the general election. Democrats are making inroads in Omaha, she said. Barack Obama won one electoral vote in 2008, a first for Democrats since the 1960s.""The field is so crowded and voters have been so fluid that we could be that magic deciding factor,"" said Ms. Kleeb, who just published a book called ""Harvest the Vote: How Democrats Can Win Again in Rural America.""Gladys Harrison is among Nebraska's Democrats eager for attention not only for her own congressional campaign, which she thinks would benefit from a presidential candidate's visit, but also for her community.Her Big Mama's restaurant sits inside a high-ceilinged new cornerstone of a development meant to transform a part of Omaha that residents had long complained was neglected with trendy apartments, a giant green space for outdoor concerts and coding classes for kids. If it were in Iowa, it would be a siren call for any Democratic candidate, she said.The restaurant, started by Ms. Harrison's mother, each month hosts the Hungry Club, which brings in local politicians, candidates and community organizers to speak before a crowd snacking on cold chicken sandwiches, sweet potato pie and other dishes culled from her family's 100-year-old recipes.""The Democratic Party has got to continue to send the message out that we've got the best candidates that can beat Trump,"" Ms. Harrison said. ""And everybody needs to hear that message.""PhotographWhimp's Place, top, in Burbank, S.D. Though in another state, the town is part of Iowa's media mar- ket, and residents are inundated with ads al- though their primary is in June.

| Jump to first hitIt's hard to believe there are still contests to come. When they'll happen is anyone's guess.Hi. Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Lisa Lerer, your host.Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.We now almost certainly know how the Democratic primary is going to end. We just don't know when it will happen.Tuesday night, as San Francisco sheltered in place and the European Union barricaded borders, Joe Biden swept three primary contests. He won nearly every county in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, capturing majorities across virtually all major demographic groups.Now Bernie Sanders finds himself in a particularly difficult position.The spread of the coronavirus means he can't campaign. He can't get news coverage. And he can't seem to narrow the gap in delegates.The large rallies he uses to energize his supporters are suspended over concerns about the virus spreading. Cable news networks didn't air his remarks last night, sticking with coronavirus reports instead. To capture the nomination he would have to win the remaining delegates by around 20 percentage points, requiring a net 40-point improvement over his performance so far, as our colleague Nate Cohn points out.The only state Mr. Sanders has won since Super Tuesday is North Dakota. In a normal election, that would be a cue for Mr. Sanders to find a podium, give a concession speech before teary-eyed supporters and vow to back Mr. Biden.But, as we all know, these are not normal times.Every major state primary election until Wisconsin on April 7 has been postponed. Two states -- Louisiana and Kentucky -- have even pushed their elections past June 9, the deadline set by the Democratic National Committee.Wisconsin's primary, too, could get moved, as the coronavirus spreads. On Wednesday, Democrats sued to extend the state's deadline for online voter registration and vote-by-mail applications.To be honest, we don't know when the next round of voting will be.But what is clear is that the coronavirus crisis flipped a switch among Democratic primary voters.When asked today's most pressing questions -- who can best handle a crisis and who has the best chances to defeat Donald Trump -- Democrats picked Mr. Biden by significant margins in all three states, according to surveys by the National Election Pool.Some Democrats say the concern about Mr. Sanders is obvious: If you can't win primaries in states like Florida, Arizona and Michigan, how do you expect to win a general election? They're urging him -- in ways both quiet and more vocal -- to end his campaign.Mr. Sanders doesn't agree. At least not yet.The liberal champion sees the current crisis as a moment to press the case that he's been making for years about health care and income inequality, issues that are likely to become more immediate as the virus spreads.And with so much uncertainty, the race could shift if there's a gap of weeks -- or months! -- before the next voting.There's certainly one other candidate who sees an advantage if Mr. Sanders remains in the race: President Trump. For months, he has delighted in the prospect of an intraparty fight, which he believes will benefit his re-election bid, and has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that the D.N.C. has ""rigged"" the election against Mr. Sanders.""The DNC will have gotten their fondest wish and defeated Bernie Sanders, far ahead of schedule,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. ""Now they are doing everything possible to be nice to him in order to keep his supporters. Bernie has given up, just like he did last time. He will be dropping out soon!""The Sanders campaign has begun to prepare its supporters for political reality to sink in. ""No sugarcoating it, last night did not go the way we wanted,"" Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, wrote in a note to supporters Wednesday morning.He added, ""We are losing the battle over electability to Joe Biden.""In at least one way, Mr. Sanders has already won. On issues like climate change, taxes and health care, Mr. Biden's platform is further to the left than any Democratic nominee's in recent history.""I've been doing this a long time and it is by far the most progressive agenda we have ever seen on the Democratic side,"" said former Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, who once headed the D.N.C. ""Bernie has made a tremendous impact. My only hope is that Bernie continues his energies against Trump.""As for Mr. Sanders, aides say he plans to vote on the coronavirus relief package in Washington before heading home to Vermont with his wife to assess their path forward.When asked in the Capitol today about his campaign plans, Mr. Sanders lashed out: ""I'm dealing with a fucking global crisis,"" he told reporters.Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We'll try to answer it. Have a comment? We're all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com .When will polls open again?Is anyone holding elections anymore? I wanted to get a better sense of what's left of the primary calendar, so I called up Nick Corasaniti, political reporter, newsletter writer and Jersey rock expert.Here's what he told me about voting in the time of coronavirus:Hi, Nick! Where are you holed up?I am in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, right now. I am at my Ikea desk that I got on Craigslist and put in the corner of my room, and I also went on Craigslist and got an ergonomic chair. I'm actually more comfortable in this chair that I am at my desk chair at the office.My house is so small that I can't even fit a chair along with a desk for my husband and a desk for my kid. So, anyway, are there going to be any more primaries or are we done?There will be more primaries. Nothing is set in stone, but it does look like the next big one, Wisconsin, will probably happen on April 7. They also have some municipal and county elections and a state Supreme Court justice on the ballot. So there are some transfer-of-power issues there that make it a little bit harder to move than a simple presidential primary, as other states have done.Why can't all these states just switch to voting by mail?It's not an easy switch to flip, both practically and legislatively. All of our election systems are on a state-by-state basis, and then in some states decentralized further down to the counties. In Wisconsin, they're decentralized down to municipalities. There are 1,800 municipalities that cover an election. It's a jumble of governments that would need to all act together.You also have to find vendors --What do you need? You need that crayon?-- that can print your ballots. ... Oh, are you talking to your kid?Yeah. Sorry about that. Purple crayon crisis. Anyhow, you were saying?It's not like every state is sitting on enough vote-by-mail ballots for their entire voting population. You have to go print these ballots. You have to have enough envelopes.The bigger thing is that in a lot of states it would require either legislative action or an executive order from the governor. Not all states are on the same page for voting by mail and some would need different laws.Is there any effort to think through how we might need to change the general election voting in November, or are people just not there yet?There are efforts in Congress to mandate the opportunity to vote by mail for everyone. But the thought of this passing before any of the primaries seems unlikely.Any changes made for the primaries would likely also apply to a general election.So, how are you going to spend the rest of the day?I'm going to spend the rest of the day calling secretaries of state and state parties to find out how this vote by mail is progressing. But to be perfectly honest, I made the Alison Roman stew last night so I'll have that for lunch. I'll turn on the new Springsteen ""London Calling"" stream that he released last night and take a quick break.Who doesn't love that stew? Stay healthy!...

| Jump to first hitCONCORD, N.H. -- The other day, Lauren Chooljian received a text from her father, a lifelong New Hampshire resident, that said: ""You're losing friends in nh.""She knows, Dad.Ms. Chooljian, 32, has become a divisive figure in her home state because of her job: co-host of ""Stranglehold,"" a podcast from New Hampshire Public Radio that, as its name suggests, takes a not always flattering look at the Granite State's treasured first-in-the-nation presidential primary.So far, ""Stranglehold"" has had 16 episodes of varying lengths. An 11-minute episode included a discussion of how the botched Iowa caucuses may affect the New Hampshire primary, which takes place Tuesday. A deeply reported 55-minute episode revealed how the election sausage is made in Dixville Notch, the White Mountains community celebrated by national news outlets for its tradition of midnight voting.The primary is ""protected and upheld by powerful people who stand to benefit from its survival,"" Ms. Chooljian said in one episode. ""And so reporting that doesn't interrogate that institution, well, it seems to apply a different standard to the primary than to other important political forces.""Fans of the show appreciate its rigorous examination of the state's role in picking presidents. But the podcast has a prominent detractor in Joseph W. McQuaid, until recently the publisher of the state's biggest newspaper, The New Hampshire Union Leader.In an editorial published in August, Mr. McQuaid wrote that he saw evidence of bias in the podcast's tagline: ""One small state got its hands around our presidential elections. Now it won't let go."" He called the show ""a bit of a head-scratcher, given how much NHPR itself gains from its association with the first-in-the-nation primary.""In a phone interview, Mr. McQuaid, now editor at large at The Union Leader, said he had listened to some ""Stranglehold"" episodes and found them wanting.""It confirmed my suspicion that this was, as we said in the bad old days of newspapering, a hatchet job, with a desire, for some reason, to trash the New Hampshire presidential primary,"" he said.James Pindell, a Boston Globe reporter who is covering his fifth New Hampshire primary, disagreed, describing ""Stranglehold"" as a novel journalistic development.""You would occasionally have long-form pieces that looked at the institution, but never with a critical eye,"" Mr. Pindell said. ""It would be a soft, featurey thing, with a lot of war stories. Never something like this.""Mr. Pindell, who appeared as a guest on the show, has noticed that not everyone is a fan. When he bumped into a New Hampshire political insider in the course of his reporting, he got an earful.""There was no small talk,"" Mr. Pindell said. ""He started right into 'Stranglehold' and how much he hates it.""Ms. Chooljian, the journalist stirring the pot, grew up in Hampstead, a town of about 8,000 in the state's southeastern crook. Her father, Barry Chooljian, is an accomplished high school wrestling coach. Her mother, Carrie, is a social worker.She decided to attend St. Anselm College in Manchester partly out of interest in the primary. She said she attended the 2008 debate where Barack Obama told Hillary Clinton, ""You're likable enough.""""I found my career through the primary,"" Ms. Chooljian said.After St. Anselm, she earned a master's degree at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism and went to work at the Chicago public radio station WBEZ. She covered Mayor Rahm Emanuel and the 2016 Democratic and Republican conventions for the station. In 2017, she returned to New Hampshire -- which, thanks to her years away, came into sharper focus.""I understand the ecosystem of this thing,"" Ms. Chooljian said, ""but I couldn't really see it until I had taken a step back and then come back.""Within two years, she was working on the podcast, which would examine a tradition as essential to the state's identity as Lincoln to Illinois or the orange to Florida.NHPR newsroom leaders were hoping to follow up on their breakout podcast hit, the true-crime series ""Bear Brook,"" with a show focused on the primary. But it would have to steer clear of the usual fare. Maureen McMurray, the station's director of content, said she wanted to avoid ""primary kitsch,"" and Dan Barrick, the news director, did not want to add to the election-season din.""We were not going to spend that much being the 51st reporter at a Joe Biden press conference in Manchester,"" Mr. Barrick said.Accordingly, the first five ""Stranglehold"" episodes, which took months to report and produce, were divorced from the news cycle. Ms. Chooljian and her co-host, Jack Rodolico, 37, got help from colleagues like the reporter Casey McDermott and the ""Bear Brook"" host Jason Moon, who helped write the ""Stranglehold"" theme music.In an interview at the NHPR office in Concord, the state capital, Ms. Chooljian and Mr. Rodolico bristled at descriptions of ""Stranglehold"" as slanted or even ""critical,"" arguing that the show's irreverent title was meant to establish a tone that would set it apart from other political podcasts.""It could just never be something that felt like broccoli,"" Mr. Rodolico said.He added that the show's through line was its focus on ""people who have outsize influence over one of the most consequential decisions in American democracy.""When ""Stranglehold"" made its debut a few months ago, the Democratic Party was struggling with the premium it placed on New Hampshire and the caucuses in Iowa, another largely white state. After the debacle over Iowa's vote counts last week, skepticism of the two bellwethers has only increased, as evidenced last week by a Boston Globe editorial whose headline said it all: ""Kill the tradition: N.H. and Iowa should not vote first.""""This is the first time people are openly considering us not being first,"" Ms. Chooljian said after a day spent reporting a ""Stranglehold"" episode.Mr. Rodolico and Ms. Chooljian alternate as hosts. He is direct and self-effacing; she is more willing to make herself something of a character, the crescendo of her sentences often ending on an incredulous question mark.There has been very little horse-race content on ""Stranglehold."" This is not a podcast that makes a fetish of passing along the latest poll results. What it does provide is an almost novelistic portrait of the relationship between the state's residents and the primary that turns them into cable-news quarry every four years.""I don't know if it will be forever,"" William Shaheen, a former United States attorney for the state, said in a ""Stranglehold"" episode that chronicled Jimmy Carter's upset victory in the 1976 primary. ""But there was a time -- big time -- when it was Camelot.""The first episode told the story of Bill Gardner, the longtime New Hampshire secretary of state, whose clout overseeing the state's elections has made him a powerful gatekeeper. More recently, the podcast team turned the microphones on itself, exploring how the primary had been a boon to New Hampshire news outlets.Scott Spradling, a former political director of WMUR, the only TV station in the state with its own news division, said on the episode: ""When it came to protecting the presidential primary, I was a biased reporter. I will own that proudly."" The podcast went deeper into meta-journalism when it noted that Mr. McQuaid, of The Union Leader, had renewed his criticism of ""Stranglehold"" in a C-SPAN interview last month.Ms. Chooljian spoke up for ""Stranglehold"" in the closing minutes. ""Now, I would argue what we are doing is not negative, but I understand why my colleagues would be mad, or at least baffled,"" she said. ""The primary has made New Hampshire's local media important -- all local media. Us, too.""Away from the microphone, she was more specific.""I occupy a really odd spot, where my face is on the marketing at St. Anselm College for interviewing presidential candidates,"" Ms. Chooljian said. ""It's just evidence for how much we all benefit from this thing.""PhotographLauren Chooljian's podcast, ""Stranglehold,"" has riled New Hampshire.

| Jump to first hitBernie Sanders had an advantage on Super Tuesday he will not see again: many early votes cast before moderates coalesced around one candidate.Joe Biden not only reclaimed his status as a front-runner on Super Tuesday, but his victories also gave him a clear path to amassing enough delegates to clinch the nomination by the Democratic National Convention.Bernie Sanders, the left wing's champion, has dodged a knockout blow for now. While he has lost his lead in pledged delegates, he remains competitive in the delegate count, and he has probably stopped Mr. Biden well short of an overall majority of delegates awarded on Super Tuesday.But an Upshot analysis suggests that the close delegate race might not last for long. If the race doesn't take a decisive turn in favor of Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden is likely to build an insurmountable delegate lead over the next few weeks.Mr. Biden largely swept the Eastern half of the country, where most of the delegates awarded after Super Tuesday are at stake. And in many states, Mr. Sanders was able to forestall greater defeats only because of the large number of early voters who cast their ballots before the South Carolina race, when the party's moderate voters were still divided. He will no longer have that advantage.Mr. Biden got an additional lift on Wednesday as his leading moderate rival, Mike Bloomberg, dropped out of the race. His departure could free additional moderate voters to join Mr. Biden, and it seems Mr. Bloomberg will be willing to use his considerable wealth to support him. Even in the unlikely event that his voters don't break toward Mr. Biden, Mr. Bloomberg's absence would allow Mr. Biden to claim even larger delegate majorities in the remaining Southern states. In Florida, for example, Mr. Bloomberg might have otherwise cleared the 15 percent threshold for earning delegates, at Mr. Biden's expense.Mr. Biden swept the South with expected, overwhelming support among African-American voters, who backed him by a margin of 56 percent to 19 percent across the Super Tuesday states, according to exit polls. His success among white voters was less expected and allowed him to extend his strength well beyond the South.He ran even or ahead among white voters in every state east of the Mississippi River, except for Mr. Sanders's home state of Vermont, according to the exit polls, and won decisive victories in the affluent suburbs around Boston, Washington and Minneapolis. He even carried much of the old, moderate rural vote that Mr. Sanders swept four years earlier.Mr. Biden rapidly consolidated moderate-leaning voters in the days after his landslide victory in the South Carolina primary. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar left the race and endorsed him, with the result that he appeared to add nearly all their former supporters. His strength across the rural North and in affluent suburbs mirrored their strengths in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.Mr. Biden also seemed to benefit from the high turnout in many states, particularly in many of the affluent, well-educated metropolitan areas where Democrats have gained in recent years but where Mr. Sanders has long struggled. Mr. Sanders, in contrast, did not benefit from a long-promised surge in youth turnout, and his core base of support was overwhelmed across most of the South and even the North, where relatively liberal white voters make up a larger share of the electorate.Texas offered a different test. The state's Democratic electorate is a mix of African-Americans and more conservative and affluent white voters who tend to back Mr. Biden, and younger, urban and Latino voters who tend to back Mr. Sanders. According to the exit polls, Mr. Sanders won Latinos by a margin of 50 percent to 24 percent across the Super Tuesday states, with a margin of 41 percent to 24 percent in Texas.In an election night count that reflected the shift in the national political environment over the last week, Mr. Biden eventually overtook Mr. Sanders in the Texas returns, with a wide advantage among late-deciding voters who cast their ballots on Election Day. In a telling indication of how quickly moderate voters had coalesced behind Mr. Biden, the exit polls across the Super Tuesday states found that among voters who decided in just the last few days, Mr. Biden won by a margin of 48 percent to 21 percent.In North Carolina, which separates out early and Election Day results, Mr. Biden won just 28 percent among early voters but 41 percent of the vote statewide after winning 52 percent among Election Day voters. Mr. Bloomberg saw his support collapse in the Election Day vote.Mr. Sanders denied Mr. Biden a more sweeping victory with decisive wins of his own in the West, where Mr. Sanders can count on his strengths among Latinos, liberals and younger, urban voters without fully facing his weakness among African-American voters and conservative rural whites. The West also has the highest rate of early voting in the country, which helped blunt Mr. Biden's surge.Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar combined for 22 percent support in the exit poll in Colorado, where advance voters represented well over half of all voters -- the largest share of the vote of any state on Tuesday. Their support was not recorded in the election night tabulation because they withdrew from the race, but they routinely breached 10 percent in early voting elsewhere in the country, including California.The large early and absentee vote in some of the states most favorable to Mr. Sanders was enough to keep him close and competitive in the overall delegate count, despite 10 losses in 14 states. Over all, Mr. Biden holds only 45 percent of pledged delegates after Super Tuesday, according to preliminary Upshot estimates, while Mr. Sanders is expected to finish with around 39 percent. These tallies could change depending on the eventual result in California (which might not become official for weeks), but if they hold, Mr. Biden's delegate lead would be far from irreversible. In fact, Mr. Sanders would need to defeat Mr. Biden by only three points in the remaining two-thirds of the country to overtake him.A three-point deficit is not a daunting handicap, certainly not when Mr. Biden was polling 20 points lower just a few days ago. But the Super Tuesday results do not augur well for Mr. Sanders's odds of pulling it off. He remained so competitive on Super Tuesday in part because of the large number of early and absentee voters who cast ballots before it became apparent that Mr. Biden was the viable moderate candidate.The rest of the country may be even less favorable to Mr. Sanders. With Texas and California off the board, most of the remaining populous states lie in the East, where Mr. Sanders tended to lose, often badly. They also tend to have a below-average Latino share of the vote. It is hard to identify any state where Mr. Sanders would be obviously favored outside of the Northwest, if voters broke approximately as they did on Super Tuesday.The states where Latino voters do represent roughly their average share of the electorate do not seem likely to be as favorable to Mr. Sanders as California or Texas. Arizona, New Mexico, New York and Florida allow only registered Democrats to vote, and therefore exclude a disproportionate number of young Hispanic voters -- many of them registered as independents -- who are likeliest to back Mr. Sanders. These closed primaries will exclude many young non-Latino voters as well, posing a broader challenge to Mr. Sanders that he did not overcome in 2016 and has not yet had to face in 2020.Mr. Biden, in contrast, will continue to find many states in the next few weeks where black voters represent an average or above-average share of the population. He is all but assured to win commanding delegate majorities in Mississippi, Georgia and Florida. And there are many other states, including Missouri, Ohio and Michigan, where Mr. Biden would be the favorite if he could continue the pattern of his success with white voters in the East.He needs around 54 percent of the remaining delegates to claim a majority heading into the Democratic nomination, and his path to accomplishing this might be as simple as repeating a Super Tuesday outcome under a more favorable set of states, without the burden of early votes cast before he emerged as the top rival to Mr. Sanders.Mr. Sanders now needs around 57 percent of the remaining delegates to claim a majority. To pull it off, he would need to post decisive victories in states he would have almost certainly lost if they had voted on Super Tuesday. He would probably need the race to fundamentally change in the coming weeks, as it has before.PhotographBernie Sanders had an advantage Tuesday that he will not see again: many early votes were cast before moderates coalesced.

| Jump to first hitJoe Biden and other Democrats were already talking about health care before the coronavirus, but the outbreak gives new urgency to a central issue for the party.WASHINGTON -- One of the thorniest debates in American politics is over health care. Now add a pandemic.The future of America's health insurance system has already been a huge part of the 2020 presidential race. At campaign events over the past year, voters have shared stories of cancer diagnoses, costly medications and crushing medical debt.That was before more than 68,000 people in the United States tested positive for the coronavirus, grinding the country to a halt, upending lives from coast to coast, and postponing primary elections in many states. The virus has made the stakes, and the differing visions the two parties have for health care in America, that much clearer.""Health care was always going to be a big issue in the general election, and the coronavirus epidemic will put health care even more top of mind for voters,"" said Larry Levitt, the executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan research organization. ""Sometimes these health care debates can get a bit abstract, but when it's an immediate threat to the health of you and your family, it becomes a lot more real.""On Monday, Joseph R. Biden Jr. sent a letter to President Trump and Republican state officials that emphasized the sorts of immediate threats Americans are feeling, and criticized those Republicans for supporting litigation that targets the Affordable Care Act. The letter called it ""unconscionable that you are continuing to pursue a lawsuit designed to strip millions"" of coverage in the midst of a pandemic.Mr. Biden sent his missive on a health care milestone: the 10th anniversary of when President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law -- with Mr. Biden, then the vice president and now the likely Democratic presidential nominee, standing by his side.While the Democrats spent much of their primary fighting about whether to push for ""Medicare for all"" or build on the Affordable Care Act, the coronavirus crisis may streamline the debate to their advantage: At a time when the issue of health care is as pressing as ever, they can present themselves as the party that wants people to have sufficient coverage while arguing that the Republicans do not.""A crisis like the coronavirus epidemic highlights the stake that everyone has in the care of the sick,"" said Paul Starr, a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton who served as a health policy adviser in the Clinton White House. ""It really strengthens the Democratic case for expanded health coverage, and that should work, I should think, to Biden's advantage in a campaign against Trump.""The virus is also having dire economic consequences, depriving Mr. Trump of a potent re-election argument rooted in stock market gains and low unemployment numbers. It is testing Mr. Trump's leadership in the face of a national emergency like nothing he has encountered, and if voters give him poor marks, that could inflict lasting damage on his chances in November's general election.""It's a leadership argument,"" said Representative Donna E. Shalala, Democrat of Florida, who served as secretary of health and human services for President Bill Clinton. ""Who do you want to be president of the United States when there's a big health crisis?""In addition, the virus is a providing an unmistakable reminder that Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden have starkly different views about the future of American health care -- and starkly different records on the issue.Four years ago, Mr. Trump ran for president promising to repeal the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. But his campaign pledge quickly turned into a debacle in the first year of his presidency when Republicans struggled and ultimately failed to repeal and replace the health law. In the midterm elections the next year, Democrats emphasized health care, highlighting issues like preserving protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and they won control of the House.That line of argument has already surfaced in the 2020 election cycle. ""Too many Montana families go to sleep at night worried about health care -- coverage, costs, now the fear of coronavirus,"" the narrator said in a recent ad targeting Senator Steve Daines, Republican of Montana, who is up for re-election. The ad was run by Protect Our Care, a liberal advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act and has set up a coronavirus ""war room"" aimed at holding Mr. Trump accountable over his handling of the crisis.Mr. Trump is particularly vulnerable on the issue of health care. Over the course of his presidency, his administration has repeatedly taken steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act, including by arguing in court that the entire law should be invalidated. The Supreme Court agreed this month to hear an appeal in that case, which is the latest major challenge to the law. The court is not expected to rule until next year, but Democrats point to the Trump administration's legal position as yet another example of the president's desire to shred the Affordable Care Act.All together, those steps by Mr. Trump and his administration amounted to something of a policy piñata for Mr. Biden and other Democrats to swing at in the general election, even before the coronavirus threat emerged.""Trump wants to take health care away,"" said Representative Ami Bera of California, a physician. ""Democrats and Vice President Biden want to extend health care and make it affordable.""In his campaign, Mr. Biden has already put a focus on health care, promising to build on the Affordable Care Act and create a so-called public option, an optional government plan that consumers could purchase. On the campaign trail, he has talked about his own exposure to the health care system, including when his late son, Beau Biden, had brain cancer. He has also regularly heard from people about their own struggles. ""They walk up and grab me and say, 'I just lost my daughter, cancer,' or, 'My son's dying,' or, 'I have Stage 4,""' he recalled this year.Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said Mr. Trump had ""spent almost his entire presidency attempting to cost millions of Americans their health coverage,"" adding: ""The coronavirus outbreak, which Trump has egregiously mishandled, would be even more catastrophic if he had his way on health care.""At a Fox News town hall event this month, Mr. Trump said he had not ""been able to sell what a great job we've done"" on health care. While the president and congressional Republicans failed at repealing the Affordable Care Act, they succeeded at undoing a key part of the law when, as part of their 2017 tax overhaul, they eliminated the tax penalty for people who go without insurance.The Trump campaign has already attacked Mr. Biden over health care, including by arguing that he poses a threat to private health insurance with his proposal to create an optional government plan.""As President Trump is leading our country and taking unprecedented action to stop the coronavirus, Joe Biden is campaigning on his Bernie Sanders-inspired, socialist health care agenda, which would take away Americans' access to quality health care,"" said Sarah Matthews, a Trump campaign spokeswoman. ""Make no mistake about it, Biden's government-run 'public option' is just another name for a government takeover of the entire health care system.""And although the Affordable Care Act has gained in popularity during Mr. Trump's presidency, Republicans can still point to rising health care costs as a problem that voters want to see addressed. In that vein, Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana and a physician, cited the substantial premiums and high deductibles that many consumers have.""Democrats have to have a credible plan to control health care costs,"" Mr. Cassidy said. ""If you look at what the No. 1 concern is, it is the cost of health care.""In the Democratic primary race, the health care debate has largely focused on the divide between moderate-leaning Democrats looking to build on the Affordable Care Act and progressives calling for Medicare for all, a government-run health insurance program. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders represent the two sides of that argument.Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator, faces long odds at catching up to Mr. Biden in the delegate race, but he has remained in the primary and continues to push progressive policy ideas, including on health care. In response to the virus, he has pointed once again to the need for Medicare for all.""It is nearly impossible to believe that anyone can still think it's acceptable to continue with a health care system that leaves tens of millions of people uninsured,"" Mr. Sanders said this month. ""The cruelty and absurdity of that view is more obvious in the midst of this crisis than it has ever been.""In a poll this month by Morning Consult, four in 10 Americans said the coronavirus outbreak had made them more likely to support universal health care proposals in which everyone would receive their health insurance from the government.Under the single-payer system that Mr. Sanders is proposing, private health insurance would be eliminated -- a potential political vulnerability that Republicans would most likely exploit in the general election if the Democratic nominee supported Medicare for all. Mr. Biden, who has repeatedly criticized Mr. Sanders's health care proposal during the primary, does not share that vulnerability.At one of his final campaign stops before the virus shut down in-person campaigning, Mr. Biden visited a community health center in Grand Rapids, Mich., where he spoke of his pride in having worked with Mr. Obama to pass the Affordable Care Act.""I'm running to protect the progress we fought for,"" Mr. Biden said. He cast doubt on Mr. Sanders's plans for a single-payer system and spoke about the urgent need to improve health care -- now more evident than even two weeks ago.Talking about the patients at that clinic, he said, ""They can't afford to wait for a revolution.""PhotographA nurse worked at a drive-up coronavirus testing site in Yuba City, Calif., on Monday.

| Jump to first hitAs Mr. Biden campaigned in the state, residents appeared unmoved: ""I don't think much about anything Joni Ernst says.""MUSCATINE, Iowa -- Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, a Republican, wondered aloud about her Democratic constituents as they wrestled with a final decision before the looming Iowa caucuses, particularly those considering supporting former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.After sitting through hours of arguments in the impeachment trial of President Trump on Monday, where his legal team focused on how Mr. Biden's son, Hunter, had nabbed a lucrative position on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Ms. Ernst addressed reporters in the basement of the Capitol.""Iowa caucuses are this next Monday evening,"" she said. ""And I'm really interested to see how this discussion today informs and influences the Iowa caucus voters, those Democratic caucusgoers. Will they be supporting Vice President Biden at this point?""At an event in Muscatine on Tuesday, a handmade sign on the wall seemed to answer her directly: ""Joni -- We're w/ Joe.""Mr. Biden responded to Ms. Ernst's comments head-on, presenting them as proof that Mr. Trump's team was using the impeachment trial to try to hobble his candidacy.""She spilled the beans,"" Mr. Biden told the crowd, speaking in a room overlooking the Mississippi River on a gray winter day. ""She just came out and flat said it. You know, the whole impeachment trial for Trump is just a political hit job to try to smear me, because he is scared to death to run against me, and he has good reason to be concerned.""By late afternoon Tuesday, his team had sent a fund-raising email from his campaign manager with the subject line ""Hey Senator Joni Ernst, let me answer your question directly."" The campaign also released a digital ad highlighting Ms. Ernst's comments and accusing Republicans of spreading ""lies"" about Mr. Biden.The impeachment trial of Mr. Trump has paralyzed Washington and frozen much of the fluid 2020 Democratic field in amber, commanding nonstop news media attention and tethering the four senators in the race to Capitol Hill. But talk of impeachment has been largely absent from the campaign trail in Iowa in the final stretch before the state's caucuses, including at Mr. Biden's events.Ms. Ernst was first elected to the Senate in 2014 in a victory that helped the Republicans take control of the chamber. As she gears up for her first re-election battle this year, she has the built-in advantage of running on the same ticket as Mr. Trump, who carried Iowa in 2016 by nearly 10 points, even after Barack Obama won the state twice.So, could a shot from Iowa's junior senator, launched from a microphone in the bowels of the Capitol in Washington, put the polarizing impeachment process in the minds of Democratic caucusgoers in Iowa?The answer, as Mr. Biden campaigned in Iowa on Tuesday, seemed clear.""She's just mouthing everything that the president is saying,"" said Donna Cantrell, 70, who came to see Mr. Biden in Muscatine. She plans to support him next week and said the president's attacks would not persuade her otherwise.""He's a good person,"" she said of Mr. Biden. ""All the stuff that Trump keeps putting out there, investigating Burisma and all the stuff, it's just the same thing, the same playbook he did with Hillary Clinton to ruin her.""Michael Wehner, 66, was similarly unmoved. He said he had been leaning toward supporting Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, but was impressed by Mr. Biden.""I don't think much about anything Joni Ernst says,"" he said. The scrutiny of Hunter Biden did not give him any pause, he added.""The fact that he took that job was ill thought out,"" Mr. Wehner said. Still, he said, ""It's been investigated so deeply and there's nothing there. It's just a distraction away from what the president has done.""Interviews with a half dozen Democratic county chairs in Iowa similarly cast doubt on whether impeachment would be on the minds of caucusgoers as they decide among the Democratic candidates.""It has zero effect on actual caucus voters,"" said Brian Bruening, the chair of the Clayton County Democrats in northeast Iowa. ""I don't know any Joe Biden supporter whose support of Biden has lessened because of any of the impeachment issues.""Sue Dvorsky, a former chairwoman of the Iowa Democratic Party, argued that Ms. Ernst's comments would hurt her in the election by energizing the Democratic base.""She's calling out Democratic activists to look at her,"" Ms. Dvorsky said. ""Like, oh, sister. Are you sure? Are you sure you want to be the face of this?""As for Mr. Biden, she said that Mr. Trump's attacks had both accentuated the Biden campaign's argument that the president worries about facing him in a general election and offered a clear preview of how the president would attack him.""One of his residential addresses is inside Trump's head,"" she said. ""Does that help? Sure. Is it a double-edged sword? Yes, of course it is.""Ms. Ernst, who also sent a fund-raising appeal based on her Monday remarks, offered a different take on Twitter on Tuesday. She wrote that Mr. Biden ""thinks my comments prove his point"" regarding Mr. Trump.""Wrong,"" she added. ""Yesterday the president's counsel showcased that the Bidens were knee deep in corruption. Corruption isn't good politics nor is it good for the American people.""As the impeachment proceedings have ramped up, Mr. Biden has been hammering the argument that he is the candidate Mr. Trump fears most.""You Iowa caucusgoers have a chance for a twofer here,"" Mr. Biden said in Muscatine. ""You can ruin Donald Trump's night by caucusing for me, and you can ruin Joni Ernst's night as well.""Kevin Gleaves, who came out to see Mr. Biden, appeared eager to follow the former vice president's instructions -- at least in part.""I will certainly support whoever the Democrats nominate for president,"" said Mr. Gleaves, 71, who backs Ms. Warren but rebuffed Ms. Ernst nonetheless. ""I will actively support whoever's up against Joni Ernst. I will give that person my time, my money, my soul.""The Iowa Senate race is crucial to Democrats' hopes of retaking the Senate. Theresa Greenfield, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee's preferred candidate in the primary, wasted no time capitalizing on Ms. Ernst's remarks.""Sounds like you're focused on the wrong election, Senator,"" she tweeted Monday evening alongside a call for donations.Thomas Kaplan reported from Muscatine, and Nick Corasaniti from Des Moines. Maggie Astor contributed reporting from Des Moines, and Katie Glueck from Chicago.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitEfforts to bring wavering Republicans into line appeared to be working as President Trump's lawyers argued that anything a president did to win re-election was ""in the public interest.""WASHINGTON -- The White House and Senate Republicans worked aggressively on Wednesday to discount damaging revelations from John R. Bolton and line up the votes to block new witnesses from testifying in President Trump's impeachment trial, in a push to bring the proceeding to a swift close.As the Senate opened a two-day, 16-hour period of questioning from senators, Mr. Trump laced into Mr. Bolton, his former national security adviser, whose unpublished manuscript contains an account that contradicts his impeachment defense. The president described Mr. Bolton on Twitter as a warmonger who had ""begged"" for his job, was fired, and then wrote ""a nasty & untrue book.""On Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump's aides circulated a letter informing Mr. Bolton that the White House was moving to block publication of his forthcoming book, in which he wrote that the president refused to release military aid to Ukraine until its leaders committed to investigating his political rivals. That is a core element of the Democrats' case, which charges Mr. Trump with seeking to enlist a foreign government to help him win re-election this year.Before the trial convened, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and other Republicans signaled that they were regaining confidence that they would be able to cobble together the 51 votes needed to block new witnesses and documents and bring the trial to an acquittal verdict as soon as Friday, after the revelations from Mr. Bolton, reported Sunday by The New York Times, had threatened to knock their plans off course.Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Senate Republican, declared that he had ""heard enough"" and predicted that the Senate would vote to acquit the president by week's end.""I'm ready to vote on final judgment,"" Mr. Barrasso told reporters. Asked if Republicans planned to move directly to a vote on the two articles of impeachment on Friday, Mr. Barrasso said, ""Yes, that's the plan.""By Wednesday afternoon, Democrats were sounding a note of pessimism about the prospect of witnesses and securing new evidence in the trial, even as they used their questions to make the case that an impeachment trial without additional witnesses and documents amounted to a cover-up.""We've always known it will be an uphill fight on witnesses and documents because the president and Mitch McConnell put huge pressure on these folks,"" Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said during a break in the trial.""Is it more likely than not? Probably no,"" Mr. Schumer said. ""But is it a decent, good chance? Yes.""For Republicans, it appeared as if they were on the verge of giving Mr. Trump what he has wanted all along: an acquittal that he could boast about on the campaign trail -- delivered before he goes to the Capitol next Tuesday for his State of the Union address.Inside the Senate chamber, senators spent eight hours grilling House managers and White House lawyers about the definition of obstruction; the meaning of executive privilege; the history of security aid to Ukraine; the role of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., on the board of a Ukrainian energy company; the whistle-blower who first raised concerns about Mr. Trump's call with the president of Ukraine; and whether, as Mr. Trump's legal team asserted, it was perfectly fine for the president to solicit damaging information about the Bidens from Ukraine.In accordance with impeachment protocol, senators wrote their queries on small cards, which were read aloud by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who presided over the trial. In their responses, Mr. Trump's lawyers offered their most expansive defense of the president to date, effectively arguing that a president cannot be removed from office for demanding political favors if he believes his re-election is in the national interest.""Every public official I know believes that his election is in the public interest,"" said Alan M. Dershowitz, the celebrity defense lawyer and constitutional scholar who is part of the Mr. Trump's legal team. ""Mostly, you're right.""""If the president does something which he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment,"" he said.Many of the arguments and much the day was tailored to convincing a few Republicans who remained holdouts on the question of whether to call witnesses. Mr. McConnell gave his party's first question on Wednesday to Senators Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in an effort to allay the concerns of the three lawmakers, Republican moderates who are swing votes on the issue. The trio teamed up to ask Mr. Trump's lawyers how they should judge the president if they conclude he acted in the Ukraine matter with both political and policy motives.The selection of Ms. Collins, who is facing the toughest re-election campaign in her long Senate career, was revealing: It suggested that Mr. McConnell was keenly focused on giving her every opportunity to have her voice heard before moving forward. When she rose to announce herself, she became the first senator other than the two leaders to have a speaking role in the trial.Notably absent from the group was the fourth Republican who had expressed interest in witnesses: Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a close friend of Mr. McConnell's who has said he will not decide whether to support witnesses until after the question period has closed.Later in the evening, Mr. Romney hinted that he was seeking to better understand why Mr. Trump withheld security aid for Ukraine, asking White House lawyers for the specific date that the president first ordered a hold on the assistance. Patrick Philbin, a deputy White House counsel, did not provide a direct answer, saying there was no evidence of a specific date and offering only testimony showing that budget officials were aware of the hold in late June.On Tuesday, Mr. McConnell had privately warned his rank-and-file members that he did not currently have the votes to stop Democrats from summoning witnesses. One after the other on Wednesday, in statements and interviews in the Capitol, they made clear they would side with their leader.Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, who had previously floated the idea of a witness deal, said Wednesday that he was ""very, very skeptical"" of new witnesses. Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, facing a tough re-election in a swing state, issued a statement saying that he had heard enough and would vote against hearing from anyone else. Senator Martha McSally of Arizona, who is also facing a difficult election, tweeted later Wednesday: ""I have heard enough. It is time to vote.""Mr. McConnell summoned Ms. Murkowski to his office on Wednesday morning for a private meeting before the trial began, and she emerged refusing to answer questions about whether she would ultimately support the call for witnesses.""We still got some folks who are, like I said, assessing,"" said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Senate Republican. But the leaders were planning as if the defeat of a bid for witnesses was a certainty; Mr. Thune said it was likely that if it did fail, Republicans would move swiftly for an acquittal.Democrats would need the votes of four Republicans to compel the Senate to subpoena witnesses and new documents. But it seems increasingly likely that Mr. Alexander, who is retiring from the Senate and is thus free to do as he chooses without political repercussions, would not break from his party.Mr. Trump is charged with abusing his power and obstructing Congress by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, including Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden, and concealing evidence of it from lawmakers who were investigating.In the first hint of a possible crack in Democratic unity, Senator Doug Jones of Alabama suggested Wednesday that he might vote to acquit Mr. Trump on the charge of obstruction of Congress, though he said that the president's own behavior was strengthening the case against him. And Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia said he thought that Hunter Biden might be a relevant witness.""I'm still looking at that very closely; there are some things that trouble me about it,"" Mr. Jones said, without elaborating. ""But I will tell you this about the obstruction charge: The more I see the president of the United States attacking witnesses, the stronger that case gets.""Fielding friendly questions from Democratic senators, House managers reiterated the heart of their case and accused Mr. Trump's lawyers of falsely stating that there was no evidence that Mr. Trump linked security assistance to investigations. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the lead House impeachment manager, responded to Mr. Dershowitz's argument that a president who believed his re-election was in the national interest could demand a quid pro quo to help himself politically without consequence was ""very odd.""""If you say you can't hold a president accountable in an election year where they're trying to cheat in that election, then you are giving them carte blanche,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""All quid pro quos are not the same. Some are legitimate and some are corrupt.""Democrats have argued that Mr. Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine was precisely the kind of corrupt scheme that the nation's founders had in mind when they created impeachment, fearing that an out-of-control president would abuse his power for personal gain. But throughout the day, lawyers for Mr. Trump argued that all elected officials make policy decisions to help themselves get re-elected.Answering the question from the three Republican moderates, Mr. Philbin said that a president could not be removed for a ""mixed-motive situation"" in which he is acting out of both personal and policy concerns.""There's always some personal interest in the electoral outcome of policy decisions and there's nothing wrong with that,"" Mr. Philbin told senators. ""That's part of representative democracy.""In one case, White House lawyers struggled to answer a question from Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski, admitting that they had no evidence to counter Democratic arguments that Mr. Trump became interested in investigations of Joseph Biden in 2019 only after Mr. Biden became a candidate for president.Mr. Trump's legal team also argued that the House needed to prove its case ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" -- a standard of proof that legal experts say has no basis in either the Constitution or the rules of the Senate. And the legal team said that the case was merely ""based on a policy difference"" between the president and the career diplomats who sounded the alarm on his pressure campaign in Ukraine.While Chief Justice Roberts spent the day reading senators' words aloud, he did exercise his judgment on one key point, refusing to reveal the identity of the C.I.A. whistle-blower who filed the complaint that spurred the impeachment inquiry. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, sought unsuccessfully to ask a question about the origins of the investigation that named the whistle-blower, according to a person familiar with the debate. The query was rejected repeatedly.White House lawyers had help making sure their speakers stayed within a five-minute time limit that Chief Justice Roberts strictly enforced, and he occasionally cut off speakers midsentence. Staff for the lawyers held up small white cue cards showing when the clock was about to run out; the Democratic House managers did not appear to have such a system.Reporting was contributed by Catie Edmondson, Nicholas Fandos, Patricia Mazzei and Emily Cochrane.PhotographSenator Mitt Romney of Utah before Wednesday's session.

| Jump to first hitSome states are postponing their primary elections. Others are preparing to give out hand sanitizer.Hi. Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Giovanni Russonello, your morning newsletter writer taking over your evening edition.Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.First the Democratic presidential candidates were suspending their campaign events. Then Sunday's debate, originally planned for Phoenix, was moved to Washington and conducted without a live audience.Now we're at the point where some states are postponing voting in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Louisiana, Georgia and Kentucky have all pushed back their primary elections.In Ohio, a last-minute move has only added to the uncertainty. Ohio was one of four states scheduled to hold Democratic primaries on Tuesday, but its governor, Mike DeWine, recommended on Monday afternoon that it move its election to June 2 and allow mail-in voting to continue until then.""It is clear that tomorrow's in-person voting does not conform and cannot conform with these C.D.C. guidelines,"" Mr. DeWine said, referring to a recommendation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that any events in the United States be canceled or postponed where 50 people or more are expected to gather.On Monday evening, a county judge rejected the governor's request. But Mr. DeWine said late Monday night that he and top state health officials would ignore that ruling and order the polls closed by declaring a public health emergency. (Track the latest developments here.)Florida, Illinois and Arizona have decided to press on with their primaries on Tuesday, so expect hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes to be distributed at polling places. And expect the coronavirus to be going around at some of them, experts say.""Currently, the state of the situation is that the virus is in the community, probably more than is actually reported,"" Dr. E. Hanh Le, the senior director of medical affairs at Healthline, said in an interview. ""Many of the symptoms are so mild, a lot of people are reporting that they don't have any symptoms at all. So it is probably much more prevalent than we know about at this point.""In the Bay Area, where voting in the California primary has already occurred, local officials have issued a shelter-at-home order, effectively barring people from leaving their homes under most circumstances.But in states that vote Tuesday, officials are doing an elaborate dance, encouraging people to stay home except when absolutely necessary -- while also reassuring voters that it's OK to take part in the political process.Dr. Le said that despite the seriousness of the virus, voters who take necessary precautions shouldn't feel obligated to stay home. She has been closely following preparations at the state level, and she expressed satisfaction with the precautions being taken.""Particularly for states like Arizona and Florida, where there's a higher population of older voters, they've done a great job I think of pre-emptively preparing themselves,"" she said. That includes ""making sure that their polling stations and poll employees know what to do in terms of accepting people when they come; making sure the machines are cleaned before and throughout the day, so that when people come in they're not contaminating each other.""In Florida, the most delegate-rich state on the Democratic calendar Tuesday, more than 100 cases of the virus have been confirmed, and at least three people have been killed by it, according to a New York Times database. Mark Ard, a spokesman for Florida's Division of Elections, said the state was coordinating its response with the 67 county election supervisors and was helping provide counties with health supplies.""We are working with the supervisors of elections to make sure they're prepared and they have what they need, working with their emergency management officials to make sure that they have what they need,"" he said in an interview.Polling sites in Florida, Illinois and Arizona have been moved out of many senior centers in order to prevent voters from coming into contact with higher-risk, elderly voters. ""Our recommendation would be if there's a polling location in an assisted living facility, allow the residents to vote there,"" Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said Wednesday. ""But maybe the general public should have the option or be directed to go to a different polling location.""Ohio's voters would have more than two extra months to send in their ballots if the election is postponed, but in the three states that plan to proceed with voting Tuesday, mail balloting has not been extended.In Arizona's most populous county, Maricopa County, a partisan battle broke out last week over whether to take added measures to help people mail in votes in the primary. Adrian Fontes, the county recorder, who is a Democrat, announced a plan to mail ballots to all Democrats who had not yet cast early votes. But the state's attorney general, Mark Brnovich, a Republican, acquired a restraining order to prevent Mr. Fontes from sending the ballots.The Arizona secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, is now seeking legislation that could prevent hangups like this in the future, by allowing election officials to authorize all-mail elections in cases of emergency like this one.Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We'll try to answer it. Have a comment? We're all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com .Monday mailbag: Biden's V.P. shortlistThis morning, we listed Senators Amy Klobuchar, Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren as some of the possible running mates for Joe Biden after he declared he would select a woman for the job. Eric Wiesenthal of Sacramento writes:Your bullet on possible V.P. candidates was easy, but not very imaginative. I agree with you listing the women who've run this time, but I would suggest you and your team begin investigating possible African-American and Latinx candidates. Stacey Abrams of Georgia comes to mind, as does Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto. My guess is there is a robust shortlist of women of color who would bring youth, energy and genuine excitement for what the Democrats will offer.Our colleague Katie Glueck gave us an update on the thinking in the Biden camp:While Mr. Biden is certainly not yet the nominee, he has mentioned by name, or alluded to, a long list of potential running mates, including many of his former rivals. And his allies are already quietly -- and largely unofficially -- debating the merits of various vice-presidential candidates, mainly focusing on the names Mr. Biden himself has floated in public.One school of thought holds that Mr. Biden must choose a running mate who reflects the racial diversity of the Democratic Party, and he is already facing pressure from some of his most loyal backers to select an African-American woman in recognition of his unique debt to black voters.Another view is that the stakes of the election are so high, and Democrats are so focused on beating Mr. Trump, that Mr. Biden is likely to have wide latitude to choose whichever person he concludes is likeliest to help him win the general election. And choosing a popular woman for the vice presidency might be greeted with strong enough enthusiasm within the Democratic Party to offset any reservations about an all-white ticket.Some close to Mr. Biden's campaign have noted that he appears fond of Ms. Klobuchar, who endorsed him before Super Tuesday. He went on to win her home state, Minnesota, despite never having campaigned there this cycle, and he seemed visibly incredulous at his results watch party that evening when he noted the victory, a reflection of how unexpected it was.A day after Ms. Harris dropped out of the race, Mr. Biden said: ""She can be the president one day herself. She can be the vice president."" She rallied with him on the eve of the Michigan primary, and he dealt a major blow to Mr. Sanders in that contest. There are still bruised feelings among some in the Biden camp over her lacerating remarks about his views on busing during a debate-stage clash, but Mr. Biden has said that he doesn't hold grudges.He has also expressed openness to Ms. Warren, though more recently he emphasized her value in the Senate. Still, he said on the debate stage on Sunday that they had spoken recently, and over the weekend he endorsed her bankruptcy proposal.In November, he alluded to several other women outside of Washington: Ms. Abrams, the former Georgia House minority leader and 2018 nominee for governor; Sally Q. Yates, the acting attorney general who was fired by President Trump early in his term; and Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire.Other names generating chatter include Ms. Cortez Masto of Nevada, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Representative Val Demings of Florida. But in an MSNBC interview on Monday, Ms. Whitmer appeared to take herself out of the running. ""It is not going to be me, but I'm going to have a hand in helping make sure that he has got the rounded-out ticket that can win,"" she said.Thanks for reading.

| Jump to first hitThe Russians don't have to help President Trump or Bernie Sanders. They may already be winning.Hi. Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Lisa Lerer, your host.Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.Have the Russians already won?That's the question my colleague Reid Epstein and I were discussing this morning as we looked at the presidential candidates' responses to a new series of reports over the past few days revealing, yet again, a campaign of Russian meddling in American elections.Most of the specifics remain fairly hazy: A report on Thursday said intelligence officials had warned House lawmakers that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump re-elected. The next day, there was a report in The Washington Post that American officials had briefed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont a month ago that Russia was attempting to help his presidential campaign in the Democratic contest.And then yesterday, intelligence officials disputed the reports about Russia's helping Mr. Trump, saying that House members might have misheard or misinterpreted the briefing, and that Russia was intervening in the election but not necessarily to help the president.We don't know exactly what the Russians are doing or how they are doing it, though we can make some assumptions based on their 2016 effort, which many cybersecurity experts believe never stopped operating after the last election.But we do know how some of the candidates have reacted to this serious threat to democracy: by adding to the confusion and disinformation.Mr. Trump responded to revelations about the briefing with lawmakers by berating Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, then replacing him days later with Ambassador Richard Grenell, a Trump loyalist with little experience in intelligence or in running a large bureaucracy. Later, Mr. Trump blamed Democrats for spreading a ""hoax.""Mr. Sanders, for his part, moved quickly to denounce Russia, calling President Vladimir V. Putin an ""autocratic thug"" and warning Moscow to stay out of the election. Yet, he has also alluded to the idea that there is a domestic conspiracy afoot, playing into the kind of theories Moscow is eager to promulgate to undermine the news media and our political system.When asked why the disclosure about Russia's attempted assistance came out on Friday, Mr. Sanders said: ""I'll let you guess about one day before the Nevada caucus. Why do you think it came out? It was The Washington Post? Good friends.""The candidates are doing to one another what the Russians are trying to do to the election: weaponize the information. With Russia seemingly pulling levers from behind a curtain, they're attempting to create a narrative about whom Mr. Putin might support or oppose.Mr. Trump suggested at a rally in Las Vegas that Mr. Putin would prefer Mr. Sanders, claiming that Mr. Sanders and his wife had ""honeymooned in Moscow."" (The couple did travel to the Soviet Union after their wedding, and have jokingly called the trip their honeymoon, but they had a more traditional honeymoon the next year in the Caribbean.)Michael Bloomberg's aides made a similar argument: ""Trump himself and now the Russians are indicating that Senator Sanders is the candidate they want to run against,"" Dan Kanninen, a campaign official, told reporters on Monday.And Joseph R. Biden Jr., who said he had not been informed of any specific intelligence about Russia and his campaign, said he was the candidate Mr. Putin most hated.""The Russians don't want me to be the nominee,"" he said on ""Face the Nation."" ""They spent a lot of money on bots on Facebook, and they've been taken down, saying Biden is a bad guy. They don't want Biden running. They're not -- no one's helping me to try to get the nomination.""Turning disinformation into just another political football is exactly the kind of reaction Russia hopes to foster. The point of Moscow's campaign is not necessarily to help Mr. Trump or Mr. Sanders get to the presidency in 2020; it's to sow discord and undermine the institutions of American democracy, making presidential elections here seem no more credible than the ones keeping Mr. Putin in office.One small solution might be to clarify the threat for voters by creating a protocol to monitor and notify both government agencies and the public about disinformation efforts -- similar to a system set up in Canada last year. Right now, most of the information coming out in public is through leaks to the news media, very likely for political gain. That gives voters little clear information about what to watch out for when they log onto Twitter or Facebook.""What's so worrying to me right now are the unclear reports,"" said Laura Rosenberger, a former Bush and Obama administration official who now leads the Alliance for Securing Democracy, which works to counter foreign interference campaigns. ""It's hard to even know the scale of the issue when we don't know really what the scope of the problem is.""Welcome to 2020, when disinformation is clouded in ... disinformation!Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We'll try to answer it. Have a comment? We're all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com .And, come see us!Are you in New York City? Join me and the New York Times politics team on March 4 -- the day after Super Tuesday -- as we dive into all of the winners, losers and head-scratching moments of the race. Get your tickets here.How the early contests changed our readers' views on 2020We asked you, On Politics readers, to tell us how the results in Iowa and New Hampshire affected your view of the race. And, boy, did you have thoughts!For Barbara Sloan of Conway, S.C., the early results changed her view -- and vote.""Living in South Carolina, I had expected Biden to do better and thought his candidacy might be inevitable,"" she said. ""Obviously, Iowa and New Hampshire showed that is not the case. At the same time, I got to see more of Amy Klobuchar and she grew on me,"" Ms. Sloan continued. ""This week, I voted in-person absentee for her in the South Carolina Democratic Primary.""For John Sanderson, the results raised his concerns about Senator Elizabeth Warren.""I live in North Carolina, and I have never given Sanders or Buttigieg any chance whatsoever of winning here, and I still don't,"" he said. ""I have also had serious doubts about Warren's chances all along, and her performances in Iowa and New Hampshire only reinforce my doubts about her electability overall."" He said a Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar ticket might fare best.Lydia Simmons of San Francisco said the early states underscored how quickly the race could change.""New Hampshire could be considered a case study of why one result doesn't guarantee another,"" she said. ""Amy Klobuchar did not stand out in Iowa. She came in fifth. One strong debate later, she came in third,"" she continued, adding that Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden could not be counted out. ""Ultimately momentum needs to be maintained, and that requires strong performance in far more than two small states.""And Joyce Tarantino questioned why Iowa and New Hampshire have so much power, anyhow.""To place such importance on having two small states, with a very small amount of delegates, and unrepresentative of the nation and the Democratic Party as a whole, being the first to vote cannot continue,"" she said. ""We are wasting valuable time and financial resources at the early stage of a very important campaign with no discernible return on investment, except confusion.""... SeriouslyDating in 2020.

| Jump to first hit1. When does primary season begin? How long is it?Voting begins Feb. 3 with the Iowa caucuses. The last states vote in early June.So, four months. Like a college semester, except in the end all but one person will flunk out.2. Who will I be voting for in the primaries?The main event: candidates for the Democratic and Republican 2020 presidential nominations.But voters will find all manner of down-ballot elections to consider on primary day, including House and Senate races and seats on the state legislature. You might be voting for the presidents of tomorrow in those contests.3. What's the difference between primaries and caucuses?Primaries are reasonably straightforward: Voters vote, and their votes go to candidates who hope to receive more votes than the other candidates.Caucuses are like this in spirit, but with a dash of municipal sausage-making and D.M.V.-style chaos.Generally, supporters for various candidates sit or stand together in groups. A head count is conducted. And if a candidate doesn't reach a certain threshold of support -- say, 15 percent of attendees at a caucus site -- the group is deemed ""nonviable,"" and its members realign with other clusters before a final count is made.Democracy!4. So when do I vote?Three possibilities:Early voting. Enjoy responsibly! And check out the rules and dates for your state.Election Day voting. The classic! Also varies by state, of course.Your primary was canceled. Better luck next time!5. Can states actually cancel their primaries?They can, and they did!While President Trump would be an overwhelming favorite to win a Republican primary in any state, some of them have decided to scrap the exercise altogether. Trump critics called the moves antidemocratic, but there is bipartisan precedent for such cancellations when a party's incumbent is seeking re-election.6. Is there a Republican presidential primary, officially?Yes, in most states.Mr. Trump's opponents include Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman, and William F. Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts. At present, they are approximately as likely to win as any person reading this sentence. #SentenceReaders20207. Can I vote in both the Democratic primary and the Republican primary?One vote per person, folks.And in some states with so-called closed primaries, you'll need to be registered with a given party to participate.8. Will impeachment affect the campaign?As a practical matter, the impeachment trial in the Senate will keep several Democratic candidates in Washington during crucial would-be campaign days.As an issue for voters, impeachment is not necessarily front of mind. The top Democrats tend to agree that Mr. Trump should be removed from office -- and they also expect the Republican-led Senate to clear him.In recent weeks, voters have pressed candidates much more often on issues like health care and climate than on any allegations of executive high crimes and misdemeanors.9. Could Trump get elected president again, even after being impeached by the House?That's his plan.Mr. Trump is the first impeached president ever to seek re-election. He would like to be the first impeached president to win again.10. I keep hearing this is the largest Democratic field. How big is it, actually?At present, it's 12 deep -- enough to fill a baseball lineup and accommodate a few benchwarmers, too.At its peak, the field swelled well into the 20s, exceeding even the unwieldy 2016 Republican roster and requiring two nights of 10-person debates that nonetheless barred a handful of candidates from the stage.11. Who's likely to win the Democratic nomination?Where's the suspense in telling you now?Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has often led in national polls, but the state-level surveys are more of a muddle. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has raised the most money and retains a loyal core of support from his 2016 run.Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend., Ind., have shown strength in Iowa at various points. Betting markets appraise Mr. Biden as the likeliest nominee. They also liked Jeb Bush's chances in 2016.12. Which Democrat has the best chance of beating Trump?For months, Democratic voters have talked constantly about electability.They have had a harder time agreeing on what it means -- or at least, who best embodies it.Biden supporters say the party needs someone who can appeal to white working-class voters who gravitated to Mr. Trump.Some Warren supporters consider this to be a sexist euphemism for an older male nominee, arguing that Ms. Warren's raft of liberal plans can better inspire the masses.Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have suggested that a Midwestern sensibility is best.And Mr. Sanders, whose admirers insist he would have defeated Mr. Trump in 2016 if given the chance, has been perhaps the least subtle at times. A campaign swing planned last year was billed as the ""Bernie Beats Trump"" tour.13. Why do I keep hearing that Iowa is so important?Because Iowa goes first and has since the 1970s.Why? There's no great reason (though the tumultuous 1968 Democratic convention set the stage to an extent), and inertia is a powerful thing. It's sort of like a teacher giving extra credit to the student who comes first alphabetically, except instead of extra credit, it's kind words from national politicians about the good people of Sioux City.Strictly speaking, Iowa awards a relatively small share of delegates (more on that shortly). But winning the state, or even exceeding expectations as a non-winner, can propel a campaign through the rest of the early calendar.14. What's Super Tuesday?Super Tuesday, March 3, is perhaps the most important single date on the primary calendar because of how many major states will be holding their elections, including California and Texas.About 40 percent of all pledged Democratic delegates will be awarded in these states.15. How does someone win the Democratic nomination?A candidate hoping to win on the first ballot at the convention must secure a majority of pledged delegates, as dictated by the outcomes in state primaries and caucuses.In total, there are just under 4,000 pledged delegates up for grabs (as well as hundreds of superdelegates, though the party prefers to call them automatic delegates). The official nomination will take place at the party's convention in Milwaukee this summer.16. What are delegates?Delegates (the people) are political figures like activists and local leaders chosen to represent their states at the party convention.Delegates (the numbers) are the all-purpose metric of primary success, allocated proportionally according to state voting results.Generally, a candidate must exceed 15 percent of the vote in a congressional district or statewide to win delegates.17. What are superdelegates? Didn't they get rid of those?Democratic superdelegates are the political insiders, from sitting lawmakers to former senior party officials, whose primary choices can be divorced entirely from the preferences of workaday voters.Superdelegates can vote as they choose, and their very existence in 2016 became a source of major tension in the race between Hillary Clinton and Mr. Sanders. While Mrs. Clinton bested Mr. Sanders among pledged delegates in 2016, Mr. Sanders and his supporters saw the superdelegate system as an affront to the democratic process.In response, the Democratic National Committee has sharply reduced the influence of superdelegates, effectively preventing them from participating substantively in the first ballot of the presidential nominating process. But in the event of a deadlock at the convention, superdelegates could come into play.18. Are there any history makers in the presidential election?Ms. Warren or Ms. Klobuchar (or Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii) would be the first woman elected president. Mr. Buttigieg would be the first openly gay person to hold the office.But for all the initial excitement within the party about a deep bench of candidates of color, several -- including Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey and Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary -- have dropped out. The remaining low-polling nonwhite candidates include Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Andrew Yang, a former technology executive.Then there is this bit of potential history: Mr. Sanders (78), Mr. Biden (77), Michael R. Bloomberg (77) and Ms. Warren (70) and would each be the oldest president ever inaugurated for a first term.19. Is there still a chance that a new longshot will emerge?Sure. Just not a great one.There's a cliché in politics: ""The only poll that matters is on Election Day."" But some other things that matter -- staffing, fund-raising, a workable delegate strategy -- are built well in advance.And many of the lower-tier candidates have been running for many, many months without catching on.A former Maryland congressman named John Delaney has been campaigning for president since the middle of 2017. He has not measurably improved his standing. But perhaps the final weeks will uncover a surge of Delan-iacs who had been keeping their feelings to themselves.20. What's Michael Bloomberg up to?Spending a nine-figure fortune on a possibly quixotic candidacy.But he does have a plan, albeit an unusual one. Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, is effectively skipping the early nominating contests to focus on delegate-rich states that vote in March and beyond. He is already ubiquitous in television ads and has amassed a small army of staff members to sustain his bid for as long as he chooses.Yet he is lagging much of the field in the often-relevant category of ""interactions with actual primary voters."" And if any candidate emerges from the February states as a clear front-runner, Mr. Bloomberg's time-biding approach could backfire.21. Which party has done better in fund-raising so far?Mr. Trump entered 2020 with more than $100 million in cash on hand and outpaced every Democrat with $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.But contenders for the Democratic nomination have cumulatively surpassed Mr. Trump's total, suggesting intense enthusiasm. Safe to say that neither party's nominee will go hungry this fall.22. Which voters are Democrats targeting?Mr. Biden generally does best with older voters and African-Americans. Ms. Warren is most popular with highly educated Democrats. Mr. Sanders, despite his age, rules the young. And Mr. Buttigieg, 38, despite his age, draws much of his support from a very different demographic.Particularly after Iowa and New Hampshire, which are overwhelmingly white, candidates will be pitching themselves to a much more diverse party electorate. Several candidates, particularly Mr. Buttigieg, have struggled in polls of voters of color. But many campaigns are hopeful that strong showings in the early states will earn them a longer look.23. What issues have dominated the race this year?Health care policy has probably been the most conspicuous, with divisions over the relative virtues of ""Medicare For all"" (one of Mr. Sanders's signature issues) or a more incremental approach.Gun control has come up some, especially after the El Paso massacre last summer.Ms. Warren was often the pacesetter in attention-grabbing proposals, like her bid to break up tech giants such as Amazon and Facebook.Some candidates, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, have turned their attention to the more amorphous issue of national unity: They frame the election as a moment for healing, though no Democrat has identified as anti-healing, exactly.24. Does my vote in the primaries matter?Sure, why not? Nihilism is for Nietzscheans and Knicks fans.And while the piecemeal nature of the state-by-state calendar might make the process seem less exciting than the all-in-one-day general election, the primaries do resolve the nontrivial matter of choosing major party nominees.25. Is it O.K. for me to skip voting in the primaries and just vote in the general election?It's allowed.Of course, candidates tend to call every election ""the most important of our lifetime."" By definition, that can't always be true. But don't forget the down-ballot primaries, which will be of significant consequence locally in many states.26. Can I vote in the primaries in one state and then the general election in another state?Potentially, if you time it right and change your registration by the fall.And if you happen to be that rare voter moving from an early-voting primary state like New Hampshire to a November swing state like Pennsylvania, well, enjoy the attention.27. Do I need to be registered to vote in the primaries?Forty-nine states require voter registration. (North Dakota, you incorrigible contrarians.)Deadlines can be found here.28. Do I need a government-issued ID?Requirements vary by state. Here's a detailed rundown.29. What if I was removed in a voter purge?Those worried about their status can check here.30. Can I vote over the Internet?Generally, no.Some states allow it in certain (often narrowly defined) circumstances.31. Are Russians going to interfere again?The intelligence community is certainly bracing for it.Despite the president's longstanding doubts about the intelligence consensus on Russian interference in 2016, officials have warned that a sequel of sorts is in the works. After detecting evidence of Russian influence efforts in 2018, Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, said last year that he viewed the attempts as ""kind of a dress rehearsal for the big show in 2020.""32. How can I tell this year if Trump's chances of winning re-election are increasing?Historically, the health of the economy is a useful indicator. So are approval ratings.But consulting precedent can be complicated where Mr. Trump is concerned.On the one hand, his party suffered steep midterm losses in 2018 despite low unemployment and many positive economic trends. On the other, Mr. Trump won in 2016 despite often dismal favorability scores.Whether he can repeat the feat might come down to this: Was Mrs. Clinton a uniquely unpopular nominee? Or will any Democrat eventually look beatable once the president and his allies have a single opponent to attack every day?33. Should I trust the polls after 2016?Yes and no.Imperfect polls (which is to say, all of them) are still far more instructive than none at all, if contextualized with care. And while Mr. Trump's 2016 success in states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan was a surprise, the popular vote margin -- Mrs. Clinton by a couple of points -- was consistent with much of the late-stage national polling.But of course, the only bulletproof prediction through political history is that people who make political predictions will keep getting things wrong sometimes.34. Are we going to be O.K.?Were we ever, really?35. When is this all over?It's probably best not to think about that. More than 280 days left until general election.Sources: The campaigns (campaign finance); The Green Papers (election calendar and delegate numbers); Ballotpedia (canceled primaries).

| Jump to first hitThe less quantifiable elements of Mr. Biden's campaign -- including his association with Barack Obama, his empathy and his momentum -- have outweighed his lack of organizational heft.Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s campaign organization in key Super Tuesday states was so flimsy that it shocked and alarmed Democratic Party leaders. Mr. Biden had little cash for advertising on the airwaves. His message just days before the big vote was sometimes unfocused and meandering.But when 14 states voted on Tuesday, none of that mattered: Mr. Biden swept to victory in 10 of them, reflecting a quickly coalescing moderate wing of the Democratic Party and a desperation among voters to start taking the fight to President Trump.""There's no analogous situation that I can think of in presidential politics where a candidate who was really on the brink of extinction came back and, over four days, took command of a race without benefit of media or organization,"" said David Axelrod, who served as chief strategist for President Barack Obama. ""It's an unparalleled situation.""Mr. Biden was greatly aided by the late endorsements of two former rivals, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., who exited the race at the beginning of the week. Mr. Biden's overwhelming victory in South Carolina last Saturday, powered by African-American voters, injected a stunning dose of momentum into the campaign after losses in the first three nominating contests.But Tuesday's results also showed that in a matchup that was largely against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the less quantifiable elements of Mr. Biden's campaign -- his association with Mr. Obama, his empathy and his more moderate approach to governing -- outweighed his lack of organizational heft in many places.Those operational challenges have not evaporated. Representative Emanuel Cleaver II of Missouri, a Biden supporter, said the campaign had ""virtually no operation"" in his state, which votes on Tuesday.Yet as the presidential contest moves into a battle for large, delegate-rich states like Michigan, Ohio, Illinois and Florida, Mr. Biden is racing to cement his advantage with the sprawling coalition that propelled him in the past week -- this time with the momentum, money and avalanche of endorsements that had eluded him throughout the race, even as his team scrambles to scale up.Headed into the next round of contests on Tuesday, when six states including Michigan and Missouri will vote, Mr. Biden is again seeking to run up the score in heavily African-American congressional districts, build on his newfound strength with moderate suburbanites and fight Mr. Sanders for white working-class voters. He is quickly rerouting some staff to key states, uncorking new ad spending and leaning into sharper criticisms of Mr. Sanders, now his chief rival for the nomination.Mr. Biden's financial fortunes are rapidly changing: Since last Saturday, the day of his resounding victory in South Carolina, his campaign has raised more than $22 million in online donations -- more than double its total fund-raising in the entire month of January. A fund-raiser he attended in Los Angeles on Wednesday was moved outdoors to accommodate the number of people who wanted to come (the guest list included the actor Leonardo DiCaprio and his mother).Mr. Biden's surrogates have sprung into action, seeking to help him acquire additional support in upcoming key states through methods both traditional -- Ms. Klobuchar deployed to Michigan for Mr. Biden -- and creative: The former U.S. ambassador to Ireland was listed as hosting an organizing event recently for Mr. Biden in the small city of Bolivar, Mo.According to his campaign, Mr. Biden has more than 70 endorsements in Missouri, more than 50 in Florida and around 20 in Michigan. Among his newest endorsers in Michigan is Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who was named a national co-chair of his campaign.Former Senator Bill Nelson of Florida, a Biden supporter, said the campaign had focused resources on South Carolina out of necessity. But with an eye on the March 17 contest in his own state, Mr. Nelson said, ""Now I think you will see a flood of people that will be coming in and augmenting the existing staff in Florida.""""People like a winner,"" added Mr. Nelson, who has been pounding the phones, seeking to get more state legislators on board.Still, there is limited time to build out the kind of on-the-ground infrastructure that can often make a difference in close races.In Michigan, Mayor Mike Duggan of Detroit, another Biden supporter, said the Biden campaign was relying on volunteers, and had long made clear that it did not intend to establish a large presence of paid staff in the state.""They flat-out said we're not putting field resources in Michigan,"" he said, noting that he agreed with their approach. ""I told them we'd do the organizing with the volunteers here and we'd be ready to go on March 10, and I think we will be.""Bill Neidhardt, a Sanders aide in Michigan, said that campaign had 25 paid staff members in the state.""We're down to two campaigns: one that has a grass-roots organizing infrastructure that is deployed in multiple states, including here in Michigan,"" he said. ""Then you have Joe Biden's campaign, which they seem to be figuring out.""Mississippi, Washington, Idaho and North Dakota are also holding nominating contests on Tuesday. In contrast to 2016, Washington and Idaho Democrats have now embraced primaries -- not caucuses, which tend to draw only the most committed activists -- a move that some Biden allies hope will allow him to cut into Mr. Sanders's potential advantages in those states, both of which he won handily in the previous presidential race.On Thursday, Mr. Sanders canceled a rally in Mississippi, a state with a heavily African-American Democratic electorate, redeploying instead to delegate-heavy Michigan, where he and Mr. Biden look poised for a fierce fight over the blue-collar workers that helped Mr. Sanders narrowly win the state in his 2016 presidential bid.Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have criticized each other during the primary race -- over Mr. Biden's vote to authorize the war in Iraq, for example, or Mr. Sanders's record on gun control -- but they now both appear willing to wage their most pointed fights to date. Mr. Sanders has released ads jabbing Mr. Biden over his position on trade and his past support at times for Social Security freezes -- reviving a fight the two men had in Iowa that Mr. Sanders's allies believe played to his advantage.Mr. Sanders also released an ad highlighting his ties to Mr. Obama, a move that drew incredulity from some of Mr. Biden's supporters who note not only Mr. Biden's service as vice president under Mr. Obama, but also that Mr. Sanders reportedly weighed a primary challenge to Mr. Obama in the 2012 election.""I'm sorry, what?"" Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware and a strong Biden supporter, said when asked about the ad. ""Senator Sanders seriously considered primarying Barack Obama in 2012 and routinely criticized him and his proposals. So if this is a race between former Vice President Biden and Senator Sanders as to who has the experience and the vision that moves forward the Obama-Biden agenda, it's undeniably Joe Biden."" Mr. Sanders has denied that he considered challenging Mr. Obama.Mr. Sanders won a surprise victory in Michigan in 2016 when competing against Hillary Clinton, whom he criticized over her support for trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. That is an issue that plays to Mr. Sanders's strengths with white working-class voters, a constituency over which he and Mr. Biden battled intensely in Iowa, where Mr. Biden came in fourth.Mr. Biden voted for NAFTA as a senator, giving Mr. Sanders ammunition to raise the issue of trade in this year's primary as well.Mr. Neidhardt promised a ""precise, specific"" conversation around the economy.Mr. Biden has been endorsed by the Michigan Democratic Party Black Caucus, and party leaders in the state say he also has a growing opportunity with moderates who had gravitated to other candidates like former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg. They also note his work on the auto industry bailout as part of the Obama administration, and his own blue-collar background, which helps him connect with working-class voters.Mr. Duggan, the Detroit mayor, suggested that affection for Mr. Biden would make up for the campaign's lack of staff in his state.""Their strategy was Nevada, South Carolina and Super Tuesday, but they got a lot of deeply loyal individuals like me, and we'll see how the campaign performs in the next week,"" he said. ""But I feel confident that what you had here were people who were with Biden because they love Biden. And that's been paying off around the country.""PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. won 10 states on Super Tuesday even though he had campaigned in only half of them.

| Jump to first hitMost are paying attention, get what it's all about and have strong opinions about impeachment -- but not always the opinions you'd expect.""A fit of partisan rage"" is how Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader of the Senate, characterized the bid to remove President Trump from office. The president's behavior, in the view of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, left House Democrats with ""no choice"" but to impeach.But what do the American people think?With the Senate trial of Mr. Trump now underway, we deployed a team of journalists to find out. We contacted hundreds of voters who had responded to an online survey saying they would be willing to be interviewed. We reached 81 people, from nearly 30 states.They were Democrats, Republicans and independents. They were retirees and real estate agents, teachers and stay-at-home parents. The youngest was 21; the oldest was 82. Even before the opening statements at the trial had begun, most had already made up their minds on their preferred verdict.As one independent voter from Ohio put it, ""maybe they should ask the people what they should do. It should be our vote.""Though the case against Mr. Trump is complex, most people grasp the basics.The last time a president was impeached, in the 1990s, the allegations were like something out of a soap opera: President Bill Clinton was accused of lying under oath about his sexual encounters with a White House intern.This time around, the charges stem from something much more complicated and less familiar than a sex scandal: using the power of the presidency to extract foreign help against a domestic rival.We wondered how closely Americans were following the complicated case. ""I think it's about them interfering with the election or something? I'm not sure. It's very confusing,"" said one Republican who didn't think the evidence was very strong. One Democrat who thought Mr. Trump should be removed acknowledged, ""I don't really know what the evidence is.""But most people, across the political spectrum, were well versed in the basics, and some could even reel off names of key witnesses and documents.Here are some of their descriptions of the case, in their own words.The accusation is that he withheld foreign aid money in exchange for Ukrainians investigating Joe Biden and his son. Kyle Sims, 46, a Republican from North CarolinaThere are two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Bill Oberjohn, 82, a Democrat from OhioSupposedly he was colluding, or he was proposing to the leaders of -- I can't think of the name of the country. Not Czechoslovakia. Joe Biden and his son had gotten involved a few years ago in the Ukraine. It's the Ukraine, right? Tim Tucker, 73, a conservative independent who splits his time between Indiana and FloridaGoing to Ukraine and asking their government for interference for our election and digging up dirt on a political opponent. Bottom line, he was asking for the quid pro quo. Melissa Reese, 32, a Democrat from Allentown, Pa.I'm confused on what they're accusing him of, but it just has to do with the communication with the Ukrainian president. They haven't been able to glom onto anything yet and this was as close as they could get after all the pressure that they've gotten. Amy, 47, a Republican from IllinoisOne side sees impeachment as a ploy in a wider partisan war against Mr. Trump.People we spoke with who said they did not want Mr. Trump to be removed from office tended to view impeachment as an intensely personal attack on the president, mounted by Democrats who despise Mr. Trump and resent his election victory in 2016.I'm convinced of my view because of the blatant disrespect that President Trump has been shown by those who oppose him. It seems as though they would have him impeached at any cost, with no regard to truth or proper proceedings. Bethany McGraw, 21, a Republican from FloridaThey just don't like the man because he's not a politician. They can't reconcile their 2016 defeat of a career politician by a businessman. They can't stand it that he's outthinking them and outmaneuvering them on every issue. Gerald Wilson, 50, a conservative Democrat from OklahomaI think the whole thing is ridiculous. You can tell that the Democrats are just out to get Trump. It's just obvious. I feel like there's no grounds to impeach him. It's just insane. Cherece Mendieta, 46, a conservative from HoustonAs a former law enforcement officer, there is no case there. Absolutely no case. The president did not do anything wrong. It's a shame that so many people hate the president to the point where they will try to make the case where there is none. Bill Marcy, 73, a Republican from MississippiThe other side sees the Ukraine allegations as just the tip of the iceberg.For Democrats and others who said they want the president removed, asking about the freezing of military aid to Ukraine was like opening a Pandora's box of other presidential decisions they disagreed with -- and, in some cases, thought could be impeachable offenses in their own right.I'm upset with the Democrats. They should have listed about 50 things. They should have just buried him. I think that he's guilty of crimes against humanity with regard to immigrants. Now that it's come out that he planned six weeks ago to commit an assassination on a foreign national, to me that's an international crime. Terry Scott, 55, a liberal from Kent, Wash.This is bigger than this particular case -- his mental ramblings, his strong support of strongmen in other countries, his completely flouting the democracy that we have. He's polarizing the nation, putting children in cages. There are so many reasons, but right now, I support that they are impeaching him for obstructing Congress and trying to do their job. Gina Fields, 54, a Democrat from Los AngelesWe have a very big character issue with him. He's made fun of people, he's attacked people's ethnicity, he's attacked people's capabilities, especially making fun of people who might have severe learning issues. He name-calls. Yes, the economy is doing well and he's going to take all of the credit, and I don't know if that is right or wrong. But I think we are at the worst possible time, in terms of the divisiveness of the country, that we have been in my lifetime. Jimmy Welch, 53, a Republican from Louisville, Ky., who voted for President Trump in 2016 but is considering voting against him in 2020I think those are the ones that the House thought would stick, but I do think he's been doing a pretty bad job locally and internationally. His use of hate speech in order to rally supporters. Him closing the borders. America was a country that was built on immigration in the beginning. Desiré Hardison, 37, a Democrat from New York CityI believe even before this case came up to the attention of the American people, Trump's rhetoric on immigration, linking south border refugees to criminals, is an invitation to incite riots and frontiersman's approach to justice. That was enough to be considered a high crime in my mind. Yin Yeh, 81, a liberal Democrat from CaliforniaNot everything is partisan. Sometimes it's complicated.Over all, our interviews captured views of impeachment that largely break along partisan lines. But at the same time, they also offered a refreshing reminder that people are complicated, and often defy political and demographic stereotypes.Would you have guessed that the 21-year-old we mentioned was a Republican, and the 82-year-old a Democrat?When we asked people where they got their news, many cited outlets that aligned with their political bents. But others listed an array of sometimes contradictory sources, like the moderate who said his media diet included both MSNBC, with its liberal-leaning prime-time opinion shows, and a podcast by the conservative commentator Ben Shapiro. One California man in his 70s told us he gets almost all his information from YouTube.And we found that negative feelings about Mr. Trump did not always translate into a desire to see him impeached.The Senate should probably not remove him from office at this point. Probably his misdeeds do not amount to high crimes and misdemeanors, and the uproar from his supporters would dislocate life in the U.S. for years. Terry Morrison, 82, a Democrat from WisconsinAs far as news goes, I've got CNN right next to Fox News on my Sirius satellite. William Johnson, 50, a conservative from TexasHas he done inappropriate things? Yeah, I hate to tell you, every president has. I don't like the man personally. I can understand why they don't like him. But that's not grounds for impeachment. Richard Thomas, 73, a Republican from Avondale, Ariz.I don't think he should've been elected in the first place, but I think it's bad for an impeachment to be this close to an election. He should not be removed. William Hogan, 35, a moderate from AtlantaAnd finally, a few choice outtakes.You've got me fired up here on a Wednesday afternoon. I have to go visit a 100-year-old lady that's in the nursing home. Mr. Tucker, a retiree whom we caught between golf rounds in FloridaI can say, damn near everything I've ever been accused of, I did it. Jonathan Swenson, 38, from Utah, who says he originally registered Republican but isn't so sure nowFiona Hill -- that would be a great name for an alternative band. Jerry Iannacci, 52, an independent from Pennsylvania, praising an impeachment witnessIf you can think of some way to bring America back together, I would pat you on the back and give you an award. Mary Moerles, 73, a conservative independent from MissouriMethodology: We obtained a list of more than 1,000 people who had responded to an online survey and said they were voters and were willing to be interviewed by a reporter. We reached out to several hundred of those voters -- covering a wide range of ages, races and ethnicities, political leanings and home states -- and conducted interviews with 81 of them; their views are presented here. Quotations were edited for brevity and clarity. The interviews do not constitute a scientific sampling of opinion.PhotographThe impeachment proceedings against the president, from the early investigation to the trial that started this week, have animated people in Battle Creek, Mich., at far left, Doylestown, Pa., at right, and many other places besides. Most are paying attention, get what it's all about, and have strong opinions about what's happening -- but not always the ones you'd expect.

| Jump to first hitFour Democratic presidential candidates hoping for success in the state remained in Washington for President Trump's Senate trial.DES MOINES -- Four Democratic presidential candidates hoping for breakout performances in the Iowa caucuses next week spent Thursday in Washington listening to questioning in the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump.But the man on trial appeared in Des Moines for a rally to fire up his supporters before the caucuses on Monday. It was his second rally in three nights.In a state where the Democratic field faces a competitive and critical contest on Monday night, the president told his supporters that they had a ""front-row seat to the lunacy and the madness of a totally sick left."" He called the Democrats the party of ""socialism and blatant corruption,"" even as he sits accused of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.Unlike the Democrats, Mr. Trump does not face a competitive contest in Iowa, where his two Republican challengers -- Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman, and Bill Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts -- have failed to make any dent in Mr. Trump's support.But the Trump campaign views a show of force before the caucuses as an opportunity to try to slow any momentum the winning Democrat hopes to gain from the close race. And Mr. Trump's team is seeking to build excitement ahead of the first chance voters have had to show their support for the president since the 2016 election.Mr. Trump tried to belittle his Democratic opponents on Thursday with his signature nicknames, referring to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as ""Sleepy Joe,"" Senator Bernie Sanders as ""Crazy Bernie"" and Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, as ""Mini Mike."" He poked fun multiple times at the pronunciation of the name of Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and accused the field at large of ""glorifying illegal immigration.""Four years after voters first saw Mr. Trump's name on a ballot, he leaned into some of the original, fear-mongering themes that defined his entry into politics, calling undocumented immigrants ""stone cold rapists."" The line was a callback to his kickoff speech in 2015, when he said of undocumented immigrants: ""They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.""Mr. Trump seemed aware that he was rocketing into a state where Democrats have been camped out for months, noting that ""we're going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats that are right down the street.""But his focus on the Democratic field in front of him appeared to be divided by his political enemies of the past and his foils in Congress.The president reminisced about the 2016 election, expressing a longing for the former Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, and rehashing a four-year-old campaign gaffe where she described some of his supporters as ""deplorables.""""Maybe we take another crack at Crazy Hillary,"" Mr. Trump said. ""She was so easy.""And he broke up his re-election pitch with invective aimed at Representative Adam B. Schiff, the lead House impeachment manager, whom the president referred to as a ""sick puppy,"" and a diatribe against Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whom he accused of letting her district in San Francisco fall into decay.""We're having probably the best years we've ever had, and I just got impeached. Can you believe these people?"" Mr. Trump said. But he claimed it was still a ""happy period because we call it 'impeachment light.""'""This is not easy,"" he said, ""you got maniacs doing a number on you for three years.""Mr. Trump spoke as the Senate waited on Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and a close friend of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to announce his decision on whether to support hearing from witnesses during the impeachment trial. A couple of hours after Mr. Trump left the stage, Mr. Alexander said he was a ""no"" on hearing from more witnesses. His is a critical vote, and his decision will help determine whether Mr. Trump receives a swift acquittal as soon as Friday.Trump officials said the caucus on Monday, even if it was not competitive, would be an important milestone for a campaign that has essentially been going on since Mr. Trump's famous escalator ride in Trump Tower in 2015. ""This will be the first time his supporters are able to take part in the process that begins his re-election,"" said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman.Before the rally on Thursday night at Drake University, Mr. Trump made a brief stop in Warren, Mich., where he spoke to manufacturing workers the day after he signed the revised North American Free Trade Agreement into law.Mr. Trump's trade deals are a key part of his re-election message. But it was clear that the impeachment trial -- which Republican senators are hoping to wrap up quickly without hearing from additional witnesses like John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser -- was on his mind.""I've kept my promise, not only my promise of loving the people of Michigan, but my promise of taking care of it so other countries aren't ripping us off,"" Mr. Trump told the crowd gathered at Dana Inc., a major auto parts manufacturer of axles, transmissions and other key components in Warren, an industrial city north of Detroit. ""You remember the tax cut? It was the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, and what do they do? They impeach you. It's frankly a disgrace to our country.""The Trump campaign plans to follow up on the Des Moines rally with a blitz of appearances at caucus sites on Monday by roughly 80 cabinet secretaries, administration officials and members of Congress to generate enthusiasm among Iowa Republicans.Mr. Biden on Thursday spent significant time during campaign stops in Iowa marveling at the band of Trump surrogates and supporters planning to flood the state, suggesting it was proof Mr. Trump's campaign was running scared. ""I never saw another party have so much interest in, in a Democratic caucus,"" he said. ""I wonder why they're all coming. I wonder why they're here.""Mr. Trump already has deep support in Iowa, a state he won in 2016 by more than nine points. Jeff Kaufmann, the chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, has been a strong Trump supporter who has echoed the president's description of a Democratic Party defined by ""left-wing nuts."" Campaign officials have tried to reward Mr. Kaufmann's loyalty with presidential visits intended to motivate other state chairmen to follow suit.The president last held a campaign rally in Iowa in Council Bluffs in October 2018 as part of his push before the midterm elections. In June, he traveled to the state to speak at the Iowa Republican dinner on the same day that Mr. Biden was crisscrossing the state, giving voters a preview of what a general election matchup between the two would look like.Since then, however, Mr. Biden has slipped from his front-runner status in the state, where Mr. Sanders has emerged on top in a handful of polls. But Mr. Sanders as well Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Michael Bennet of Colorado spent the day in the Senate chamber.Steve Friess contributed reporting from Warren, Mich., and Katie Glueck from Des Moines.PhotographPresident Trump on Thursday at a rally in Des Moines.

| Jump to first hitJoe Biden lifted turnout and performed well among key demographic groups, signs that suggest the president may struggle to replicate his 2016 success in the crucial swing state.Joseph R. Biden Jr. didn't just win the Michigan primary this week. The turnout and demographic patterns of voters, from African-Americans in Detroit to affluent suburbanites to working-class white voters in rural areas, provided evidence of a broader Democratic coalition than the party mobilized in 2016, a powerful warning shot to the Trump campaign.In that last general election, Hillary Clinton struggled with white voters and independents, and underperformed with black voters compared with Barack Obama in 2012 and 2008. To the surprise of both political parties, Donald J. Trump carried the state by 10,700 votes, the first time a Republican had won Michigan in 28 years.What stands out about Mr. Biden's victory on Tuesday is that he performed well not only among his bedrock supporters, black voters, but also drew solid backing from other key demographic groups -- including college-educated white women, moderates and those over 45 -- in a primary that shattered Democratic turnout records by more than 30 percent.""The massive high turnout is very, very bad news in Michigan for the Trump campaign,"" said Richard Czuba, a nonpartisan pollster who has surveyed the state for more than three decades. ""Everybody is motivated to vote. And in a state like Michigan, when you have a record turnout coming -- and I think we do in November -- that is a huge benefit to the Democratic nominee. There just aren't enough Republicans in Michigan.""Because Michigan was the first Obama-to-Trump state to vote in the presidential primary, an erstwhile brick in what Democrats once complacently called their Blue Wall, both parties pounced on Tuesday's results for signposts pointing to November.The Trump campaign saw weaknesses for a Biden candidacy in the general election, specifically his problem appealing to voters under 45. ""The math works very well for the president,"" said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign.Independent analysts like Mr. Czuba, however, said that while it was true that motivation to vote was elevated for both parties, high turnout in Michigan historically favors Democrats.Mr. Trump's surprise victory in Michigan was his narrowest win in the three Rust Belt states he pried from Democrats in 2016, a group that also included Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Perhaps Democrats' best hope for winning the White House -- and Republicans' best line of defense -- is through these same states in the industrial Midwest.Polling and the 2018 midterm trends suggest Michigan is the most likely of the three to swing back to Democrats this year. If Mr. Biden becomes the nominee, he will probably be especially well positioned to appeal to black voters, to suburbanites abandoning the Republican Party and to enough rural white voters to nick the president's margins in what analysts call ""outstate"" Michigan.""With the perception of a moderate ticket, the Dems are going to turn the industrial Midwest back blue,"" said Greg McNeilly, a Republican consultant in Grand Rapids, who added that Mr. Biden's pick for running mate would be critically important to his chances in Michigan.In scores of rural counties on Tuesday, Mr. Biden beat Mr. Sanders by significantly larger totals than Mr. Sanders earned when he carried the same counties in the Democratic primary four years ago. The state's rural enclaves are dominated by white voters without college degrees, the most loyal members of the Trump base. Even if most of them stick with the president, small gains by Democrats could make a difference in a closely fought statewide election.""It suggests that Vice President Biden has a chance to stop the bleeding there,"" said Brandon Dillon, a former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party.Then there are the suburbs, the key to Democratic gains nationwide in 2018. Largely thanks to a swing by suburbanites in affluent Oakland County outside Detroit -- the boyhood home of the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, whose father was governor of Michigan -- Democrats rolled up large victories in 2018. They included the election of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and two congresswomen who flipped Republican seats, Haley Stevens and Elissa Slotkin.Turnout in the Democratic primary on Tuesday was up 40 percent in suburban counties, and 44 percent specifically in Oakland County, the second most populous county in the state after Detroit's Wayne County.""The districts that flipped from Republican to Democrat were largely located in large fast-growing suburban counties,"" said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. ""So Republicans are going to face the same challenge in 2020 that they faced in 2018 -- how to be competitive in those larger suburban counties that contain large numbers of college educated women.""Even if Republicans take a beating in Oakland County, just east of it is the state's third-most populous county, Macomb, with its storied place in election lore.Once a stronghold of blue-collar Democratic support, its voters became the original Reagan Democrats of the 1980s. Macomb County twice voted for Mr. Obama, but in 2016, as Mr. Trump skewered trade deals that he said hurt American manufacturing, Macomb swung dramatically again. Its working class and largely white residents preferred Mr. Trump by about 50,000 votes.Ronna McDaniel, the chair of the Republican National Committee and a Michigander, predicted Macomb County would be the keystone in a second Trump victory in the state.""Macomb is how we won Michigan,"" she told Fox News on Tuesday. ""Those Reagan Democrats became Trump Republicans and they have stayed with him since 2016. I'd say he's even grown support in Macomb.""She said the county's white working-class workers would be ""key to us winning Michigan again.""The county lies north of Detroit, where Mr. Biden got into a heated argument on Election Day with a hard-hatted worker at a Fiat Chrysler plant who accused him of trying to ""take away our guns.""On Tuesday, Mr. Biden pulled 66,000 votes out of Macomb County, surpassing Mr. Sanders's 44,000. Mr. Trump received 78,000 votes there in the Republican primary.Representative Andy Levin, the freshman Democrat who represents Macomb County, predicted it would return to the Democratic column in November.""Donald Trump now has a record, and his record is not growing good jobs in Macomb County,"" he said, pointing to Mr. Trump's opposition to raising the minimum wage and ""a mini recession in manufacturing"" in his district.Federal data shows that Michigan manufacturing jobs increased annually since the recession through 2018, but have since dipped. General Motors last year closed a transmission plant in Macomb County, affecting 260 employees.A former labor organizer, Mr. Levin predicted, ""You'll be back in Macomb writing the obituary for Donald Trump's presidency after Nov. 3.""That suggests a large-scale swing of Trump 2016 voters crossing over to the Democratic nominee. Given the loyalty of Mr. Trump's base, it may be unrealistic.But there is a second possibility, one suggested by Tuesday's record turnout: that Democrats who did not vote in 2016 will come off the sidelines for their party's nominee this year.Michael Taylor, the Republican mayor of one of Macomb County's largest cities, Sterling Heights, who voted for Mr. Trump, announced publicly days before the primary that he supported Mr. Biden.While he doubts that there are many Trump voters who will defect, Mr. Taylor sees another path.""What you could see, and what I think will probably happen, is that Joe Biden is going to attract some voters who sat out in 2016 because they didn't like their options,"" he said. ""And you're going to see a small percent who say, 'I voted for Trump last time but I don't think I can this time.' That's all it's going to take in a swing state like Michigan.""PhotographCelebrating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s win in Michigan. The primary shattered Democratic turnout records.

| Jump to first hitBernie Sanders had an advantage on Super Tuesday he will not see again: many early votes cast before moderates coalesced around one candidate.
Joe Biden not only reclaimed his status as a front-runner on Super Tuesday, but his victories also gave him a clear path to amassing enough delegates to clinch the nomination by the Democratic National Convention.
Bernie Sanders, the left wing’s champion, has dodged a knockout blow for now. While he has lost his lead in pledged delegates, he remains competitive in the delegate count, and he has probably stopped Mr. Biden well short of an overall majority of delegates awarded on Super Tuesday.
But an Upshot analysis suggests that the close delegate race might not last for long. If the race doesn’t take a decisive turn in favor of Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden is likely to build an insurmountable delegate lead over the next few weeks.
Mr. Biden largely swept the Eastern half of the country, where most of the delegates awarded after Super Tuesday are at stake. And in many states, Mr. Sanders was able to forestall greater defeats only because of the large number of early voters who cast their ballots before the South Carolina race, when the party’s moderate voters were still divided. He will no longer have that advantage.
Mr. Biden got an additional lift on Wednesday as his leading moderate rival, Mike Bloomberg, dropped out of the race. His departure could free additional moderate voters to join Mr. Biden, and it seems Mr. Bloomberg will be willing to use his considerable wealth to support him. Even in the unlikely event that his voters don’t break toward Mr. Biden, Mr. Bloomberg’s absence would allow Mr. Biden to claim even larger delegate majorities in the remaining Southern states. In Florida, for example, Mr. Bloomberg might have otherwise cleared the 15 percent threshold for earning delegates, at Mr. Biden’s expense.
Mr. Biden swept the South with expected, overwhelming support among African-American voters, who backed him by a margin of 56 percent to 19 percent across the Super Tuesday states, according to exit polls. His success among white voters was less expected and allowed him to extend his strength well beyond the South.
He ran even or ahead among white voters in every state east of the Mississippi River, except for Mr. Sanders’s home state of Vermont, according to the exit polls, and won decisive victories in the affluent suburbs around Boston, Washington and Minneapolis. He even carried much of the old, moderate rural vote that Mr. Sanders swept four years earlier.
Mr. Biden rapidly consolidated moderate-leaning voters in the days after his landslide victory in the South Carolina primary. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar left the race and endorsed him, with the result that he appeared to add nearly all their former supporters. His strength across the rural North and in affluent suburbs mirrored their strengths in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.
Mr. Biden also seemed to benefit from the high turnout in many states, particularly in many of the affluent, well-educated metropolitan areas where Democrats have gained in recent years but where Mr. Sanders has long struggled. Mr. Sanders, in contrast, did not benefit from a long-promised surge in youth turnout, and his core base of support was overwhelmed across most of the South and even the North, where relatively liberal white voters make up a larger share of the electorate.
Texas offered a different test. The state’s Democratic electorate is a mix of African-Americans and more conservative and affluent white voters who tend to back Mr. Biden, and younger, urban and Latino voters who tend to back Mr. Sanders. According to the exit polls, Mr. Sanders won Latinos by a margin of 50 percent to 24 percent across the Super Tuesday states, with a margin of 41 percent to 24 percent in Texas.
In an election night count that reflected the shift in the national political environment over the last week, Mr. Biden eventually overtook Mr. Sanders in the Texas returns, with a wide advantage among late-deciding voters who cast their ballots on Election Day. In a telling indication of how quickly moderate voters had coalesced behind Mr. Biden, the exit polls across the Super Tuesday states found that among voters who decided in just the last few days, Mr. Biden won by a margin of 48 percent to 21 percent.
In North Carolina, which separates out early and Election Day results, Mr. Biden won just 28 percent among early voters but 41 percent of the vote statewide after winning 52 percent among Election Day voters. Mr. Bloomberg saw his support collapse in the Election Day vote.
Mr. Sanders denied Mr. Biden a more sweeping victory with decisive wins of his own in the West, where Mr. Sanders can count on his strengths among Latinos, liberals and younger, urban voters without fully facing his weakness among African-American voters and conservative rural whites. The West also has the highest rate of early voting in the country, which helped blunt Mr. Biden’s surge.
Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar combined for 22 percent support in the exit poll in Colorado, where advance voters represented well over half of all voters — the largest share of the vote of any state on Tuesday. Their support was not recorded in the election night tabulation because they withdrew from the race, but they routinely breached 10 percent in early voting elsewhere in the country, including California.
The large early and absentee vote in some of the states most favorable to Mr. Sanders was enough to keep him close and competitive in the overall delegate count, despite 10 losses in 14 states. Over all, Mr. Biden holds only 45 percent of pledged delegates after Super Tuesday, according to preliminary Upshot estimates, while Mr. Sanders is expected to finish with around 39 percent. These tallies could change depending on the eventual result in California (which might not become official for weeks), but if they hold, Mr. Biden’s delegate lead would be far from irreversible. In fact, Mr. Sanders would need to defeat Mr. Biden by only three points in the remaining two-thirds of the country to overtake him.
A three-point deficit is not a daunting handicap, certainly not when Mr. Biden was polling 20 points lower just a few days ago. But the Super Tuesday results do not augur well for Mr. Sanders’s odds of pulling it off. He remained so competitive on Super Tuesday in part because of the large number of early and absentee voters who cast ballots before it became apparent that Mr. Biden was the viable moderate candidate.
The rest of the country may be even less favorable to Mr. Sanders. With Texas and California off the board, most of the remaining populous states lie in the East, where Mr. Sanders tended to lose, often badly. They also tend to have a below-average Latino share of the vote. It is hard to identify any state where Mr. Sanders would be obviously favored outside of the Northwest, if voters broke approximately as they did on Super Tuesday.
The states where Latino voters do represent roughly their average share of the electorate do not seem likely to be as favorable to Mr. Sanders as California or Texas. Arizona, New Mexico, New York and Florida allow only registered Democrats to vote, and therefore exclude a disproportionate number of young Hispanic voters — many of them registered as independents — who are likeliest to back Mr. Sanders. These closed primaries will exclude many young non-Latino voters as well, posing a broader challenge to Mr. Sanders that he did not overcome in 2016 and has not yet had to face in 2020.
Mr. Biden, in contrast, will continue to find many states in the next few weeks where black voters represent an average or above-average share of the population. He is all but assured to win commanding delegate majorities in Mississippi, Georgia and Florida. And there are many other states, including Missouri, Ohio and Michigan, where Mr. Biden would be the favorite if he could continue the pattern of his success with white voters in the East.
He needs around 54 percent of the remaining delegates to claim a majority heading into the Democratic nomination, and his path to accomplishing this might be as simple as repeating a Super Tuesday outcome under a more favorable set of states, without the burden of early votes cast before he emerged as the top rival to Mr. Sanders.
Mr. Sanders now needs around 57 percent of the remaining delegates to claim a majority. To pull it off, he would need to post decisive victories in states he would have almost certainly lost if they had voted on Super Tuesday. He would probably need the race to fundamentally change in the coming weeks, as it has before.

| Jump to first hitThe Biden campaign and a long list of surrogates are striving to engage progressive Democrats who have so far been cool to Mr. Biden's presidential bid.Through conversations on Capitol Hill, engagement with local activists and policy nods toward Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s campaign and its allies are ramping up overtures to progressives, aiming to improve Mr. Biden's standing with a key part of the Democratic coalition in an effort to unite the party around his potential nomination.Mr. Biden has assembled a broad base of support from black and suburban white voters as he has racked up a string of victories over the last month. But many younger and left-wing Democrats remain deeply skeptical of Mr. Biden, who continues to battle Mr. Sanders for the nomination, and some are strenuously resistant to his candidacy.Aware of the importance of Democratic unity after Hillary Clinton suffered from a divisive primary contest in 2016, and hopeful of extending his delegate lead after primary elections in three states on Tuesday, the Biden campaign and a long list of surrogates are striving to engage some of those Democrats who have so far rejected Mr. Biden's presidential bid.""We're going to go talk to them and we're going to reach out to them,"" said Representative Cedric L. Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana and one of the Biden campaign's national co-chairs. ""They can help chart their future. They don't have to be bystanders as other people do. It means going and talking to them, inviting them to the table. I will absolutely be involved. It's already started.""Mr. Richmond has spoken on a regular basis, including recently, with Representative Ro Khanna of California, a national co-chair of Mr. Sanders's campaign. Mr. Richmond has made it clear that ""he would make every effort to make sure that Biden's campaign was very inclusive"" if Mr. Biden becomes the Democratic nominee, Mr. Khanna said in an interview.Both Mr. Biden, 77, the former vice president, and Mr. Sanders, 78, the Vermont senator, have pledged to actively support whoever becomes the Democratic nominee, and they have a better personal relationship than Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders had during their contentious 2016 primary matchup. There is also little appetite among many voters for the kind of infighting that characterized earlier chapters of this cycle's primary contest, as the nation grapples with the coronavirus crisis.Against that backdrop, Mr. Biden's allies argue -- even as they have been careful not to pressure Mr. Sanders to drop out -- that it is time to unify more quickly around Mr. Biden's candidacy in order to focus fully on defeating President Trump, a view many Sanders supporters strongly reject. To that end, Mr. Biden has made overt public gestures to the left in recent days.On the debate stage on Sunday night, where he promised to select a female running mate if nominated, Mr. Biden also said that he had recently spoken to Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts senator. He has endorsed a proposal she offered during her campaign to overhaul the consumer bankruptcy system -- a striking policy shift because Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren had clashed over bankruptcy legislation more than a decade ago when he was a senator from Delaware and she was a Harvard law professor.Hours before the debate, his campaign also announced that he had decided to support making public colleges and universities tuition-free for many students, adopting a proposal that Mr. Sanders put forward a few years ago. While a nod to the left, Mr. Biden's move was hardly a display of progressive boldness: Mrs. Clinton offered a similar proposal in 2016 after her primary fight with Mr. Sanders, and the proposal Mr. Biden endorsed is more limited than what Mr. Sanders is advocating in the 2020 campaign.""For Vice President Biden it's about a lack of consistency,"" Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan and a Sanders supporter, said in a recent interview. Personal engagement has to be coupled with the embrace of bold policy, she said.Some activists say the personal outreach could be improved, too.""We've heard from them some but not nearly as much as we'd like to,"" said María Urbina, the national political director at Indivisible, a major grass-roots progressive organization. ""I think they've done a handful of outreach but there are some pretty substantive conversations we'd love to have.""Still, if he is the nominee, she said, ""We will do everything we can to get him elected.""Mr. Biden is undeniably more moderate than Mr. Sanders, who is a democratic socialist. But Mr. Biden's allies argue that the former vice president does embrace relatively bold policy -- if at a more incremental pace, and on a less sweeping scale, than Mr. Sanders does. Their focus now is on promoting some of those proposals, from gun control to combating climate change, and on learning more about what supporters of other current and former candidates need to hear from Mr. Biden.""No. 1 is making it clear that we have great respect for Senator Sanders and Senator Warren,"" said Mayor Darrell Steinberg of Sacramento, a Biden endorser. ""It is important we recognize and understand why young people, many young people, have been driven to that message.""Internally, the Biden campaign has staff working on outreach to students, young professionals and young elected officials. Many of those officials are then engaging in their own progressive outreach in their cities and states, sounding out local liberal activists, for example, or talking with their fellow elected leaders.Behind the scenes, a number of Mr. Biden's congressional allies have also been contacting officials who supported Ms. Warren in particular, both in Congress and around the country.""I've certainly been reaching out to a lot of the progressives"" who supported Ms. Warren, said Representative Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona, ""asking them to keep their minds and hearts open, and also just to see if they have any suggestions about policies or topics they want to see in the campaign.""Mr. Gallego has made overtures both to congressional colleagues and to progressive leaders in Arizona with an additional focus on Latino leaders. Mr. Sanders has shown strength with Latino voters in the primary, though he faced challenges with Cuban-Americans in particular in Florida.The goal, Mr. Gallego said, is ""having a more welcoming approach to, definitely, the Bernie camp.""Yet seeking to build relationships with elected officials is not the same thing as generating the kind of organic grass-roots support Mr. Sanders enjoys. And the limits of more explicit outreach to the Sanders campaign were on vivid display at the debate on Sunday night, as Mr. Sanders continued to wage his own vigorous primary battle.Some Biden officials and allies suggested that they were surprised when Mr. Sanders repeatedly ripped Mr. Biden's Senate record, even as both men avoided the kind of personal attacks that had defined matchups with other candidates. Allies of Mr. Sanders, however, said it was legitimate for Mr. Sanders to sharply contrast Mr. Biden's views with his own, while continuing to pitch liberal policies that he believes are vital to the nation's interests.Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, which endorsed Ms. Warren and is now supporting Mr. Sanders, said Mr. Biden's embrace of the bankruptcy overhaul and tuition-free college were steps in the right direction. But he suggested that Mr. Biden should more robustly address a number of other policy issues that are important to progressives, such as climate change and a wealth tax.""I think him signaling the fact that he is open to taking good ideas from progressives is a start,"" Mr. Mitchell said. ""But unless, for example, he adopts a real climate plan that actually is at the scale of the problem, I don't think he'll ever attract the young people who are fired up.""And there are many progressives who say that while they will support the eventual nominee, they do not feel the need to pick a side right now, even as the Biden campaign rushes to consolidate support.Representative Andy Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who supported Ms. Warren in the primary, said he was ""still in mourning"" over her exit from the race, though he praised Mr. Biden's embrace of her bankruptcy plan. He said that former Gov. James J. Blanchard of Michigan has been in touch, urging him to support Mr. Biden, but he is in no hurry.""I'm not sitting around waiting for Joe or somebody to call me,"" Mr. Levin said. ""If Joe Biden is the nominee, my job becomes to unify him and progressives, and at the same time try to pin him down to govern as progressively as possible because that's the way that progressives are going to authentically get excited about him.""Some of Mr. Biden's supporters are aware of the delicacy required in engaging Democrats who backed other candidates, and say that outreach to Sanders supporters in particular can only accelerate in earnest once the primary is effectively concluded.""The way to do it is to go right to the organizations that have supported the other candidates and to show them the respect that they deserve,"" Mr. Steinberg, the Sacramento mayor, said. ""Understand the underlying motivations and issues that drove the candidacies of their candidates, and connect and meet with them, and listen.""Astead W. Herndon contributed reporting.Astead W.

| Jump to first hitThe hot dish on how she decided to end her bid and what the future holds for female candidates.Hi. Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Lisa Lerer, your host.Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.A lot of candidates dropped out of the presidential race over the past week (including Elizabeth Warren today). We were able to grab a few minutes with one of them: Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.She's still working hard: Our phone call happened very late Wednesday night, after Ms. Klobuchar finished a television appearance.Here's what she had to say about her decision to leave the race, the lack of major female candidates still competing and the total weirdness of running for president. (Our conversation has been edited and condensed.)So, how's post-presidential-race life?MS. KLOBUCHAR It's good. I just told a story about waking up at 4 or 5 in the morning, and I go, ""What city am I in? What hotel is this that has all this light that's coming from the street?"" It was my own house.Is it nice to be back in your own house?Yeah, it is. And then, I'm going to go back tomorrow for that coronavirus vote. I'll be campaigning for Biden at some point. So that's good. I have a lot of energy. From the beginning to the end, as you know. And what a way to end in this joyful event in Dallas. I'm sure you saw it. It wasn't just a normal campaign thing. It was really exciting. The congressmen and then Beto coming. It was just a lot of fun. So that made it better.What's the first non-campaign thing you've done?I went to the supermarket. I got milk. I got my own yams that people would normally not know I want. That was good.What's the weirdest thing about running for president?What's funny is you're in this kind of ""Game of Thrones"" situation, but there were so many cordial moments between the candidates. Cory and I passing notes back and forth during one of the debates. So that was one of my funnier moments, when Andrew Yang had offered $1,000 to people from the campaign, and I wrote Cory a note that said: ""Booker. Do not try that. May be election violation.""How did you know it was time to end your campaign?Well, in South Carolina, you always hope -- you know you're not going to win, but you want to give it a try. And then I kept going around to all the states, and we had good crowds. I knew we had this growing support, but it wasn't going to grow fast enough. And the other thing I knew was that we had that rush of money coming in February, I think $19 million or something. But we didn't have time to really build the operations we needed as a campaign, so that was part of it.Then, the big overwhelming thing was I knew I was going to win my state.And I thought, ""Well, that would be good. Good way to end."" But then I thought, why would I just do that for myself? Maybe I can actually deliver this for Joe Biden knowing that he was at like 10 percent or 15. So I talked to my campaign manager on Sunday morning, and then I was in the church in Selma and I kept thinking that this is the right decision. Then I called my husband, who wasn't crazy about it. He wanted to keep going.His answer was, ""I just got a lobster fisherman in Maine to support you. I talked to him a really long time, and now I feel really bad.""It's like, ""OK. Well, so we can call him."" My husband had worked so hard. So that was hard.Did you know that Pete Buttigieg was also going to endorse Mr. Biden?I didn't know when we called them [the Biden campaign], no. I figured he wasn't going to because he had withdrawn the day before. I texted him and he had called me back. And not about Biden, just about him getting out of the race. And I wrote him a nice note and he wrote something back and then we agreed to talk the next day, which we did.So do you feel like you won Minnesota, in the end?I think I was a big help, yes. Joe Biden won Minnesota. But one of the more interesting things is when you look at the counties on the edges that don't always get TV from Minnesota. They get Canadian or North Dakota or South Dakota. Those were the ones that I still won. Maybe they went to vote in the morning without knowing [I had dropped out of the race].Did you discuss any positions with Mr. Biden or anything like that should he win the White House?I knew every position he had, every single one of them. We did 10 debates. He was on the stage for ----No, no, I mean, positions in a possible future administration.Oh, you can see we didn't because I didn't even know what you were talking about. No, we did not. No, not at all. I wouldn't even have thought of doing that. I was endorsing him to help him. And it didn't even cross my mind to try to make some deal or anything like that.This is the first time we've ever had multiple women running for president. What do you think you learned from that experience about running for president while female?First of all, I was so proud of all of us. They ended up not choosing the women but that doesn't mean the women are going to go away. [Tulsi Gabbard is still running.]We all have very powerful jobs. We all have ambitions ourselves and there's a lot of other women coming up to the pipeline as well. So I just view it as, it was a process, these were the two that came out of it for various reasons. I mean, let's start with the obvious, Biden and Bernie had run for president before. And they were the most well known. I'm not saying that they weren't deserving of this, but those were the facts.So, I just don't see it as an indictment of women candidates. I have often stepped back and wondered, well, is it -- were they looking for a man to run against Donald Trump? Maybe in another election. I don't know.Do you think you'll see a female president in your lifetime?Of course we will. It's not even a close call.Do you think it'll be you?I don't know. [Laughs.]Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We'll try to answer it. Have a comment? We're all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com .From Opinion: Behind the horse raceEach week, our colleagues from The New York Times's Opinion section share expert analysis and perspectives from across the political spectrum.Horse race political coverage is a derogatory term. Candidates dismiss it, as a means of showing they're paying more attention to voters' needs than the latest polls (usually when they're down in them). Media critics often disingenuously ignore reporting on policy and governance yet pine for more of it as if it isn't there.Yet, like actual horse races, political ones change a lot. And covering the candidates who have fallen behind or burst ahead, and then taking time to ask why, is an important way of keeping up with what voters think -- and can lead to insights about bigger issues.That's been the focus of most of the pieces here in Opinion after Super Tuesday. In his newsletter on Wednesday (sign up here), Frank Bruni took stock of Joe Biden's big victories and reassessed his own priors: ""He was too unsteady. Too old. Too yesterday. How could someone so oriented toward the past sufficiently inspire Americans who were looking to the future? Well, Biden inspired or at least appealed to enough voters yesterday to stage one of the most extraordinary political comebacks I've ever witnessed.""And with Elizabeth Warren dropping out, Michelle Cottle's column ""Maybe Next Time, Ladies,"" diagnosed the reasons ""the most diverse presidential field in history"" is down to ""two straight white septuagenarian men fighting over the soul of the party -- whatever that turns out to be.""""It says something depressing about the challenges women candidates still confront in their quest to shatter the presidential glass ceiling,"" Ms. Cottle wrote.-- Talmon Joseph Smith...

| Jump to first hitElizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are longtime allies on the left. But her pool of voters generally doesn't look like his base.Welcome to Poll Watch , our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election .Throughout the 2020 presidential race, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have seemed like reluctant foes.They met with each other before starting their campaigns. They had each other's backs at the debates, until they didn't. Most important, they agreed on how to confront the issues -- boldly and structurally -- if not always on the exact details.But Ms. Warren's pool of voters, who are casting for an alternative after she dropped out of the Democratic race on Thursday, generally doesn't look like Mr. Sanders's base. There is reason to believe that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. could pick up nearly as many of Ms. Warren's former voters as Mr. Sanders does.""Obviously the more strong liberal policy folks should break more for Sanders than Biden,"" Paul Maslin, a longtime Democratic pollster, said in an interview. ""But I don't know that it's going to be anywhere near unanimous. If Biden is over the hump and is now clearly the accepted candidate as the best to beat Trump, and there's a coalescing of the party around that view, he's going to gain all kinds of support.""There is certainly significant overlap between the core support of Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, the party's two leading liberals. He is particularly well positioned to usurp the kinds of older millennials and Generation X liberals who often favored Ms. Warren.Indeed, in a Quinnipiac poll conducted early last month, when Mr. Biden was reeling from a weak performance in the Iowa caucuses, Ms. Warren's voters were four times as likely to name Mr. Sanders as their second choice as they were to pick Mr. Biden.Even still, only a third of her supporters in that poll pointed to Mr. Sanders as a runner-up. That equals out to less than 5 percent of the Democratic electorate. Besides, a lot has happened in the past month; most other candidates have disappeared from the race, and much of the party has united behind Mr. Biden.Most troublingly for Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren's support profile has roughly as much overlap with Mr. Biden's as it does with his.Ms. Warren's base is heavily tilted toward college graduates, women, white people and middle-to-high-earners. It's not as if Mr. Sanders has been unable to win votes in these demographics. For instance, his backers on Super Tuesday were just as likely to be women as to be men.But there is a working-class tilt to Mr. Sanders's support that does not play out with Ms. Warren's. He is diminishingly popular as you go up the income scale, whereas the opposite is true of Ms. Warren.If the average Warren voter is an upper-middle-class white woman, Mr. Sanders is in a tough spot: He has serious vulnerabilities among this group. In Massachusetts -- where Mr. Sanders beat Ms. Warren in her home state by five percentage points -- he won just one-fifth of white women with college degrees, making this his weakest such age-education-gender group. Ultimately he lost the state to Mr. Biden by seven points.""For most suburban or upper-middle-class white women, Joe Biden is a pretty comfortable place to land,"" Mr. Maslin said.""There's the Obama connection, there's a sense of stability and experience that's probably pretty helpful, and then to the extent that they're being pragmatic, they probably see him as a potentially stronger candidate against Trump,"" he added, though he noted that polling did not suggest that either Mr. Biden or Mr. Sanders was significantly better positioned for the general election.The good news for Mr. Sanders is that Ms. Warren's backers are highly likely to identify as liberals -- even more so than his own -- and exit polls suggest that the two candidates' voters tend to agree on the issues.The bad news for him is that his remaining rival, Mr. Biden, has already shown an ability to win over a solid chunk of liberal voters. In Super Tuesday states with available data, 40 to 60 percent of Biden voters identified as liberals.But the moderate former vice president isn't an ideal choice for Ms. Warren's voters, either. He has not articulated policy goals nearly as far-reaching or precise as Ms. Warren did. Many of her higher-educated, technocratic-minded voters may struggle to find either candidate convincing.Ultimately, Ms. Warren's voters are likely to wash out, unless she makes a big endorsement that effectively pushes them one way or the other. And even in that case, it can be hard for candidates to break through with certain demographics that have proved stubbornly averse to them.The fundamental problems for Mr. Sanders as he looks to stall Mr. Biden's momentum are that he cannot seem to break through with black voters or older voters, in spite of his increasingly targeted appeals to African-Americans and his campaign's focus on his lifelong attempts to preserve Social Security. Ms. Warren's base -- heavily white, and light on voters over 65 -- doesn't have much to offer him on those fronts.PhotographSenator Elizabeth Warren's supporters skew liberal, as do Senator Bernie Sanders's.

| Jump to first hitIn a swift turn of events, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar quit the presidential race and endorsed Mr. Biden on the eve of Super Tuesday to try to boost him against the liberal front-runner, Mr. Sanders.DALLAS -- In a last-minute bid to unite the moderate wing of the Democratic Party, Senator Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg on Monday threw their support behind a presidential campaign rival, Joseph R. Biden Jr., giving him an extraordinary boost ahead of the Super Tuesday primaries that promised to test his strength against the liberal front-runner, Senator Bernie Sanders.Even by the standards of the tumultuous 2020 campaign, the dual endorsement from Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg -- and their joint appearances with Mr. Biden at campaign events in Dallas on Monday night -- was remarkable. Rarely, if ever, have opponents joined forces so dramatically, as Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg went from campaigning at full tilt in the South Carolina primary on Saturday to joining on a political rescue mission for a former competitor, Mr. Biden, whom they had once regarded as a spent force.Ms. Klobuchar, who sought to appeal to the same moderate voters as Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, and focused her campaign on calling the Democratic Party's attention to Midwestern states like her native Minnesota, withdrew from the race on Monday afternoon after intensive conversations with her aides following Mr. Biden's thumping victory in South Carolina.Rather than delivering a traditional concession speech, Ms. Klobuchar told associates she wanted to leverage her exit to help Mr. Biden and headed directly for the joint rally. Before a roaring crowd in Dallas, she hailed her former rival as a candidate who could ""bring our country together"" and restore ""decency and dignity"" to the presidency.Mr. Buttigieg, for his part, endorsed Mr. Biden at a pre-rally stop on Monday evening; he said Mr. Biden would ""restore the soul"" of the nation as president. And Mr. Biden offered Mr. Buttigieg the highest compliment in his personal vocabulary, several times likening the young politician to his own son, Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015.For the three moderates, as well as for Mr. Sanders and other remaining candidates, the crucial question hanging over the fast-moving events was whether any of it would make a difference in Tuesday's primaries across 15 states and territories, including the critical battlegrounds of California and Texas.Millions of voters are expected to go to the polls, but many states have had early voting underway; more than 2.3 million Democratic and independent ballots have already been processed in California.Mr. Sanders has significant head starts in many of the Super Tuesday states and beyond: His popularity has risen in recent weeks, and so has Democratic voters' estimation of his electability in a race with President Trump. The Vermont senator has a muscular national grass-roots organization, backed by the most fearsome online fund-raising machine in Democratic politics -- one that collected more than $46 million last month, far outdistancing every other candidate in the race.Mr. Sanders signaled on Monday that he was ready for a fight against Mr. Biden, and perhaps a long one, if neither man can achieve a decisive early advantage in a nomination fight that still includes Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City. Mr. Sanders's advisers have long believed that he would have an advantage in a two-person contest against Mr. Biden, because of the strength of Mr. Sanders's economic platform and message of shaking up the political system.And Mr. Sanders's supporters are unlikely to be impressed by movement toward Mr. Biden among traditional Democratic power brokers, whom many Sanders voters already regard as having colluded in an unseemly way to block his candidacy in 2016. There is some risk to party leaders that anything perceived as a conspiracy against Mr. Sanders could anger his base and deepen existing fissures on the left.As news emerged of the shift of centrist support toward Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders projected confidence and defiance, dismissing it as a phenomenon of ""establishment politicians"" supporting one another. On Twitter, Mr. Sanders posted a video criticizing Mr. Biden for having supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq, linking him to unpopular Republicans like former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney. And on CNN on Monday night, he assailed Mr. Biden's record on the Iraq war and Social Security.""It is no surprise they do not want me to become president,"" Mr. Sanders said, referring to his moderate opponents.That Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg decided to align against Mr. Sanders reflected their assessments of him as a general-election candidate: Both have warned he could lose to Mr. Trump, skeptical that his liberal policy agenda would win him broad support in battleground regions like their Midwestern base.But the one-two punch also involved their own political interests, since leaving the race spared Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar the possibility of a wilting finish on Tuesday.Ms. Klobuchar's exit came a day after Mr. Buttigieg's, though he did not immediately issue an endorsement as she did. Both candidates made their biggest mark in Iowa and New Hampshire, but faltered in larger and more diverse states.It was no coincidence that the two bitter foes endorsed Mr. Biden at separate events. After Ms. Klobuchar announced that she would join the former vice president at his rally, Mr. Buttigieg's advisers pushed to set up a separate event with him and Mr. Biden, according to a Democratic official familiar with the planning. Mr. Biden's campaign and Mr. Buttigieg's remaining aides then scrambled to schedule the earlier, more informal joint appearance with just the former mayor and Mr. Biden.Ms. Klobuchar spoke briefly on Sunday with Mr. Biden at the commemoration of the civil rights march in Selma, Ala., but they did not discuss the possibility that she would end her campaign, a person briefed on the conversation said. And Ms. Klobuchar made her final decision on Monday morning without speaking again with Mr. Biden.At the Dallas rally, Ms. Klobuchar urged Democrats to close ranks now behind a candidate -- Mr. Biden -- who could win over independent voters and deliver a large victory in the November election.""If we spend the next four months dividing our party and going at each other, we will spend the next four years watching Donald Trump tear apart this country,"" Ms. Klobuchar said, embracing Mr. Biden before declaring, ""We want to win big, and Joe Biden can do that.""Mr. Biden interrupted only once, in a playful moment that illustrated their new alliance: When Ms. Klobuchar referred to the many Democratic debates, the former vice president leaned over to interject, ""All of which you won."" Ms. Klobuchar beamed.At the end of his own remarks in Dallas, Mr. Biden introduced another surprise guest, Beto O'Rourke, the former presidential candidate. Bounding to the stage, Mr. O'Rourke delivered an energetic endorsement.It is not uncommon for former presidential rivals to endorse each other later in an election season: The vanquished John Edwards helped Barack Obama conquer Hillary Clinton in 2008, for instance, and in the 2016 Republican primaries, Donald J. Trump earned a crucial seal of approval from an adversary he had handily trounced, Chris Christie.In that 2016 race, some Republican leaders wanted other candidates to drop out early and unite behind one stop-Trump contender; that never happened, as Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, Gov. John Kasich of Ohio and Ben Carson all competed on Super Tuesday that year against Mr. Trump, who came out ahead in states and delegates.Together, the moves by Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg -- who nursed their own bitter rivalry for much of the primary campaign -- amounted to an urgent and perhaps desperate effort to strengthen Mr. Biden in the first nationalized day of voting in the Democratic nomination contest. Super Tuesday includes the largest states in the country, California and Texas, and a number of important general-election swing states, including Virginia, North Carolina and Ms. Klobuchar's own Minnesota.Mr. Biden is trying to turn a wave of sudden momentum, achieved in South Carolina, into a wider breakthrough in the Democratic race, having slumped badly over the last few months after embarrassing setbacks in the first three primary and caucus states. Even with his former opponents' energetic help, Mr. Biden is by no means certain to run strong enough on Tuesday to slow Mr. Sanders's ascent or narrow the race to a one-on-one contest.Ari Rabin-Havt, Mr. Sanders's deputy campaign manager, told reporters on Monday that the campaign was untroubled by the recent developments and that it did not intend to change its strategy. The campaign announced over the weekend that it was starting a new wave of advertising in states that vote on Super Tuesday or later, including big battlegrounds like Florida, Michigan and Arizona.""Watching the campaign, watching the 10 debates unfold, we believe they have constantly shown that Bernie is the strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump, and that's still the case,"" Mr. Rabin-Havt said. ""And we think we still are in a very strong position heading into Super Tuesday.""There were a few signs of frustration from Mr. Sanders's camp, most significantly when Harry Reid, the former Senate majority leader from Nevada, issued an endorsement of Mr. Biden. The announcement prompted a tart reaction from Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager and a former aide to Mr. Reid, who tweeted that it was ""disappointing.""""I'll forever have respect and love for Senator Reid,"" Mr. Shakir said. ""But I'm old enough to remember when he thought Biden's ideas were worthy of being put in a fireplace.""Democratic officials say that Mr. Reid has been helpful in rallying support behind Mr. Biden, and has quietly talked to a handful of the now-former candidates. In a telephone interview Monday night, Mr. Reid acknowledged speaking with Ms. Klobuchar earlier in the day, before she dropped out. And while he insisted she was already planning to withdraw from the race when they talked, Mr. Reid acknowledged he has been working behind the scenes.""I do my best,"" he said. ""We need less confusion about who we're all for.""So far, Mr. Sanders has made few concessions, or even gestures of conciliation, toward the Democratic Party establishment he is aiming to displace, and if Mr. Biden does manage to slow or halt his ascent on Tuesday, it could be seen in part as a function of just how little Mr. Sanders has done to assuage moderates' anxiety about his campaign.Mr. Sanders forcibly went after Mr. Biden at a rally in St. Paul, Minn., on Monday night, vigorously attacking him for his record on trade, the Iraq war, Social Security and bankruptcy.""He's just wrong on the issues,"" Mr. Sanders said, even as he tried to quiet boos from the crowd. ""He's just wrong with regard to his vision for the future.""Mr. Sanders reserved his most pointed attack for Mr. Biden's record on trade, an issue that is especially resonant in the Midwest.""Does anybody think that Joe can go to Michigan or Wisconsin or Indiana or Minnesota, and say 'Vote for me, I voted for those terrible trade agreements'?"" Mr. Sanders said. ""I don't think so.""After a triumphant win in the Nevada caucuses late last month, Mr. Sanders delivered a victory speech in Texas that sounded like a plea for unity. But he then spent much of the next week defending his own provocative pronouncements, including his past praise for the Cuban government, and making a doomed attempt to undercut Mr. Biden in his stronghold of South Carolina.And he spent valuable time campaigning in Ms. Warren's Massachusetts and Ms. Klobuchar's Minnesota to try to beat them on their home turf -- a gamble that could have unpredictable consequences, given Ms. Klobuchar's decision to leave the race.Ms. Warren has shown no sign of yielding to Mr. Sanders, and on Monday she collected an endorsement from Emily's List, the national Democratic women's group. Her campaign has laid out a plan to amass delegates, state by state, until the nomination is decided at a contested convention -- a risky strategy, and one that could significantly complicate Mr. Sanders's hopes of building a rock-solid coalition of support on the left.Over the weekend, Ms. Klobuchar's political allies were split about whether she should press on, with some arguing that she should compete through Tuesday because she would probably carry Minnesota and deny Mr. Sanders the opportunity to harvest a large number of delegates there. In her own internal polling, Ms. Klobuchar held a 13-point lead over Mr. Sanders, who was in second place with a narrow lead over Mr. Biden, according to a copy of the poll reviewed by The Times.But after Mr. Biden bested Mr. Sanders in South Carolina by nearly 29 percentage points -- and outdistancing Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg by an even more towering margin -- Ms. Klobuchar began to deliberate with her advisers about whether it made sense to continue in the race even until March 3, according to people familiar with the conversations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The decision caught some of her staff by surprise, coming even as members of her team were in the process of buying airtime for future television ads. At a Salt Lake City rally on Monday morning, Ms. Klobuchar betrayed no indication that she was about to end her candidacy.With her abrupt withdrawal, Ms. Klobuchar believes there is at least some chance that Minnesota could tip toward Mr. Biden. On a phone call with her staff, she said she was proud of having run a ""happy, happy campaign.""Ms. Klobuchar said on the call that she had to consider ""what is best for our country right now,"" explaining that had led her to support Mr. Biden.Katie Glueck contributed reporting from Dallas, and Sydney Ember from Salt Lake City and St. Paul, Minn.PhotographSenator Amy Klobuchar with Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitThe Democratic candidates are all debating a singular issue. New polls offer insights, not answers.Hi. Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Giovanni Russonello, your morning newsletter writer taking over your afternoon edition.Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.At Wednesday night's Democratic presidential debate, the candidates bickered and battled over health care policy; over Michael Bloomberg's record and his right to represent a party that he only recently rejoined; over the possible dangers of nominating a democratic socialist.But in a way, it all seemed like just window dressing around one big question: Who has the best chance in November? Every policy critique seemed to lead inexorably back to this issue of electability.In his very first comments at the debate, Mr. Bloomberg didn't just criticize Senator Bernie Sanders's plan to create a single-payer health care system -- he said it would cause Democrats to lose the general election.""I don't think there's any chance of the senator beating President Trump,"" Mr. Bloomberg said. ""You don't start out by saying I've got 160 million people, I'm going to take away the insurance plan that they love.""Mr. Sanders shot back, arguing that Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, was ""a billionaire saying that we should not raise the minimum wage or that we should cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.""""If that's a way to beat Donald Trump, wow, I would be very surprised,"" Mr. Sanders said.A wide majority of Democratic primary voters have said in poll after poll that they care about finding someone who can win the general election more than finding a candidate who agrees with them on the issues.But who is that candidate? It's far from clear.Until recently, Democratic voters tended to see former Vice President Joe Biden as the strongest option. But after he failed to place in the top three in either Iowa or New Hampshire, he lost any veneer of invincibility. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday showed that for the first time in the race, Democrats are most likely to name Mr. Sanders as the candidate with the best chance to beat Mr. Trump.Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's approval rating has risen, most likely lifted by the strength of the economy and his acquittal in the Senate's impeachment trial. His Gallup approval rating hit 49 percent this month -- the highest number of his presidency. So while a majority of Americans still disapprove of him, he has the potential to win at least as much support as he did in 2016, when he lost the popular vote but pulled off a decisive win in the Electoral College.The ABC/Washington Post poll showed that in head-to-head matchups with all six of the candidates onstage at the debate, Mr. Trump would earn between 45 and 47 percent of the vote nationwide. The Democrats' shares varied from 49 to 52 percent. The differences between each Democrat were all within the poll's margin of error.This suggests that, despite Mr. Sanders's claim that a ""political revolution"" would be needed to drive turnout, and in spite of his more moderate rivals' argument that his left-wing proposals would alienate a huge swath of voters, any Democratic nominee would probably have a good chance of winning the popular vote.But Republicans have won the Electoral College three times this century, even though they have won the popular vote only once. So what really matters is who can beat Mr. Trump in a handful of key swing states.That's why Quinnipiac University asked voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- three states that Mr. Trump narrowly flipped in 2016, giving him an Electoral College win -- to choose between the president and each of the six leading Democratic candidates.The data from those polls suggests that Mr. Trump is in a very strong position to win Wisconsin, a heavily white state that was once solidly blue but has trended conservative over the past 10 years. None of the six leading Democratic candidates finished ahead of Mr. Trump there.Conversely, in Michigan and Pennsylvania, he didn't have a lead against any of them. Mr. Biden beat Mr. Trump by eight percentage points in Pennsylvania -- where he was born -- and by four points in Michigan. Mr. Sanders was up by five points against the president in Michigan, and by four points in Pennsylvania. Mr. Bloomberg led Mr. Trump by six points in Pennsylvania, and by five points in Michigan.The other three candidates included in the poll -- Senator Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Senator Elizabeth Warren -- generally fared a little less strongly, though Ms. Klobuchar had a strong, seven-point lead over Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania, and none of them were behind him there or in Michigan.A University of North Florida poll released this week found meaningful differences between the candidates' chances in that state. Mr. Bloomberg beat Mr. Trump by six points among registered Florida voters, thanks in part to the strength of his support among voters with college degrees, according to the poll. Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, both hobbled by relatively weak support from black and Latino voters, each finished four points behind the president.Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden both ran neck-and-neck with Mr. Trump.Like all surveys, head-to-head polls are not actually able to predict the future. They simply show what might happen if the election were held today. A lot will change over the course of the campaign.Still, what happens in these bellwether states will determine the election -- so you can expect these kinds of head-to-head polls to be more common as the primary season rambles on, and as Democrats continue to fret over their chances to take down Mr. Trump.Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We'll try to answer it. Have a comment? We're all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com .From Opinion: The trickiness of electabilityIn this new weekly feature, our colleagues from The New York Times's Opinion section will share expert analysis and perspectives from across the political spectrum. In today's installment, there's more to read about why electability is so unpredictable.There is a home base that all the conversation about the Democratic presidential primary comes back to in the end: Primary voters prioritize, above all, someone who can defeat President Trump.In any election that features an incumbent president, the main goal of the out-of-power party is to nominate a candidate well-suited to defeating the incumbent. That's why both Republican Party elites and less enthusiastic conservative voters got behind Mitt Romney after a series of polls in 2011 showed he was the only Republican beating President Barack Obama in head-to-head matchups.This year, Democrats' desire to replace the incumbent has reached a fever pitch, arguably higher than it's ever been for either party. But paradigm-shifting presidents have complicated the idea of electability, as Adam Jentleson, a former deputy chief of staff for Senator Harry Reid, pointed out this week in an Op-Ed.Mr. Obama won his first election despite being a ""black man who had admitted to using cocaine, who was caught on tape calling working-class whites 'bitter' people who 'cling to guns and religion,' and who sat in the pews with a pastor who declared, 'God damn America',"" Mr. Jentleson said.Mr. Romney, the Republicans' supposed safe bet, lost despite running against the sluggish economy under Mr. Obama.And Hillary Clinton, another supposed safe bet, lost to Donald J. Trump.So does anyone know what electability even means anymore? Our columnist Bret Stephens believes that ""of course Bernie can win,"" but also thinks that the current front-runner's democratic socialist vision may be disqualifying for many voters: ""For some of us, none-of-the-above is a viable option. For far too many others,"" he writes, Trump will ""be the devil they know.""-- Talmon Joseph SmithThanks for reading.

| Jump to first hitAs many as 12 states may hold primaries on June 2, which now carries the biggest delegate haul since Super Tuesday. That could change how the rest of the Democratic race plays out.Think of it as Super Postponed Day.June 2 had been an afterthought on the Democratic primary calendar. Ever since Joseph R. Biden Jr. seized the mantle of front-runner, voters in New Jersey and a few other states scheduled to vote that day assumed the Democratic horse race would be over before their primaries rolled around.But with numerous states pushing back voting to June 2 because of the coronavirus pandemic, the date has gained sudden prominence. It now confers a huge bounty of delegates, second only to Super Tuesday in early March, with Indiana, Pennsylvania and others moving to hold their primaries on the first Tuesday in June.Although Mr. Biden has built an all but insurmountable lead, June 2 -- which is a long 10 weeks away -- will be his first chance to clinch the presidential nomination. Only then would the former vice president have a definitive reason to press for the withdrawal of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has shown no inclination to leave a race that feels frozen in place.Some Democratic strategists see possible perils in the delay. Having to wait until June 2 for the next major chapter in the nominating race largely deprives Mr. Biden of a chance to rack up interim victories that would bring media attention; President Trump, meanwhile, is promoting his leadership in a global pandemic. A Monmouth University Poll on Tuesday showed Mr. Biden with a three-point lead over Mr. Trump among registered voters nationally, 48 percent to 45 percent, an edge the pollsters called ""negligible.""As the Democratic nominee-in-waiting, Mr. Biden may simply have to wait longer.""This idea apparently being floated by the Sanders campaign that Bernie can stay in the race and accumulate delegates without harming Biden's chances of winning in November is delusional,"" said J.J. Balaban, a Democratic strategist in Pennsylvania. The lengthy pause in the primary and Mr. Sanders's reluctance to step aside are distractions, Mr. Balaban said, from the need for Democrats to refocus on the general election race, in which Mr. Trump has a head start raising money and coalescing supporters.Michael Soliman, a Democratic strategist in New Jersey, said the delay might not be all bad if it concentrates the minds of voters on the need for change in the White House. ""As this crisis causes more states to push back their primaries, New Jersey voters will not only be reminded about the need for strong and steady leadership, but they will finally be in a position to play a meaningful role in securing the nomination for Joe Biden,"" he said.On Tuesday, Delaware became the latest state to move its primary, originally scheduled for April 28, to June 2, under an executive order by Gov. John Carney. Pennsylvania's Legislature passed a bill on Wednesday to likewise reschedule the state's primary from April 28 to June 2, which Gov. Tom Wolf is expected to sign by the end of the week.Delaware and Pennsylvania would bring to six the number of states to move primaries to June 2, including Connecticut, Indiana, Maryland and Rhode Island. The newcomers join the five primaries originally scheduled that day: New Jersey, Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota and the District of Columbia. (Inevitably, the date seems destined to be stamped the ""Acela Primary"" for its new regional tilt.)Ohio, which canceled its primary scheduled for March 17 because of the coronavirus, also has its sights on June 2. The date is one week before the June 9 deadline that the Democratic National Committee has set for states to hold primaries.Election officials in New York, which is emerging as a hot spot of infections, are considering delaying their presidential primary from April 28 to June 23. A group representing New York's election commissioners on Tuesday called for the primary to be moved to June 23, the date of another statewide vote, and to allow all voters to request absentee ballots. As the D.N.C. rules currently stand, New York could forfeit some delegates at the national convention for voting so late.In all, 822 pledged delegates would be at stake on June 2 if all the states eyeing that date follow through. The D.N.C. has said a candidate needs 1,991 to clinch the nomination.Mr. Biden currently leads, with 1,214 pledged delegates to Mr. Sanders's 910. The delegate math has become nearly prohibitive for Mr. Sanders; to overtake Mr. Biden, he would need to win the remaining states by about 20 percentage points.Few of the remaining states on the map feature the voting blocs, chiefly large numbers of Hispanics, where Mr. Sanders has done well. He has lost in a series of states where he was thought to have the advantage, notably Michigan, Minnesota and Texas.With the coronavirus outbreak, the Vermont senator has turned away almost entirely from conventional campaigning, instead converting his campaign apparatus to rally his liberal supporters around fighting for his vision of health care during the emergency. On Tuesday night he streamed a ""coronavirus town hall"" featuring health experts, a musical guest and Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, a chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.Four years ago, Mr. Sanders never formally dropped out of the primary race even after Hillary Clinton became the presumptive nominee on June 7. (Mr. Sanders endorsed Mrs. Clinton a month later, just before the national convention.)Mr. Biden has struggled to adapt to the new political landscape in which there are no more scheduled debates or live rallies, and Mr. Trump has seized the national spotlight with daily briefings from the White House. A Biden appearance from his Delaware basement on Monday, in which he criticized Mr. Trump for not acting like the ""wartime president"" he claims to be, was not picked up in real time by any of the major cable news channels.Mr. Biden appeared again from his new home studio in a round of television news interviews on Tuesday. On MSNBC, he said that he opposed calling off any elections; on CNN, he said that he was ""staying in place, not gathering at events"" and that anyone who enters his home, Secret Service agents included, wears masks and gloves.He was asked about Mr. Sanders's ""ramping up"" for primaries in New York and elsewhere.""I think that's his decision,"" Mr. Biden said.PhotographDejuane Miller and other Ohioans voted early in Dayton last week before the primary was shelved.

| Jump to first hitHe has such a thorough hold on the party now that any collapse would probably require a political U-turn as sharp as the one that precipitated his rise.The state of our union is unsettled, chaotic, impossible to pin down. The state of the Democratic primary, improbably, is not.With a string of commanding victories on Tuesday -- Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, probably any other ""M"" state that might have bothered with a primary this week -- Joe Biden appears poised to complete one of the most striking turnarounds in recent campaign memory, finding himself in a dominant position only 10 days after the first state victory of his three presidential runs. His remarkable reversal has banished Senator Bernie Sanders to a familiar electoral perch: an insurgent progressive long shot straining to catch an establishment favorite.The former vice president has won in the South, in the Northeast, in the Midwest. He has won large states and small ones. He has won in places where his strength with African-Americans could carry him and in others where such residents are fewer and far between.So thorough is Mr. Biden's hold on the party now that any collapse would probably require a political U-turn as sharp as the one that precipitated his rise. And as 2020 lurches into a logistically uncertain phase, with rallies canceled over coronavirus fears and voters more likely to privilege steady leadership, Mr. Biden is consistently and significantly outpacing Mr. Sanders on the crucial measure of whom to trust in a crisis, according to exit polls.Next week's contests include states where Mr. Biden is expected to perform well again. In Florida, the largest prize on the map until late April, his appeal to older voters and moderates, coupled with Mr. Sanders's struggles with Cuban-Americans, has Mr. Biden primed for the kind of delegate haul that can only come with a true blowout. A week later, on March 24, the race moves to Georgia, where a large black population is expected to help deliver Mr. Biden another rout.Unlike 2016, when Mr. Sanders extended his race against Hillary Clinton with a series of victories in caucuses, a format in which he has excelled, this year's calendar has many more traditional primaries, supplying fewer chances for Mr. Sanders to drive up margins and keep the delegate tally close.The result -- implausible as it seemed last month, when Mr. Biden faltered so badly in Iowa and New Hampshire that establishment Democrats indulged fantasies about a contested convention to stop Mr. Sanders -- is a race that could be nearing its functional end.It is difficult to overstate the whiplash. The last time Mr. Biden ditched one of his own election night parties, he was careening toward a fifth-place finish in New Hampshire in mid-February, skipping out on a Nashua gathering to seek refuge in South Carolina and accept his election-night fate from a safe distance.On Tuesday, he again pulled out of an event -- but this time, out of concerns that his crowd in Cleveland could be exposed to health risks amid the coronavirus scare. Mr. Biden headed instead to Philadelphia, the site of his campaign headquarters, where at the National Constitution Center he sought to project resolve in a time of national anxiety.With his wife, Jill Biden, by his side, Mr. Biden appeared to describe the race as he sees it now: effectively over on the Democratic side -- he thanked Mr. Sanders and his supporters for their ""passion"" -- leaving voters with a choice between himself and President Trump.And that, he suggested, was not a close call.""At this moment, when there's so much fear in the country, and there's so much fear across the world, we need American leadership,"" Mr. Biden said. ""We need presidential leadership that's honest, trusted, truthful and steady. Reassuring leadership.""Mr. Sanders and his team have not ceded the election publicly, though as the latest election returns came in, his campaign said he would not be speaking Tuesday night. His supporters say that there are many states yet to weigh in, many issues yet to litigate, many chances left for Mr. Biden to squander his advantages -- as he has, on and off, for much of the past year as a would-be front-runner who surrendered the label. The Sanders campaign has been eager for the scheduled debate this Sunday, the first one-on-one session with Mr. Biden, a lengthy unscripted setting that could showcase his propensity for missteps.But if Mr. Sanders could not hold his own on Tuesday -- especially in a state like Michigan, the site of his most memorable primary victory of 2016 -- it is becoming hard to imagine where he might.In a sense, Mr. Biden is offering something of a 2016 do-over, coated in patriotism and wishful thinking: Remove Mr. Trump. Prove that the country does not represent his values. And let the work of repair begin, dooming the 45th president to history's amnesia, eventually.Mr. Biden decided against a run four years ago as he mourned his son Beau, who died in May 2015. Now, he is running the kind of campaign that voters might expect from a vice president seeking a promotion immediately after his time as second in command, as if the last four years could be effectively elided. He is promising continuity with his party's prior administration, pledging to build on successes without wide-scale overhaul and even presenting himself as more of a transitional figure than a long-term standard-bearer.""I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,"" Mr. Biden said in Detroit on Monday night, campaigning with new endorsers like Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. ""There's an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country.""Throughout the campaign, he has declined to meet the demands of the loudest voices on the left -- he has super PAC support, attends high-dollar fund-raisers and remains unapologetic about overtures to Republicans -- and none of it hurt him much. Instead, Mr. Biden is enticing Democrats with a bloodless bargain: a return to normal -- or whatever this nation was on Nov. 7, 2016 -- and a vow to make Mr. Trump go away, even if Mr. Biden rarely emphasizes a bold new policy vision.It is a pitch that shares some elements with Mrs. Clinton's in 2016, centered often on Mr. Trump's character and behavior. Mr. Biden and his team seem convinced that the reality of Mr. Trump's tenure will yield a different outcome this time, with the daily tumult more visceral to voters now than it was in Mrs. Clinton's prescient-but-hypothetical predictions of executive disorder and excessive tweeting.There is also the messenger to consider. Mr. Biden recently remarked on an ""unfair"" sexism in the campaign four years ago. Then came an aside, blunt but true: ""That's not going to happen with me.""Mr. Sanders is summoning 2016 memories of another sort. After his setbacks this month, he finds himself in much the same bind he faced against Mrs. Clinton, seeking ways to prolong the primary but finding few opportunities for true breakthroughs.In recent days, Mr. Sanders and his allies have made the case that Democrats would be foolish to nominate the more moderate candidate once again, reminding audiences of Mr. Biden's potential vulnerabilities on matters of trade and the Iraq war.""Lots of flashbacks,"" said Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator and Mr. Sanders's national campaign co-chair. ""2016 has never ended.""Mr. Trump, she added, was sure to reprise a formula that worked for him the last time, if Democrats let him. ""You best believe Donald J. Trump is going to make this a repeat of 2016,"" Ms. Turner said, comparing Mr. Biden's record to Mrs. Clinton's. ""There are so many similarities for him to hit.""The president, still known to recount the details of his election victory years after the fact, is not the only veteran of that campaign inclined to linger over it. Mrs. Clinton is starring in a new documentary series in which her loss is featured prominently.And Mr. Sanders, pressed repeatedly of late about whether his attacks on Mr. Biden might damage the former vice president in November, appeared to grow frustrated last week with a trope he recognized well.""I heard that back in 2016,"" he told reporters in Phoenix. ""2016, the feeling was, 'We should anoint the candidate, and get everybody else -- get out of the race.' Is that really what democracy is about?""Mr. Biden has not generally felt like a candidate on a glide path to an anointing, though he has appeared exceedingly happy on the campaign trail in recent days, wearing his signature aviator sunglasses indoors at an ice cream shop in California last week and telling reporters about his cash windfall between spoonfuls.But winning has not changed the underlying weaknesses that defined him through the early states. Despite the growing presence of teleprompters, he still sometimes sets off on long tangents and makes verbal blunders.He continues to struggle to excite some young people and progressives. He can lose his temper in heated and colorful ways, a trait that delights some voters who take it as a sign of vigor but strikes others as unseemly for a man pursuing the statesman's mantle. (Mr. Biden swore at a man in Michigan who had suggested Mr. Biden wanted to confiscate guns. ""Don't be such a horse's ass,"" he said at another point in the exchange.)After Iowa, Mr. Biden's team underwent a shake-up, and people inside and outside the campaign have since reported more signs of a righted ship. Just last week, three former rivals -- Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O'Rourke -- announced their endorsements in the span of a few hours, in an extraordinary show of force that sent Mr. Biden into Super Tuesday with a burst of momentum and free media.It was the kind of dramatic turn that felt essential to boosting a campaign eager for any jolt it could find as it sought to catch up to Mr. Sanders, the early delegate leader.A week later, Mr. Biden's success registered as something even more stunning, in its way: a little boring.PhotographSupporters of former Vice President Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitWith President Trump facing an impeachment trial over his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden, Russian military hackers have been boring into the Ukrainian gas company at the center of the affair, according to security experts.
The hacking attempts against Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Hunter Biden served, began in early November, as talk of the Bidens, Ukraine and impeachment was dominating the news in the United States.
It is not yet clear what the hackers found, or precisely what they were searching for. But the experts say the timing and scale of the attacks suggest that the Russians could be searching for potentially embarrassing material on the Bidens — the same kind of information that Mr. Trump wanted from Ukraine when he pressed for an investigation of the Bidens and Burisma, setting off a chain of events that led to his impeachment.
The Russian tactics are strikingly similar to what American intelligence agencies say was Russia’s hacking of emails from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman and the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 presidential campaign. In that case, once they had the emails, the Russians used trolls to spread and spin the material, and built an echo chamber to widen its effect.
Then, as now, the Russian hackers from a military intelligence unit known formerly as the G.R.U., and to private researchers by the alias “Fancy Bear,” used so-called phishing emails that appear designed to steal usernames and passwords, according to Area 1, the Silicon Valley security firm that detected the hacking. In this instance, the hackers set up fake websites that mimicked sign-in pages of Burisma subsidiaries, and have been blasting Burisma employees with emails meant to look like they are coming from inside the company.
The hackers fooled some of them into handing over their login credentials, and managed to get inside one of Burisma’s servers, Area 1 said.
“The attacks were successful,” said Oren Falkowitz, a co-founder of Area 1, who previously served at the National Security Agency. Mr. Falkowitz’s firm maintains a network of sensors on web servers around the globe — many known to be used by state-sponsored hackers — which gives the firm a front-row seat to phishing attacks, and allows them to block attacks on their customers.
“The timing of the Russian campaign mirrors the G.R.U. hacks we saw in 2016 against the D.N.C. and John Podesta,” the Clinton campaign chairman, Mr. Falkowitz said. “Once again, they are stealing email credentials, in what we can only assume is a repeat of Russian interference in the last election.”
The Justice Department indicted seven officers from the same military intelligence unit in 2018.
The Russian attacks on Burisma appear to be running parallel to an effort by Russian spies in Ukraine to dig up information in the analog world that could embarrass the Bidens, according to an American security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence. The spies, the official said, are trying to penetrate Burisma and working sources in the Ukrainian government in search of emails, financial records and legal documents.
The Russian government did not immediately respond to requests for comment, nor did Burisma.
American officials are warning that the Russians have grown stealthier since 2016, and are again seeking to steal and spread damaging information and target vulnerable election systems ahead of the 2020 election.
[Read: Even as American election defenses have improved,  Russian hackers and trolls have become more sophisticated .]
In the same vein, Russia has been working since the early days of Mr. Trump’s presidency to turn the focus away from its own election interference in 2016 by seeding conspiracy theories about Ukrainian meddling and Democratic complicity.
The result has been a muddy brew of conspiracy theories that mix facts, like the handful of Ukrainians who openly criticized Mr. Trump’s candidacy, with discredited claims that the D.N.C.’s email server is in Ukraine and that Mr. Biden, as vice president, had corrupt dealings with Ukrainian officials to protect his son. Spread by bots and trolls on social media, and by Russian intelligence officers, the claims resonated with Mr. Trump, who views talk of Russian interference as an attack on his legitimacy.
With Mr. Biden’s emergence as a front-runner for the Democratic nomination last spring, the president latched on to the corruption allegations, and asked that Ukraine investigate the Bidens on his July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. The call became central to Mr. Trump’s impeachment last month.
The Biden campaign sought to cast the Russian effort to hack Burisma as an indication of Mr. Biden’s political strength, and to highlight Mr. Trump’s apparent willingness to let foreign powers boost his political fortunes.
“Donald Trump tried to coerce Ukraine into lying about Joe Biden and a major bipartisan, international anti-corruption victory because he recognized that he can’t beat the vice president,” said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign.
“Now we know that Vladimir Putin also sees Joe Biden as a threat,” Mr. Bates added. “Any American president who had not repeatedly encouraged foreign interventions of this kind would immediately condemn this attack on the sovereignty of our elections.”
The corruption allegations hinge on Hunter Biden’s work on the Burisma board. The company hired Mr. Biden while his father was vice president and leading the Obama administration’s Ukraine policy, including a successful push to have Ukraine’s top prosecutor fired for corruption. The effort was backed by European allies.
The story has since been recast by Mr. Trump and some of his staunchest defenders, who say Mr. Biden pushed out the prosecutor because Burisma was under investigation and his son could be implicated. Rudolph W. Giuliani, acting in what he says was his capacity as Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, has personally taken up investigating the Bidens and Burisma, and now regularly claims to have uncovered clear-cut evidence of wrongdoing.
The evidence, though, has yet to emerge, and now the Russians appear to have joined the hunt.
Area 1 researchers discovered a G.R.U. phishing campaign on Ukrainian companies on New Year’s Eve. A week later, Area 1 determined what the Ukrainian targets had in common: They were all subsidiaries of Burisma Holdings, the company at the center of Mr. Trump’s impeachment. Among the Burisma subsidiaries phished were KUB-Gas, Aldea, Esko-Pivnich, Nadragas, Tehnocom-Service and Pari. The targets also included Kvartal 95, a Ukrainian television production company founded by Mr. Zelensky. The phishing attack on Kvartal 95 appears to have been aimed at digging up email correspondence for the company’s chief, Ivan Bakanov, whom Mr. Zelensky appointed as the head of Ukraine’s Security Service last June.
To steal employees’ credentials, the G.R.U. hackers directed Burisma to their fake login pages. Area 1 was able to trace the look-alike sites through a combination of internet service providers frequently used by G.R.U.’s hackers, rare web traffic patterns, and techniques that have been used in previous attacks against a slew of other victims, including the 2016 hack of the D.N.C. and a more recent Russian hack of the World Anti-Doping Agency.
“The Burisma hack is a cookie-cutter G.R.U. campaign,” Mr. Falkowitz said. “Russian hackers, as sophisticated as they are, also tend to be lazy. They use what works. And in this, they were successful.”

LOS ANGELES — Latino voters are poised to pick the Democratic nominee.
Long overlooked by the political establishment and dismissed as a sleeping giant of a demographic that didn’t vote as reliably as it could, millions of Latinos are expected to go to the polls on Tuesday in key states like Colorado, Virginia, North Carolina and, most significantly, in Texas and California.
One analysis estimates that roughly one-third of the 643 delegates up for grabs in those two states will be determined by Latino voters.
Latinos are expected to make up the largest nonwhite ethnic voting bloc in 2020. Around the country, Latino Democrats are seeking the candidate who is best poised to take on President Trump, who many believe has placed a target on their own backs with his anti-immigrant rhetoric. These voters, far from a monolith but united on some key issues, will cast their ballots in Texas exactly seven months after the deadliest anti-Latino attack in modern American history took place in El Paso.
“It’s hard to be Latino right now,” said Christian Arana, the policy director for the Latino Community Foundation, a philanthropic group based in California. “There are so many of us who feel we have to constantly be on the watch for something terrible. People are channeling their anger into voting in a way we have not seen historically.”
Polls have consistently shown that Latino voters in Texas and California list health care, economic inequality and immigration as their top issues. But the upcoming primaries are likely to show the splits and contradictions among the group. Interviews with dozens of Latino voters in El Paso and Los Angeles in recent days show that though Senator Bernie Sanders has built up a loyal base among Latinos, particularly younger and working-class voters, there are many lifelong Democrats who are still searching for a moderate alternative.
“It’s a historic moment and a historic disappointment because yet again we are the most underinvested community from the establishment and the big donors and yet still in every election, the Latino voting segment keeps growing,” said Héctor Sánchez Barba, the executive director of Mi Familia Vota, which does Latino voter outreach throughout the country. In 2018, Latino voters helped flip several Congressional districts to the Democrats.
Now, he said, is the time Latino groups are pressing to get more promises from candidates on what they will do on health care, education and immigration.
Democratic candidates have made more of an effort in recent weeks to court Latino voters, recognizing the decisive role they could play on Super Tuesday. No other candidate has put more effort into courting Latinos than Mr. Sanders, who has made it clear that he is counting on Latinos as a kind of firewall on Tuesday, nationally and particularly in California. So far, recent surveys seem to reflect that effort: Mr. Sanders has a significant lead among Latino voters in both Texas and California, ahead of his rivals by double digits.
“We’ve lived in fear for our families for the last three years,” said Janette Espino, a 26-year-old sports merchandising buyer from Long Beach, Calif., who attended a rally for Mr. Sanders in Los Angeles Sunday. Ms. Espino said health care was the most important issue for her, but added that she has several family members who are undocumented immigrants. She said several of other family members had become citizens in the last two years and planned to cast their first ballot Tuesday, choosing Mr. Sanders. “We’ve never had a candidate for president who listened to us like this, who we are really excited about.”
Seeming to recognize the need for more of an effort targeting the Latino community, Joseph R. Biden Jr. held rallies in Texas leading up to Super Tuesday, and touted the endorsement of Congresswoman Veronica Escobar of El Paso. And on Saturday, four former Latino cabinet secretaries from the Clinton and Obama administrations published a letter in La Opinion, Los Angeles’ largest Spanish-language newspaper, urging their “Latino brothers and sisters” to vote for Mr. Biden, arguing that they “know Joe” and that he is “running to restore the American dream.”
In East Los Angeles Monday night, Senator Elizabeth Warren called Latinas “the unsung heroes of the American story,” in an lengthy speech about the janitor strikes of the 1990s, which amassed significantly more power for both unions and Latinos in Southern California.
Former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has poured in a record-breaking amount of money into Spanish-language advertising in California and Texas. Mr. Bloomberg’s campaign has focused particularly on finding local endorsements from heavily Latino regions and featuring those leaders in “Ganamos Con Mike” advertisements.
Like Mr. Sanders’s campaign, Mr. Bloomberg has opened field offices in heavily Latino regions that have long been ignored in presidential elections, such as the Central Valley and the Inland Empire in California. The campaign has also sent millions of campaign mailers to Hispanic voters in both states.
“What used to happen was you avoided talking about Latinos until Florida,” said Mayra Macías, the executive director of Latino Victory Fund, which tries to get more Latinos elected and backed Mr. Biden last month. “Now we are seeing that there is no path to victory without speaking holistically to them.”
In some ways, California Latinos began their steady march to political power after Proposition 187, an anti-immigrant ballot initiative approved by voters in 1994. Dozens of current Latino elected officials in the state became engaged in activism during the protests against the measure, which was eventually struck down by the courts. And many in California believe that Texas Latinos are in the midst of a similar political transformation.
It has now been nearly seven months since the shooting at an El Paso Walmart. The white 21-year-old gunman, Patrick Crusius, turned a Saturday morning in the binational, majority-Hispanic border city into a scene of horror: He killed 22 people and wounded nearly two dozen others. Most of those killed or injured were either Mexicans or Mexican-Americans.
Minutes before the shooting, the gunman had posted an anti-immigrant manifesto online, declaring that the attack was in response to “the Hispanic invasion of Texas.” He wrote that he feared that the Hispanic population in Texas would make it a Democratic stronghold that would “win nearly every presidential election.”
For 27-year-old Elisa Tamayo, the shooting last year was personal. It was her neighborhood Walmart, a place to shop and meet her family from across the border. One of her mother’s friends was killed in the attack — Maria Eugenia Legarreta Rothe, 58, from the Mexican state of Chihuahua. Ms. Tamayo called her “tía,” Spanish for aunt, although they were not related.
But for Ms. Tamayo, the attack has since veered to the political.
She is running for public office for the first time in her life, pushed in part by the Walmart shooting and the rhetoric from President Trump and state Republican leaders that she believes fueled the anti-Latino hatred of the gunman. Ms. Tamayo is vying to become a Democratic lawmaker in the state House of Representatives and to represent the House district that includes the Walmart. She announced her candidacy eight weeks after the shooting, standing with relatives and supporters in front of a mural reading “El Paso Strong.”
Ms. Tamayo, who is on the Democratic primary ballot in El Paso on Tuesday and who voted for Ms. Warren for president, said that in knocking on doors for her campaign, she has seen firsthand a new level of engagement of Hispanic voters.
“We’ve been knocking on doors for more than three months, and I keep hearing that they want to vote in this election,” she said. “They really want to vote in this election because they feel like we’ve got to get Trump out of office. Instead of saying my vote doesn’t matter, I think people are now more willing to show up and more willing to vote because of that.”
Around El Paso, many people described similar reasons for voting: Mr. Trump’s rhetoric and the shooting last summer. But they came to different conclusions about their preferred candidates.
Anna Casas, 33, a single mother and home health aide in El Paso, voted for the first time in her life last week — her vote went to Mr. Sanders, and she had registered to vote last year about three months after the attack at the Walmart, where she would often shop with her three sons. “What about if we were there and that happened?” she said. “It did open my eyes. It pushed me to vote.”
Ms. Casas said it was clear to her that Mr. Trump’s words fueled the shooter’s hatred of Hispanics.
“I’m trying to push other people to vote, because they think that their vote doesn’t matter,” she said. “But it actually does. I used to think that way, honestly, until Trump became president.”
Irma Vasquez, 67, a former school-district worker who voted for Mr. Bloomberg, put the role the president’s words played in the attack this way, tugging at the skin on her cheek: “He put a bull’s-eye on our backs, especially this color.”
Pedro Gandara, 74, a retired telephone-company repairman and Air Force veteran who voted for Mr. Biden, said Mr. Trump evokes for him the anti-Latino racism he has faced his entire life. He remembered being refused service at a restaurant in the Panhandle city of Amarillo when he was a high school student.
“This was ’63 or ’64, so the racism has been here ever since, but Trump has really brought it out,” Mr. Gandara said. “He’s very much against us all.”
Perhaps no one exemplified the split of Latino Democratic voters in Texas heading into Super Tuesday better than the Balcazar family.
Last Wednesday, Miguel Balcazar, 66, a retired middle-school history teacher, walked slowly to an early voting site at a recreation center in the city’s Mission Valley neighborhood, a little more than two miles from the scene of the Walmart shooting. He used a cane because of his knee problems as his wife, Lucinda, 65, a retired special-education teacher’s assistant, walked alongside him, just as slowly. They’ve been married for 41 years.
They were making their way cautiously to vote, but they were eager for political revolution. When they got back to their car wearing “I voted” stickers, both said they had supported Mr. Sanders.
“I feel strongly that he’s more radical than anything else,” Mr. Balcazar said of Mr. Sanders.
Their three sons were not with them, but their parents know exactly how they will vote. One of their sons plans on voting for Mr. Sanders, one is undecided and the other will vote for Mr. Trump, a sign of the Hispanic Republican support for the president that exists in a conservative state like Texas.
“I can’t change his mind,” Mr. Balcazar said, shaking his head and adding with a chuckle, “He says, ‘Dad, I’m going to put the sign up on top of your roof, because you can’t get up there anymore.’”

| Jump to first hitPete Buttigieg's stint at McKinsey gets more attention, but the time he spent driving ""real people"" around in a van for Al Gore might speak more directly to his candidacy.CHARLESTON, S.C. -- Pete Buttigieg has tailored much of his campaign message to the idea that he is best able to speak ""flyover country,"" in addition to all those other languages. As the onetime leader of the fourth-largest city in Indiana, he understands this most crucial of regions -- the Midwest -- that supposedly represents the most ""authentic"" part of the American experience. He fashions himself an ""outsider,"" always contrasting his experience with the ""Washington"" mind-sets and résumés of his opponents.In fact, Mr. Buttigieg has far more in common with the standard Washington type and whiz kid political animal than any candidate in the race.While much has been made of the former South Bend mayor's elite background, polyglot skills and pioneer status as an openly gay candidate for president, it's easy to overlook just how hard-core of a political obsessive he is.One could easily envision Mr. Buttigieg as a peripatetic presidential campaign operative, or election commentator; or imagine him organizing ""watch parties"" in college where like-minded revelers at Harvard's Institute of Politics could gather to enjoy that week's episode of ""West Wing."" Or see him live-blogging the Indiana primary for Slate in 2016, and angling to become the chair of the Democratic National Committee. That's because he has actually done all of these things.""I was just fascinated by it, just getting to be around these people,"" Mr. Buttigieg said, describing the opportunity to experience ""proximity to politics"" as an 18-year-old college student and volunteer for Al Gore's 2000 presidential campaign. ""You know, some people geek out to actual rock stars,"" he said. ""For me, it was seeing people who I'd only watched on TV, getting to see them around."" He cited Donna Brazile, the ubiquitous cable pundit and former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.Mr. Buttigieg presents himself as a 38-year-old embodiment of a generation that has little in common with the current septuagenarian front-runner (Bernie Sanders), former front-runner (Joe Biden) and incumbent (Donald Trump). But he also very much reflects a cohort of young politicos who were weaned on mass media and pop culture portrayals of the profession; they are just as likely to idolize Toby Ziegler from ""The West Wing"" or George Stephanopoulos as they are Ronald Reagan or John F. Kennedy.In the fall of 2000, for instance, Mr. Buttigieg worked as a volunteer driver for special guests who were attending a general election debate between Mr. Gore and then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush at the Kennedy Library in Boston. ""Do you remember the 'Real People?""' Mr. Buttigieg asked. He explained: In preparing for his debates with Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore had enlisted the help of about a dozen ostensibly ""regular Americans"" who were deemed to be sufficiently representative of the national quilt, or at least the demographic threads the campaign wished to reach.""You had these twelve people,"" Mr. Buttigieg said. ""Diverse. The schoolteacher and the nurse and the older woman who had some medical horror story, something like that.""It was young Pete's job to shepherd ""a van full of the real people"" around Boston on the night of the debate. ""It's not like I was anywhere near the beating heart of the campaign or something,"" he said. Still, this was one harrowing ride for a teenager who'd never driven a van before, never driven in a city and never navigated around packs of Ralph Nader protesters.He did however have his own police escort for when he was tasked with shuttling the real people to Boston's North End, where they had a date to eat cannoli with Ted Kennedy.As Mr. Buttigieg battled a cold on the morning of Tuesday's Democratic debate in South Carolina, he sounded almost nostalgic for those days. It was as if he missed being able to partake of politics as a carefree tourist, from a position of even slight remove from the pressure-cooker he now occupied.He took a sip of something warm, and began to describe another formative pit stop along his fast-track tour. In 2004, he moved to Arizona to work as a research assistant in the communications shop of John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign. He sat all day in a cubicle, monitoring five TVs in an effort to track what people were saying about the campaign.""That was when I learned what message discipline was,"" Mr. Buttigieg said, as if he was checking off another job-training box. ""You'd see all these Bush surrogates. You'd have Condi Rice on this Sunday show, Colin Powell over there and Karl Rove over there."" He kept the televisions on mute and used close captioning, the better to record what exact words they were using. ""You'd learn about how they said what they wanted to say,"" Mr. Buttigieg said. ""And nothing else.""One of the strange qualities of many politicians is that they are loath to be seen as too nakedly ""political."" Candidates are told to avoid talking publicly about the insider-y facets of a campaign that are best left to the professionals behind the scenes or on TV. Mr. Buttigieg may have missed that Power Point presentation. In fact, he becomes especially animated in detailing how valuable it was to get to watch a bunch of talking-heads all day while working for Mr. Kerry.To many observers, such a diet of drivel would be a recipe for despair -- or at least jadedness. But Mr. Buttigieg said that while he felt some of that, becoming a mayor of his hometown -- at 29 -- served as its own antidote to cynicism. ""It's politics for sure, but it's very real,"" he said, of leading the city. As a mayor, he now had the opportunity to cavort with real-life ""real people,"" not just the curated photo-op variety assembled by the Gore campaign.And yet, Mr. Buttigieg seemed eager to leave that behind in 2017 when he launched a bid to become chairman of the Democratic National Committee, a job saturated with exactly the kind of Washington inanity he had just been talking about. He said he ran to be chair of the D.N.C. because he felt that his skill set matched up with what he viewed to be his own strengths (being from ""the industrial Midwest,"" winning as a Democrat in a Red State, appealing to younger voters). The more skeptical reading of this places Mr. Buttigieg's bid in the context of a precocious striver who was desperate to raise his national profile by climbing whatever ladder happened to be available to him.Either way, Mr. Buttigieg conspicuously gritted his teeth when it was mentioned to him that Tom Perez -- the eventual chair of the D.N.C -- seems to currently occupy one of the more miserable jobs in American politics. ""It crossed my mind,"" Mr. Buttigieg said at the prospect of being one of the last Democrats standing in a presidential field rather than dealing with caucus fiascos in Iowa and fighting off calls for his resignation.Still, as you watch Mr. Buttigieg move through his campaign, there are certain settings in which he becomes seemingly indistinguishable from the talking heads and hangers-on who populate this insider bubble.On the morning of the New Hampshire primary, for instance, he was working his way backstage following an appearance on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe."" ""Hey, longtime follower, first time hand-shaker,"" Mr. Buttigieg said, extending his hand to David Wasserman, a campaign and elections guru at ""The Cook Political Report"" and semifamous inhabitant of this political-media ecosystem.A self-described ""nerd for maps,"" Mr. Wasserman represents just the kind of campaign super-junkie that only the most fanatical of politicos get aroused by.Likewise, Mr. Wasserman became equally gob-smacked over Mr. Buttigieg's ability in their brief encounter to forecast exactly what regions of New Hampshire he expected to perform well in (the Lakes Region, the western towns near the Vermont border).On Tuesday morning in Charleston, S.C., before heading into a prep session for that night's debate, Mr. Buttigieg was asked if his life as a political aficionado had prepared him for making strategic decisions on his own presidential campaign. ""Not really at all,"" he said, noting that it's incumbent upon a candidate to relinquish as much of those considerations as possible, and focus on all the infinite stresses and demands of actually running. In so much as he follows the race as a spectator, he describes it almost as a kind of causal diversion.""I thumb through Twitter, like everybody else does,"" Mr. Buttigieg said. ""I flip through cable when I'm ironing my shirts in the morning.""Mr. Buttigieg has frequently been asked why he is running for president, a question every candidate gets but much more often in his case given his age and how unusual it would be for a small city mayor to jump straight to the White House.His practiced answer is that after serving as a mayor for eight years, it occurred to him that the best way to help America's cities would be to give them a better president. By that logic, it was pointed out to Mr. Buttigieg that any mayor in the country could run for president, right?""Yes,"" the candidate agreed. ""But I'm not like the others.""PhotographPete Buttigieg in Denver on Saturday. The 38-year-old was weaned on mass media and pop culture portrayals of modern politics.

| Jump to first hitThe senator played herself in a surprise appearance in an episode that featured the Weeknd as the musical guest.It started out familiar: a ""Saturday Night Live"" sketch centered on impersonations of political figures. But then it was rescued by something even more familiar: the show's ability to wrangle real-life politicians to come on the show during an election season -- which in this case yielded Senator Elizabeth Warren, who announced on Thursday that she was exiting the race for the Democratic presidential nomination.The sketch -- which led an episode hosted by Daniel Craig and featuring the musical guest the Weeknd -- was framed as an episode of the Fox News program ""The Ingraham Angle,"" with Kate McKinnon playing its host, Laura Ingraham. She traded quips with her cast mates Cecily Strong (playing Jeanine Pirro), Mikey Day and Alex Moffat (as Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump) and the ""S.N.L."" veteran Darrell Hammond, who returned in his recurring role as the ""Hardball"" host Chris Matthews (for what could be his last go-round as that character).Then McKinnon introduced Warren, playing herself, and asked her how she'd been since dropping out of the race.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]""You know, I'm doing just fine,"" Warren said. ""My friends and family have been so supportive. They've been calling nonstop, asking: 'Are you OK? What do you need? Were you electable?' That kind of thing.""McKinnon set up what she said would be footage of Warren debating Mike Bloomberg but was instead a viral clip of Warren's dog, Bailey, devouring a stolen burrito. Asked if she was the dog or the burrito in that clip, Warren responded, ""I was the dog""Reminded that Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders were both still hoping for her endorsement, Warren indicated that she was not yet ready to choose one of them. ""It's tough,"" she said. ""Maybe I'll just pull a New York Times and endorse them both.""Warren said she had no regrets about how she had run her campaign. ""We built a wide coalition of teachers, preschool teachers, middle-school teachers, and teachers' pets,"" she said. ""And not only did I not accept money from billionaires, I got to give one a swirly on live TV.""In the meantime, Warren said, she was practicing a regimen of self-care: ""Hanging out with my dog, Bailey. Prank-calling big banks. Drag-racing Subarus. Avoiding Twitter.""Just as the sketch seemed to be wrapping up, McKinnon raced onto the screen, now dressed as Warren, whom she had impersonated many times. ""I wanted to put on my favorite outfit to thank you for all that you've done in your lifetime,"" McKinnon told her.Warren replied, ""I'm not dead -- I'm just in the Senate.""Opening Monologue of the Week[Video: Watch on YouTube.]At the start of the week, Daniel Craig was getting ready to appear on ""Saturday Night Live"" in conjunction with his new James Bond movie, which was scheduled to premiere in April. On Wednesday, those plans changed when the film, ""No Time to Die,"" was postponed until November amid concerns about the worldwide spread of the coronavirus.That didn't prevent Craig from having some fun with his superspy character, as he introduced what he said would be a clip from ""No Time to Die"" but was instead a lengthy Bond parody in which 007 can't quite get away from a craps table where he's having a lucky streak.(And if you were hoping Craig would poke fun at his hit mystery caper ""Knives Out,"" he did that, too, in a sketch in which Beck Bennett played the accent coach training him to play the Southern detective Benoit Blanc.)Soap Opera Parody of the Week[Video: Watch on YouTube.]As a narrator informs viewers at the start of ""The Sands of Modesto,"" a tongue-in-cheek soap opera, ""With the outbreak of COVID-19, otherwise known as the Coronavirus, the producers of today's episode of 'The Sands of Modesto' would like to remind viewers that the staging of certain scenes has been altered for the actors' safety."" That meant that when two long-separated lovers (played by Craig and McKinnon) were reunited, they conducted their affair through a pane of plexiglass and a layer of Saran Wrap.When Cecily Strong caught them in the act, she thoroughly sanitized her hands before air-slapping her romantic rival.Weekend Update Jokes of the Week[Video: Watch on YouTube.]Over at the Weekend Update desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che continued to riff about the 2020 presidential election.""Last week we had six Democratic candidates,"" Jost began:and this week it's become like my dad's favorite radio station -- just the oldies. Joe Biden is now the front-runner and just picked up an endorsement from Michigan's governor only days before the state's primary. And it makes sense that Michigan would love Biden, because it kind of looks like a hand trying to touch a lady's hair.Jost paused while the audience laughed at a map of Michigan, then continued:I've got to say, honestly, I could not be more excited for Biden-Trump debates. They're going to be the first debates that have to be moderated by a Jamaican nurse. As well as the only debates that air on the Turner Classic Movies channel. And I don't want the moderator to ask them about anything political. I want all the questions to be like, ""Who was the greatest slugger of the 50s? Who's your favorite white boxer?"" At this point, between Bernie, Biden and Trump, I think the next debate should just be on that cruise ship. And whichever one of them can beat coronavirus becomes our next president.Che picked up the thread:I don't know who's going to win the nomination, but watching white people fight over these old dudes is hilarious. I don't even care who wins, just as long as they beat Trump. I'm not even really a Democrat, I just vote not-Republican. Democrats are like condoms to me. I mean, I'll use them because it's safer, I guess. But it doesn't feel good.Classic 'S.N.L.' Throwback of the Week[Video: Watch on YouTube.]In another sketch that began with a clever fake-out, a group of partygoers at a wedding reception asked a fellow guest to remove her obtrusive gas mask and -- surprise! -- it was Debbie Downer, the perpetually morbid character whom Rachel Dratch first portrayed back in 2004, spawning a slang term for that person in every group who always has to be the buzz kill.Naturally, she was fretting about the coronavirus. And also feline AIDS.And if you like comically irritating ""S.N.L."" characters of a different vintage, Cecily Strong appeared on Weekend Update as The Girl You Wish You Hadn't Started a Conversation With at a Party.Music Video of the Week[Video: Watch on YouTube.]If you've already got the Weeknd as your musical guest, you might as well put him to work on an irresistible slow jam about guys who can't quite understand how they found themselves in the doghouse with their significant others. ""On the Couch"" is sung -- quite well, one might add! -- by Kenan Thompson, Chris Redd and the Weeknd, but its closing verses belong to Ego Nwodim, Melissa Villaseñor and Heidi Gardner, who clarify why these chumps deserved their punishments (and probably worse).PhotographKate McKinnon, left, played the Fox News host Laura Ingraham in a cold opening featuring Senator Elizabeth Warren. ""We built a wide coalition of teachers, preschool teachers, middle-school teachers and teachers' pets,"" Ms. Warren said.

| Jump to first hitThe point of the attacks was not to set off mass defections between the left and the center, but rather to consolidate support on one side of the party or the other.HOOKSETT, N.H. -- Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., clashed throughout the day on Sunday, in a combative display of their determination to treat the upcoming New Hampshire primary as a two-person race, with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. continuing to struggle.After a year when Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren dominated the campaign at different stages, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg have arrived in New Hampshire with the greatest momentum, according to public polling and a consensus of Democratic strategists in the state. A one-two finish for Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg here, after their near-tie in Iowa, could reorder the race and hasten a reckoning among Democratic leaders about which man would be the stronger nominee against President Trump.For all its divisions, the Democratic presidential field has been united for a year around the goal of defeating Mr. Trump, and even as attacks flew on Sunday the candidates continued to pledge that they would lock arms and work together in the general election. But the weekend melee -- complete with dark allusions to billionaire donors, allegations of intellectual dishonesty and sarcastic references to political inexperience -- showed how difficult that task could be if the primary becomes a prolonged and acrimonious affair.One way to avoid a long primary would be for Mr. Sanders or Mr. Buttigieg to fully unite either liberals or moderates behind their campaigns. Such unity seems unlikely: Mr. Sanders must contend with Ms. Warren on the left, while Mr. Buttigieg is a long way from clearing the race of moderates like Mr. Biden and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who has drawn fresh interest from many voters since a strong debate performance on Friday night.But if they could not eliminate their other competitors, Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders managed at least to overshadow them on Sunday by escalating the rivalry that has emerged between them. In Plymouth, Mr. Sanders denounced Mr. Buttigieg for relying on campaign contributions from the extremely wealthy, slamming his 38-year-old rival by name.""Our views are different: Pete has raised campaign contributions from over 40 billionaires,"" Mr. Sanders said. Telling the crowd that television interviewers had questioned whether fund-raising was an important campaign issue, Mr. Sanders thundered, ""Of course it matters!""In Dover, Mr. Buttigieg offered his own broadside, alleging that Mr. Sanders had not leveled with voters about the cost of his policy ambitions, especially single-payer health care. Rebuking Mr. Sanders again for what he has called an uncompromising view of leadership, Mr. Buttigieg suggested that voters ""deserve somebody who can actually deliver math that adds up.""""What we could do without is a plan so expensive that Senator Sanders himself freely admits he has no idea how it's supposed to be paid for,"" Mr. Buttigieg said.The rivalry played out on television as well, with Mr. Sanders chiding Mr. Buttigieg on CNN for having raised money from ""the C.E.O.s of some of the largest drug companies in America."" Mr. Buttigieg retorted, in perhaps the most personal barb of the day, ""Well, Bernie's pretty rich and I'd happily accept a contribution from him.""Neither argument was likely to win converts from the opposing candidate's camp: It would be difficult to imagine supporters of Mr. Sanders suddenly recoiling from the price tag for ""Medicare for all,"" or for Mr. Buttigieg's backers to abandon him over his fund-raising practices.The point of the exercise, however, was not to trigger mass defections between the left and the center, but rather to consolidate support on one side of the party or the other. Mr. Sanders has been focused on driving up turnout among progressives and trying to wrest away liberal support from Ms. Warren, the third-place finisher in Iowa, while Mr. Buttigieg has been appealing both to moderate Democrats, and also to independents and Republican voters who can cast ballots in New Hampshire's open Democratic primary.Mr. Buttigieg's television advertisements have focused on his outreach beyond the Democratic Party, and on Sunday he underscored the point when he asked voters -- as he often does -- to imagine the first day when Mr. Trump is no longer president. ""I don't even think that's a partisan statement anymore, to look forward to that,"" he added.At a campaign stop in Hanover, Mr. Sanders's supporters cheered his criticism of Mr. Buttigieg, sometimes in terms that captured the stark nature of the choice the two candidates have framed for voters. Alison Campion, 26, a researcher at Dartmouth, said she faulted Mr. Buttigieg for failing to ""lead by example"" in getting money out of politics; Ms. Campion said she believed Mr. Buttigieg's financial entanglements were more politically problematic than the label for which Mr. Sanders is most often criticized.""In my world, there's more support for the word socialist than billionaire,"" Ms. Campion said.The possibility that moderate voters could rally behind Mr. Buttigieg has seemed to pose a dire threat to Mr. Biden, whose weak finish in Iowa has sent at least some of his New Hampshire supporters fleeing to Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar.Kevin Donohue, a retired federal employee who attended a rally for Ms. Klobuchar on the campus of Southern New Hampshire University, said he had not entirely made up his mind but was leaning strongly toward supporting her. Mr. Donohue, 63, said he was also tempted to vote for Mr. Buttigieg, but had definitively ruled out Mr. Biden after watching him in a televised town hall event last week.""Joe Biden just seems too old and out of touch,"" said Mr. Donohue, who said he admired Ms. Klobuchar's experience in government and praised Mr. Buttigieg as ""something different.""Faced with the former vice president's imperiled status, his campaign charted a zigzagging course through the weekend, sometimes striking hard at Mr. Buttigieg and at other points taking a restrained and even gentle approach to a trying moment.On Saturday, Mr. Biden's campaign released a cutting video that ridiculed Mr. Buttigieg's limited record in government, lining up Mr. Biden's formidable experience with matters of state against Mr. Buttigieg's municipal résumé. In a television interview, Mr. Biden questioned whether Mr. Buttigieg could win support from African-American voters and dismissed him again to reporters.But on Sunday, Mr. Biden declined to keep up the offensive against Mr. Buttigieg, limiting his criticism on the stump to veiled allusions to Mr. Buttigieg's failure to win over people of color and speaking broadly about the importance of experience.He was more pointed in taking on Mr. Sanders over a familiar subject: Medicare for all. He suggested that the senator was not being straightforward about what the far-reaching proposal would cost.The former vice president also noted that he was ""far ahead of everybody"" among black voters, but sounded at times like he was more inclined to make his stand in the diverse primary states that vote later this month -- Nevada and South Carolina -- than to wage an all-out battle against Mr. Buttigieg here.""Guess what, it's the base of the Democratic Party,"" Mr. Biden said, referring to African-American voters.Mr. Biden was not the only candidate seeming to move past New Hampshire. Ms. Warren, too, indicated in Concord on Sunday that she was looking to states further down the primary calendar and perhaps anticipating a very long primary campaign.""There are 55 more states and territories after this,"" Ms. Warren told reporters. ""I've got plenty of energy left.""Among moderates, the risk to Mr. Biden does not come solely from Mr. Buttigieg: Ms. Klobuchar, too, has shown signs of gaining ground since Iowa, and her campaign said she drew her largest crowd yet on Sunday in Manchester.Ms. Klobuchar continued on Sunday to make a strenuous case to moderate voters that she was the best choice for those ""tired of the extremes in our politics,"" and several times mentioned that she hoped to win support from independent and Republican voters.Even amid signs of a shift toward Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, voters were still expressing anxiety about their final decision. At Ms. Klobuchar's stop in Hooksett, Janet White, 70, said she had settled on Ms. Klobuchar through a ""process of elimination,"" excluding several candidates who were ""too much to the left"" and ultimately rejecting Mr. Biden as well.""I like him as a person, I just think we need somebody younger,"" Ms. White said. ""We need somebody younger, and that's what I like about Amy: She's not too young, she's not too old.""Of Mr. Buttigieg, she said, ""He's another one I like, but I'm not sure it's his time.""Alexander Burns reported from Hooksett, and Nick Corasaniti from Plymouth, N.H. Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from Dover, N.H., and Katie Glueck from Hampton, N.H.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders has been exchanging criticism with Pete Buttigieg after both performed well in the Iowa caucuses.

| Jump to first hitForeign affairs have played a strictly limited role so far in the Democratic primary, but the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani could reshape the contest.The American strike in Baghdad that killed the Iranian general Qassim Suleimani thrust foreign policy to the center of the Democratic presidential race, drawing expressions of grave concern from the leading candidates and stoking a new debate in the party about the American military presence in the Middle East.The party's presidential field reacted to the attack with a measure of unity, at least on the surface level, condemning General Suleimani's role directing violence against Americans but criticizing what they called the Trump administration's penchant for reckless action and the threat of all-out war.But during a series of campaign events on Friday, the top Democrats began to signal their differences on matters of national security, opening the way for what could become the party's most serious conversation of the race about war and peace. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose long diplomatic résumé and global stature have been seen as crucial assets to his campaign, seized the occasion to remind voters of his experience, pressing them to elect a president who could ""command the world stage with no on-the-job training.""Delivering stern remarks in Dubuque, Iowa, Mr. Biden said President Trump was risking nuclear proliferation and ""direct conflict with Iran."" On Twitter, he described the president as ""erratic, unstable and dangerously incompetent.""""The threat to American lives and interests in the region and around the world are enormous,"" Mr. Biden said in Iowa.But elsewhere in the state, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont called not just for the replacement of an impulsive president but for a wholesale overhaul of American foreign policy in the Middle East. Opening a town-hall-style meeting in Anamosa, Iowa, with a somber address, Mr. Sanders urged a total military pullback from the region and noted at length that he had forcefully opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, without explicitly mentioning that Mr. Biden had voted to authorize the war.""We need to firmly commit to ending the U.S. military presence in the Middle East in an orderly manner, not through a tweet,"" Mr. Sanders said, reiterating his past calls for a pullout from Afghanistan and an end to cooperation with Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. ""Instead of provoking more volatility in the region, the United States must use its power, its wealth and its influence to bring the regional powers to the table to resolve conflicts.""And Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who in the past has urged a pullout of all American combat troops from the Middle East, echoed that sentiment on Twitter, warning that the country was ""on the brink of yet another war"" and urging Americans to mobilize against military escalation. ""No more Middle East Wars,"" she wrote.Both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren used the word ""assassination"" to describe the killing of General Suleimani, a term that has significant legal and diplomatic implications. One of the prominent centrists in the race, Michael R. Bloomberg, rebuked Mr. Sanders for that description, calling it ""outrageous."" He described the felled general as a fair target, questioning instead whether Mr. Trump was prepared for the fallout.Whether military matters come to dominate the primary, in the remaining month before the Iowa caucuses, is likely to depend on events in Iraq and Iran -- and perhaps in neighboring countries -- and how severe and visible any ensuing clash with Iran turns out to be. Foreign affairs have so far played a strictly limited role in the Democratic race.There have been major debate-stage duels over health care, taxation, immigration, criminal justice and gun control, but only glancing disagreements about the role of the United States abroad and the proper way to resolve American military engagements in the Middle East and Central Asia.On Friday, much of the Democratic field proceeded with -- and recommended -- caution. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota called on the Trump administration to consult with Congress about a ""strategy for preventing a wider conflict. ""And in North Conway, N.H., Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., called the Baghdad attack ""an extremely provocative act,"" noting that Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush had both considered but opted against attempting to kill General Suleimani.""If we have learned nothing else from the Middle East in the last 20 years, it's that taking out a bad guy is not a good idea unless you are ready for what's coming next,"" said Mr. Buttigieg, who referred several times to his own service in the military.The possibility of a new and protracted conflict abroad could well reshape the general election, even beyond the Democratic race. Mr. Trump ran for president on a pledge to pull back the United States from foreign wars, drawing support from unconventional quarters for a Republican because of the perception that he would pursue an ""America First"" policy of relative isolationism and national self-interest.But Mr. Trump had already drawn criticism from his Democratic rivals, and even within his own party, for presiding over a chaotic pullback from Syria, and the eruption of large-scale violence in Iran and Iraq could profoundly complicate his aim to seek a second term on a message of peace and prosperity. After Thursday's attack, the Trump administration announced that thousands more troops would deploy to the region in anticipation of Iranian action.At Democratic campaign events on Friday, there was already a strong ripple of anxiety running through the primary electorate, as voters who turned out to see several candidates voiced alarm as they imagined what Mr. Trump might do next.""Nobody wants war, and that's what I am afraid of, is that there is going to be war,"" said Brenda Bachman, a 63-year-old from Marengo, Iowa, who had come to see Mr. Sanders. ""We don't need war.""Ross Mercer, 37, a disabled Navy veteran in New Hampshire who served two tours in Iraq, said at Mr. Buttigieg's event that he was worried about Iranian retaliation.""We attacked their country first and I'm scared that they're going to come back and attack our country,"" Mr. Mercer said.There is some precedent for events overseas reshaping American primary elections, often to the benefit of a candidate regarded as a figure of experience -- in this case, perhaps Mr. Biden. In December 2003, the capture of Saddam Hussein in Iraq formed a backdrop for the final phase of a Democratic presidential primary that yielded the quick nomination of John F. Kerry, a Vietnam veteran who served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Four years later, in 2007, the troop surge in Afghanistan and the December assassination of a former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, in Pakistan pushed national security to the center of an unsettled Republican primary that ended with the nomination of John S. McCain, the war hero whose campaign focused overwhelmingly on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Kevin Madden, a political strategist who advised Mr. Bush and Mitt Romney's presidential campaigns, said national security tended to become an election issue in response to major external developments. He cited the Benghazi attack in the fall of 2012 and the Paris nightclub massacre in 2015 as other recent examples.""Every recent contest has had one of these events,"" Mr. Madden said, ""where everything seems to stop and cause all the participants, from the candidates and campaigns to the voters and the media, to recalibrate the stakes of the election through the lens of national security and foreign policy.""But an intensifying debate over foreign policy could have the effect of both spotlighting Mr. Biden's extensive track record in the Middle East and subjecting it to new scrutiny. There have been signs in recent days that several of the leading Democratic candidates were angling for a foreign policy debate with Mr. Biden, even before the outbreak of violence in Iraq and the Suleimani killing came to consume the news.Mr. Sanders has campaigned consistently on his antiwar record, and he has repeatedly highlighted Mr. Biden's past support for the Iraq war, warning Democrats that Mr. Trump would use that record against the former vice president in a general election. On Friday morning, an aide to Mr. Sanders posted images on Twitter showing the progressive lawmaker speaking out against war in Iraq in 1991, 1998, 2002 and 2014.Mr. Biden told reporters in Iowa on Friday that he would not respond to Mr. Sanders's criticism, calling it ""ridiculous"" and countering that Mr. Sanders had his own ""baggage."" He did not specify what he meant by that.Mr. Buttigieg, meanwhile, has attempted to counter questions about his own relative inexperience by pointing to Mr. Biden's stances on Iraq, as an example of how experience was not always an asset in campaigning or governing.""He supported the worst foreign policy decision made by the United States in my lifetime, which was the decision to invade Iraq,"" Mr. Buttigieg said in an Iowa television interview.Mr. Sanders's speech on Friday also indicated how he might use foreign policy to separate himself from other senators who are running for president: He pointed out that he has voted against all of Mr. Trump's military budgets, a distinction that Ms. Warren and Ms. Klobuchar cannot claim.It is impossible to predict precisely how an extended debate over foreign affairs might alter the dynamics of the Democratic race. On Friday, some voters said they yearned for a candidate with Biden-like credentials, while others said they wanted one with a Sanders-like aversion to war.""I don't think it would have escalated to this point if he was the current president,"" Craig Bruxvoort, a 62-year-old Iowa voter, said of Mr. Sanders.At Mr. Biden's event in Dubuque, Karen Sudmeier, a retired teacher, said she had begun the day considering several options -- including Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg -- but after hearing Mr. Biden speak about the Middle East she had decided to support him.""Joe knew everything about it,"" said Ms. Sudmeier, 72. ""He had a plan. And the consequences he laid out of what could happen, I thought, were frightening.""Reid J. Epstein contributed reporting from North Conway, N.H., Sydney Ember from Anamosa, Iowa, and Katie Glueck from Dubuque, Iowa.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., far left, denounced President Trump's decision to approve a military strike in Iraq on Friday, describing Mr. Trump as ""dangerously incompetent.""

| Jump to first hitAs Bernie Sanders has seen his fortunes slide, he has cited a number of factors that portray him as an aggrieved outsider.ST. LOUIS -- To Senator Bernie Sanders, there is plenty of blame to go around when it comes to his recent reversal of fortune. For everyone but him and his campaign.The ""corporate media"" didn't pay attention to his agenda.The Democratic Party establishment aligned to block him from winning its presidential nomination.And the young voters he counted on to power his campaign didn't come through for him.""Let me tell you the bad news, to be honest with you, young people vote at much lower rates than older people,"" the Vermont senator told a St. Louis crowd of mostly young people Monday morning. ""All right? That is the facts. I hope all of the old people vote, that's great, but I want young people to vote at the same rates.""Political candidates are not generally given to self-criticism. And as Mr. Sanders has seen his fortunes slide after a 30-point South Carolina loss to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., followed by Mr. Biden's unexpected strength across Super Tuesday and victories in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi on Tuesday night, he has cited a number of factors that portray him as an aggrieved outsider.It comes at a time of particular weakness for Mr. Sanders. Through Tuesday's voting, his theory of the election has not proven true. The surge of new voters in the Democratic primaries has featured mostly older people, moderate suburbanites and African-Americans disinclined to support his campaign.As Democrats in six states voted Tuesday, Mr. Sanders, his team and his supporters have come up with explanations for his loss of momentum that deflect the responsibility onto others.So when Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar dropped out of the race and endorsed Mr. Biden, to the Sanders camp it wasn't because they'd won next to no support from black voters and run out of money, it was part of an establishment plot. And Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris were simply joining the effort to block Mr. Sanders when they backed Mr. Biden this week.""If they thought that Joe Biden was the best choice, maybe they shouldn't have run,"" Rasheen Aldridge, a Missouri state representative who was a warm-up speaker for Mr. Sanders in St. Louis, said in an interview. ""Some of these candidates -- Kamala has been out for a long time, Booker has been out for a while. It's all very kind of fishy how things are working out.""The 2016 campaign established Mr. Sanders as the Democratic Party's foremost practitioner of grievance politics. Like Donald Trump in that year's Republican primary, Mr. Sanders tapped into populist anger to upend a major political party.Then, Mr. Sanders denounced Democratic National Committee debate rules he said favored Hillary Clinton's campaign and a superdelegate system he argued empowered party insiders over grass-roots voters. His vociferous, public complaints led the D.N.C. to enact substantive changes to the rules for caucus states and to strip first-ballot voting power from superdelegates at the party's convention.Now the Sanders campaign says the policies he's pitching as a democratic socialist -- ""Medicare for all,"" free public college tuition and other proposals -- represent an existential threat to powerful operators that have prompted an unusually coordinated effort to block his rise.""We face a unique uphill battle that other candidates don't because of the agenda that he stands for,"" a campaign spokesman, Mike Casca, said. ""Because of the agenda that he's putting forward, a lot of super wealthy forces are aligned against him.""Yet others close to the Sanders campaign say he didn't expect to find himself trailing Mr. Biden at this point in the race and is trying to save face with his most ardent supporters by blaming others. It's also not bad for fund-raising -- perhaps uniquely among the 2020 candidates, Mr. Sanders does just as well with online contributions after he loses states than when he wins.The ability to keep raising tons of money can allow Mr. Sanders to prolong his candidacy even if voters keep delivering a verdict more favorable to Mr. Biden.Mr. Sanders blamed his Super Tuesday performance in part on the ""venom"" of the ""corporate media."" Last month, his campaign manager said the liberal cable network MSNBC had been unfair to Mr. Sanders, while Mr. Sanders said supporters in California ""may find it impossible"" to vote for him because of the state's mail ballot rules.When he went on MSNBC to discuss the Super Tuesday results with Rachel Maddow, Mr. Sanders said that some polling shows he's beating Mr. Biden among African-Americans but attributed his weak showing among black voters to the fact that ""we're running against somebody who has touted his relationship with Barack Obama for eight years.""Even among those ideologically inclined to back Mr. Sanders, he has engendered little sympathy in recent days. Adam Jentleson, a close ally of Senator Elizabeth Warren's campaign -- who has not been shy about expressing his own grievances about perceived outside forces that limited her campaign -- said Mr. Sanders does himself little good in arguing others are responsible for his shortcomings.""Blame-shifting is pointless because nobody swoops in and hands you the nomination; you have to win it,"" Mr. Jentleson said. ""The nominee needs to be the leader of the whole party and Bernie's job was to convince people he could be that.""Though Mr. Sanders's campaign would love to get Ms. Warren's endorsement, he has not publicly made an issue of it, saying she deserves the time to make her own determination. Privately, aides have expressed irritation that she withheld her backing while Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar quickly rallied to Mr. Biden, and many of Mr. Sanders's supporters have publicly denounced her online.""Imagine if the progressives consolidated last night like the moderates consolidated, who would have won?"" Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota wrote on Twitter after Mr. Biden swept 10 of 14 Super Tuesday states. ""That's what we should be analyzing. I feel confident a united progressive front would have allowed for us to #BuildTogether and win MN and other states we narrowly lost.""Mr. Sanders on Monday declined to answer a question about when he had last spoken to Ms. Warren.Mr. Sanders also scoffed at the endorsement of Mr. Biden by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan -- whom Mr. Sanders backed in the 2018 general election after campaigning for her opponent in the primary.When Ms. Whitmer said Mr. Biden would be the party's best nominee, Mr. Sanders said: ""Well, that wasn't her thoughts when I came here to help her get elected, as a matter of fact.""Then on Sunday, Mr. Sanders said on ABC's ""This Week"" that Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar were forced out of the race by party leaders intent on blocking his rise.""One of the things I was kind of not surprised by was the power of the establishment to force Amy Klobuchar, who had worked so hard, Pete Buttigieg, who had really worked extremely hard as well, out of the race,"" he said, in a remark that managed to unite aides to Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, who spent months in deep political conflict with each other.""What was very clear from the media narrative and what the establishment wanted was to make sure that people coalesced around Biden and tried to defeat me,"" he added. ""So that's not surprising.""By Monday in St. Louis, that sentiment was evident among Sanders supporters in the audience.""I'm frustrated that a lot of the candidates in the field endorsed Biden,"" said Jen McCabe, an information technology saleswoman from Kirkwood, Mo. ""I think they gave into D.N.C. and super PAC pressure. We need to get that money out of the primary.""Mr. Sanders made his final pitch to Michigan voters on Fox News Monday night, hardly the go-to news source for Democratic primary voters. During a town hall event in Dearborn, Mich., he blamed the news media in general for negative coverage and cited a New York Times article he didn't like about a trip he made to the Soviet Union to launch a sister city program when he was mayor of Burlington, Vt. ""What we need from the media is honesty and respect,"" he said.Asked by a voter how he'd get a resistant Congress to enact his slate of progressive proposals, Mr. Sanders said people who believe he can't work with lawmakers to get things done are wrong.""There's a mythology going out around me that everybody hates me; we heard that from Secretary Clinton that I can't work with anybody,"" he said. ""It's just not accurate.""PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders during a rally in Ann Arbor, Mich., on Sunday. (PHOTOGRAPH BY Chang W.

| Jump to first hitIn New Hampshire, the Democratic field defines itself, unflatteringly, as ""cool newcomer"" vs. ""establishment experience.""MANCHESTER, N.H. -- For months, he played the big-talking front-runner, swaggering if rarely steady, hoping voters would not linger long on the tautology of his premise: Joe Biden was the candidate who should win, he told fellow Democrats, because he was the candidate who could win.So it was with some apparent humility -- and then plenty of residual swagger -- that Mr. Biden, days off a fourth-place debacle in Iowa, opened Friday night's debate with an unusual prediction: He would probably do some more losing next week.""I took a hit in Iowa,"" the former vice president allowed. ""I'll probably take a hit here.""Since joining the race last year, Mr. Biden has presented himself as the safe choice for risk-averse times, the O.K.-that'll-do option for Democrats whose chief priority has been finding the candidate best positioned to defeat President Trump. But with Mr. Biden's setback in Iowa and a slate of flawed competitors beside him onstage on Friday -- their shortcomings laid bare in several punchy exchanges throughout the night -- the party has been left to consider an unsettling truth.There is no safe option. And that is starting to feel especially risky.For a perpetually anxious party, the gathering on Friday supplied an untimely forum to air the weaknesses of several top contenders, aided by the man whose standing has fallen the fastest.The cost of Senator Bernie Sanders's progressive health care plans? ""He's unwilling to tell us what the damn thing is going to cost,"" Mr. Biden said.The meager poll numbers among nonwhite voters for Pete Buttigieg? ""He's the mayor of a small city who has done some good things,"" Mr. Biden ruled, ""but has not demonstrated his ability -- and we'll soon find out -- to get a broad scope of support across the spectrum.""Perhaps most significantly, in the running dialogue that could define the campaign's coming weeks, the race's generational fault lines -- and the field's conspicuous absences -- came bluntly to the fore. A lengthy discussion of institutional racism proceeded without a black contender onstage, in a primary that once included several candidates of color who pledged to help rebuild the winning Obama coalition. (On Friday, Andrew Yang, the former technology executive, was the only nonwhite candidate who qualified for the debate.)Mr. Sanders, the septuagenarian choice of the young, acknowledged that the runaway turnout he had hoped for in Iowa had not come to pass. Mr. Buttigieg, the millennial who does best with older voters, appeared to tweak capital veterans like Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren when he said that those hungering for the person ""with the most years of Washington establishment experience"" should look elsewhere.And in a signal of Mr. Buttigieg's growing stature in the race in these early states -- after functionally tying Mr. Sanders in Iowa, he has inched within striking distance in New Hampshire polls -- the former mayor provoked sharp defenses from some of those proud establishment figures.""This going after every single thing that people do because it's popular to say and makes you look like a cool newcomer -- I don't think that's what people want right now,"" Senator Amy Klobuchar fired, noting the senators' work during the recent impeachment trial. ""We have a newcomer in the White House now and look where it got us.""Mr. Biden, in one of several forceful defenses of his long record in Washington, adopted the uncommon political strategy of trumpeting the old ways of doing business, after Mr. Buttigieg urged voters to ""leave the politics of the past in the past.""""The politics of the past, I think, were not all that bad,"" Mr. Biden said, spending the night ticking off highlights of the Obama administration and his legislative career.He was at least ""part of the reason,"" he said, for the following events in American history: the confirmation of Supreme Court Justices Elena Kagan, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor; the non-confirmation of Judge Robert H. Bork; and the Iran nuclear deal.He noted his early support for same-sex marriage and his involvement with the withdrawal of troops in Iraq (""I did that""); the Paris climate accords; gun legislation (""I'm the only guy that beat the N.R.A. twice""); and ""every major initiative we have had relative to diplomacy.""Democrats, rarely a tranquil lot this election season, have endured a particularly distressing week. Mr. Trump's long-anticipated Senate acquittal was dispiriting enough for his critics -- punctuated by a series of angry public appearances from the president, news that his approval ratings have climbed and, on Friday, the firing of key witnesses who had testified in the House impeachment proceedings.In one memorable flourish on Friday, Mr. Biden urged the crowd to its feet to honor one of them, Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a National Security Council official whom the White House had dismissed earlier in the day.""Stand up and clap for Vindman. Get up there!"" Mr. Biden said. ""That's who we are. We are not what Trump is.""The fiasco of the Iowa results just four days earlier was a psychological blow the Democrats did not see coming, a self-inflicted mess that instantly shook confidence within the party and seemed to validate Republican taunts that their opponents cannot even be trusted to count their own votes.This crisis of competence is now the candidates' to bear, leaving to them the task of convincing voters that the party will be able to come together -- and get out of its own way -- in time to turn back Mr. Trump. The fallout from Iowa has only exacerbated the wide-scale disdain and distrust that many progressives, particularly Sanders supporters, have reserved for the party leadership.Still, with success in Iowa and a strong showing in New Hampshire polls, Mr. Sanders has emerged as the unquestioned early choice of the left, outperforming Ms. Warren, who had threatened to eat into his liberal base, and watching with delight as the race's moderate lane remains a candidate pileup.Ms. Warren's campaign has argued that she still has a path, preaching a stay-the-course message and telling reporters that she has the ""widest, deepest coalition"" in New Hampshire, a state that borders her own.On Friday, she appeared to take aim at former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and perhaps Mr. Buttigieg with a familiar theme: lashing the billionaire class. ""I don't think anyone ought to be able to buy their way into a nomination,"" she said, before also knocking ""people who suck up to billionaires in order to fund their campaigns.""Mr. Biden's post-Iowa adjustments have been more dramatic. In a significant leadership shake-up, Mr. Biden has given effective control of the campaign to Anita Dunn, a veteran party operative, an acknowledgment that major improvements must come quickly if he is to reverse his fortunes.But no staff reordering can change the profile of the candidate. In person, Mr. Biden has often felt like a contender at odds with his reputation: He was a national-polling leader who teetered through nationally televised debates; a three-time presidential candidate whose experience could not protect him from damaging mistakes; a former vice president who spoke constantly of his closeness with a popular former boss who had not explicitly endorsed him.For a candidate whose allies had allowed themselves to dream of an incident-free path to the nomination, muscling through Iowa and dominating by Super Tuesday, his early stumbles have been startling. Now, more than three decades after first seeking the presidency, Mr. Biden has staggered into New Hampshire having extended his track record of primary failure, asking voters to believe that he is the safest electoral choice.And so, the goals of Mr. Biden's Friday evening were perhaps loftier than they had been at past debates. In a series of uneven performances throughout the primary, he had appeared at times content to grade out with a gentleman's ""B"" -- good enough to get through the night, if not to put away the field. Now the moment has plainly demanded more.On Friday, it was a fiery Mr. Biden, whose efforts at soaring oratory can sometimes veer closer to a shout.He was at his most passionate and to-the-point when discussing matters within his comfort zone: Foreign policy. Legislative accomplishments. Experience. His time in the Obama administration.When Mr. Buttigieg said at one point in the evening that he offers a perspective ""of somebody whose life has been shaped by the decisions that are made in those big white buildings in Washington, D.C.,"" Mr. Biden -- perhaps inadvertently -- appeared to strike at a crucial tension of this primary.""I don't know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden was so bad,"" he said, his volume rising. ""We were just beginning.""PhotographJoseph R.

| Jump to first hitThe president is brazenly grabbing his only clear option to bolster his re-election hopes, portraying himself as a take-charge leader the country can't afford to lose.WASHINGTON -- With the economy faltering and the political landscape unsettled as the coronavirus death toll climbs, a stark and unavoidable question now confronts President Trump and his advisers: Can he save his campaign for re-election when so much is suddenly going so wrong?After three years of Republicans' championing signs of financial prosperity that were to be Mr. Trump's chief re-election argument, the president has never needed a new message to voters as he does now, not to mention luck. At this point, the president has one clear option for how to proceed politically, and is hoping that an array of factors will break his way.The option, which he has brazenly pushed in recent days, is to cast himself as a ""wartime president"" who looks in charge of a nation under siege while his likely Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., is largely out of sight hunkered down in Delaware. This gambit, however, requires a rewriting of history -- Mr. Trump's muted approach to the virus early on -- and it's far from clear if many voters will accept the idea of him as a wartime leader.Then there are other variables that he and his allies hope will fall in their favor: that the outbreak of the virus will slow and, in the warmer months, dissipate; that the states will get it under control; that the federal government's steps taken so far will flatten the curve; that Mr. Biden and the Democrats will look impotent and inconsequential by comparison; and that enough voters will move past his initial efforts to play down the virus's dangers.The great unknown, of course -- and the tremendous risk to Mr. Trump's political fate, no matter what he says or does -- is that the human cost, the economic toll, and the longevity and course of the pandemic are all X factors that will most likely play out for months and could be strongly salient if not severe by the time of the November general election.In perhaps the best-case scenario for Mr. Trump, the patina of a ""wartime president"" could prove to be influential with casual voters who don't dig into the details of his belated response to the coronavirus, which included dismissing the criticism of his handling of the threat as a Democratic ""hoax"" and contributing to a slow start in testing for the virus.""He is counting on people being so traumatized on a day-to-day basis that they will forget his inaction,"" said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University. ""It's better for him to be a wartime commander in chief than someone who, when the big crisis hit, misread it completely.""Politically, Mr. Brinkley said, the new posture made sense. ""He can claim credit for the curve flattening at some point,"" he said, ""and hope people will be afraid to push a leader out of office if the crisis pushes into the fall.""The president's course correction showed some quick results that were seized on by his political advisers. An ABC News poll released last week showed that 55 percent of Americans approved of Mr. Trump's response to the pandemic, up from 43 percent the week before.Rarely have incumbent presidents seen their arguments for re-election evaporate so quickly. Mr. Trump and his advisers had planned to argue that the strong economy warranted a second term and that supporters and detractors alike wanted their 401(k)'s in the Trump-era stock market; that has now become an impossible sell. And as the administration negotiates an enormous bailout package with Congress for multiple industries, his strategy of caricaturing Democrats as ""socialists"" is not tenable either.So Mr. Trump is trying to mount a new version of his old argument: that ""I alone can fix it,"" as he said at the 2016 Republican convention about the nation's problems. He is counting on enough voters believing they have to stick by a leader in the midst of an immense global crisis.Addressing fearful Americans, Mr. Trump said on Sunday evening: ""You have a leader that will always fight for you and I will not stop until we win. This is going to be a victory."" He added at another point, ""No American is alone as long as we're united.""But shortly after reading his new script on Sunday night, Mr. Trump mocked Senator Mitt Romney of Utah for self-quarantining. ""Romney's in isolation? Gee, that's too bad,"" he said sarcastically at the briefing room podium.Mr. Trump is on uncertain political ground. His poll numbers in critical swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan have been wavering, with most surveys showing him behind Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Republican officials are banking on voters seeing him as take-charge in contrast to Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, who have been following the government's guidance about staying indoors but have not yet found memorable ways to show how they would lead in this crisis.Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have held news conferences from remote locations, and Mr. Biden has participated in ""virtual"" fund-raisers. While Mr. Biden has an all but insurmountable lead in the race for the Democratic nomination, he has no real ability to steer events because he is not officially the presumptive nominee, and therefore is not the head of the party either.As a result, Mr. Biden finds himself with far fewer options than Mr. Trump or Democratic governors like Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, who have real authority and are holding news conferences often broadcast live.In turn, Republican officials and Sanders allies are pushing out attacks on Mr. Biden's low profile, asking ""Where's Joe?"" in emails to supporters and the news media. (A spokesman, T.J. Ducklo, said Sunday that Mr. Biden had not been tested for the virus because he had shown no symptoms.)But the ""wartime"" strategy also presents risks to Mr. Trump. In his new posture, he is trying to rewrite recent history, erasing his comments from as recently as a week ago when he told Americans that they needed to ""just relax"" because ""it all will pass."" It is also undercut by his resistance to calls for additional federal action from governors in hard-hit states.Mr. Trump's temperament is also dissimilar to ""wartime presidents"" with whom he is seeking to compare himself. Over the course of his presidency, Mr. Trump has struggled to stick to any bipartisan message, or speak emotionally to the pain and fear of Americans during crisis points like natural disasters or mass shootings.""That's why it's so hard to be a wartime president,"" said Michael Beschloss, the historian and author of ""Presidents of War."" ""Not only are you coming up with a strategy and tactics, but at the same time you have to let Americans know that you know how hard this is for them.""Mr. Trump, so far, has struggled to feel anyone's pain, unlike past presidents, while continuing to play out the fights with the news media that enliven his base. Last week, he lashed out at a journalist who had prompted him to explain what his message was to the millions of Americans watching him from home, who felt scared.The president has also continued to credit his own administration's response. But Mr. Beschloss added that ""part of being a wartime president is being willing to give people bad news,"" a job Mr. Trump has mostly left to others.At the same time, he has been timid of using wartime powers to fight what he has called an ""invisible enemy."" Last week, for instance, he resisted invoking the Defense Production Act, a federal law that grants presidents extraordinary powers to force American industries to ensure the availability of critical equipment.Mr. Trump's allies are aware that his re-election now hangs almost entirely on how he handles the crisis. And the question is whether he will be seen as President George W. Bush was in the immediate aftermath of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when he was widely viewed as bringing the nation together, or if he will be compared to Mr. Bush amid the fallout from Hurricane Katrina, when he tried to minimize a crisis that eventually became too big for him to ignore, and during which Mr. Bush praised cabinet officials even as the federal government bungled the response.Aides said that how Mr. Trump ends up being perceived would also depend on Mr. Trump's own disposition during the crisis. It is not clear to them whether he will be able to maintain his focus on the crisis for months, especially as the economic situation worsens. Over the weekend, some Trump advisers weren't ready to accept the likelihood of jobless claims climbing into the millions by next month.The White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, defended Mr. Trump's response as apolitical. ""While it seems many in the media continue to use every opportunity to destroy this president, the fact remains that he has risen to fight this crisis by taking aggressive historic action to protect the health, wealth and well-being of the American people,"" Ms. Grisham said in an email.Some Democrats, meanwhile, said the mistakes made at the beginning of the response had already colored how Mr. Trump would be remembered both in the history books and at the ballot box in November. ""At the end of the day, this will be Katrina with the waters at a much higher level, and lasting a longer time,"" said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster.But there is an emerging split in Democratic circles about whether to attack Mr. Trump's response to the virus in real time, or whether the gravity of the moment calls for a pause in negative political advertising and attacks.Some of Mr. Trump's highest-profile political adversaries leading states that have become epicenters of the virus have been striking conciliatory notes as they seek federal assistance. Mr. Cuomo said the president was ""fully engaged"" on the crisis. Gov. Gavin Newsom, Democrat of California, described a recent phone conversation with Mr. Trump as ""a privilege.""Other antagonists have continued to criticize him. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York tapped into one of Mr. Trump's greatest fears when he referred to him on CNN as the ""Herbert Hoover of his generation,"" comparing him to a president who failed to recognize or take bold actions to stave off the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression.The debate about whether to embrace or attack Mr. Trump in a national emergency played out most succinctly on Twitter between David Axelrod and David Plouffe, the two men who led Barack Obama's presidential campaigns.Mr. Axelrod said that voters would have plenty of time to judge Mr. Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis, ""but now doesn't seem the moment for negative ads."" Mr. Plouffe responded that time was of the essence, and that Democrats couldn't afford to ""disarm"" and let Mr. Trump create his own reality.Veterans of John Kerry's 2004 campaign said Mr. Biden was in a stronger position against Mr. Trump than they were when they faced an election against Mr. Bush. Back then, Mr. Bush still basked in good will from his performance in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.Some Democratic Party officials said a comparison between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump at a moment of crisis only helped Mr. Biden.""You can see the contrast between the steady, assured, informed and strong leadership that Vice President Biden has shown and the bungling, chaotic and dishonest start-stop approach that Mr. Trump has shown us since the beginning of this crisis,"" said Gilberto Hinojosa, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.PhotographPresident Trump spoke on Saturday during a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House.

| Jump to first hitAs Republicans rallied behind President Trump, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, the party's 2012 presidential nominee, joined Democrats in voting to convict, the only senator to cross party lines.WASHINGTON -- After five months of hearings, investigations and revelations about President Trump's dealings with Ukraine, a divided United States Senate acquitted him on Wednesday of charges that he abused his power and obstructed Congress to aid his own re-election, bringing an acrimonious impeachment trial to its expected end.In a pair of votes whose outcome was never in doubt, the Senate fell well short of the two-thirds margin that would have been needed to remove the 45th president. The verdicts came down -- after three weeks of debate -- almost entirely along party lines, with every Democrat voting ""guilty"" on both charges and Republicans uniformly voting ""not guilty"" on the obstruction of Congress charge.Only one Republican, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, broke with his party to judge Mr. Trump guilty of abuse of power.It was the third impeachment trial of a president and the third acquittal in American history, and it ended the way it began: with Republicans and Democrats at odds. They disagreed over Mr. Trump's conduct and his fitness for office, even as some members of his own party conceded the basic allegations that undergirded the charges, that he sought to pressure Ukraine to smear his political rivals.But in a sign of the widening partisan divide testing the country and its institutions, the verdict did not promise finality, which members of both parties conceded would come only after the November election.The president himself did not directly address his acquittal, but shortly afterward, he announced on Twitter that he would make a public statement on Thursday at the White House about what he called ""our Country's VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax."" He then tweeted an attack ad against Mr. Romney that called the senator a ""Democrat secret asset.""At the Capitol earlier in the day, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who presided over the trial, put the question to senators shortly after 4 p.m.: ""Senators how say you? Is the respondent, Donald John Trump, president of the United States guilty or not guilty?""Seated at their mahogany desks, senators stood one by one to answer ""guilty"" or ""not guilty"" to each of the two articles of impeachment.""It is, therefore, ordered and adjudged that the said Donald John Trump be, and he is hereby, acquitted of the charges in said articles,"" declared Chief Justice Roberts after the second article was defeated.Democratic leaders immediately insisted the result was illegitimate, the product of a self-interested cover-up by Republicans, and promised to continue their investigations of Mr. Trump.""The verdict of this kangaroo court will be meaningless,"" Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said moments before the vote. ""By refusing the facts -- by refusing witnesses and documents -- the Republican majority has placed a giant asterisk, the asterisk of a sham trial, next to the acquittal of President Trump, written in permanent ink.""The president's Republican allies excoriated Democrats for a proceeding they said had damaged the country and its institutions in the name of saving them.""We will reject this incoherent case that comes nowhere near justifying the first presidential removal in history,"" said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.Yet at a news conference after the vote, Mr. McConnell declined several times to answer reporters who asked whether he considered Mr. Trump's actions appropriate.""This decision has been made,"" Mr. McConnell said curtly. ""As far as I'm concerned, it's in the rearview mirror.""As expected, the tally in favor of conviction on each article fell far below the 67-vote threshold necessary for removal. The first charge was abuse of power, accusing Mr. Trump of a scheme to use the levers of government to coerce Ukraine to do his political bidding. It did not even garner a majority vote, failing 48 to 52, with Mr. Romney voting with the Democrats. The second article, charging Mr. Trump with obstruction of Congress for an across-the-board blockade of House subpoenas and oversight requests, failed 47 to 53, strictly on party lines.Like this one, the trials of Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton also ended in acquittal -- a reflection of the Constitution's high burden for removing a chief executive.But in a stinging rebuke of the country's leader aimed at history, Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, said that Mr. Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine was ""the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine."" Though he voted against the second article, Mr. Romney became emotional on the Senate floor in the hours before the verdict on Wednesday as he described why he deemed Mr. Trump guilty of abuse of power, calling it a matter of conscience. He was the first senator ever to vote to remove a president of his own party.""I am sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters,"" Mr. Romney said. ""Does anyone seriously believe I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?""Mr. Romney's defection, which he announced a couple of hours before the final vote, was a stark reflection of the sweeping transformation of the Republican Party over the past eight years into one that is now dominated almost entirely by Mr. Trump. And it deprived the president of the monolithic Republican support he had eagerly anticipated.Still, the White House declared victory.""Today, the sham impeachment attempt concocted by Democrats ended in the full vindication and exoneration of President Donald J. Trump,"" said Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary. ""As we have said all along, he is not guilty.""Mr. Trump's re-election campaign moved quickly to capitalize on the moment, distributing a fund-raising email declaring, ""Sorry haters, I'm not going anywhere.""Several Republican senators ultimately acknowledged the heart of the House case -- that Mr. Trump undertook a concerted pressure campaign on Ukraine to secure politically beneficial investigations into his rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., using nearly $400 million in military aid as leverage.But most argued that the conduct was not sufficiently dangerous to warrant the Senate removing a president from office for the first time in history -- and certainly not with an election so near. Others dismissed Democrats' arguments altogether, insisting their case was merely an attempt to dress up hatred for Mr. Trump and his policies as a constitutional case.Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, two Republican swing votes who have tilted against the president in the past, both voted against conviction and removal. And two Democrats from traditionally conservative-leaning states, Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, voted to convict Mr. Trump, denying him the bipartisan acquittal he coveted.Although the verdict was never in doubt, Democrats lobbied to expand the scope of the Senate trial to include witnesses and documents that the president refused to provide during the House inquiry, working to pressure vulnerable Republicans facing challenging re-election contests, like Ms. Collins, to join them or risk being portrayed as beholden to Mr. Trump. All but two Republicans refused, making the trial the first impeachment proceeding in American history to reach a verdict without calling witnesses.As they closed their case, the seven Democratic House managers who prosecuted it warned that Mr. Trump would emerge only emboldened in his monarchical tendencies and that those who appeased him would be judged harshly by history. Republicans, they said, had chosen to leave the president's future up to voters despite evidence that he had tried to cheat in the election, and would continue to do so.Seldom used in American history, impeachment is the Constitution's most extreme mechanism for checking a corrupt or out of control officeholder. In unsheathing it, Democrats took on political risk that could backfire in November on their presidential nominee or their incumbents in Congress, including moderates in conservative districts and states where Mr. Trump is popular.At least one Democrat, Senator Doug Jones of Alabama, glancingly acknowledged that his vote to convict would most likely contribute to his loss this fall in deeply conservative Alabama.""There will be so many who will simply look at what I am doing today and say it is a profile in courage,"" Mr. Jones said before the vote. ""It is not. It is simply a matter of right and wrong.""For now, the impeachment of Mr. Trump appears to have evenly divided the nation. Public opinion polls suggest that even though a growing number of Americans agreed that the president most likely abused his office and acted improperly, more than a slight majority never agreed that he should be removed from office.If Mr. Trump's standing among the public has been hurt by the trial, it is not yet evident. To the contrary, the latest Gallup poll, released on Tuesday, showed that 49 percent of Americans approved of his job performance -- the highest figure since he took office three years ago. The same survey showed that Republicans' image has improved markedly, with 51 percent viewing them favorably compared with 43 percent in September.The possibility of impeachment has hung over Mr. Trump's presidency virtually since it began, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, initially resisted it. After Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who investigated Russia's election interference in 2016 and possible collaboration with the Trump campaign, found 10 instances of potential obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, she said impeachment was too divisive a remedy to pursue.Her calculations changed in September with the emergence of an anonymous C.I.A. whistle-blower that accused the president of marshaling the powers of government to press Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden and a theory that Democrats had colluded with Ukraine in the 2016 election. In authorizing the impeachment inquiry, Ms. Pelosi tasked the House Intelligence Committee to investigate the scheme and build a case.Mr. Trump issued a blanket directive to all government agencies not to comply with the inquiry, robbing investigators of key witnesses and facts that could have filled out their case, and ultimately giving rise to the obstruction of Congress charge.Still, more than a dozen administration officials came forward, offering testimony in private and then in scintillating public hearings that confirmed and expanded on the whistle-blower complaint. On Dec. 18, the House impeached Mr. Trump on both counts.To protect his Senate majority as much as the presidency, Mr. McConnell promised a swift acquittal -- and he delivered it. It was just 20 days from the time the articles of impeachment were first read on the Senate floor to Wednesday's vote. By comparison, the Clinton trial in 1999 lasted five weeks, and in 1868, the Senate took the better part of three months to try Johnson.The final shift in defenses by all but the most conservative of Mr. Trump's allies came last week, when The New York Times reported the first in a series of articles revealing that in August, Mr. Trump told John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, that he would not release the military aid for Ukraine until the country helped out with investigations into Mr. Biden and other Democrats.Impeachment was seriously contemplated for a president only once in the first two centuries of the American republic; it now has been so three times since the 1970s, and two of the past four presidents have been impeached.Reporting was contributed by Emily Cochrane, Catie Edmondson, Patricia Mazzei, Michael D.

| Jump to first hitThe representative from Hawaii, who often defied her own party, announced the end of her campaign and said she would back Joe Biden.Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, who ran a foreign policy-focused campaign for the presidential nomination of a party she sharply criticized, announced on Thursday that she was dropping out of the race.Ms. Gabbard, who had been one of only three candidates and the only woman remaining in the Democratic primary, said she would throw her support to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has accumulated a nearly insurmountable lead in the delegate count. Throughout the race, her campaign struggled to gain traction, never breaking double digits in state or national polls. She won only two delegates in the primary contests, both in American Samoa, where she was born.In a video posted to social media on Thursday, Ms. Gabbard said she felt she could better serve the country in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic in her capacity as a major in the Hawaii Army National Guard.""Our nation is facing an unprecedented global crisis that highlights the inextricable bonds of humanity, and how foreign policy and domestic policy are inseparable,"" she said. ""The best way I can be of service at this time is to continue to work for the health and well-being of the people of Hawaii and our country in Congress, and to stand ready to serve in uniform should the Hawaii National Guard be activated.""Ms. Gabbard, who resigned her vice chairmanship at the Democratic National Committee in 2016 to endorse the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mr. Biden's closest competitor this year, said she had ""great appreciation"" for Mr. Sanders's work.She also cited her relationship with Mr. Biden's son Beau, who served in the Delaware Army National Guard and died in 2015.""Although I may not agree with the vice president on every issue, I know that he has a good heart and is motivated by his love for our country and the American people,"" she said. ""I'm confident that he will lead our country guided by the spirit of aloha -- respect and compassion -- and thus help heal the divisiveness that has been tearing our country apart.""Ms. Gabbard, 38, announced late last year that she would not seek re-election to Congress in the fall.She campaigned for president on a noninterventionist foreign policy, denouncing ""regime-change wars"" and the idea of the United States as the world's police. She said her own deployments -- she served two tours of duty in the Middle East as a member of the National Guard -- had taught her the costs of war firsthand.""We should be coming to other leaders in other countries with respect, building a relationship based on cooperation rather than with, you know, a police baton,"" she said last year.Her unorthodox platform, a mix of noninterventionist foreign policy, liberal social policy and libertarian leanings on issues like drug decriminalization, attracted support from an unusual array of public backers. Alt-right internet stars, white nationalists, libertarian activists and some of the biggest boosters of Mr. Trump heaped praise on Ms. Gabbard.Many Democrats were far more skeptical of her effort, at a loss to explain her frequent appearances on Fox News, favorable coverage in Russian state media and an ideology that both argued for getting out of foreign wars and refused to strongly condemn some autocratic leaders.A public fight with Hillary Clinton brought attention and fund-raising dollars, keeping Ms. Gabbard on the primary debate stage and attracting some support from independent and Republican voters, particularly in libertarian-leaning New Hampshire.Ms. Gabbard was once seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party, even as she sometimes defied it.Her progressive economics and noninterventionist foreign policy seemed like obvious attractions for Democrats, her military résumé gave her extra credibility, and she broke barriers as the first Hindu and the first American Samoan elected to Congress. So it was not surprising when she entered the presidential race last January, even though no sitting representative has been elected president in 140 years.In a race that at its peak included six female candidates, Ms. Gabbard ended up becoming the last woman standing.But while she had a deeply devoted base, it was not large enough to sustain her. And at times, she seemed to be campaigning against the same party whose nomination she was seeking.""Our Democratic Party, unfortunately, is not the party that is of, by and for the people,"" she said at a debate in November. ""It is a party that has been and continues to be influenced by the foreign policy establishment in Washington, represented by Hillary Clinton and others' foreign policy, by the military industrial complex and other greedy corporate interests.""President Trump's re-election campaign seized on that remark, clipping the first sentence and blasting it out on Twitter before the debate had even ended.Perhaps no emblem of the establishment was a better foil for Ms. Gabbard than Mrs. Clinton, who suggested in October that Russia was backing Ms. Gabbard's campaign and that Republicans were ""grooming"" her as a third-party candidate. Ms. Gabbard pushed back fiercely, calling Mrs. Clinton ""the queen of warmongers, embodiment of corruption and personification of the rot that has sickened the Democratic Party for so long"" and then suing her for defamation.The clash helped raise Ms. Gabbard's profile and won over some voters -- including independents and conservatives -- who dislike the Clintons, while simultaneously alienating some members of the party's usual base.Ms. Gabbard also broke from the Democratic pack on impeachment. She was the last candidate to back an inquiry last year, and when the articles of impeachment came to the House floor in December, she was the only Democrat who refused to cast a yes-or-no vote.""I came to the conclusion that I could not in good conscience vote either yes or no,"" she said at the time, calling the process too partisan. ""I am standing in the center and have decided to vote present.""PhotographRepresentative Tulsi Gabbard had been the last woman in the Democratic presidential primary.

| Jump to first hitMr. Biden announced on Thursday that he had hired Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, who was Beto O'Rourke's campaign manager.WASHINGTON -- Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. announced on Thursday that he had hired Jennifer O'Malley Dillon as his new campaign manager, elevating a veteran Democratic strategist as he tries to scale up his limited organization and pivot toward President Trump and the general election.Ms. O'Malley Dillon, 43, managed former Representative Beto O'Rourke's presidential campaign last year and before that was a top aide on former President Barack Obama's re-election team.""She will be a tremendous asset to a campaign that is only growing and getting stronger as we prepare to take the fight to Donald Trump this fall,"" Mr. Biden said in a statement.His decision to bring on a new campaign manager in what could be the last days before he claims the Democratic nomination was not, however, merely a step toward expanding his team.Presidential campaigns always grow as they transition from the primary to the fall election, which Mr. Biden is plainly doing after building a near-insurmountable delegate lead against Senator Bernie Sanders. But installing Ms. O'Malley Dillon amounted to a recognition by Mr. Biden that he must make major changes to better position himself for a race against Mr. Trump, who has spent months stockpiling cash and building his re-election machinery.The choice of Ms. O'Malley Dillon, who remains close to Mr. Obama's inner circle, also serves as a signal to Democratic donors and elected officials that Mr. Biden is revamping an operation that, until his Super Tuesday success, had been underfunded and lightly staffed.Mr. Biden enjoyed a sudden reversal of fortune in South Carolina last month that has extended into March, but he was unable to build the sort of expansive organization enjoyed by most presidential front-runners. He had no staff members on the ground in many of the Super Tuesday states he won.Well before that, though, his organization prompted considerable grumbling from longtime Democratic officials, in part because it was not always responsive and in part because it was, like all of Mr. Biden's past campaigns, a multi-headed hydra consisting of advisers old and new.Even on the day of the vote in South Carolina, which would turn his campaign around, Mr. Biden's most prized supporter said he desperately needed to make changes.""I'm not going to sit idly by and watch people mishandle this campaign,"" said Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, whose endorsement helped propel Mr. Biden to victory there.By hiring Ms. O'Malley Dillon now, Mr. Biden is effectively trying to catch his organization up to his success and status as the Democratic front-runner.And the former vice president still has considerable work to do to unify his party, which is deeply divided along generational and ideological lines. The youngest and most liberal voters supported Mr. Sanders in this week's primaries, exit polls showed, even as Mr. Biden enjoyed commanding victories overall.Before she can fully turn to taking on Mr. Trump, Ms. O'Malley Dillon first must work to mollify Mr. Sanders and, in what may be an even greater challenge, his die-hard supporters.What remains of the primary, however, may largely be conducted online. In a memo on Thursday, the Biden campaign told staff members across the country that they should work from home.Ms. O'Malley Dillon first joined Mr. Biden's campaign in a volunteer capacity earlier this year, helping his team in Nevada, where he finished second after back-to-back disastrous showings in Iowa and New Hampshire.Before she managed Mr. O'Rourke's campaign, which ended in November, Ms. O'Malley Dillon worked on both of Mr. Obama's presidential bids and did a stint as the executive director of the Democratic National Committee. A Massachusetts native, she also worked on a series of state and local campaigns before moving to Washington, where she is a partner in the public relations consultancy Precision Strategies.Her arrival at Mr. Biden's Philadelphia headquarters could assuage a number of Democrats, including Mr. Obama and his acolytes, who have long been uneasy about the former vice president's operation. In addition to her own connection to the president, Ms. O'Malley Dillon's husband, Patrick Dillon, also worked in the Obama White House.Ms. O'Malley Dillon's hiring was immediately greeted with enthusiasm by a number of Democrats. ""I will no doubt be one of a chorus to say this, but absolutely excellent move by Joe Biden,"" said Todd Schulte, a progressive advocacy leader and campaign veteran.Mr. Biden already shook up his campaign last month, installing Anita Dunn, a longtime adviser, as his chief strategist. She is expected to remain in that role.Greg Schultz, the original campaign manager, clashed with some in Mr. Biden's orbit but is well-liked by a number of colleagues. Some of his admirers pointed out that, for all the criticism the campaign has received, Mr. Biden is now on the doorstep of the Democratic nomination after the campaign played out as Mr. Schultz had predicted.For months, he assured Democrats that even if Mr. Biden were to struggle in heavily white Iowa and New Hampshire, which voted first this year, he would recover in more diverse Nevada and South Carolina and be catapulted into Super Tuesday.Mr. Schultz was planning to stay on the campaign to work on ""organizational planning for the general election,"" according to Mr. Biden's statement.That task, said Robby Mook, the campaign manager for Hillary Clinton in 2016, ""is an enormous undertaking"" and suits Mr. Schultz, who is close to a number of national and state party officials. ""Greg comes with the deep trust of the vice president and long experience building state operations,"" Mr. Mook said.On Thursday, Mr. Schultz's colleagues offered him their own gratitude.At an all-staff meeting to discuss the leadership change, the Biden aides showered him with a long round of applause, according to a staff member there.Katie Glueck contributed reporting from Wilmington, Del.PhotographJennifer O'Malley Dillon led Beto O'Rourke's bid last year.

| Jump to first hitFor more than 30 years, over three presidential runs, Mr. Biden has been waiting to notch a victory like the one in South Carolina. Now he has to face the test of Super Tuesday.
GREENVILLE, S.C. — Joe Biden did what he had to do, and then some. Now, his supporters say, it is time for fellow moderates to do the same.
With a commanding victory on Saturday, Mr. Biden made a compelling case that he is the Democrat best positioned to head off the nomination of Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist senator whom centrists fear would doom the party this fall.
Next comes the awkward part.
If a place like South Carolina, built to reward Mr. Biden’s strength with black voters, helped mask some of his weaknesses for one week, his fate ahead of Super Tuesday is still shadowed by the preceding failures of both Mr. Biden’s campaign and the candidate himself. These aftereffects are already complicating a stretch that finds his rivals preaching patience as Biden allies demand urgency — and unity, around him.
After months as the front-runner, with the power to clear the field if he excelled, Mr. Biden is now a candidate at once determined and dependent. He is convinced that he has done enough to demonstrate his dominance with a core Democratic constituency and affirm his argument that no one is better suited to take on President Trump. “If the Democrats want a nominee who’s a Democrat — A lifelong Democrat! A proud Democrat! An Obama-Biden Democrat! — then join us,” he told supporters in Columbia, S.C., speaking with more force and precision than usual. “We have the option of winning big or losing big. That’s the choice.”
Mr. Biden took direct, conspicuous aim at Mr. Sanders: “Talk about revolution isn’t changing anyone’s life,” he said. “We need real changes, right now.”
But for all his undeniable success on Saturday, Mr. Biden remains hamstrung on two fronts: by several competitors still disinclined to stand down, even if they siphon crucial non-Sanders votes, and by a campaign organization that party officials have described as jarringly thin in many of the states that will vote on Tuesday.
His ability to address either of these problems in time is far from assured, in a primary that has already exposed his capacity for bungling on the campaign trail, his enthusiasm deficit with many younger voters and his struggles in fund-raising.
Why would Michael R. Bloomberg step aside, before the states he is contesting have even voted, with hundreds of millions of dollars already sunk into his bid and a conviction that he is the man for the job?
What do Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar owe Mr. Biden, whom they each dusted in New Hampshire (and, in Mr. Buttigieg’s case, in Iowa), where the voters who spend the most time with their candidates decided that the former vice president could not be trusted to defeat President Trump?
The result is a party establishment that agrees on the desired end of avoiding a Sanders nomination but is still bickering about the means.
The most creative among old-guard Democrats have spent recent weeks gaming out knotty scenarios to keep Mr. Sanders from the top of the ticket: a convention migration to another contender if Mr. Sanders falls short of a pledged delegate majority or the drafting, somehow, of a white-knight candidate who is not even running.
But settling for Mr. Biden would appear to be the straightest line. And in the coming days, his supporters plan to argue, loudly, that the time for dithering has passed.
“The case you’re going to make is, ‘Look, guys, this is the only alternative to Bernie, which is the only alternative to losing the election to Trump, and we need to consolidate,’” said Rufus Gifford, who was finance director for Barack Obama’s re-election campaign and supports Mr. Biden. But, he quickly acknowledged, “the big challenge there is Bloomberg. We all know that the Bloomberg vote is not going to Bernie, for the most part. So without a doubt, Bloomberg could be playing a spoiler.”
Top Democratic officials in key battleground states that go to the polls Tuesday, from Alabama to Texas, have said that Mr. Bloomberg poses an acute threat to Mr. Biden, eating into his standing with moderate voters. It does not help that early voting has already been underway in many states against the backdrop of Mr. Biden’s bleak finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
In interviews over the past week, a number of Mr. Biden’s top surrogates in key Super Tuesday states have heightened their attacks on the former New York City mayor, a sign of escalating tensions to come. “Bloomberg is spending a lot of money on the ground,” said Representative Terri Sewell, Democrat of Alabama. “But there’s one thing I know for a fact: People in my district died and fought for the right to vote, and that vote is not for sale.”
Yet the Alabama Democratic Conference, a powerful black caucus in the state, has endorsed Mr. Bloomberg, as has Anthony Daniels, the Alabama House minority leader.
In North Carolina, too, Mr. Bloomberg has racked up a host of powerful endorsers and locked down some of the state’s top strategists. Representative Alma Adams, a Biden supporter, was sharply dismissive, calling Mr. Bloomberg “doomed” in the state and noting that he was once a Republican.
“People aren’t stupid around here,” she said. “I think he’s trying to trick his way in, claiming to be a Democrat and claiming to have close ties with Obama.”
Mr. Bloomberg’s presence is not the Biden campaign’s only cause for concern. On Saturday, Mr. Biden’s most important endorser in South Carolina, Representative James E. Clyburn, acknowledged organizational problems and, in a CNN interview, raised the prospect of assessing “how we retool this campaign.”
But Biden advisers are hoping that his victory in South Carolina will resonate in states, congressional districts and media markets that, like this state, have a significant base of African-American Democrats.
Mr. Biden is scheduled to visit Selma, Ala., and Norfolk, Va., on Sunday, and Houston and Dallas on Monday before heading to California. The campaign is also optimistic about an influx of cash that traditionally comes with primary victories. Such an infusion could be plowed into both his Super Tuesday operation and the states that vote later in March. There are also efforts underway to organize fund-raisers throughout the rest of the month.
“Hopefully, some other of the candidates will really start thinking about, you know, stepping away and letting this race shape up where the democratic socialist folks can have their say, and the moderates to the left can have their say,” said Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio and a former 2020 presidential candidate who is supporting Mr. Biden. “And we can have an argument to the finish.”
Mr. Ryan said that he would be at one of several organizing events the campaign is holding in his state on Sunday. He hopes to persuade Sanders opponents that Mr. Biden must be embraced for the good of the party.
Of course, “the party” is less a monolith than an unruly collection of fiefdoms, none necessarily powerful enough to make candidates or voters come to heel through sheer force of will or strongly-worded-statement.
For 2020 contenders, who have committed a year or more to the cause, the incentives to drop out have perhaps never been weaker than in this political era. Even lower-polling candidates are often still drawing large crowds, still appraising a field without a runaway favorite, still being told that the fight is worth fighting, especially in a campaign so unpredictable.
“Everybody believes they are two days away from the big turnaround,” said Jennifer Palmieri, a former top aide to Mr. Obama and Hillary Clinton. “It’s also a candidate and staff on the ride of their lives. To be like, ‘We’re going to drop out and go back to the Senate on Tuesday’ — it’s just not appealing.”
Some Democratic eminences have begun hinting unsubtly, after an early primary season in which an unusually large number of credible choices have stayed on the stage.
Barbara Boxer, a former California senator who spoke fondly of Mr. Biden, her onetime colleague, said she would “never tell other people what to do.” But underperforming candidates, she added, “ought to look at what their staying in the race means to the country, to the party and to their own reputations.” Ms. Boxer said she hoped to announce an endorsement on Sunday.
Many Biden-inclined voters have been less diplomatic. After the former vice president’s event in Spartanburg, S.C., on Friday evening, Antwion Yowe, 43, a local pastor, summoned a favored family analogy about separating standout options from the rest.
“My dad used to say: ‘barbecue and mildew,’” he said. “You’re either barbecue and you go forward, or you’re mildew and you’re done.” After South Carolina, he suggested, everyone except Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders belonged in the latter camp.
Even if his peers were to fall away, Mr. Biden’s path would not be straightforward. Mr. Sanders has shown himself capable of building a formidable coalition, particularly in his blowout win in Nevada a week ago. He remains the favorite in California, the grandest delegate trove on the map. He has also flashed a victor’s swagger in scheduling events in the home states of two fellow hopefuls, which also happen to have primaries on Tuesday: Massachusetts, represented in the Senate by Elizabeth Warren, and Minnesota, the province of Ms. Klobuchar.
Any further setback for Ms. Warren could prove especially helpful to Mr. Sanders, potentially sending some of her progressive supporters into his camp. But voters do not always behave ideologically, a fact that cuts both ways for Mr. Sanders as Mr. Biden banks on a boost if other center-left candidates drop out: Some of that support will drift to Mr. Sanders even if voters do not align precisely with him on policy.
For one evening, though, Mr. Biden and his team seemed content not to dwell much on any of that. In Columbia on Saturday night, Mr. Biden — who has often campaigned in smaller venues — walked onstage to a raucous victory rally in a large gym. “We love you, Joe!” someone cried out.
“We can say, without fear of contradiction, the Bidens love you guys,” Mr. Biden replied. “The Bidens love you. That’s real.”
He had won a state for the first time in his life — in his third presidential campaign, more than three decades after his first.
He had three whole days before he would have to do some winning again.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump is 73. His leading rival is 77. And many of their strongest supporters -- vulnerable to the coronavirus but enormously influential politically -- are eligible for Social Security.LAS VEGAS -- Joseph R. Biden Jr. wasn't accustomed to overflow audiences.It was a Tuesday evening in February and Mr. Biden had limped into Las Vegas, bruised from his disappointing showings in the Iowa and New Hampshire nominating contests. But at Harbor Palace Seafood Restaurant, a dim sum spot here, a crowd of retirees had packed in to see the 77-year-old former vice president, forming a line that snaked out the door.""I don't like Warren and I don't like Bernie because they want 'Medicare for all,""' said Alan Davis, 80, dismissing the single-payer health care system promoted by Senator Bernie Sanders, 78. ""I'm totally against it. I have a good health plan.""Mr. Biden is ""really human. He can feel how an ordinary person feels,"" said Minerva Honkala, a retired teacher who identified herself as ""65-plus.""Mr. Biden's ability to connect with Ms. Honkala's age group -- through his résumé and more centrist tendencies, his talk of shared values and his perceived general election promise -- helped him regain his footing in Nevada, surge to victory in South Carolina and catapult to his perch as the likely Democratic nominee. It was a rapid reversal of fortunes fueled by overwhelming support first from older black voters and, ultimately, from older voters more broadly, a key part of his larger coalition.Now that age group is top of mind for many Americans as the nation confronts the staggering costs of the coronavirus crisis. It's a vulnerable population in terms of the outbreak -- and has become the focus of the public conversation. Health officials are pleading for young people to stay home to protect their parents and grandparents, while in Texas, Dan Patrick, the Republican lieutenant governor, suggested that older people might be willing to take risks in order to protect the economy, sparking a national controversy.But politically, the primary results this election season have highlighted the extraordinary, sustained power of older Americans: Exit polls, surveys and interviews with political strategists and demographers show that the concerns and preferences of these voters have played a critical role in defining the trajectory of the Democratic race so far, and are poised to do so in the general election as well.In Florida, a state with a significant retiree population, Mr. Biden won the Democratic primary last week by nearly 40 percentage points, a reflection of both his momentum in the race and his strength with constituencies including more moderate Latino voters, African-Americans and college-educated white suburbanites. Among voters aged 65 and over, Mr. Biden's advantage was even starker: He was the choice of 70 percent of those voters, while 5 percent said the same of Mr. Sanders, according to a National Election Pool pre-election survey of Florida voters.""Older voters, after African-American voters, have been the single most important constituency for Joe Biden,"" said Celinda Lake, a veteran Democratic pollster and political strategist who works with the Biden team but spoke in her personal capacity.Younger voters have had ""tremendous influence"" in shaping the contours of the Democratic debate, pushing boldly progressive ideas on matters like student loan debt reform to the fore, said John Della Volpe, the director of polling at Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics.When it comes to electoral outcomes, however, young people are being outflanked: ""Rather than increasing their influence in 2020, what's happened is, their parents and grandparents have increased their influence,"" he said.Those Democratic grandparents, especially, tend to be more moderate, more swayed by traditional government experience and more keenly focused on the tactics they believe are needed to defeat President Trump, strategists and pollsters said.Mr. Biden, who once faced significant competition for older Americans, emerged in recent weeks as the dominant front-runner among those highly committed Democratic voters who have now helped bring him to the cusp of his party's presidential nomination.Older voters have punched above their political weight for years, with turnout among those 65 and older often double, or more, that of the youngest voters. As Americans age and become more rooted in their communities, political participation tends to rise with their stake in society.Even in the midterm elections in 2018, hailed as a high-water mark for youth voting because the share of 18- to 24-year-olds nearly doubled from the previous midterm election, the gap with older voters remained about the same. About 66 percent of eligible older people turned out, compared with about 36 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds, said William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution.""There's no magic age for becoming a regular voter,"" said Carroll Doherty, the director of political research at the Pew Research Center. ""But when people move into their 40s, that's when you see voter turnout grow.""Certainly, Mr. Sanders, the overwhelming favorite with younger voters, is continuing to campaign. And while the Vermont senator has acknowledged that younger voters did not appear to turn out at the rate he had hoped for, polls and exit surveys show that Mr. Biden faces major challenges with that constituency, a liberal slice of the electorate that, his advisers acknowledge, he will need to energize if he is the nominee.His standing with older voters is also poised to look different in a general election, where that demographic is again influential -- but traditionally has tilted much more conservative.""The irony is that the pattern is about to reverse in the general,"" Ms. Lake said, pointing to Mr. Trump's overall strength with older voters, even as she added that ""Donald Trump is despised by younger voters.""The virus has thrown politics completely, and unpredictably, up in the air. What will happen in Florida's retirement communities -- some of the most vulnerable in the nation to the virus -- if Mr. Trump's push to reopen the country fast comes to pass? It's a question with potentially partisan implications.Older people have long leaned Republican. A majority have chosen Republicans in four of the last seven presidential elections, according to Mr. Frey. In recent years they have also become more demographically distinct from the rest of the country: About 78 percent of eligible senior voters are white, compared with just 67 percent of eligible voters in the country as a whole.Older voters favored Mr. Trump in 2016. In Pennsylvania, they preferred him by a 10-point margin, Mr. Frey said. In all, 52 percent of older people -- and 58 percent of white seniors -- voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, Mr. Frey said.Seniors also show up, particularly in swing states. In the Midwestern states of Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016, turnout among older voters was higher than the national average for that age group, according to Mr. Frey. In Michigan, for example, 74 percent of older eligible voters turned out, compared with just 38 percent of 18- to 24-year-old eligible voters.This presents a challenge for Mr. Biden, should he win the nomination: how to get younger voters -- who did not prefer him to begin with -- to turn out for him, while persuading their older counterparts, who tend to choose Republicans, to vote for him over Mr. Trump.In recent weeks, Mr. Biden has increased his efforts to appeal to younger and more progressive voters, ramping up outreach and embracing portions of proposals from Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren that take aim at the student debt burden.But throughout the primary contest, Mr. Biden's most consistent overtures were to older voters, both substantively and through explicit and more subtle messaging.His inaugural bus trip across Iowa was called the ""No Malarkey"" tour, a phrase that struck some younger voters as dated, following Mr. Biden's proactive mention, in an autumn debate, of a record player. It didn't seem out of step with the older crowds at his events, where Mr. Biden would often aim to connect over what he cast as similar upbringings.""The way we were raised, all of you were raised, the way I was raised, everything's about integrity and decency,"" he said in Emmetsburg, Iowa, in December.On the policy front, his experience in foreign affairs and his support for building on the Affordable Care Act while allowing Americans the option of maintaining their private insurance resonated with older voters.There were ""almost pragmatic, urgent worries about health care that people want addressed in the short term,"" Stanley B. Greenberg, a longtime Democratic pollster, said when asked about the age gap at play in the primary. Several Sanders priorities, he continued, including ""Medicare for all, climate change and student debt -- almost all of them are kind of long term.""Younger voters who were focused on the future, he added, ""have more space to deal with it.""Mr. Biden struggled in Iowa and New Hampshire, when he faced a crowded primary field and significant competition for many demographics. Over the summer and into the fall, older people often voiced concerns about Mr. Biden's sharpness and stamina. Voters who were close to Mr. Biden's age were often keenly aware of their own limitations -- and some worried about whether he faced the same challenges they did.""Early on, they weren't sold on Joe Biden,"" said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. ""Many of them felt he was too old.""Those voters, he said, were also drawn to candidates like Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota or former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. But as those candidates dropped out and endorsed Mr. Biden on the eve of Super Tuesday, he shored up his strength with older white voters, while his appeal to older black voters continued apace: He went on to win the support of a stunning 94 percent of black voters over the age of 60 in Mississippi, according to exit polls.Older Americans will soon be even more important. Mr. Frey noted that the large ""Baby Boom"" generation has only just begun entering the older American voting bloc. He has calculated that the number of senior eligible voters will rise to 68 million in 2028 from 47 million in 2016.""The second half of the boomer generation has yet to turn 65,"" he said. ""When more of them do, they are going to make this older voting bloc even more prized, especially in the northern swing states like Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania.""Mr. Biden, who was born in Scranton, Pa., and emphasizes his working-class roots, is not ceding those voters, and his allies argue that his strong performance with older voters in the primary signals an ability to cut into what has historically been a Republican advantage in the general election.Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said that Mr. Biden would offer a clear contrast with Mr. Trump's record on health care and social safety net matters, promising that ""older Americans will remember whose values align with theirs this fall."" Sarah Matthews, a spokeswoman for the Trump campaign, defended that record, calling Mr. Trump a ""proven champion for seniors"" -- a sign of possible clashes to come.But first, there is still a primary contest, and the age gap between Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders has been on vivid display all year. The senator favored large rallies that attracted devoted young people, while Mr. Biden's events, even in his strongest states, tended to be smaller, with crowds that tilted older.Now, because the coronavirus outbreak forced an end to traditional campaigning, Mr. Biden's efforts to reach voters -- old and young -- are typically online anyway.He and his team are working on a podcast and he has hosted a virtual happy hour with younger supporters -- but his efforts have faced technological difficulties, and Mr. Biden has admitted it is challenging to adjust.""As you can tell,"" he wrote in a newsletter on Wednesday, ""I'm still getting used to this virtual world we're campaigning in.""PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at a rally in Las Vegas last month.

| Jump to first hitLatino voters in California, Texas and around the country are invested in picking someone who can beat President Trump, though they don't all agree on who that is.LOS ANGELES -- Latino voters are poised to pick the Democratic nominee.Long overlooked by the political establishment and dismissed as a sleeping giant of a demographic that didn't vote as reliably as it could, millions of Latinos are expected to go to the polls on Tuesday in key states like Colorado, Virginia, North Carolina and, most significantly, in Texas and California.One analysis estimates that roughly one-third of the 643 delegates up for grabs in those two states will be determined by Latino voters.Latinos are expected to make up the largest nonwhite ethnic voting bloc in 2020. Around the country, Latino Democrats are seeking the candidate who is best poised to take on President Trump, who many believe has placed a target on their own backs with his anti-immigrant rhetoric. These voters, far from a monolith but united on some key issues, will cast their ballots in Texas exactly seven months after the deadliest anti-Latino attack in modern American history took place in El Paso.""It's hard to be Latino right now,"" said Christian Arana, the policy director for the Latino Community Foundation, a philanthropic group based in California. ""There are so many of us who feel we have to constantly be on the watch for something terrible. People are channeling their anger into voting in a way we have not seen historically.""Polls have consistently shown that Latino voters in Texas and California list health care, economic inequality and immigration as their top issues. But the upcoming primaries are likely to show the splits and contradictions among the group. Interviews with dozens of Latino voters in El Paso and Los Angeles in recent days show that though Mr. Sanders has built up a loyal base among Latinos, particularly younger and working-class voters, there are many lifelong Democrats who are still searching for a moderate alternative.""It's a historic moment and a historic disappointment because yet again we are the most underinvested community from the establishment and the big donors and yet still in every election, the Latino voting segment keeps growing,"" said Héctor Sánchez Barba, the executive director of Mi Familia Vota, which does Latino voter outreach throughout the country. In 2018, Latino voters helped flip several Congressional districts to the Democrats.Now, he said, is the time Latino groups are pressing to get more promises from candidates on what they will do on health care, education and immigration.Democratic candidates have made more of an effort in recent weeks to court Latino voters, recognizing the decisive role they could play on Super Tuesday. No other candidate has put more effort into courting Latinos than Senator Bernie Sanders, who has made it clear that he is counting on Latinos as a kind of firewall on Tuesday, nationally and particularly in California. So far, recent surveys seem to reflect that effort: Mr. Sanders has a significant lead among Latino voters in both Texas and California, ahead of his rivals by double digits.""We've lived in fear for our families for the last three years,"" said Janette Espino, a 26-year-old sports merchandising buyer from Long Beach, Calif., who attended a rally for Mr. Sanders in Los Angeles Sunday. Ms. Espino said health care was the most important issue for her, but added that she has several family members who are undocumented immigrants. She said several of other family members had become citizens in the last two years and planned to cast their first ballot Tuesday, choosing Mr. Sanders. ""We've never had a candidate for president who listened to us like this, who we are really excited about.""Seeming to recognize the need for more of an effort targeting the Latino community, Joseph R. Biden Jr. held rallies in Texas leading up to Super Tuesday, and touted the endorsement of Congresswoman Veronica Escobar of El Paso. And on Saturday, four former Latino cabinet secretaries from the Clinton and Obama administrations published a letter in La Opinion, Los Angeles' largest Spanish-language newspaper, urging their ""Latino brothers and sisters"" to vote for Mr. Biden, arguing that they ""know Joe"" and that he is ""running to restore the American dream.""Former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has poured in a record-breaking amount of money into Spanish-language advertising in California and Texas. Mr. Bloomberg's campaign has focused particularly on finding local endorsements from heavily Latino regions and featuring those leaders in ""Ganamos Con Mike"" advertisements.Like Mr. Sanders's campaign, Mr. Bloomberg has opened field offices in heavily Latino regions that have long been ignored in presidential elections, such as the Central Valley and the Inland Empire in California. The campaign has also sent millions of campaign mailers to Hispanic voters in both states.""What used to happen was you avoided talking about Latinos until Florida,"" said Mayra Macías, the executive director of Latino Victory Fund, which tries to get more Latinos elected and backed Mr. Biden last month. ""Now we are seeing that there is no path to victory without speaking holistically to them.""In some ways, California Latinos began their steady march to political power after Proposition 187, an anti-immigrant ballot initiative approved by voters in 1994. Dozens of current Latino elected officials in the state became engaged in activism during the protests against the measure, which was eventually struck down by the courts. And many in California believe that Texas Latinos are in the midst of a similar political transformation.It has now been nearly seven months since the shooting at an El Paso Walmart. The white 21-year-old gunman, Patrick Crusius, turned a Saturday morning in the binational, majority-Hispanic border city into a scene of horror: He killed 22 people and wounded nearly two dozen others. Most of those killed or injured were either Mexicans or Mexican-Americans.Minutes before the shooting, the gunman had posted an anti-immigrant manifesto online, declaring that the attack was in response to ""the Hispanic invasion of Texas."" He wrote that he feared that the Hispanic population in Texas would make it a Democratic stronghold that would ""win nearly every presidential election.""For 27-year-old Elisa Tamayo, the shooting last year was personal. It was her neighborhood Walmart, a place to shop and meet her family from across the border. One of her mother's friends was killed in the attack -- Maria Eugenia Legarreta Rothe, 58, from the Mexican state of Chihuahua. Ms. Tamayo called her ""tía,"" Spanish for aunt, although they were not related.But for Ms. Tamayo, the attack has since veered to the political.She is running for public office for the first time in her life, pushed in part by the Walmart shooting and the rhetoric from President Trump and state Republican leaders that she believes fueled the anti-Latino hatred of the gunman. Ms. Tamayo is vying to become a Democratic lawmaker in the state House of Representatives and to represent the House district that includes the Walmart. She announced her candidacy eight weeks after the shooting, standing with relatives and supporters in front of a mural reading ""El Paso Strong.""Ms. Tamayo, who is on the Democratic primary ballot in El Paso on Tuesday and who voted for Ms. Warren for president, said that in knocking on doors for her campaign, she has seen firsthand a new level of engagement of Hispanic voters.""We've been knocking on doors for more than three months, and I keep hearing that they want to vote in this election,"" she said. ""They really want to vote in this election because they feel like we've got to get Trump out of office. Instead of saying my vote doesn't matter, I think people are now more willing to show up and more willing to vote because of that.""Around El Paso, many people described similar reasons for voting: Mr. Trump's rhetoric and the shooting last summer. But they came to different conclusions about their preferred candidates.Anna Casas, 33, a single mother and home health aide in El Paso, voted for the first time in her life last week -- her vote went to Mr. Sanders, and she had registered to vote last year about three months after the attack at the Walmart, where she would often shop with her three sons. ""What about if we were there and that happened?"" she said. ""It did open my eyes. It pushed me to vote.""Ms. Casas said it was clear to her that Mr. Trump's words fueled the shooter's hatred of Hispanics.""I'm trying to push other people to vote, because they think that their vote doesn't matter,"" she said. ""But it actually does. I used to think that way, honestly, until Trump became president.""Irma Vasquez, 67, a former school-district worker who voted for Mr. Bloomberg, put the role the president's words played in the attack this way, tugging at the skin on her cheek: ""He put a bull's-eye on our backs, especially this color.""Pedro Gandara, 74, a retired telephone-company repairman and Air Force veteran who voted for Mr. Biden, said Mr. Trump evokes for him the anti-Latino racism he has faced his entire life. He remembered being refused service at a restaurant in the Panhandle city of Amarillo when he was a high school student.""This was '63 or '64, so the racism has been here ever since, but Trump has really brought it out,"" Mr. Gandara said. ""He's very much against us all.""Perhaps no one exemplified the split of Latino Democratic voters in Texas heading into Super Tuesday better than the Balcazar family.Last Wednesday, Miguel Balcazar, 66, a retired middle-school history teacher, walked slowly to an early voting site at a recreation center in the city's Mission Valley neighborhood, a little more than two miles from the scene of the Walmart shooting. He used a cane because of his knee problems as his wife, Lucinda, 65, a retired special-education teacher's assistant, walked alongside him, just as slowly. They've been married for 41 years.They were making their way cautiously to vote, but they were eager for political revolution. When they got back to their car wearing ""I voted"" stickers, both said they had supported Mr. Sanders.""I feel strongly that he's more radical than anything else,"" Mr. Balcazar said of Mr. Sanders.Their three sons were not with them, but their parents know exactly how they will vote. One of their sons plans on voting for Mr. Sanders, one is undecided and the other will vote for Mr. Trump, a sign of the Hispanic Republican support for the president that exists in a conservative state like Texas.""I can't change his mind,"" Mr. Balcazar said, shaking his head and adding with a chuckle, ""He says, 'Dad, I'm going to put the sign up on top of your roof, because you can't get up there anymore.""'Jennifer Medina reported from Los Angeles, and Manny Fernandez from El Paso.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders, campaigning in San Jose, Calif., left, has built up a loyal base of younger and working-class Latino voters. Elisa Tamayo, 27, right, was motivated to run for the Texas legislature by the deadly mass shooting at a Walmart in El Paso last year.

| Jump to first hitIf Super Tuesday boiled down the primary to a two-man contest, then its smaller sequel a week later made it plain that the race is now Joe Biden's to lose.It was a drubbing.Four years ago, the Missouri Democratic primary was one of the closest in the nation in the grinding and protracted campaign between Senator Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.On Tuesday, the state was called just moments after the polls had closed in favor of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The early call represented the beginning of the second straight week of Biden victories. This week's were so thorough that Mr. Sanders opted against even delivering a televised address to the nation.""There's no sugarcoating it,"" Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a top Sanders surrogate, said in a livestream on her Instagram page. ""Tonight's a tough night.""If Super Tuesday boiled down the primary to a two-man contest, then its smaller sequel made it plain that the race is now Mr. Biden's to lose.The results demonstrated the breadth of Mr. Biden's sudden and enviable political coalition of black voters, women, older voters and white voters with college degrees. In Michigan, the biggest prize of the night and a state that Mr. Sanders carried four years ago, Mr. Biden was winning in urban areas, suburban areas and rural areas.Mr. Sanders was on pace to win zero counties in Missouri and Mississippi. He lost Idaho, where he won in 2016. And Washington State, seemingly favorable terrain for Mr. Sanders, was too close to call.Here are five takeaways from the results now that about 46 percent of delegates have been allocated:Joe Biden has taken control of the primary.Only three weeks ago, after a landslide loss in Nevada, Mr. Biden was struggling and Mr. Sanders was ascendant.The race has inverted entirely since then.A string of Biden victories across the Midwest and the South showcased the power of Mr. Biden's political coalition, anchored first by black voters but now also winning over white voters in the suburbs and rural areas that four years ago made the primary between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton so competitive.In Michigan, where Mr. Sanders had focused much of his attention in the last week, he was leading in none of the state's 83 counties as of early Wednesday, and trailing Mr. Biden by double digits statewide. In Missouri, Mr. Sanders was also trailing in every single county in a state where he won dozens of counties in 2016. And in Mississippi, Mr. Sanders was getting thrashed, with Mr. Biden topping 80 percent of the vote.The margin of black support for Mr. Biden over Mr. Sanders in Mississippi was breathtaking: 87 percent to 10 percent, according to the exit poll.The calendar does not get significantly easier for Mr. Sanders in the next two weeks. Three of the four states that vote next week have sizable black voting populations: Illinois (a 28 percent black electorate in the 2016 primary, according to the exit poll), Ohio (20 percent) and Florida (27 percent).Given Mr. Sanders's struggles in Michigan on Tuesday, it is not clear why he would do significantly better in nearby Ohio and Illinois. Then the next week comes Georgia, where black voters made up half of the Democratic electorate four years ago.But it was hardly just black voters lifting Mr. Biden. In Missouri, for instance, the story was about white voters who sided with Mr. Sanders in 2016 but backed Mr. Biden in 2020. Exit polls showed that Mr. Sanders led Mrs. Clinton by nine percentage points among white voters there; Mr. Biden was up by 12 points this year.Bernie Sanders's demographic disadvantages are hardening.The wave of new and younger voters that Mr. Sanders has banked much of his candidacy on simply has not shown up.The results were especially stark in Missouri.There, voters under 45 years old were 41 percent of the electorate in 2016; those same voters accounted for only 32 percent of the electorate in 2020. The biggest jump, in terms of share of the electorate, came among Mr. Biden's strongest group: those 65 or older, who were 31 percent of the electorate, up from only 22 percent four years ago.Mr. Biden carried older voters with a colossal 81 percent support, an even bigger share than Mr. Sanders had among those under 30.What had been Mr. Sanders's early strength in a fractured field -- his quick consolidation of younger voters, very liberal voters and Latinos -- has proved far less formidable in a two-man contest as moderate and ""somewhat liberal"" voters have coalesced behind Mr. Biden.And as Democratic strategists have preached for more than a year, the consolidation of black voters behind a single candidate provides an almost overwhelming advantage when trying to accumulate delegates.Mr. Biden's ability to win states in the South by huge margins -- especially Alabama last week and Mississippi on Tuesday -- has generated a delegate windfall.In Alabama alone, the 36 more delegates that Mr. Biden netted were enough to offset the edge over Mr. Biden that Mr. Sanders had built in the first three states combined: Iowa (6), New Hampshire (9) Nevada (15). In Mississippi, Mr. Sanders was at risk of falling below 15 percent statewide.Bernie 2020 is losing to Bernie 2016.For the second straight week, Mr. Sanders underperformed his own bar from 2016 (a race, it should be noted, he eventually lost).He won Michigan then; he lost it now.He nearly won Missouri then; he lost it decisively now.He won Washington, North Dakota and Idaho in landslides then (all were caucuses four years ago); all were too close to immediately call on Tuesday night.Mr. Sanders doing worse in 2020 than 2016 is not new. As the pro-Biden super PAC Unite the Country wrote in a memo this week, ""on Super Tuesday, in every single state, Bernie Sanders earned a smaller share of the vote than he earned in those same states in 2016.""Mr. Sanders had a legitimate excuse a week ago: The other leading progressive vote-getter, Senator Elizabeth Warren, was still in the race. But that argument melted away this week and his standing still did not improve.The Democratic Party has decided.In his speech to a mostly empty National Constitution Center (relocated to avoid a crowd because of fears surrounding the coronavirus), Mr. Biden not only thanked Mr. Sanders and his supporters but also offered an olive branch, saying, ""There's a place in our campaign for each of you.""As the results rolled in, a growing number of Democratic officials began to both declare the primary over and consider the delicate task of uniting a party with deep ideological and generational divisions.The two leading Democratic super PACs, Priorities USA and American Bridge, echoed each other Tuesday night as they announced in short succession that they believed Mr. Biden was now the de facto nominee.""The math is now clear. Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee,"" said Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities. ""The voices of Democratic voters are loud and clear: they want Joe Biden to be our standard-bearer,"" said Bradley Beychok, president of American Bridge.A top Biden backer, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, went even further in an interview on NPR, saying the Democratic National Committee should ""shut this primary down"" and ""cancel the rest of these debates.""But some of Mr. Sanders's prominent surrogates and advisers were digging in, even as questions about the future of his campaign intensified as the Vermont senator opted against delivering a speech.Briahna Joy Gray, the national press secretary for Mr. Sanders, wrote that moderates were ""panicking"" about a one-on-one debate and that ""America finally gets to see Biden defend his ideas, or lack there of, on Sunday."" David Sirota, a longtime Sanders adviser, praised the benefits of ""tough primaries"" in molding a stronger nominee. ""Don't let anyone tell you otherwise,"" he wrote on Twitter.Michigan's results hint at the depth of anti-Clinton sentiment in 2016.Michigan has played a special place in the Sanders retelling of 2016: It was the state that, despite the polls, gave him a major victory over Mrs. Clinton and foreshadowed her eventual weakness in the general election in the upper Midwest against Donald J. Trump.The results on Tuesday raised fresh questions about just how much of his 2016 primary victory there was about him -- and how much was simply rejection of Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders appeared to lose every one of Michigan's 83 counties on Tuesday night. Four years ago, he carried 73 counties. While Mrs. Clinton carried black voters then, as Mr. Biden did now, the biggest difference was white voters, who swung wildly from backing Mr. Sanders in 2016 to Mr. Biden in 2020.Mr. Sanders won nearly every county outside the Detroit metropolitan area four years ago -- and lost all of them this week. Some small counties swung from a nearly 25-point Sanders win to a nearly 25-point Sanders loss.The role of gender was almost unavoidable. ""Mansplain me on sexism again, dudes,"" Anne Caprara, a top Democratic strategist and the current chief of staff for the governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, said on Twitter. ""Please.""White men supported Mr. Sanders by a 25-point margin over Mrs. Clinton. Yet they favored Mr. Biden over Mr. Sanders on Tuesday. White women flipped a lot, too, delivering a majority for Mr. Biden after they had gone with Mr. Sanders in 2016.Beyond the delegate math, the loss in Michigan undercut a Sanders 2020 story line: that he is the strongest candidate against Mr. Trump in one of the most critical swing states in the most critical swing region.PhotographWith strong support across multiple demographics, Mr. Biden won every county in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi, and emerged as the party's clear choice.

| Jump to first hitDemocratic presidential contenders are proposing expanding benefits, including Joe Biden, whose stance has evolved. President Trump's position is much less clear.The C-SPAN video from 1995 is grainy, but the audio is clear: Senator Joe Biden is heard bragging about his support for freezing spending on Social Security as part of broader deficit reduction legislation.""I'm up for re-election this year, and I'm going to remind everybody what I did, at home, which is going to cost me politically. When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans benefits -- I meant every single solitary thing in the government,"" Mr. Biden says in the video. ""And I not only tried it once, I tried it twice, I tried it a third time and I tried it a fourth time.""The footage is a centerpiece of an attack on Mr. Biden launched last month in the run-up to the Iowa caucuses by his rival for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders. Mr. Biden has pushed back, and a New York Times review of his record on Social Security over the course of his long Senate career reveals votes in support of protecting benefits as well as cutting them.The Biden-Sanders dust-up underscores the recent transformation of political debate on Social Security. As recently as 2010, benefit cuts were widely embraced by Mr. Biden and many other centrist Democrats as part of broader bipartisan deals to repair Social Security's finances or to reduce the federal deficit, which never reached fruition. Progressives fought the benefit-cutting. And in 2013, they began pushing the idea that benefits should be expanded.""It was difficult enough just to fight the benefit cuts at the time,"" recalls Nancy Altman, the president of Social Security Works, one of the advocacy groups fighting for expansion. ""But the end of the 'grand bargain' talks opened the door for the focus we thought was necessary -- the retirement income crisis and what we thought was the correct policy response -- expansion of Social Security.""Since then, the Democratic Party has taken a decisive left turn on Social Security: In 2020, none of the 11 Democratic presidential candidates advocate cuts, and most favor expanding benefits.As a 2020 candidate, Mr. Biden supports expanding benefits, and you won't find a word about cuts on his website. In fact, nearly all of the Democratic candidates' proposals are built on fixing Social Security's projected shortfall with revenue.Donald J. Trump campaigned in 2016 promising to oppose cuts to retirement benefits, a clear break with his party's orthodoxy -- and he reiterated that pledge in this week's State of the Union address. But Democrats argue that one recent statement by the president signaled his openness to considering reduction.No topic is more important than Social Security to the well-being of today's older voters -- and younger workers who will come to rely on the program. Nearly all Americans pay into the program and can expect to receive a benefit. It is the largest retirement income source for a majority of older households.Just 52 percent of households owned retirement accounts in 2016, according to Federal Reserve data. And at a time when fewer retirees can rely on traditional pensions, Social Security will be the only source of guaranteed lifetime income for most workers. Benefits are adjusted annually for inflation -- a unique feature that adds substantially to Social Security's value.The DemocratsAll of the Democrats' proposals include a fix for the program's looming financial shortfall. The combined trust funds for Social Security's retirement and disability programs are on course to be depleted in 2035; without changes, funding from payroll tax receipts will be sufficient to pay only 80 percent of scheduled benefits.Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren have been at the forefront of the expansion forces since they mobilized in 2013. Mr. Sanders is the chief sponsor of current Senate expansion legislation, and Ms. Warren has published a detailed Social Security expansion plan as part of her campaign.A recent review of the candidates' positions on Social Security by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College revealed no candidates -- from either party -- on record supporting benefit cuts. Among the Democrats, several (Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Tulsi Gabbard) back an across-the-board increase in benefits. Ms. Warren, for example, would immediately boost benefits for all by $200 per month.And three of the Democrats favor shifting to a formula for the annual cost-of-living adjustment all beneficiaries receive that more accurately reflects the inflation experienced by seniors. This would be done by adopting an inflation index known as the CPI-E (the ""E"" stands for elderly). Social Security's actuary estimates that the CPI-E would increase retiree benefits by two-tenths of a percentage point annually.Similar across-the-board increases are proposed in legislation already introduced by Democrats in the House of Representatives. The Social Security 2100 Act is co-sponsored by roughly 90 percent of House Democratic lawmakers, but has not been voted on by the full House.Nearly all of the candidates support targeted increases aimed at helping the most vulnerable seniors, an approach that aligns with recent C.R.R. research findings on retirement inequality. ""The typical minority household is coming into retirement with nothing -- no employer-sponsored retirement plan, or even a house,"" says Geoff Sanzenbacher, associate director of research at C.R.R. and a co-author of the study. ""When you add in Social Security, things look a whole lot better.""All of the top-polling candidates support increasing Social Security's special minimum benefit, which aims to keep very low-income workers out of poverty in retirement. But the benefit has eroded in value over the years in relation to the overall benefit formula. Most candidates propose updating the formula to keep beneficiaries at or above 125 percent of the federal poverty line at retirement age.Four of the Democrats support increasing Social Security benefits for caregivers, recognizing that caregiving duties can depress benefits by cutting into working hours and wages. This could be achieved by allowing caregivers to exclude some non-working years from the calculation of their benefits; another is to provide a wage credit to caregivers.Some candidates support raising benefits for surviving spouses. When a spouse dies and benefits stop, the surviving spouse can lose as much as 50 percent of the household's retirement income. The current survivor benefit is equal to 100 percent of the deceased spouse's benefit, but that doesn't help much in cases where both spouses had similar wage histories and benefits.Ms. Warren, for example, proposes that survivors could receive 75 percent of the household's combined benefits up to a capped amount, if that amount is higher than the survivor's own benefit or that of the deceased spouse.How would Democrats pay for expansion? Most would lift the cap on wages subject to payroll taxes, set this year at $137,700. Three support increasing payroll tax rates for high-income households, and two (Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren) would bolster the program's finances by establishing new taxes on investment income for high earners.The RepublicansMr. Trump, in his State of the Union address this week, pledged that ""we will always protect your Medicare and we will always protect your Social Security. Always.""But his administration has taken no steps to address the solvency problems of the Social Security Trust Funds. (Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is projected to be insolvent in 2026, three years earlier than the administration's actuaries projected in 2017.) And Mr. Trump's latest pledge contradicts comments he made in a CNBC interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month.Asked if entitlements would ""ever be on your plate,"" Mr. Trump replied that ""at some point they will be."" Democratic candidates and Social Security advocates pointed to the exchange as evidence Mr. Trump would seek cuts to Social Security, and Medicare, in a second term.White House officials walked back the comment the next day, suggesting that no draconian cuts to Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid were expected in the administration's upcoming budget, which will be released this month.The Trump administration has drawn fire for proposing cuts to Social Security's disability program. Its most recent budget proposed $72 billion in cuts over 10 years to benefits. Another set of administrative changes would make it harder for Americans to qualify and continue to receive benefits.Republican lawmakers speak often about reining in entitlement spending, but specifics have been absent during the Trump years.""They are in a nowhere zone on policy,"" says Andrew Biggs, resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank, and a former deputy commissioner of the Social Security Administration during the George W. Bush administration. ""In response to Democratic proposals to expand Social Security and raise taxes, Republicans will say, 'We don't want to raise taxes, and we don't want to cut benefits, either' -- as though there are other options.""How urgent is the problem?The public already is pessimistic about Social Security's future. A Pew Research Center study released last March found widespread worry among today's workers about the program's future -- 83 percent expected benefit cuts by the time they retire, and 42 percent did not expect to receive any benefits in retirement.The public worry is understandable, but out of proportion, says Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. ""The odds that benefits are going to disappear are as close to zero as possible,"" he said. ""But the continual talk about the financial problems leads people to worry excessively about it.""Despite public sentiment and trust fund projections, the next president and Congress may not feel pressure to act during the next four years. Much will depend on the balance of control in Congress and the White House.""The more power Democrats have, the more likely it is that there will be action,"" said Ms. Altman of Social Security Works. ""If Republicans stay in power, they will try for a bipartisan solution, but Democrats won't go"" for benefit cuts.If the problem is not solved before the 2035 depletion date gets near, experts note that odds will favor restoring solvency to the trust funds with new revenue -- rather than benefit cuts.That is because any benefit cuts almost certainly would not be applied retroactively to current beneficiaries, Mr. Van de Water said. ""That means the cuts could only apply to new beneficiaries, with the possible exception of a less generous C.O.L.A., which would affect people receiving benefits now and in the future,"" he added.With that constraint, it would be difficult to avoid insolvency relying on benefit cuts, Mr. Van de Water said. New revenue could come from tax increases -- or Congress could decide to inject general revenue into the program.Perhaps the biggest risk of delay is that it fuels public pessimism and worry about Social Security's future, he said. Still, he adds: ""It's quite feasible that this just gets punted for another four years.""PhotographA campaign ad from Senator Bernie Sanders, above, features a 1990s video of Joseph R. Biden Jr., then a senator, talking about freezing benefits for Social Security and Medicare. Mr. Biden's stance has evolved.

| Jump to first hitThe rift between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren over electability rose to the surface in the Democratic debate, and the candidates also sparred over their stances on war.DES MOINES -- The Democratic presidential candidates clashed in starkly personal terms Tuesday over who had the best chance to defeat President Trump, as Senator Elizabeth Warren sought to jump-start her campaign in the last debate before the Iowa caucuses by highlighting her electoral success and that of other female candidates in the Trump era.Prompted by the moderators, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders continued a back-and-forth over the fraught subject of whether a woman could be elected president, an issue that in recent days had caused the first serious breach in their relationship. One day after she confirmed a report that Mr. Sanders had told her in a private meeting that he did not think a woman could defeat Mr. Trump, Ms. Warren trumpeted her Senate victory over an incumbent Republican and then gestured down the debate stage toward the four male candidates.""Collectively they have lost 10 elections,"" she said, before acknowledging the only other female candidate present, Senator Amy Klobuchar. ""The only people on this stage who have won every single election they have been in are the women: Amy and me. And the only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent Republican in the past 30 years is me.""Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren's top rival for progressive support, flatly denied that he had made the comment when the two lawmakers met without aides in 2018. He said it was ""incomprehensible that I would think that a woman couldn't be president of the United States,"" noting Hillary Clinton had won the popular vote in the 2016 general election.Meeting less than three weeks before Iowans vote, the Democrats disagreed over international affairs and keeping troops in the Middle East, whether to support Mr. Trump's trade deal for North America, how aggressively to tackle climate change and, yet again, health care. But the issue animating much of the evening was the same question that has shaped the primary race for the past year: which of them would be the most formidable contender against Mr. Trump.The contest has increasingly revolved around questions of electability, but the matter has become more urgent in the weeks since hostilities increased between the United States and Tehran after the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the powerful Iranian commander. Much of Tuesday's debate, which featured six of the remaining candidates, touched on national security as the Democrats excoriated Mr. Trump, urged caution in the Middle East and laid claim to the mantle of being the best potential commander in chief.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. came under far less scrutiny than his standing as the national front-runner might have merited in the final debate before voting begins in Iowa on Feb. 3. Just as notable, Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., who has slipped in Iowa, seemed satisfied to make his own case without sharply criticizing his top rivals.New polls in Iowa show that Democratic voters are roughly split between four top candidates: Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders of Vermont, Ms. Warren of Massachusetts and Mr. Buttigieg.But while Mr. Sanders was criticized for the cost of his plans, Ms. Warren for how many people would be turned off by hers and Mr. Buttigieg for the scope of his ambitions, Mr. Biden went long stretches on Tuesday receiving scant attention.The debate unfolded at an extraordinarily volatile moment in American politics, with impeachment looming and escalated tensions with Iran. Yet befitting the setting and the stakes of the debate, multiple candidates -- Ms. Warren, Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Klobuchar -- were just as eager to invoke Iowa and stories of specific Iowans they had met along the campaign trail, tailoring their pitch to the crucial state.But the contretemps between Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders was the most memorable moment in the lead-up to the caucuses here. It was a remarkable exchange between the two senators, in part because they are friends and have labored to abide by a de facto nonaggression pact for the past year. But more important, it also crystallized the competing cases that the leading Democratic contenders were making for why they were best positioned to defeat Mr. Trump.Even as Ms. Warren said ""Bernie is my friend and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie,"" she flashed him a smile after Mr. Sanders noted that he, like Ms. Warren, had once defeated an incumbent Republican. ""Just to set the record straight, I defeated an incumbent Republican running for Congress,"" he said, before Ms. Warren pointed out that it had been 30 years ago.Acknowledging that she was facing doubts about her chances to defeat Mr. Trump, she pointed out that John F. Kennedy had addressed questions about his Catholicism and, more recently, Barack Obama had overcome doubts that he could win the presidency as a black man.Both times, Ms. Warren said, ""the Democratic Party stepped up and said yes.""It was an unusual closing argument in Iowa for a candidate who first rose to contention on the basis of her policy proposals, but it reflected the urgency she was facing to reverse her decline in a state where she led in the polls last year.For his part, Mr. Sanders did not seem rattled by the confrontation, at least during the forum. But in the immediate aftermath of the debate, CNN cameras captured Ms. Warren appearing to refuse to shake Mr. Sanders's hand, and the two senators engaged in what seemed to be a pointed conversation.Tom Steyer, the California billionaire, who was standing nearby during the exchange, said later in the spin room, ""Whatever they were going on between each other, I was trying to get out of the way as fast as possible.""During the debate, Mr. Sanders used the exchange with Ms. Warren to make his own case for why he was the most electable candidate: because he could lure a stream of new voters to the polls. ""The real question,"" he said, ""is how do we beat Trump? And the only way we beat Trump is by a campaign of energy and excitement and a campaign that has, by far, the largest voter turnout in the history of this country.""Mr. Biden, who has placed his own polling strength against Mr. Trump at the center of his candidacy -- including in a new television ad timed with Tuesday's debate -- was just as emphatic that he was best equipped to win the general election.""The real issue is who can bring the whole party together,"" said Mr. Biden, citing his endorsements from a variety of Democrats, including many who were racial minorities. ""I am the one who has the broadest coalition of anyone running up here."" Later, alluding to Mr. Trump's attempt to press the Ukrainians to investigate the work of his son in Ukraine, Mr. Biden said of the president: ""I've taken all the hits he can deliver.""Ms. Klobuchar cited her success appealing to a range of voters in her home state of Minnesota and even boasted that every one of her Republican opponents had left politics since they lost to her. ""I think that sounds pretty good with the president we have right now,"" she said.But Ms. Klobuchar struggled momentarily when she sought to highlight the success of other Midwestern Democratic women and forgot the name of Gov. Laura Kelly of Kansas before receiving a cue.""Kansas has a woman governor right now and she beat Kris Kobach,"" she began. ""And her name, um, is, I'm very proud to know her, and her name is, uh, Governor Kelly. Thank you.""Mr. Steyer, whose television ads have blanketed Iowa and the other early-voting states, said his economic experience would position him well against a businessman turned president. ""Whoever is going to beat Donald Trump is going to beat him on the economy,"" he said, ""and I have the experience and expertise to show he's a fake there and a fraud.""Not long after the debate, Mr. Trump responded on Twitter: ""Steyer is running low on cash. Nobody knows him. Made his money on coal. So funny!""In a rare policy split, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren disagreed on the new North American trade deal that Mr. Trump is trying to push through Congress. Mr. Sanders said it was not worth supporting -- even if it made a ""modest"" improvement. ""We can do much better than a Trump-led trade deal,"" he said.Ms. Warren, however, said that was the reason to support it. ""We have farmers here in Iowa who are hurting,"" she said.The back-and-forth was an example of how Ms. Warren has sought to position herself as a progressive more willing to get things done than Mr. Sanders.The candidates clashed, as they have in all of the debates, on health care. Mr. Sanders was pressed by the moderators about the cost of his ""Medicare for all"" package; unlike Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders has not said what his proposal would cost or revealed which taxes he would increase to pay for it.Ms. Warren, who has found herself on the defensive over her embrace of Medicare for all in recent months, pitched her plan as more expansive than those offered by Ms. Klobuchar or Mr. Buttigieg.""You would kick 149 million Americans off their health insurance,"" Ms. Klobuchar said to Ms. Warren at one point. ""It's just not true that the plan I'm proposing is small,"" Mr. Buttigieg said at another, suggesting Ms. Warren's approach would turn off too many voters.""We've got to move past a Washington mentality that suggests that the bigness of plans only consists of how many trillions of dollars they put through the Treasury, that the boldness of a plan only consists of how many Americans it can alienate,"" Mr. Buttigieg said pointedly.Mr. Buttigieg was asked directly about his lack of support among black voters, whom he will need to activate not just to win the nomination but also a potential general election against Mr. Trump. Mr. Buttigieg said those who know him best -- in South Bend -- support him, cited his African-American backers in Iowa and noted that his new campaign co-chairman was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus.Mr. Sanders had the opportunity right from the start to emphasize his pacifist credentials as the debate opened with questions about the heightened tensions with Iran and who was best positioned to serve as commander in chief. Mr. Sanders immediately seized the opportunity to trumpet his past opposition to the war in Iraq. ""I not only voted against the war, I helped lead the effort against the war,"" he said.Mr. Sanders warned that both the Iraq and Vietnam wars had been based on ""lies."" ""Right now, what I fear very much is that we have a president that is lying again and could drag us into a war that is even worse than the war in Iraq,"" he said.Mr. Sanders drew a distinction with Mr. Biden, who had supported the Iraq war resolution in the Senate. ""Joe and I listened to what Dick Cheney and George Bush and Rumsfeld had to say,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""I thought they were lying. Joe saw it differently.""Mr. Biden said he regretted his vote for that war. ""It was a mistake and I acknowledge that,"" Mr. Biden said, while noting that as vice president he had brought thousands of troops home from the Middle East.The race here remains extremely fluid. A large part of the electorate is up for grabs in a contest that many of the campaigns believe will produce record-setting turnout. A Des Moines Register-CNN poll last week indicated that 45 percent of caucusgoers said they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate.In a final twist that had the potential to affect the race in Iowa, four candidates who will be deliberating on Mr. Trump's fate are confronting a looming challenge: how to mount a successful Iowa campaign while their duties in Congress require them to be in Washington.With the senators likely to be in the Capitol for up to six days a week for the impeachment trial of Mr. Trump, they will be unable to make their final appeals to Iowa voters in person as frequently as Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg.""Some things,"" Ms. Warren said, ""are more important than politics.""PhotographFrom left, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren, Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitIn the Trump era, some voters say the power of a symbolic first is overshadowed by anxiety about defeating him.WINTERSET, Iowa -- Almost exactly three years ago, Leila Schlenker marveled at the crowds at the Women's March in Des Moines, which drew more than 26,000 people to the grounds of the state capitol and reminded her of the large social protests of the 1960s.Her daughter, now a mother herself, used to roll her eyes when her mom would talk about the importance of fighting for issues like abortion rights and equal pay. But Ms. Schlenker has seen how the current political moment has convinced her daughter that her rights could be taken away, and that sexism remains a force in both of their lives. And she's watched in horror as the Trump administration has worked to roll back funding for clinics specializing in reproductive health care, the field she worked in for more than a quarter century.Yet, as she sat in the front row of a crowded banquet hall on Monday morning, waiting for Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., to take the stage, Ms. Schlenker, 66, made clear that there was at least one area of her life where gender was not a determining factor.""I would love to see a woman in office,"" she said. ""But I still like Pete.""In the final weeks before the Iowa caucuses, the two leading female candidates remaining in the Democratic primary are embracing their gender as an asset, decisively pushing back against concerns that a woman can't be elected president. Those sensitive conversations burst into public view this past week at the Democratic debate, in a nationally televised discussion about sexism and experience between Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Since Donald J. Trump took office, women have emerged as the backbone of the Democratic Party, leading protests, creating new political organizations and running for office. A record number of women are serving in Congress, and the #MeToo movement has raised awareness of sexual assault and gender bias. Saturday marks the fourth annual Women's March, with events taking place around the country and the world.Yet, the sisterhood may stop before the White House. In interviews with nearly two dozen female voters in Iowa this week, the symbolism of breaking what Hillary Clinton called ""that highest, hardest glass ceiling"" in politics seemed to be less resonant than ever before, particularly for older voters, who were subsumed by anxiety about defeating Mr. Trump.Some voters who backed either Ms. Warren or Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota bristled at the idea that they might support them because they are women, even as many acknowledged a greater awareness of the sexism women candidates face. All the marches, protests and public discussion of gender gaps, double binds and sexual harassment seem to have led some voters to a perhaps surprising conclusion: This is not our time.Becky Kakac, 68, said she would like to see a woman president in her lifetime and would love to support a female candidate -- just not now.""I'm not sure this is our year. We have to win the country and that is one of the reasons I'm leaning toward Joe Biden,"" Ms. Kakac said. ""That was one of the problems with the Hillary candidacy, thinking that a woman president would be elected after our first African-American president. That was a little too much to ask.""Women make up 54 percent of registered voters and nearly 51 percent of the country. They are far from a monolithic voting bloc, even if the ""women's vote"" is sometimes treated as such by pundits and operatives. Several studies of the 2008 primary found that while black voters overwhelmingly supported Barack Obama because of their racial identity, Mrs. Clinton's candidacy didn't benefit as much from solidarity among women voters. And in 2016, a majority of white women backed Mr. Trump instead.In the 2020 primary, Senators Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris made explicit appeals to women; neither was able to motivate a groundswell of support from female voters, and both have since dropped out. Support for Representative Tulsi Gabbard, who is still in the race but hasn't qualified for a party debate since November, skews male.""There's this internalized bias with women,"" said Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, a super PAC focused on African-American Democrats. ""The number of women that you heard say and still hear say, 'We wouldn't vote for Hillary Clinton because she is a woman.' We've even heard this about Warren.""Moderate female voters point to Mrs. Clinton's defeat to explain why they hesitate to back another woman, saying the stakes are too high to take another risk. At the same time, the gains made over the last few years may have inadvertently minimized, for some voters, how historic it would be for a woman to win the White House.As she waited with her daughter and mother to get their photo taken with Ms. Warren, Cyndi Boertje, 56, said that while she'd love to see a female president, she didn't think it would be quite as transformational for the country as when Mr. Obama won the presidency.""We've had more women in higher things,"" said Ms. Boertje, who's deciding between Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg and like most women interviewed at campaign events in Iowa is white. ""We've got Nancy Pelosi as speaker. To me, at least, people are used to seeing women in leadership.""Mrs. Clinton made her history-making potential a major theme of her 2016 bid, eagerly highlighting pleas from her older female supporters that they'd like to see a woman elected president during their lifetime.That's been pushed aside this year, as voters prioritize defeating Mr. Trump over representation, said Jennifer Lawless, a professor at the University of Virginia and an expert on women in politics.""The novelty of this has worn off,"" she said. ""Since Hillary Clinton became the nominee we've really turned a corner in terms of the way that we talk about sexism and gender roles.""Ms. Shropshire said the idea of making history with a female president has never come up in the focus groups she regularly holds with black women voters, though activists and political operatives raise it at forums and events.""People are not looking for a historic candidate,"" she said. ""They're looking for someone who can not just beat Trump but end Trumpism.""For Ms. Warren and Ms. Klobuchar, that dynamic means casting their gender as an electoral strength, rather than a chance to make history. At the debate, Ms. Warren pointed out that the male candidates onstage had collectively lost 10 elections.""The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in are the women,"" she said. ""Amy and me.""In an election cycle that saw more women run for president than ever before, a long-held goal for women's organizations, these groups face an unusual challenge: they're unwilling to throw their full weight behind one contender.Shaunna Thomas, co-executive director of UltraViolet, a women's rights advocacy group, described endorsing one woman over another as ""somewhat fraught,"" saying her group was more focused on pushing all of the candidates, male and female, to give more attention to issues like gender equity, abortion and sexism.""The sole reason for our existence is not just putting women into positions of power,"" she said. ""Though we think that is part of how we will achieve gender equality and justice in this country, it's not the only way.""In spring 2013, as Mrs. Clinton prepared her second presidential bid, Emily's List, the largest national organization devoted to electing female candidates, debuted a nationwide effort it called the ""Madam President campaign."" This year, the group is playing a quieter role in the Democratic primary.""This isn't about electing a first,"" said Stephanie Schriock, its president. ""This is about electing a person who can put this country back together, and I think Elizabeth and Amy are situated to do this really well.""Early-state polling shows Ms. Warren with an edge among female voters but Mr. Biden with more backing over all. Nationally Mr. Biden leads among female voters, a reflection of his strength in the race.At events for Ms. Warren and Ms. Klobuchar in recent months, female voters were grappling with contradictory ideas. They thought the women were better equipped to run the country but worried the country was too sexist to elect them.Chatting with fellow volunteers for Ms. Warren after a campaign event on Sunday, Diane Lemker, 65, bemoaned what she saw as unfair political projection by others.""'I don't know if people over there are ready for a woman, so we can't vote for a woman.' Oh my gosh!"" she said. ""With my support of her, I am not only affirming that women are capable, but I am also actively rejecting the undercurrent of misogyny.""Some frustrated supporters of Ms. Warren argue the concerns about electability have become a self-defeating prophecy for women.""It's just disheartening to think we could have come together, and now maybe people think women are getting too much power, or too much strength in the numbers, that they're getting a little bit afraid,"" said Erin Smith, 19, as she waited with friends for Ms. Warren to address a crowd in Marshalltown, Iowa.Aileen Bell, 21, agreed, saying gender was part of what drew her to Ms. Warren.""If I'm going to choose between an old white man and a woman, and we've never had a woman in the White House, I feel much more drawn to the woman on the stage,"" said Ms. Bell, a student who attended the first Women's March. ""If we don't run women, then we're never going to have a woman in the White House.""As she campaigned in Iowa over the weekend, Ms. Klobuchar argued that the sexism faced by women candidates makes them tougher opponents against Mr. Trump.""Any woman in politics right now, when you get to these highest levels, you have to be resilient,"" she told a group of voters gathered in a hotel ballroom in Perry, Iowa, on Sunday evening. ""You have to be so tough that you are definitely tough enough to beat Donald Trump.""After listening to the remarks, Monica Peitz, 65, said those comments were not the most convincing part of Ms. Klobuchar's pitch. Mrs. Clinton, she said, had already been the first woman nominated by a major party, satisfying her appetite for making history.Ms. Peitz added: ""More than a woman, I like that Amy's from the Midwest.""PhotographAn Iowa woman said she ""would love to see a woman in office,"" but backed Pete Buttigieg, above.

| Jump to first hitMr. Biden was moving quickly to capitalize on his South Carolina victory and recast the Democratic primary campaign as a two-man contest between himself and Mr. Sanders.The Democratic presidential campaign took a dramatic turn on Sunday as a top candidate, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, quit the race and started clearing the way for moderate voters to coalesce around candidates better positioned to stop Senator Bernie Sanders, the liberal front-runner for the party's nomination.Mr. Buttigieg made his decision after a devastating loss in Saturday's primary in South Carolina, where a fellow moderate, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., won his first victory in the presidential race. The departure of Mr. Buttigieg could lift Mr. Biden's political fortunes heading into the major Super Tuesday primaries, but might also benefit other candidates, particularly Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who also hold appeal with swaths of Mr. Buttigieg's supporters.Even before Mr. Buttigieg's exit, Mr. Biden was moving quickly to capitalize on his victory and recast the Democratic campaign as a two-man contest between himself and Mr. Sanders. Yet there were also signs that Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and other rivals were fighting for their own survival against Mr. Sanders on Super Tuesday, the single most important election date on the 2020 primary calendar.In a show of strength, Mr. Sanders announced on Sunday morning that he raised $46.5 million in February, by far the biggest amount of any candidate so far, giving him a huge financial war chest. Mr. Sanders is using those funds to dramatically expand his advertising in states that vote deep into March, including Florida, Michigan and Ohio. Mr. Biden is not yet on the airwaves in those states or any other that votes past Tuesday.The pressure to persevere on Super Tuesday was even more acute for other Democratic candidates as some reckoned with losses in the South Carolina primary on Saturday but were unwilling to quit a race that has been defined by unpredictability.In a blunt memo on Sunday, Ms. Warren's campaign all but admitted she no longer has a path to the nomination beyond a contested Democratic convention. Mr. Bloomberg appeared in a three-minute nationwide commercial on Sunday night, further pushing the bounds of what his billions could buy after his candidacy was undercut by his debate performances. And Senator Amy Klobuchar strained to make the case she was still a serious contender, boasting that she had been ""in the top five vote getters in these small caucuses and primaries"" in a local television interview.Ratcheting up the pressure on Democrats to unite behind a single stop-Sanders candidate, an influential donor for Mr. Biden circulated an email to his political network calling for some rivals to the former vice president to drop out. At the same time, Bloomberg campaign officials presented internal polling projections to skittish Democratic Party leaders, arguing that Mr. Bloomberg's presence in the race was actually containing Mr. Sanders's potential to run up the score on Super Tuesday.If Mr. Biden appeared suddenly ascendant on Sunday, the Super Tuesday map still favored Mr. Sanders, given his money, organization and breadth of support in key states. But the primaries on Tuesday remain highly volatile because so many Democrats are competing, each with some pockets of support in multiple states, and because Mr. Buttigieg's departure makes his supporters free agents.Polls show Mr. Biden, Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Warren are all at risk of falling short of the critical 15 percent threshold of support necessary to win delegates in various states and congressional districts on Tuesday.Mr. Buttigieg, the first openly gay major presidential candidate, drew support from different ideological wings of the Democratic Party. With him out of the race, his backers could help one or more of those other candidates rise above the 15 percent margin. Some could also support Mr. Sanders. Mr. Buttigieg spoke with Mr. Biden on Sunday and the former vice president asked him for his support. Mr. Buttigieg told aides he wanted to sleep on it.In remarks on Sunday night about his decision to leave the race, Mr. Buttigieg dropped his recent criticism of Mr. Sanders by name, but did warn against a Democratic politics that could get ""lost in ideology."" He pledged to do ""everything in my power"" to defeat President Trump this fall.Mr. Biden had been left for dead politically after three consecutive losses to open the contest, but he recovered on Saturday thanks to the overwhelming support from black voters. Mr. Biden benefited from his association with the nation's first black president, Barack Obama, and in a phone call Mr. Obama congratulated Mr. Biden on his victory in South Carolina, a person familiar with the call said.Mr. Biden predicted their big vote of confidence would help reset a race that Mr. Sanders had been threatening to run away with.The result was Mr. Biden's best day of fund-raising since his launch -- he raised $5 million on Saturday, and another $5 million on Sunday -- as he reasserted the fundamental strengths of his candidacy.""I think we're moving into constituencies that when they hear me, they've always been mine. Diverse communities, white working-class folks, African-Americans and Hispanics, women in the suburbs,"" Mr. Biden said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday.With the Super Tuesday primaries imminent, there were competing tactical imperatives on display on Sunday. Mr. Sanders -- alone among the major candidates -- skipped a commemoration of ""Bloody Sunday"" in Selma, Ala., flying instead to California for a pair of rallies in a state he leads in the polls and is worth nearly triple the delegates of all the February contests combined.Mr. Biden, meanwhile, won the endorsement of Selma Mayor Darrio Melton and was received warmly at Brown Chapel A.M.E. church, as his speech was interrupted by a stream of affirmations as he denounced white supremacy. ""Say it, Biden!"" someone cried out.Despite Mr. Biden's decisive, nearly 30-point win in South Carolina, it was not clear how much his win would alter the hardening contours of the race. Millions of votes have already been cast in Super Tuesday states, particularly in California, and Mr. Biden has been dramatically outgunned on the airwaves and out-organized on the ground there. In February, Mr. Biden's $18 million fund-raising total, announced on Sunday, amounted to less than 40 cents for every dollar that Mr. Sanders collected.And in the last week, Mr. Biden essentially bunkered down in South Carolina to achieve his campaign-saving victory, while Mr. Sanders has been building up his operation, airing ads and making inroads across the country.""They invested everything they had in South Carolina at the cost of everything else because they knew it was the only path forward,"" Patti Solis Doyle, a Democratic strategist and former campaign manager for Hillary Clinton in 2008, said of the Biden operation. ""It leaves them with incredible momentum, new energy but still lacking the resources and bodies to execute.""What limited resources Mr. Biden has deployed in Super Tuesday states have been focused buying ads on shows and stations that draw an outsized African-American viewership, according to a campaign official. His campaign has previously announced a $2.2 million ad buy across eight states; the same Biden campaign official said they planned to use much of the new infusion of money to make investments in March 10 and March 17 states.For now, Mr. Sanders has outspent Mr. Biden in Super Tuesday radio and television advertising by a margin of more than seven-to-one, according to the media-tracking firm Advertising Analytics; Mr. Bloomberg is outpacing Mr. Biden by closer to a 100-to-one margin.Ari Rabin-Havt, a deputy campaign manager on the Sanders campaign, urged caution about over-interpreting the results from South Carolina and its impact. ""Wait until you see what happens in other states,"" he said. ""I think taking one state and transmuting one state's population to every state in the country is a mistake.""Two other main candidates in the race -- Ms. Warren and Ms. Klobuchar -- pressed to justify the rationales for their continued candidacies in memos, media appearances and appeals to the arcana of delegate math on Sunday, predicting a contest that would not be resolved until the convention this summer.The Warren campaign memo about the post-Super Tuesday landscape was the most plain-spoken. ""The reality of this race will be clear: no candidate will likely have a path to the majority of delegates needed to win an outright claim to the Democratic nomination,"" wrote Roger Lau, Ms. Warren's campaign manager.The Warren campaign, he argued, was positioned to ""ultimately prevail at the national convention in Milwaukee.""An online gusher of donations has allowed those whose fund-raising might otherwise have dried up in past cycles to linger deeper into 2020.Ms. Warren was on track to be the No. 2 fund-raiser in February, raising $29.3 million, despite never finishing better than third in any of the February contests. Ms. Klobuchar had hoped her surprise third-place finish in New Hampshire would propel her forward but while her momentum has long since evaporated, the money she raised provided a financial lifeline. She is now digging in to defend her home state of Minnesota on Tuesday.Even Mr. Buttigieg had raised money steadily until the end, with an online counter on his website showing him more than $9 million toward his $13 million Super Tuesday goal when he dropped out.It is not just Mr. Buttigieg's supporters who are now up for grabs but the enviable network of big-dollar bundlers who helped him raise more than $82 million last year.After his appearance in Selma, Mr. Biden headed to Virginia to rally supporters with two of his recent, big-name Democratic backers, Senator Tim Kaine, who had been Hillary Clinton's vice-presidential pick four years ago, and former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, also a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee chairman.The event was an establishment show-of-force that came after two other Virginia members of Congress, Representatives Bobby Scott and Jennifer Wexton, also endorsed him over the weekend, along with the former D.N.C. chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz.Mr. Bloomberg readied for his first test in Tuesday's primaries after skipping the four early contests. He paid for a three-minute address to the nation on Sunday evening about the spreading coronavirus. Ms. Warren accused him of trying to ""pretend he's the president.""Bloomberg advisers have grown frustrated with Ms. Warren's repeated attacks, including in her commercials, and recently produced an ad hitting Ms. Warren for her reversal on super PACs, going from denouncing super PAC money to benefiting from the biggest super PAC ad buy in the race. Aides presented a plan to spend twice as much on the anti-Warren ad as Ms. Warren has spent on her anti-Bloomberg spots.""Mike said no,"" said Jason Schechter, a Bloomberg spokesman. ""He wanted to stay positive."" (Mr. Bloomberg is running negative ads on Mr. Sanders but entirely online and not on television.)For Mr. Biden's supporters, the results in South Carolina and the departure of Mr. Buttigieg added fuel to their efforts to prune the field in hopes of setting up Mr. Biden as the single alternative to Mr. Sanders.""The Democratic Party needs to come together behind Joe and make this a two person race,"" Jon Henes, who was Senator Kamala Harris's finance chair and now supports Mr. Biden, wrote to friends and other donors before Mr. Buttigieg quit the race, according to a person who reviewed the email.He went on to add, ""Suspending a campaign is incredibly difficult for any candidate but right now we need our candidates to be realistic.""A pro-Biden super PAC, Unite the Country, was even more to the point, accusing Mr. Bloomberg's $500 million in advertising of amounting to ""the Bernie Sanders super PAC.""""His entire argument for existence was Joe Biden stumbling -- and after four states, Joe Biden has received more votes than anyone,"" said the memo. ""Mayor Bloomberg should decide soon if he wants to be the reason why Bernie Sanders is the nominee of the party.""Shane Goldmacher reported from New York and Reid J.

| Jump to first hitPITTSBURGH -- Though they are both Democrats, John Fetterman, Pennsylvania's lieutenant governor, and Bill Peduto, this city's mayor, have their differences on the environment.Mr. Fetterman, who toppled an incumbent Democrat in 2018 from the left, nevertheless calls Pennsylvania ""the Saudi Arabia of natural gas"" and sees extracting and taxing gas as critical to the state's economy and the ""union way of life."" Mr. Peduto lobbied unsuccessfully against a local petrochemical plant and is steering his once-struggling steel town to be independent of fossil fuels within 15 years.But they agree on one thing: a pledge to ban all hydraulic fracturing, better known as fracking, could jeopardize any presidential candidate's chances of winning this most critical of battleground states -- and thus the presidency itself. So as Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren woo young environmental voters with a national fracking ban, these two Democrats are uneasy.""In Pennsylvania, you're talking hundreds of thousands of related jobs that would be -- they would be unemployed overnight,"" said Mr. Fetterman, who endorsed Mr. Sanders in 2016 before Donald J. Trump won his state, pop. 12.8 million, by just over 44,000 votes. ""Pennsylvania is a margin play,"" he added. ""And an outright ban on fracking isn't a margin play.""Mr. Peduto said ""the Warren-Sanders, ban-all-fracking-right-now"" position would ""absolutely devastate communities throughout the Rust Belt"" and pit environmentalists against workers at a time when Democrats need both.""If a candidate comes into this state and tries to sell that policy, they're going to have a hard time winning,"" he said.Climate change has consistently polled as one of the top issues for Democratic primary voters, propelling Senators Sanders and Warren leftward even as the specific politics of fracking have gotten little airing. While Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren push a nationwide fracking ban, other leading Democrats -- Joseph R. Biden Jr., Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Michael R. Bloomberg -- have held back, calling instead for tighter regulations, a ban on new oil and gas drilling leases on federal lands, and a transition away from natural gas over time.In critical pockets of the country, perhaps none more so than Pennsylvania, the issue of fracking could become vital in the general election, according to union leaders, Democratic politicians and Republican strategists. Potential battleground states where Democrats nurse dreams of winning, like Ohio and Texas, are hotbeds of natural gas -- Texas has 137,000 natural gas wells -- and Mr. Trump has signaled he hopes for a Republican comeback in New Mexico, another fracking state.Mr. Trump has made plain that his unabashed advocacy for oil and gas development will be central to his re-election, as he blasts Democrats as ""anti-energy zealots."" And Democrats like Mr. Peduto and Mr. Fetterman take him seriously. Fresh for both are the wounds of 2016, when Hillary Clinton was sharply criticized for her line about putting coal miners and companies ""out of business"" even though, at the time, she also spoke of creating new economic opportunities for coal workers.In some ways, the fracking ban is indicative of the entire political bet undergirding the candidacies of Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren that the 2020 campaign will not be won by appeals to the narrow interests of traditional swing voters but through the mass mobilization of an energized electorate.Mr. Trump will demagogue on energy regardless of the Democrats' positions, they argue; better to inspire young voters and others impassioned to tackle climate change, especially in cities like Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, than to worry about isolated voters in Western Pennsylvania's fracking country. ""Dream big, fight hard,"" as Ms. Warren's slogan goes.""It goes to the heart of the debate that we're seeing within the Democratic Party right now, which is the appetite among progressives and the left for an agenda that remains unpalatable to swing voters in the states that determine the Electoral College,"" said Amy Walter, national editor of the Cook Political Report.A November poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Cook Political Report found that only 39 percent of Pennsylvania swing voters saw a fracking ban as a good idea, even as nearly 7 in 10 of those same voters said they supported the idea of a ""Green New Deal"" for the environment.Ashleigh Deemer, deputy director of PennEnvironment, which supports a ban, is unmoved by the low support for a full ban. ""The model is changing,"" she said. ""Everything we know about how to win a campaign is changing.""'People in the Rust Belt are being sold false hope'Driving through downtown Monaca, Pa., it is hard to imagine cars backed up past the Shear Utopia hair salon, window repair shops and lonely P-Dub's Sports Bar and Grille. But State Representative Robert F. Matzie, a Democrat, insists a planned $4 million roundabout will be needed in a few years to deal with the bottleneck coming to State Route 51, ""because of the cracker.""""The cracker"" is shorthand for a $6 billion Royal Dutch Shell petrochemical complex under construction in Beaver County, just northwest of Pittsburgh, that will convert ethane, a natural gas liquid fracked in Southwestern Pennsylvania, into pellets for plastic manufacturing. It gets its nickname from the chemical reaction known as cracking.Born and raised in Western Pennsylvania during the decline of the steel industry, Mr. Matzie said he remembered finding fewer students in his class after each summer vacation because their parents got laid off and moved away. Now, handsome new townhomes are being erected with views of the construction site smokestacks.A candidate who wants to ban hydraulic fracturing cannot win the state, he said plainly; his vote in the primary will most likely go to Mr. Biden.""He's quite frankly probably the only guy you could stand onstage with in Beaver County,"" Mr. Matzie said.In neighboring Washington County, which has the most fracking wells in the state, Republicans took control of the county commission for the first time in two decades last fall. The remaining Democratic commissioner, Larry Maggi, said he could not support a nominee who supported a ban.Fracking triggers similar passions for environmental activists, who lament its immediate impact on the earth and what they say is its stalling of progress toward clean, renewable energy.United Nations scientists have urged a deadline for achieving net-zero global emissions -- that is, eliminating as much greenhouse gas pollution from the atmosphere as humans generate -- by 2050. That goal will require an aggressive transition to wind, solar and other power sources that do not generate climate-warming carbon dioxide. Once viewed charitably as a ""bridge"" to a cleaner future because it produces far less carbon than coal or oil, natural gas has become a new front in the climate change fight.Mr. Peduto said that was, in part, why he has opposed the cracker plant. ""The people in the Rust Belt are being sold false hope of, 'Just sacrifice your land and your air and your water one more time and we will provide you with all of these jobs,""' he said.Yet he had a warning for national Democrats. ""This presidential race comes down to about ten states,"" he said. ""And if you are trying to pass universal bans, it will never happen.""The numbers are not that conclusive. In 2016, Mr. Trump outpaced Mrs. Clinton by a combined 40,700 votes in Washington and Beaver Counties -- almost double the margin that Mitt Romney secured over Barack Obama four years earlier. And Democrats could fall further. Mr. Trump won those two counties by 60 percent and 57 percent -- a lower margin than more rural parts of the state.But there is room for Democratic gain in the cities and suburbs, especially around Philadelphia. Mrs. Clinton flipped one county in that area, Chester, carrying it by more than 25,000 votes even as Mr. Obama lost it in 2012. And suburban gains in 2018 swept Democrats to power in House seats all through Greater Philadelphia.Even the economic argument is not simple. Pennsylvania boasts more than 90,000 jobs in wind, solar, energy efficiency and other clean technologies. By contrast, about 20,000 people are employed directly in oil and gas jobs, according to 2016 figures from the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry, though the industry says it supports more than 350,000 related jobs in the state.'Don't vote, or vote for the other guy'Union leaders meeting for lunch one recent afternoon at an Italian restaurant on the outskirts of Pittsburgh said they could not afford to be dismissive of jobs like the ones constructing the cracker plant, where wages, pensions and benefits can run into the six figures.""At the end of the day, if I don't have a job, if I don't have health care, if I can't take care of my family, it doesn't matter if we have global peace and gun control and everything else,"" said Jeff Nobers, executive director of the Builders Guild of Western Pennsylvania.""This is one of the most robust economies in the country,"" Mr. Nobers added, ""and it's mostly fueled by, yeah, the gas industry, the burgeoning petrochemical industry, manufacturing. And you have politicians that say, no, we don't need this because there's 200 people working for Google in East Liberty,"" referring to a shining commercial area of Pittsburgh.Four of the labor leaders, all Democrats who said they supported Mrs. Clinton in 2016, said they would most likely sit out the 2020 election if Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren were the nominee.""If we end up with a Democratic candidate that supports a fracking ban, I'm going to tell my members that they either don't vote or vote for the other guy,"" said James T. Kunz Jr., business manager of the International Union of Operating Engineers.A fifth labor leader, a registered Democrat, said he had voted for Mr. Trump and that he intended to do so again.Environmental activists say that as voters learn more about climate change and the consequences of fracking, which has been linked to earthquakes and contaminated drinking water, they will embrace broader bans on oil and gas development. Besides, some say, regardless of the nominee's position, Mr. Trump will bludgeon Democrats anyway.He has already started. ""Virtually every leading Democrat has pledged to entirely eliminate American production of oil, clean coal, natural gas,"" Mr. Trump said, incorrectly, at a rally in Hershey, Pa., in December.Republicans say they believe they have a weapon against Mr. Biden in his reply at last month's debate. When asked if he would sacrifice some oil and gas jobs for a greener economy he said, ""The answer is yes.""Mark Dixon, a documentary filmmaker and environmental activist from Pittsburgh, said hearing the liberal candidates' call for a fracking ban was an ""extraordinary moment.""""I was overjoyed and stunned that the conversation had moved that far that fast,"" Mr. Dixon said.He viewed Mr. Biden's dismissal of an anti-fracking environmentalist in December as ""a slap in the face."" In the exchange posted online by the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate change advocacy group, Mr. Biden told the activist, ""Well, you ought to vote for someone else.""Mr. Fetterman, the Pennsylvania lieutenant governor, is no moderate. Mr. Sanders campaigned for him in 2018. His wife, who came to America as an undocumented immigrant, recently endorsed Ms. Warren.But while he insisted that every major Democrat could carry Pennsylvania, he sounded especially bullish on Mr. Biden. ""Being completely neutral, Joe Biden would be all but impossible for Trump to beat,"" he said.PhotographA Shell oil site being built in Monaca, Pa., above, and known as the cracker, will convert ethane, a product of fracking, into pellets for plastic manufacturing.

| Jump to first hitA frequent surrogate for Joseph R. Biden Jr. on the campaign trail, Ms. Owens has a résumé that reveals how politics, business and family converge for the Bidens.SWANSEA, S.C. -- Valerie Biden Owens traveled past swamps, harvested fields and parked tractors to a small church, where she stepped off a bus to address voters. She had her talking points memorized.Just as she had done at every other stop campaigning for her brother, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Ms. Owens invoked the deep personal suffering he endured, and how it infused him with empathy and toughened him against adversity.She also recounted the role she played in helping him recover after the death of his first wife and daughter in 1972 in a car accident, when she took over as a substitute mother for Mr. Biden's two sons, Beau and Hunter.""That was nothing heroic,"" she said. ""It was exactly what my brother would have done for me. It was called family.""It was not the only time she would have her older brother's back. Biden family lore holds that Ms. Owens ran her brother's campaign for class president 60 years ago, and has been at it ever since. She managed all of his Senate campaigns and his first two presidential races, playing a central role in her brother's career -- as his confidante, closest political adviser and one of his top surrogates on the campaign trail.Mr. Biden calls her his best friend. ""She's been on my handlebar since she was 3 years old,"" he told another South Carolina church gathering.She has also benefited from her connections to her brother, receiving jobs, appointments and speaking engagements over the years. ""I had a better seat at the table because my brother is at the head of the table,"" Ms. Owens has said, acknowledging the symbiosis of the relationship.Her relationship with him reveals the powerful and integral role that family has played in Mr. Biden's ascent to power.Those familial connections are newly resonant in the highly charged partisan climate of this political season, as President Trump and Republicans attack Mr. Biden for the overseas business dealings of his son Hunter.This year is not the first time that Mr. Biden's family have raised questions. In 2008, a Washington-based good government group took issue with his Senate campaign's payments to relatives, which included Ms. Owens. In a report, the left-leaning organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington said that, while legal, such payments had the potential for abuse.Other examples include Ms. Owens's 2016 appointment by former President Barack Obama as alternate representative to the United Nations -- a largely ceremonial four-month job that paid about $26,000; her nearly 20-year career as vice president of Joe Slade White & Company, the media consulting firm that previously handled Mr. Biden's campaign commercials; and her current job as vice chair and a consultant at the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware. The university has declined to disclose her contract.""The Bidens are a very close family and they always try to help each other,"" said Mike Lux, a Democratic strategist who worked in Mr. Biden's 1988 presidential campaign.The Biden campaign declined repeated requests to interview Ms. Owens for this article, but provided a statement: ""Anyone who meets Valerie can immediately see her innate talent and intrinsic skill,"" said Elizabeth Alexander, a campaign spokeswoman. ""She and her brother have been an indomitable team since they were children. Some might ask, 'Would she have been successful but for her brother?' Others might ask the question in reverse.""Honing her management skillsAs Ms. Owens ventured from her early career as a schoolteacher to a place in the limelight -- campaign, government and private work tied to her brother's political fortune -- she gained a reputation as a driven and passionate advocate, both for her brother and for women.Over the years, Ms. Owens has honed her speaking skills. She has been retained as a speaker by companies and organizations, including Bank of America and the MGM Resorts Foundation, frequently to talk about women's empowerment and body language.As a volunteer, she has traveled extensively with Women's Campaign International, a State Department- and USAID-funded organization operated by Marjorie Margolies, a former member of Congress who is also Chelsea Clinton's mother-in-law. (Ms. Margolies said Ms. Owens was not paid for her appearances.)In May 2013 -- while Mr. Biden was vice president -- Ms. Owens was among the speakers at a conference in Baku, Azerbaijan, that the Justice Department later described as an ""attempt at foreign influence.""Participants -- including Ms. Owens, several members of Congress and former aides to Mr. Obama -- were led to believe that the Caspian Sea gathering was hosted by the Turquoise Council, a Houston-based nonprofit organization.But behind-the-scenes funding for the all-expenses-paid meeting came from SOCAR, the state-owned oil company, amid an image-burnishing effort by Azerbaijan's authoritarian leader, Ilham Aliyev.""It was an example of what many people don't like about Washington,"" said Michael J.G. Cain, a professor at St. Mary's College of Maryland, who attended. ""There was plenty of money around."" A congressional ethics investigation found that participants were lavished with gifts.Ms. Owens spoke twice at the gathering, where speaking fees ranged from $2,500 to $15,000 for former Obama administration officials, according to a report by The Washington Diplomat, a publication covering the diplomatic community.Ms. Owens is advertised by several speakers' bureaus, with one listing her minimum speaking fee at $40,000.The Biden campaign would not disclose Ms. Owens' standard speaking fee.It is not Ms. Owens's speaking ability, though, but her management and organizational skills that some have credited with propelling her brother to the Senate seat in Delaware.Ted Kaufman, a one-time Biden aide who succeeded him as a senator, recalled his friend's first Senate campaign in 1972. ""I told him, 'I've got to be honest with you -- I don't think you've got a chance to win,""' Mr. Kaufman said recently.A poll three months before the election showed Mr. Biden with under 20 percent of the vote against the popular Republican incumbent, Senator Cale Boggs.Summoning an Irish-Catholic call to arms that elevates the importance of blood ties, the entire family pitched in. One brother, James Biden, took charge of raising money. Another, Frank Biden, managed volunteers. Their mother ran kaffeeklatsches. Ms. Owens's first husband, Bruce Saunders, handled the budget.Ms. Owens managed the campaign, while her brother was out knocking on doors and shaking hands.""She was really good at the management part of the campaign,"" Mr. Kaufman said. ""She got a lot of quality people really super involved.""On election night, Mr. Biden took Mr. Boggs by surprise, winning by about 3,000 votes. At 29, a young father with a wife and three children, he was headed to Washington, D.C. Six weeks later, the euphoria ended tragically.Ms. Owens was with her brother at the Capitol when they got the phone call telling them that his family had been in a car accident.Grief-stricken, Mr. Biden thought about relinquishing his Senate seat. His sister would help convince him to stay.""Val was the critical anchor who helped Joe decide he was going to remain in the Senate, and to decide he was going to go on with life,"" said Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, who has known the Biden family for years.So Ms. Owens took on yet another critical assignment -- stand-in mother for Mr. Biden's two surviving sons. She quit her job as a teacher to stay home with the boys full time. Mr. Biden has called his sister ""the cornerstone that allowed me to sustain and then rebuild my family.""""We moved in with Joe,"" Mr. Saunders, Ms. Owens's first husband, recalled recently. ""The commitment at that time was making sure the boys were OK and making sure that Joe was able to fulfill his responsibilities.""Mr. Saunders subsequently got a big appointment -- director of the Delaware Economic Development Office. He credits it to his connection to Mr. Biden.""That's how life works,"" Mr. Saunders said. ""I know my chances were a lot better being his brother-in-law. That's the only advantage that ever worked for me.""Ms. Owens remarried in 1975, and her second husband, John T. Owens, a lawyer and businessman, also moved in with Mr. Biden.Two years later, Ms. Owens and her family moved out of her brother's home. Mr. Biden had remarried.Some bipartisan helpMr. Biden has emphasized his ability to work ""across the aisle"" with Republicans. That was the case in 1998 when a call came in to then-Mayor Rudy Giuliani's office at City Hall: Mr. Biden wanted Mr. Giuliani to hire his niece, Missy Owens -- Valerie's daughter -- for a midlevel job in the administration. Mr. Giuliani complied without complaint, four people familiar with the request said.Missy Owens, now 43, began working on Mr. Giuliani's legislative affairs team in June 1998, and remained until August of 1999. The mayor's senior staff thought highly of her political skills, said several of her former colleagues who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing private assessments.She now works as a senior executive with Coca-Cola in Washington and counts herself among the extended friends-and-family group who informally advises her uncle. Shortly after the Obama-Biden team took over in Washington in 2009, Missy Owens and her sister, Casey, both landed federal jobs, according to their LinkedIn profiles.Missy Owens became deputy chief of staff at the Energy Department in 2009, remaining with the federal government for three years. Casey Owens joined the Treasury Department as special assistant to the senior coordinator for China, also in 2009, and left the government in 2011. Casey Owens, now known as Casey Castello, works in Starbucks management in Seattle.Ms. Alexander, the spokeswoman for the Biden campaign, said both women brought ""impeccable academic and professional credentials"" to their government jobs.In 2008, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington released a report, ""A Family Affair"" that analyzed payments by members of Congress to their relatives. The group ranked Mr. Biden among the ""top five senators paying the most money in salaries or fees to family members."" Mr. Biden's 2002 campaign paid Ms. Owens $51,286 in salary and made $3,618 in payments to her daughter Casey. His leadership PAC also paid $38,974 to Hunter Biden's firm for legal fees in 2005 and 2006.Mr. Biden's campaign said Hunter Biden's firm worked on the account but he was not involved and received no payments from it.By that time, Ms. Owens has said, she had been hired by Joe Slade White & Company, which she joined in 1997. She left her job at the company to run her brother's campaigns, she has said.Joe Slade White, founder of the media consulting firm, recalled that he was first contacted by Ms. Owens in 1995 during the run-up to Mr. Biden's fifth Senate race. Worried that his constituents had forgotten what he stood for, Mr. Biden wanted fresh commercials.Mr. White not only landed the Biden account, but he was also so impressed with Ms. Owens that he hired her.She remained with the company until Mr. White dissolved it in 2016, but said she took a leave during Mr. Biden's Senate campaigns as well as his 2008 run for the Democratic nomination, when his campaign paid the firm about $1.6 million.Much of that money was passed through to broadcasting outlets and not retained by Joe Slade White & Company. Mr. White acknowledged that his arrangement with Ms. Owens was somewhat unusual in the industry, saying he was not aware of any top politician who had a relative working for the candidate's media consulting firm.But he added, ""I absolutely know, Joe Biden never got us any campaigns,"" Mr. White said.On the campaign trail, Ms. Owens often recalled how her brother empowered her as a young girl.""In our family, it made perfect sense that I was going to be his campaign manager,"" Ms. Owens told a group in Allendale County in South Carolina, recalling their childhood in Delaware. ""He took me with him his whole life. I opened my eyes and he was there. He said, 'Come on, Val, we've got places to go, things to do and people to see, so let's go.' And I was his perpetual sidekick.""Glenn Thrush contributed reporting.Glenn Thrush contributed reporting.PhotographValerie Biden Owens, above, campaigning for her brother, Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitFour years ago, Mr. Sanders drew support from some voters who didn’t like Hillary Clinton. Joe Biden is poised to do well with black Democrats and college-educated white voters.
DETROIT — Four years ago, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont scored an upset win over Hillary Clinton in the Michigan Democratic primary, reviving his insurgent candidacy one week after his political prospects dimmed because of Super Tuesday losses.
Now Mr. Sanders finds himself once again urgently in need of a bounce-back victory in Michigan’s presidential primary after another disappointing Super Tuesday, this time against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Mr. Sanders has shaken up his schedule to hold three days of events and rallies in Michigan. He has intensified his attacks on Mr. Biden over trade, a major issue in the state; in remarks in Dearborn on Saturday, he recalled joining picket lines to protest “disastrous” trade deals. And his campaign arranged an event in Flint on Saturday night for the explicit purpose of Mr. Sanders making his case to black voters, who have largely favored Mr. Biden so far. The Flint event mostly drew white voters, though, and Mr. Sanders mostly reiterated his stump speech.
As Mr. Biden now attempts to leverage his Super Tuesday success and build momentum, Mr. Sanders may face even longer odds in Michigan than he did in 2016. The state that Mr. Sanders last week called “very, very important” suddenly looks forbidding for him.
Mr. Biden, despite having a thin operation in Michigan, appears likely to do well with black Democrats and college-educated white voters, two groups that handed him decisive margins in Virginia, North Carolina and several other states on Super Tuesday. And the exit polling and voting trends in some of those states indicate that Mr. Sanders has declined in strength with working-class white voters, who, uneasy with Mrs. Clinton in 2016, delivered him landslide wins across much of central and northern Michigan that year.
Michigan, with its 125 delegates, is the most populous state to vote on Tuesday, and it is the first of the big Midwestern battlegrounds to cast ballots — a general election trophy that President Trump painfully pulled from the Democratic column in 2016 with a narrow win. But Michigan also could amount to a bellwether for the rest of the Democratic primary race this spring.
With Mr. Biden appearing strong in the South and Mr. Sanders winning in the West, the industrial Midwest could effectively determine the nomination. And if Mr. Sanders can’t win in Michigan, he may struggle when Ohio and Illinois vote on March 17 and Wisconsin on April 7, while also undercutting his claims about expanding the electorate in some of the most pivotal general election swing states.
“Michigan is an important state to do well in because the issues facing residents here are issues we see across the country, so a strong message and showing here will be extremely helpful for the nomination,” said Representative Rashida Tlaib, one of Mr. Sanders’s most prominent supporters in the state.
Recognizing the stakes here, Mr. Sanders is assailing Mr. Biden for his support of what he called “disastrous trade agreements like Nafta.” And his campaign is airing a commercial in the manufacturing-heavy state that features a former autoworker highlighting the former vice president’s lack of regret for supporting the pact while pointing out that Mr. Sanders has opposed free trade deals.
As he addressed supporters in Dearborn, Mr. Sanders devoted about a third of his stump speech to attacking Mr. Biden, lashing him not only on trade but also over entitlement programs, support for the war in Iraq and a willingness to take donations from wealthy donors.
“Our campaign and our administration is about representing the working families in the country,” Mr. Sanders said.
Abdul El-Sayed, a Sanders supporter who ran for governor in 2018, said he believed that Michigan Democrats would see clear distinctions between the two candidates.
“Free trade helped decimate those manufacturing jobs — Bernie has always been against it, Biden has been for it,” he said.
But recent election trends in Michigan are not encouraging for Mr. Sanders. In 2018, Michigan Democrats rallied behind a number of moderates — most notably Gretchen Whitmer in the governor’s race, and Haley Stevens and Elissa Slotkin in congressional races — and ended up winning Republican-held seats and loosening the G.O.P.’s grip on the state.
Mr. El-Sayed, who ran against Ms. Whitmer for governor on progressive issues like “Medicare for all,” enjoyed Mr. Sanders’s support and a flood of news media attention in 2018, but did not capture a single county in that primary. Ms. Whitmer, a former Democratic leader of the State Senate whose most memorable vow was to “fix the damn roads,” beat him by nearly 22 points.
While the race was somewhat competitive in Detroit and around Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, Ms. Whitmer ran up enormous margins across much of rural Michigan.
“The Whitmer primary victory over El-Sayed paints a clear road map for Biden over Bernie,” said Eric Goldman, who ran Ms. Whitmer’s campaign. “Biden will excel where Whitmer won big plus he’ll run up the score with black voters.”
Mr. Sanders’s candidacy may in fact hinge on whether he’s able to perform better with African-Americans in the Midwest than he has in the South — and if he can replicate his strength with working-class white voters who abandoned Mrs. Clinton in the primary and general election. Mr. Biden’s supporters, in turn, believe that he is better positioned than Mrs. Clinton was, including with union members who like the former vice president and don’t want their health insurance to change under a Medicare for all system.
“The connection with the workers here is at a completely different level,” said Mayor Mike Duggan of Detroit, a Biden supporter, noting the former vice president’s support for the auto industry during the Great Recession. “We have a candidate who I think will bring the traditional Democratic coalition back together.”
Also lifting Mr. Biden in Michigan is some of what helped him going into the primary last Tuesday in Virginia, where many of the state’s leading Democrats endorsed him in the run-up to the balloting. Ms. Whitmer, Ms. Slotkin and Ms. Stevens all threw their support behind Mr. Biden this past week.
In an acknowledgment that his campaign would be grievously wounded if he did not rebound in Michigan, Mr. Sanders canceled an event scheduled for Mississippi, which also votes Tuesday, to spend more time here. And he has abruptly started to attack Mr. Biden on abortion rights, not an issue the democratic socialist typically uses against his intraparty rivals.
It is clear why Mr. Sanders is scrambling — the Super Tuesday results carried ominous signs for his candidacy. In next-door Minnesota, for example, Mr. Biden did not visit once but still defeated Mr. Sanders 44-32 among white voters without a college degree, according to exit polls.
Representative Dan Kildee, a longtime Michigan Democrat who has not endorsed a candidate in the presidential race, said Mr. Sanders was in a far weaker position going into Tuesday than he was four years ago. Voters then wanted to slow Mrs. Clinton’s front-running campaign and did not feel the level of Trump-inspired alarm that they do now.
“Those factors conspired against Hillary much to the benefit of Bernie,” Mr. Kildee said. “The feeling that she was inevitable, and his supporters were much more animated. And there was just, among some, a lack of enthusiasm for her campaign.”
Now, Mr. Kildee said, Mr. Biden is experiencing a surge of enthusiasm because of “the absolute commitment to beat Donald Trump.”
Brandon Dillon, a former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said, “I know people personally who voted for Bernie because they wanted to send a message to Hillary.”
Now, Mr. Dillon said, Mr. Sanders isn’t “a novelty anymore.”
“People just want to want to win because we know who our opponent is and what he can do if he gets another four years,” he continued.
Some of the more Clinton-friendly precincts from 2016 may be even more hospitable to Mr. Biden now that Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, is out of the presidential race. Polls taken while Mr. Bloomberg was still running showed Mr. Biden leading but with the former mayor of New York, who poured tens of millions of dollars into the state, also receiving some votes.
Yet now that Mr. Bloomberg has withdrawn and endorsed Mr. Biden, some of his supporters appear poised to migrate to the former vice president; a Detroit News survey taken before Super Tuesday found 49 percent of Mr. Bloomberg’s supporters indicating that Mr. Biden was their second choice, while just 18 percent said Mr. Sanders was their second choice.
These Bloomberg-to-Biden voters could prove especially crucial in the Detroit area, which was where Mrs. Clinton ran the strongest. In suburban Oakland County, for example, Mrs. Clinton won by about five points in 2016. But after Mr. Biden’s commanding margins in similar upscale communities on Super Tuesday, many Michigan Democrats expect him to win by far more there.
“Those women are voting for Joe Biden against Bernie Sanders and they’ll vote for him again against Donald Trump,” State Senator Adam Hollier said of the suburban women who helped power the Democrats in the midterms, and who surged to the polls last Tuesday.
Just as worrisome for Mr. Sanders, the same Detroit News poll had Mr. Biden winning 40 percent of black voters while Mr. Sanders was taking just 16 percent.
Mr. Hollier, who initially supported former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., represents a legislative district in and around Detroit that includes a number of working-class black neighborhoods as well as some of the most affluent enclaves in the state. He said, “everybody in my circle is coalescing around Joe Biden.”
At first, he said, black and white voters alike were “looking for President Obama — but instead we went with the one we’ve always felt comfortable with.”

| Jump to first hitWhite working-class voters lifted Bernie Sanders to victory over Hillary Clinton in Michigan four years ago, but Joe Biden won that demographic on Super Tuesday, as well as African-Americans.GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- Dave Burdick has supported Vermont's democratic socialist in Congress since 2005, a full decade before Bernie Sanders's first presidential race.""I've been very fortunate, I've been the beneficiary of white male privilege my whole life,"" said Mr. Burdick, 65, who owns a small business in Western Michigan. ""It's not fair. We've got to change the dynamics.""He and his wife, Mary Lukens, are anxious about putting a daughter through college, saving for retirement and shouldering up to $30,000 a year in health costs. ""All these economic issues that Sanders brings up are something that we experience daily,"" Ms. Lukens said.At a Sanders rally here on Sunday, the couple skewed older than most others by about a generation, though they shared the disdain of the Sanders youth brigade for moderate Democrats like Joseph R. Biden Jr. ""Growing up during Nam, you look around and just want a choice for a change,"" Mr. Burdick said. ""You know what -- we were right back then and we're right now.""With Mr. Biden the beneficiary of a surge after carrying 10 states on Super Tuesday last week, Sanders supporters in Michigan, which votes Tuesday, know they are his firewall in the first of several Midwest states going to the polls in the next two weeks, likely writing his fate.Even as Mr. Biden is heading a bandwagon with former 2020 rivals and moderate Democratic voters clambering aboard, Mr. Sanders has a loyal base that is emotionally bound to him, an attachment rooted in their own economic struggles and lived experiences, rather than triangulating the most electable candidate.Tuesday's primary contests, in six states including Missouri and Washington, are unfolding against a backdrop of high anxiety over the economic and health consequences of the coronavirus outbreak. For most Sanders voters, plummeting stock prices matter less than the broader injustices he champions around wage inequality, health care and student loan debt.If Mr. Sanders defies expectations in Michigan, a state he won in the 2016 primary, it will be because his all-out efforts here over the last four days succeeded in broadening his support, reversing the demographic trends that broke against him on Super Tuesday.While doubling his organizing staff in the state to 25, he is running TV ads that attack Mr. Biden on trade and Social Security, expanding his outreach to voters and holding a multitude of events.Meanwhile, a confident Mr. Biden scheduled only one visit to the state in recent days, on Monday, when he planned a rally in Detroit with Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. Mr. Booker endorsed the former vice president on Monday. Earlier he sent Senator Amy Klobuchar for a couple of low-key events.""If you look at what Joe's running here versus what we're running here,"" Bill Neidhardt, a Sanders spokesman, said over the weekend, ""they'll send a surrogate or two out here, but we're going to have Bernie talk to as many people as possible, and then we're going to have door knockers talk to as many people as possible.""On Sunday, according to campaign counts, Mr. Sanders drew crowds of more than 7,000 in Grand Rapids, where the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the two-time presidential candidate, endorsed him, and over 10,000 in Ann Arbor, where he was introduced by America's second most popular democratic socialist, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.""In order for us to win we have to grow, we must be inclusive, we must bring more people into this movement,"" Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said.One possible sign of progress in widening his coalition is that former supporters of Senator Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out of the Democratic presidential race last week but has yet to make an endorsement, were not hard to find in the Sanders multitudes. One of them, Tom Sapkowski, said, ""I don't think Biden's a hard enough left turn.""Mr. Sapkowski, who worked 35 years ""turning wrenches"" as an auto mechanic, has lived the contradictions of the American economy, where unemployment is low but incomes for those who aren't rich feel like they've flatlined. ""Things have not changed for the middle class for the past 50 years,"" he said. He remembered ""during the Clinton administration where I made like 80, 90 grand, but apparently that was too much.""His wife, Kim, who lost her job as an education administrator in January, said: ""I was just thinking this morning, my dad, he was 58 when he retired from the telephone company. He had a very nice retirement. Belonged to the union. And here I am 55 and nowhere near to retiring.""Younger voters often brought up the huge burden of college debt for their generation, which Mr. Sanders proposes to cancel.At a rally on Saturday in Flint, as well as one on Friday in Detroit -- both cities with majority black populations -- the Sanders supporters were largely a sea of white faces. They revealed that Mr. Sanders has not overcome his weakness with black voters. Despite years of outreach to African-Americans since his loss to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic race, Mr. Sanders saw black voters choosing his rival in Southern states on Super Tuesday.He won Michigan that year -- the high-water mark of his campaign -- by carrying white voters, especially whites without a college degree, who represented more than one in three voters. Winning those voters again not just in Michigan but in Ohio and Illinois, which vote on March 17, undergirds Mr. Sanders's hope for a comeback.His TV ads and his speeches hammer Mr. Biden for supporting trade deals including the North American Free Trade Agreement, reviled by many factory workers, and for past statements suggesting an openness to cutting Social Security.""This city got destroyed by NAFTA,"" said Glenn Chatters, a Sanders supporter in Flint, who works as a heating and air conditioning installer. In 1992, he voted for the third-party candidate Ross Perot because of his warnings about trade deals.He is hopeful, if not entirely optimistic, that Mr. Sanders can again win working-class white voters in Michigan, many of whom in 2016 may have been voting against Mrs. Clinton and have since been lost to President Trump.""I hope that people actually stop and listen to what he actually has to say, instead of the party lines,"" Mr. Chatters said. ""Sometimes people are so swayed by the term 'socialism' when they're driving on their free roads, they're taking their kids to the free school.""In the Super Tuesday primaries, it was Mr. Biden who won working-class white voters, helping him to carry Northern states including Maine and Minnesota, an ominous sign for Mr. Sanders. Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said he was skeptical of Mr. Sanders's ability to repeat his 2016 Michigan win, or his chances elsewhere in the Midwest, because Democrats this year, who singularly want to beat Mr. Trump, are less open to revisiting arguments over trade or Social Security.""Voters, astonishingly, have taken over the nominating process,"" he said. ""Biden did well among blacks, suburban whites and white working-class voters because they want him to take on Trump. That was so powerful on Super Tuesday.""Most Sanders supporters said they would grieve his failure to win the nomination if it comes to that, but they would vote for Mr. Biden in November. But not all.In Flint, the fiery Harvard professor Cornel West, a Sanders surrogate, wound up the crowd by accusing Mr. Biden of being ""a neoliberal,"" eliciting hearty boos. Afterward, an audience member, Bob Granville, echoed the critique. Neoliberalism, he said, ""means socialism for the rich and a rugged capitalism for everyone else.""If Mr. Biden is the nominee, said Mr. Granville, a retired work-force trainer, he plans to vote for a third-party candidate in protest. ""People say, oh, you're going to be part of letting Trump in there. I say, if you're going to run Biden, we deserve Trump.""Despite the avowed desire of the Sanders campaign to broaden his appeal, Mr. Sanders himself has a penchant for pushing away moderate voters he needs by frequently attacking the Democratic ""establishment."" On Sunday, he accused party leaders of forcing Ms. Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., out of the race to help Mr. Biden ""and try to defeat me.""David Betras, a former Democratic chairman of Mahoning County, Ohio, in an industrial region where Mr. Trump did well in 2016, said he feared that the more Mr. Sanders attacks ""the establishment,"" the more enraged his supporters will become, with many likely to sit out the general election. ""His supporters are fervent and will feel betrayed by Democrats.""That is not an inevitability. Mr. Sanders explicitly tells supporters in nearly every speech that he will back Mr. Biden as the nominee.And there are anecdotal signs that Mr. Sanders may be growing support.Eric Mays, a city councilman in Flint, arrived as an undecided voter to his rally there on Saturday, which was billed as ""a town hall on racial and economic justice.""""Bernie has got me fired up,"" he said. ""I might very well be voting Bernie on Tuesday.""Mr. Mays said that despite the overwhelming support of black voters in Southern states for Mr. Biden, Michigan could break differently. ""We know Bernie Sanders will get black voters out of Flint,"" he said.""I hope that we see him all the way through this year.""PhotographWhite working-class voters lifted Bernie Sanders past Hillary Clinton in Michigan four years ago, but Joe Biden won that demographic on Super Tuesday.; Mr. Sanders at a rally Saturday in Grand Rapids, Mich. He has stepped up his efforts in the state in recent days. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY CHANG W.

| Jump to first hitFor more than 30 years, over three presidential runs, Mr. Biden has been waiting to notch a victory like the one in South Carolina. Now he has to face the test of Super Tuesday.GREENVILLE, S.C. -- Joe Biden did what he had to do, and then some. Now, his supporters say, it is time for fellow moderates to do the same.With a commanding victory on Saturday, Mr. Biden made a compelling case that he is the Democrat best positioned to head off the nomination of Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist senator whom centrists fear would doom the party this fall.Next comes the awkward part.If a place like South Carolina, built to reward Mr. Biden's strength with black voters, helped mask some of his weaknesses for one week, his fate ahead of Super Tuesday is still shadowed by the preceding failures of both Mr. Biden's campaign and the candidate himself. These aftereffects are already complicating a stretch that finds his rivals preaching patience as Biden allies demand urgency -- and unity, around him.After months as the front-runner, with the power to clear the field if he excelled, Mr. Biden is now a candidate at once determined and dependent. He is convinced that he has done enough to demonstrate his dominance with a core Democratic constituency and affirm his argument that no one is better suited to take on President Trump. ""If the Democrats want a nominee who's a Democrat -- A lifelong Democrat! A proud Democrat! An Obama-Biden Democrat! -- then join us,"" he told supporters in Columbia, S.C., speaking with more force and precision than usual. ""We have the option of winning big or losing big. That's the choice.""Mr. Biden took direct, conspicuous aim at Mr. Sanders: ""Talk about revolution isn't changing anyone's life,"" he said. ""We need real changes, right now.""But for all his undeniable success on Saturday, Mr. Biden remains hamstrung on two fronts: by several competitors still disinclined to stand down, even if they siphon crucial non-Sanders votes, and by a campaign organization that party officials have described as jarringly thin in many of the states that will vote on Tuesday.His ability to address either of these problems in time is far from assured, in a primary that has already exposed his capacity for bungling on the campaign trail, his enthusiasm deficit with many younger voters and his struggles in fund-raising.Why would Michael R. Bloomberg step aside, before the states he is contesting have even voted, with hundreds of millions of dollars already sunk into his bid and a conviction that he is the man for the job?What do Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar owe Mr. Biden, whom they each dusted in New Hampshire (and, in Mr. Buttigieg's case, in Iowa), where the voters who spend the most time with their candidates decided that the former vice president could not be trusted to defeat President Trump?The result is a party establishment that agrees on the desired end of avoiding a Sanders nomination but is still bickering about the means.The most creative among old-guard Democrats have spent recent weeks gaming out knotty scenarios to keep Mr. Sanders from the top of the ticket: a convention migration to another contender if Mr. Sanders falls short of a pledged delegate majority or the drafting, somehow, of a white-knight candidate who is not even running.But settling for Mr. Biden would appear to be the straightest line. And in the coming days, his supporters plan to argue, loudly, that the time for dithering has passed.""The case you're going to make is, 'Look, guys, this is the only alternative to Bernie, which is the only alternative to losing the election to Trump, and we need to consolidate,""' said Rufus Gifford, who was finance director for Barack Obama's re-election campaign and supports Mr. Biden. But, he quickly acknowledged, ""the big challenge there is Bloomberg. We all know that the Bloomberg vote is not going to Bernie, for the most part. So without a doubt, Bloomberg could be playing a spoiler.""Top Democratic officials in key battleground states that go to the polls Tuesday, from Alabama to Texas, have said that Mr. Bloomberg poses an acute threat to Mr. Biden, eating into his standing with moderate voters. It does not help that early voting has already been underway in many states against the backdrop of Mr. Biden's bleak finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire.In interviews over the past week, a number of Mr. Biden's top surrogates in key Super Tuesday states have heightened their attacks on the former New York City mayor, a sign of escalating tensions to come. ""Bloomberg is spending a lot of money on the ground,"" said Representative Terri Sewell, Democrat of Alabama. ""But there's one thing I know for a fact: People in my district died and fought for the right to vote, and that vote is not for sale.""Yet the Alabama Democratic Conference, a powerful black caucus in the state, has endorsed Mr. Bloomberg, as has Anthony Daniels, the Alabama House minority leader.In North Carolina, too, Mr. Bloomberg has racked up a host of powerful endorsers and locked down some of the state's top strategists. Representative Alma Adams, a Biden supporter, was sharply dismissive, calling Mr. Bloomberg ""doomed"" in the state and noting that he was once a Republican.""People aren't stupid around here,"" she said. ""I think he's trying to trick his way in, claiming to be a Democrat and claiming to have close ties with Obama.""Mr. Bloomberg's presence is not the Biden campaign's only cause for concern. On Saturday, Mr. Biden's most important endorser in South Carolina, Representative James E. Clyburn, acknowledged organizational problems and, in a CNN interview, raised the prospect of assessing ""how we retool this campaign.""But Biden advisers are hoping that his victory in South Carolina will resonate in states, congressional districts and media markets that, like this state, have a significant base of African-American Democrats.Mr. Biden is scheduled to visit Selma, Ala., and Norfolk, Va., on Sunday, and Houston and Dallas on Monday before heading to California. The campaign is also optimistic about an influx of cash that traditionally comes with primary victories. Such an infusion could be plowed into both his Super Tuesday operation and the states that vote later in March. There are also efforts underway to organize fund-raisers throughout the rest of the month.""Hopefully, some other of the candidates will really start thinking about, you know, stepping away and letting this race shape up where the democratic socialist folks can have their say, and the moderates to the left can have their say,"" said Representative Tim Ryan, Democrat of Ohio and a former 2020 presidential candidate who is supporting Mr. Biden. ""And we can have an argument to the finish.""Mr. Ryan said that he would be at one of several organizing events the campaign is holding in his state on Sunday. He hopes to persuade Sanders opponents that Mr. Biden must be embraced for the good of the party.Of course, ""the party"" is less a monolith than an unruly collection of fiefdoms, none necessarily powerful enough to make candidates or voters come to heel through sheer force of will or strongly-worded-statement.For 2020 contenders, who have committed a year or more to the cause, the incentives to drop out have perhaps never been weaker than in this political era. Even lower-polling candidates are often still drawing large crowds, still appraising a field without a runaway favorite, still being told that the fight is worth fighting, especially in a campaign so unpredictable.""Everybody believes they are two days away from the big turnaround,"" said Jennifer Palmieri, a former top aide to Mr. Obama and Hillary Clinton. ""It's also a candidate and staff on the ride of their lives. To be like, 'We're going to drop out and go back to the Senate on Tuesday' -- it's just not appealing.""Some Democratic eminences have begun hinting unsubtly, after an early primary season in which an unusually large number of credible choices have stayed on the stage.Barbara Boxer, a former California senator who spoke fondly of Mr. Biden, her onetime colleague, said she would ""never tell other people what to do."" But underperforming candidates, she added, ""ought to look at what their staying in the race means to the country, to the party and to their own reputations."" Ms. Boxer said she hoped to announce an endorsement on Sunday.Many Biden-inclined voters have been less diplomatic. After the former vice president's event in Spartanburg, S.C., on Friday evening, Antwion Yowe, 43, a local pastor, summoned a favored family analogy about separating standout options from the rest.""My dad used to say: 'barbecue and mildew,""' he said. ""You're either barbecue and you go forward, or you're mildew and you're done."" After South Carolina, he suggested, everyone except Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders belonged in the latter camp.Even if his peers were to fall away, Mr. Biden's path would not be straightforward. Mr. Sanders has shown himself capable of building a formidable coalition, particularly in his blowout win in Nevada a week ago. He remains the favorite in California, the grandest delegate trove on the map. He has also flashed a victor's swagger in scheduling events in the home states of two fellow hopefuls, which also happen to have primaries on Tuesday: Massachusetts, represented in the Senate by Elizabeth Warren, and Minnesota, the province of Ms. Klobuchar.Any further setback for Ms. Warren could prove especially helpful to Mr. Sanders, potentially sending some of her progressive supporters into his camp. But voters do not always behave ideologically, a fact that cuts both ways for Mr. Sanders as Mr. Biden banks on a boost if other center-left candidates drop out: Some of that support will drift to Mr. Sanders even if voters do not align precisely with him on policy.For one evening, though, Mr. Biden and his team seemed content not to dwell much on any of that. In Columbia on Saturday night, Mr. Biden -- who has often campaigned in smaller venues -- walked onstage to a raucous victory rally in a large gym. ""We love you, Joe!"" someone cried out.""We can say, without fear of contradiction, the Bidens love you guys,"" Mr. Biden replied. ""The Bidens love you. That's real.""He had won a state for the first time in his life -- in his third presidential campaign, more than three decades after his first.He had three whole days before he would have to do some winning again.Matt Flegenheimer reported from Greenville, S.C., and Katie Glueck from Columbia, S.C.PhotographJoe Biden with supporters in Columbia, S.C., on Saturday.

| Jump to first hitAmy Klobuchar understands how Washington works. Since she was elected to the Senate in 2006, the problems she has tried to tackle since, often in partnership with a Republican colleague, have ranged from herculean (comprehensive immigration reform) to plain common sense (backup paper ballots). ¶ Ms. Klobuchar met with The Times's editorial board on Dec. 10. She put an emphasis on the practical, what she genuinely thinks she can achieve in her administration. Her answers were witty, often feisty, always specific, as she addressed big questions on economics, health policy and foreign policy aimed at getting a sense of the vision underlying that pragmatism. ¶ Here are excerpts from the 90 minute discussion's annotated transcript.Kathleen Kingsbury: So Senator, we've all watched the debates. Many of us have heard you on the trail. We've heard you talk a lot about health care in the past and the Middle East and your past boyfriends. [LAUGHTER] So we want to ask you some questions that we haven't heard you answer so far. We're going to just jump right in. I hope that's O.K. National polls show that the former vice president, Joe Biden, is still leading in a lot of places. Your platform in many ways is very similar to his. Make the case for us of you versus Joe Biden? (1) Amy Klobuchar: Sure. The No. 1 case is that I am someone that has a record of bringing people with me and winning in districts that eluded the Hillary Clinton campaign in 2016. And the, I guess, proof point is what happened in Minnesota where Secretary Clinton, who would have been a great president, had her lowest percentage in a state that she won in the country. And then I went on, as I've done now three times, to win every rural congressional district, including the ones bordering Iowa, North and South Dakota, including the Iron Range, northern Minnesota, where the steelworkers are and including Michele Bachmann's district. And you don't do that just by a fluke when you do it three times. And how I've done this is by going not just where it's comfortable, but where it's uncomfortable. We also had the highest voter turnout in the United States of America when I have led the ticket and flipped the statehouse every single time from Republican to Democrat because it is truly a purple state. I have done that because I view these races not as a personal victory for me, but a state and a national victory. And when you look at it that way, you bring people with you. You bring other electeds with you, and you bring voters with you. While a lot of people have talked about that on the stage, they actually don't have the track record of doing it. And I think in such a critical election that that should really, really matter. The other thing about me is that I am from the heartland, and I think that that matters in this election as well when you look at the states that we need to put together to not just have a victory at 4 in the morning, but to win big. Those states include states that are very similar to mine: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Ohio. As I have said several times, I want to build a blue wall around those states and make Donald Trump pay for it. Those states have significant, of course, manufacturing but also agriculture. I'm the only candidate that's left in this field who asked to be on the Agriculture Committee, [who is] a senior member of that committee and that really knows these issues. And it's an area where Donald Trump has completely messed things up. Finally, I am in a new generation of leaders. I'm well aware I'm only one of two women that are left on that stage after my friend Kamala made that difficult decision just last week. I wish she was still on the stage, honestly. And I think that despite some of the common wisdom of who can beat Donald Trump, I think a woman is a strong candidate to run against Donald Trump. And one of my challenges is to convince some of those people who may be in Vice President Biden's camp just because they think he's more electable or in Mayor Buttigieg's camp that actually I'm the one that can win. (2) KK: O.K. We have a lot of other questions for you. A growing number of Americans, especially in the states that you just named, believe that the economy is rigged against them. Yet you are calling for incremental change relative to other candidates. How do you make the case that that is sufficient for the existing challenge, and how do you reach the more progressive members of the Democratic Party? Yeah, I don't agree with the premise. I don't think it's incremental to want to go to carbon neutral with our environment, and to finally get something done on climate change. And my plan, which is similar to Governor Inslee's plan, and I think he really did us all a favor by getting in this race and making that such an issue. My plan is carbon neutral by 2050 and 45 percent reduction by 2030. It involves the day I get in as president, signing us back into the international climate change agreement and then putting back in place the clean power rules as well as the gas mileage standards, something that you have written about, that I questioned the head of the antitrust division just recently about, about how even when California has been trying to move forward with those gas mileage standards, the administration has chosen to attack the companies that are trying to work with California and threatening antitrust violations, which is completely outrageous. So those are three examples of things I would do immediately. I don't think that's one bit incremental. Nor is introducing sweeping legislation to price carbon. Other examples: Immigration reform. Two presidents have valiantly tried to get that done. George Bush tried. I know because I was in the small group that was picked to work on it. Sheldon [Whitehouse] and I were the two new senators in that group, and I saw how hard he was trying to get it done, but he was defeated. At the time it was Lou Dobbs and right-wing talk radio. (3) Then it was tried again when President Obama was in, and I was on the Judiciary Committee in 2013. That was a really big, good bill, supported by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the Chamber [of Commerce]. We can do it this time. I can do it because I've been intimately involved in these negotiations. Later, the board turned to a more personal subject... KK: So I want to change directions a little bit. O.K. KK: Bear with me. Who has broken your heart? Besides a few boyfriends that still gave me money when I asked them? [LAUGHTER] Who has broken my heart? O.K., so here we go. Lindsey Graham's broken my heart lately in the political system. Just because I like him and know him really well and traveled with him and Senator McCain all over the, all over the world. I'm just more thinking of Senator McCain and how much I miss him right now because I think he would have been really strong on Ukraine and on standing up against some of the things the president did and he's no longer with us. And Lindsey and McCain and I were actually on the front line with former President Poroshenko in a blizzard on New Year's Eve, and I think about this now every New Year's Eve -- because John McCain wanted to show -- after Trump got elected -- wanted to show those countries that we were on their side. (4) And so of course I was disappointed with how the Kavanaugh hearing was handled. I think everyone could see me on TV to see that, but I just hope that he has the ability to rise up here, and has a very important job right now as chair of the Judiciary Committee and certainly smart enough and has shown some tendency in the past to stand up for things and I just wish he would do it again when it comes to this conduct and a whole range of issues about our judicial system. KK: Have you spoken to him directly about that? I did. After the Kavanaugh hearing, we had a little skirmish and leave it, put it behind us. But one thing he did do that was good is -- the work that we did together on the -- he took over the Honest Ads Act from Senator McCain when Senator McCain died. And that's my bill where I took on the social media companies -- before it was cool -- to say that they should have to put disclaimers and show how they pay for ads and have them on file. He did that with me, and he's done a few other things with me. (5) Senator Klobuchar also talked gender... Lauren Kelley: Senator, you alluded earlier to the fact that you're running to become the first female president of the United States. I'm wondering how on the campaign trail you're dealing with a couple of competing realities that we see in the polls. On the one hand you see voters say that they would be really excited to vote for a woman for president more than even a white man. On the other hand, you look at the likability numbers for individual women candidates and they're in the single digits. So I'm just wondering how you think about that reality as you're on the campaign trail? I think it is on me to make my case to the American people. I addressed that some in the last debate, and I was an interesting person to address it, about can a woman win? Because I actually have gone out of my way to make clear that I'm running on my merits, which of course I still am and I will, and let me just explain that. When I've run for the D.A.'s job, I was the first woman in that job. When I ran for U.S. Senate in my state, two very qualified women had -- one the secretary of state, one a majority leader for the State Senate -- each decade had tried to run and lost. And I made it my mission to focus on, not that I want to be the first woman in this job because that had happened in their campaigns. But then I'm the right person for this job, and I'll have your back. I will never forget being in a room of steelworkers, and retired steelworkers and their spouses, in which one woman named Rose Brodovitch raised her hand and said: ""I've never voted for a woman before because I think they should be home with their kids. But in your case, I'm making an exception."" I later heard from the mayor there, the woman mayor, that that was the moment she realized Rose Brodovitch had not voted for her. [LAUGHTER] As I sat there, trying to address these men, they were like, someone said: Can a woman win? I first tried: well, a woman has won in Texas, so I bet a woman can win here. Then: Well, I'm not running as a woman candidate. I'm running on my merits and being accountable and getting things done like you've known I've done as Hennepin County attorney. And finally I said -- wouldn't work now -- ""Last time I checked, half the voters were men. So if I was just running as a woman, it wouldn't work."" And they go, ""Yeah."" I think what that is, is everyone, regardless of who they are or what gender, that they want to know that someone has their back. That is how I have done my work, and it's been very straightforward concept of being a representative and what I would do as president. You listen to them, and you try to get things done. That is why, in my own state, the one very clear poll of me versus Trump where they know who I am, I am 18 points up on Trump, eight points more than the vice president. I do better with men than any of the other candidates, and I have tended to always have a lot of support with men. So, for me to say on the debate floor what I did, which you need to dispel thoughts that you have to be the tallest person in the room or the skinniest person in the room or the loudest voice in the room. That took a lot because -- but I think it is a barrier, and I think that it is on the two of us that are left on the stage as the candidates to dispel that. And you don't always have to talk about it, but men have voted for women. They voted for Laura Kelly to be governor of Kansas. They voted for Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan. They voted for -- and those are executive jobs. So I lead with those. They have done that and they will do it again. But right now it's a mess. There's so many candidates. They have to understand who they are. So that's how I look at it. It's just, it's they -- the men will come around. (6) Next, the interview turned to reparations... Mara Gay: Senator, when asked whether you support reparations, you've demurred and said that the important thing is to invest in communities that have been so hurt by racism. What should that look like? (7) Well, first of all, I'm on the bill, the reparation bill. I'm a co-sponsor of Cory's bill, which is the counterpart to, I think it Sheila Jackson Lee's, if I'm right. Anyway, but it is the counterpoint. (8) MG: For education? Well, it's the reparation commission actually. That's the reparation bill that everyone is on because that way you're going to be able to get recommendations on what the best way is to do that. MG: What do you think the best way is to do that? (9) I don't know. That's why we're doing the commission. But I think, and I think a lot of people would say this, but I think one of the ways you could do it, which is what you're referring to that I've talked about, is investing in communities that have been in poverty for literally centuries, but decade after decade after decade.Credit: By The Editorial BoardPhotographBackers of Amy Klobuchar at an event in Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

| Jump to first hitThe escalation of a Senate inquiry into Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s son has coincided with the former vice president's overwhelming electoral turnaround.WASHINGTON -- Republicans are wielding the power of their Senate majority to intensify an election-year investigation of Hunter Biden's work for a Ukrainian energy firm, putting new scrutiny on the son of Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the former vice president re-emerges as President Trump's chief rival for the presidency.In elevating questions about the younger Mr. Biden's work in Ukraine, Senate Republicans are effectively picking up where the president left off last year when he pressed the country's leaders to investigate the Bidens, an effort that led to his impeachment in the House on charges that he abused his power by seeking foreign help in the 2020 election. It is part of a broader attempt by his allies on Capitol Hill to breathe fresh life into politically charged inquiries into issues that have preoccupied Mr. Trump.Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin and the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, plans to hold a vote next week despite Democratic objections to issue a rare Senate subpoena to Andrii Telizhenko, a former Ukrainian official who worked for Burisma, the energy firm. Mr. Johnson told reporters on Wednesday that he would release an interim report this spring summarizing what Republicans had learned from months of quiet queries.For now, Republicans insist Burisma is a matter of longstanding interest unrelated to Mr. Biden's presidential candidacy, and no evidence has emerged to suggest that either Biden acted improperly. But Mr. Johnson acknowledged that his investigation could affect the election and said that was as it should be.""These are questions that Joe Biden has never adequately answered,"" Mr. Johnson told reporters in the Capitol, a day after Mr. Biden's remarkable Super Tuesday turnabout. ""And if I were a Democrat primary voter, I'd want these questions satisfactorily answered before I cast my final vote.""The increased interest in the Bidens comes as Senate Republicans have ramped up other investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump politically, including an inquiry into the F.B.I.'s Russia investigation and claims that Democrats colluded with Ukraine in the 2016 election.Mr. Biden's campaign has branded the Johnson investigation an abuse of congressional authority and maintained that it would find no evidence of wrongdoing by the former vice president or his family. But Democrats are concerned that Republicans are trying to recreate their playbook for the run-up to the 2016 election, when Mr. Trump -- aided by Republicans and Fox News -- worked to weaponize a steady stream of small disclosures from an investigation into Hillary Clinton to cast her as secretive and potentially corrupt.Some Republicans have privately voiced discomfort about the effort. On Thursday, Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah and a member of the Homeland Security Committee, told reporters that there was ""no question"" that ""looking into Burisma and Hunter appears political."" He said he was not yet sure if he would support the subpoena.Mr. Romney was the only member of his party who voted at the Senate impeachment trial to convict Mr. Trump of abuse of power and remove him from office.""People are tired of these kind of political investigations, and would hope that if there is something of significance that needs to be evaluated, it would be done by perhaps the F.B.I. and some other agency that is not as political as a committee of our body,"" he said.But Mr. Trump has embraced the effort, using his megaphone to try to create a shroud of innuendo and doubt about an increasingly viable opponent. On Wednesday, he circulated on Twitter a report about Mr. Johnson's investigation and later told Sean Hannity of Fox News that portraying the Bidens as corrupt would be a central theme of his bid for re-election.""That will be a major issue in the campaign,"" Mr. Trump said in the interview. ""I will bring that up all the time.""At issue is Hunter Biden's position on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian oil and gas company with a history of corruption, which he held while his father served as vice president overseeing United States policy toward the former Soviet republic. The younger Mr. Biden had no expertise on energy issues and was paid a large salary. Mr. Trump and Republicans have continually raised questions about the arrangement, claiming with no evidence that it was part of a corrupt scheme.Mr. Johnson and Senate Republicans are specifically investigating whether Burisma used Hunter Biden's name and influence to gain access to the Obama administration.The investigation closely resembles the one that Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine to undertake last year into whether Mr. Biden sought to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor for investigating Burisma. That allegation has been discredited -- the prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was widely viewed as corrupt, and his removal was supported by many American and European officials. (Mr. Johnson was among the Republican and Democratic senators who signed a letter at the time calling for ""urgent reforms"" to his office.)But Republicans mounting an impeachment defense for the president in the Senate later said Mr. Trump had been justified in wanting Ukraine to scrutinize the episode, insisting that the president had been asking for a legitimate investigation of possible corruption, not a political favor to smear a rival.Now, Republican senators argue that Mr. Biden's son is fair game.""I am not saying Joe Biden is corrupt -- far from it,"" said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. ""But he had knowledge that his son was sitting on the most corrupt board in the Ukraine, when he was trying to clean up the Ukraine. We are going to hold him accountable for that.""Democrats say Senate Republicans are knowingly raising a false flag for an operation designed to legitimize claims by Mr. Trump and some in the conservative news media.""What is actually new here?"" said Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, one of the Democrats trying to counter the inquiry. ""There is no evidence to date that has implicated Vice President Biden in wrongdoing of any kind, and we base that on our review of hundreds of documents.""Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr. Biden's campaign, accused Mr. Johnson of ""abusing congressional authority in a manner that would make the founding fathers spin in their graves.""""We already knew that Donald Trump is terrified of facing Joe Biden -- because he got himself impeached by trying to force a foreign country to spread lies about the vice president on behalf of his re-election campaign,"" Mr. Bates said. ""Now, Senator Johnson just flat-out conceded that this is a ham-handed effort to manipulate Democratic primary voters.""Those leading the inquiries insist their focus on Burisma is not politically driven, noting that it dates to 2017, before it was clear that Mr. Biden would be a presidential candidate.""We are proceeding with the investigation whether Biden is in or out,"" said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and the chairman of the Finance Committee, who co-signed numerous requests with Mr. Johnson. ""This investigation is about conflicts of interest, not political candidates.""In addition to the Burisma matter, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Grassley are investigating whether Democrats conspired with Ukrainian officials to harm Mr. Trump's campaign in 2016. Senator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina and the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, has previously warned his fellow chairmen in private that any investigation that turned on information from Ukraine should be handled delicately because it could advance Russian efforts to spread disinformation, according to two officials familiar with the discussions, which were first reported by Politico. (Mr. Burr said this week that he had no objection to Mr. Johnson's investigation.)It is unclear how far the Burisma investigation has advanced. The senators indicated they had received documents from multiple individuals in recent weeks, and the State Department has handed over 2,800 pages of records.Mr. Johnson sought approval for the subpoena from Senator Gary Peters of Michigan, the top Democrat in the Homeland Security Committee, but Mr. Peters refused, citing concerns similar to Mr. Burr's.In a letter to committee members on Sunday informing them of the subpoena vote next week, Mr. Johnson stressed that his staff was going to ""great lengths"" to consult with intelligence and law enforcement officials first.""I share the ranking member's interest in ensuring that the Senate and this committee not be used to advance disinformation,"" he wrote in the letter, which came the day after Mr. Biden won the South Carolina primary.PhotographJoseph R. Biden Jr. in Los Angeles on Wednesday. His campaign has branded an inquiry by Senator Ron Johnson, left, chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, into Hunter Biden's ties to a Ukrainian energy company an abuse of congressional authority.

| Jump to first hitHe has such a thorough hold on the party now that any collapse would probably require a political U-turn as sharp as the one that precipitated his rise.
The state of our union is unsettled, chaotic, impossible to pin down. The state of the Democratic primary, improbably, is not.
With a string of commanding victories on Tuesday — Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, probably any other “M” state that might have bothered with a primary this week — Joe Biden appears poised to complete one of the most striking turnarounds in recent campaign memory, finding himself in a dominant position only 10 days after the first state victory of his three presidential runs. His remarkable reversal has banished Senator Bernie Sanders to a familiar electoral perch: an insurgent progressive long shot straining to catch an establishment favorite.
The former vice president has won in the South, in the Northeast, in the Midwest. He has won large states and small ones. He has won in places where his strength with African-Americans could carry him and in others where such residents are fewer and far between.
So thorough is Mr. Biden’s hold on the party now that any collapse would probably require a political U-turn as sharp as the one that precipitated his rise. And as 2020 lurches into a logistically uncertain phase, with rallies canceled over coronavirus fears and voters more likely to privilege steady leadership, Mr. Biden is consistently and significantly outpacing Mr. Sanders on the crucial measure of whom to trust in a crisis, according to exit polls.
Next week’s contests include states where Mr. Biden is expected to perform well again. In Florida, the largest prize on the map until late April, his appeal to older voters and moderates, coupled with Mr. Sanders’s struggles with Cuban-Americans, has Mr. Biden primed for the kind of delegate haul that can only come with a true blowout. A week later, on March 24, the race moves to Georgia, where a large black population is expected to help deliver Mr. Biden another rout.
Unlike 2016, when Mr. Sanders extended his race against Hillary Clinton with a series of victories in caucuses, a format in which he has excelled, this year’s calendar has many more traditional primaries, supplying fewer chances for Mr. Sanders to drive up margins and keep the delegate tally close.
The result — implausible as it seemed last month, when Mr. Biden faltered so badly in Iowa and New Hampshire that establishment Democrats indulged fantasies about a contested convention to stop Mr. Sanders — is a race that could be nearing its functional end.
It is difficult to overstate the whiplash. The last time Mr. Biden ditched one of his own election night parties, he was careening toward a fifth-place finish in New Hampshire in mid-February, skipping out on a Nashua gathering to seek refuge in South Carolina and accept his election-night fate from a safe distance.
On Tuesday, he again pulled out of an event — but this time, out of concerns that his crowd in Cleveland could be exposed to health risks amid the coronavirus scare. Mr. Biden headed instead to Philadelphia, the site of his campaign headquarters, where at the National Constitution Center he sought to project resolve in a time of national anxiety.
With his wife, Jill Biden, by his side, Mr. Biden appeared to describe the race as he sees it now: effectively over on the Democratic side — he thanked Mr. Sanders and his supporters for their “passion” — leaving voters with a choice between himself and President Trump.
And that, he suggested, was not a close call.
“At this moment, when there’s so much fear in the country, and there’s so much fear across the world, we need American leadership,” Mr. Biden said. “We need presidential leadership that’s honest, trusted, truthful and steady. Reassuring leadership.”
Mr. Sanders and his team have not ceded the election publicly, though as the latest election returns came in, his campaign said he would not be speaking Tuesday night. His supporters say that there are many states yet to weigh in, many issues yet to litigate, many chances left for Mr. Biden to squander his advantages — as he has, on and off, for much of the past year as a would-be front-runner who surrendered the label. The Sanders campaign has been eager for the scheduled debate this Sunday, the first one-on-one session with Mr. Biden, a lengthy unscripted setting that could showcase his propensity for missteps.
But if Mr. Sanders could not hold his own on Tuesday — especially in a state like Michigan, the site of his most memorable primary victory of 2016 — it is becoming hard to imagine where he might.
In a sense, Mr. Biden is offering something of a 2016 do-over, coated in patriotism and wishful thinking: Remove Mr. Trump. Prove that the country does not represent his values. And let the work of repair begin, dooming the 45th president to history’s amnesia, eventually.
Mr. Biden decided against a run four years ago as he mourned his son Beau, who died in May 2015. Now, he is running the kind of campaign that voters might expect from a vice president seeking a promotion immediately after his time as second in command, as if the last four years could be effectively elided. He is promising continuity with his party’s prior administration, pledging to build on successes without wide-scale overhaul and even presenting himself as more of a transitional figure than a long-term standard-bearer.
“I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,” Mr. Biden said in Detroit on Monday night, campaigning with new endorsers like Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. “There’s an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country.”
Throughout the campaign, he has declined to meet the demands of the loudest voices on the left — he has super PAC support, attends high-dollar fund-raisers and remains unapologetic about overtures to Republicans — and none of it hurt him much. Instead, Mr. Biden is enticing Democrats with a bloodless bargain: a return to normal — or whatever this nation was on Nov. 7, 2016 — and a vow to make Mr. Trump go away, even if Mr. Biden rarely emphasizes a bold new policy vision.
It is a pitch that shares some elements with Mrs. Clinton’s in 2016, centered often on Mr. Trump’s character and behavior. Mr. Biden and his team seem convinced that the reality of Mr. Trump’s tenure will yield a different outcome this time, with the daily tumult more visceral to voters now than it was in Mrs. Clinton’s prescient-but-hypothetical predictions of executive disorder and excessive tweeting.
There is also the messenger to consider. Mr. Biden recently remarked on an “unfair” sexism in the campaign four years ago. Then came an aside, blunt but true: “That’s not going to happen with me.”
Mr. Sanders is summoning 2016 memories of another sort. After his setbacks this month, he finds himself in much the same bind he faced against Mrs. Clinton, seeking ways to prolong the primary but finding few opportunities for true breakthroughs.
In recent days, Mr. Sanders and his allies have made the case that Democrats would be foolish to nominate the more moderate candidate once again, reminding audiences of Mr. Biden’s potential vulnerabilities on matters of trade and the Iraq war.
“Lots of flashbacks,” said Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator and Mr. Sanders’s national campaign co-chair. “2016 has never ended.”
Mr. Trump, she added, was sure to reprise a formula that worked for him the last time, if Democrats let him. “You best believe Donald J. Trump is going to make this a repeat of 2016,” Ms. Turner said, comparing Mr. Biden’s record to Mrs. Clinton’s. “There are so many similarities for him to hit.”
The president, still known to recount the details of his election victory years after the fact, is not the only veteran of that campaign inclined to linger over it. Mrs. Clinton is starring in a new documentary series in which her loss is featured prominently.
And Mr. Sanders, pressed repeatedly of late about whether his attacks on Mr. Biden might damage the former vice president in November, appeared to grow frustrated last week with a trope he recognized well.
“I heard that back in 2016,” he told reporters in Phoenix. “2016, the feeling was, ‘We should anoint the candidate, and get everybody else — get out of the race.’ Is that really what democracy is about?”
Mr. Biden has not generally felt like a candidate on a glide path to an anointing, though he has appeared exceedingly happy on the campaign trail in recent days, wearing his signature aviator sunglasses indoors at an ice cream shop in California last week and telling reporters about his cash windfall between spoonfuls.
But winning has not changed the underlying weaknesses that defined him through the early states. Despite the growing presence of teleprompters, he still sometimes sets off on long tangents and makes verbal blunders.
He continues to struggle to excite some young people and progressives. He can lose his temper in heated and colorful ways, a trait that delights some voters who take it as a sign of vigor but strikes others as unseemly for a man pursuing the statesman’s mantle. (Mr. Biden swore at a man in Michigan who had suggested Mr. Biden wanted to confiscate guns. “Don’t be such a horse’s ass,” he said at another point in the exchange.)
After Iowa, Mr. Biden’s team underwent a shake-up, and people inside and outside the campaign have since reported more signs of a righted ship. Just last week, three former rivals — Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O’Rourke — announced their endorsements in the span of a few hours, in an extraordinary show of force that sent Mr. Biden into Super Tuesday with a burst of momentum and free media.
It was the kind of dramatic turn that felt essential to boosting a campaign eager for any jolt it could find as it sought to catch up to Mr. Sanders, the early delegate leader.
A week later, Mr. Biden’s success registered as something even more stunning, in its way: a little boring.

| Jump to first hitJoseph R. Biden Jr. widened his advantage over Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary race, capturing Mississippi and Missouri as well as Michigan, with support from both black and white voters.Joseph R. Biden Jr. took command of the Democratic presidential race in decisive fashion on Tuesday, marshaling a powerful multiracial coalition in the South and the Midwest that swept aside Senator Bernie Sanders and completed Mr. Biden's rapid transformation from a sometimes-fumbling underdog into his party's likely nominee.Replicating the combination of voters that delivered him broad victories a week ago on Super Tuesday, Mr. Biden won Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi with overwhelming support from African-Americans and with large margins among suburban and rural white voters.Mr. Sanders was more evenly matched with Mr. Biden in the West, where Idaho and Washington were too close to call. But there was little doubt by the end of the night that Mr. Sanders had lost his recent status as the progressive front-runner in a race defined for months by feuding and factionalism on the moderate wing of the Democratic Party.By besting Mr. Sanders for a second consecutive week, Mr. Biden, the former vice president, demonstrated that his successes on Super Tuesday reflected more than fleeting good fortune, and that many Democratic voters had rallied behind his candidacy in a lasting enough way to erase his embarrassing setbacks last month in Iowa and New Hampshire.Addressing supporters Tuesday night in Philadelphia, in a tone that was more sober than celebratory, Mr. Biden said voters had put him ""a step closer to restoring decency, dignity and honor to the White House"" and moved to unify the party with an appeal to supporters of Mr. Sanders. ""We share a common goal,"" Mr. Biden said, ""and together we'll defeat Donald Trump.""In Tuesday's primaries, Mr. Biden assembled a strong electoral coalition that combined his party's most loyal constituencies -- including African-Americans, women and union members -- with a new wave of moderate white voters who have aligned themselves with the Democrats as refugees from President Trump's Republican Party.Even in his moment of triumph, however, Mr. Biden made little headway with the youngest and most liberal primary voters, who remained steadfastly behind Mr. Sanders even as his national prospects have dimmed. Mr. Biden appeared mindful of his deficit with these voters, using his election-night remarks to acknowledge the ""tireless energy"" of Mr. Sanders's followers.Mr. Sanders, a Vermont liberal, did not address supporters on Tuesday night, leaving an unusual void in the space his thunderous persona has typically occupied on election nights.Mr. Sanders suffered the most grievous blow in Michigan, the biggest delegate prize of the night. After absorbing a series of unexpected losses last week, the senator had raced to revive his candidacy in Michigan, a state that four years ago helped power his insurgent challenge to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.But even after holding several events across Michigan and mounting some of his most pointed attacks against Mr. Biden, most of all for his record on trade, Mr. Sanders was routed.The contest in Michigan held great symbolic significance for both candidates, each of whom has presented himself as uniquely capable of reclaiming the Midwest for Democrats in 2020. Mr. Biden has long boasted of his bond with working-class voters there, while Mr. Sanders has enjoyed a lasting political glow from his surprise win in the Michigan primary four years ago. His inability to repeat that feat against a more popular opponent, Mr. Biden, further undercuts his argument that only a candidate who trumpets far-reaching change can energize voters there.The losses in Michigan and Missouri were especially ominous for Mr. Sanders, because they suggested his strength among rural Midwestern voters in 2016 largely owed to their opposition to Mrs. Clinton. Against Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders was trounced across the countryside of both states and saw working-class white voters, a pillar of his campaign four years ago, shift markedly away from him.More important on Tuesday was the scope of Mr. Biden's victories: With 365 delegates up for grabs, the former vice president was poised to build what could become an insurmountable advantage. If he wins with similarly large margins next week in delegate-rich Florida, where Mr. Sanders trails badly in polls, he may make it all but impossible for the senator to catch up.Mr. Biden's victories came against a backdrop of unexpected instability in the economy and widespread fear about the coronavirus as a growing threat to public health -- forces that may have further bolstered the former vice president's message of steady leadership against Mr. Sanders's promises of social transformation. The market-rattling outbreak, along with the White House's uncertain response, has both underscored Mr. Trump's political vulnerability and added to the mood of urgency among Democrats bent on defeating him.The spread of the coronavirus across the United States also raised the specter that political activities could soon be curtailed or restructured for reasons of public health. Just hours before the polls closed, both candidates canceled planned rallies in Ohio, citing concerns related to the virus. And in his subdued remarks at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Mr. Biden said there was a climate of fear and danger that demanded presidential leadership.Mr. Sanders now faces the unenviable task of mapping a path forward in a race that has exposed the apparent limits of his campaign tactics and political message. He retains a strong base of support among young and very liberal voters, and he has expanded his popularity with many Latinos. But Mr. Sanders has struggled to make headway with the most important constituencies that resisted his campaign four years ago, and the senator has lost ground with some groups that backed him as the only alternative to Mrs. Clinton.In Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi, Mr. Biden won black voters by colossal margins, including by more than 70 points in Mississippi, where African-Americans made up nearly two-thirds of the primary electorate, according to exit polls. But Mr. Biden also won white voters by double digits in all three states, and carried white voters without college degrees -- a friendly constituency for Mr. Sanders in 2016 -- by a narrower margin.In a sign that Mr. Sanders may struggle to compete with Mr. Biden across the Midwest, the exit polls from Missouri showed that Mr. Biden carried union households by a 25-point margin over Mr. Sanders. That advantage suggests that Mr. Sanders's populist message and hard-edge criticism of Mr. Biden's record on trade had failed to dent the former vice president's popularity with a key constituency that made up about a quarter of the Missouri electorate.Mark Brewer, a former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said Mr. Sanders had confronted circumstances this time that made the state a tougher battlefield for him. Mr. Brewer, who was a supporter of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, said that voters appeared to have made a straightforward assessment of the two candidates' electability and that ""at least for tonight, in Michigan, Biden won that argument.""""It's difficult to compare tonight to four years ago: There is an incumbent president, who Democrats are just focused on replacing, and that was not the case four years ago,"" Mr. Brewer said. ""Sanders was the underdog four years ago, and frankly Hillary Clinton took the state for granted and did not campaign here vigorously, and so forth. It's really apples and oranges.""Perhaps nothing better illustrated the direction of this nominating contest, though, than the surge in voter turnout. A centerpiece of Mr. Sanders's campaign has been his promise to win by inspiring a wave of new voters in the primary race and the general election.But for the second consecutive week it was Mr. Biden who was the beneficiary of an increase in turnout compared with that of the 2016 race, often in the sort of suburban jurisdictions that powered the Democrats' big gains in the midterm elections. In Oakland County, Mich., the Detroit suburb where Representative Haley Stevens picked up a Republican-held seat in 2018, Mr. Biden was winning by nearly 30 points and turnout was on track to be about twice what it was four years ago.The next few rounds of primaries are focused on big, diverse states where Mr. Biden is seen as having a solid advantage, including Florida and Georgia. And a number of states where Mr. Sanders won caucuses four years ago have since switched to hold primary elections, which tend to be less controlled by ideological activists, leaving Mr. Sanders without an obvious place to make a comeback.The contests on Tuesday included four states that Mr. Sanders carried against Mrs. Clinton in 2016: Michigan, Idaho, North Dakota and Washington. But there has been no indication that many Democrats have been having second thoughts about embracing Mr. Biden, to whom the party's voters turned abruptly last week as a safe option after a chaotic and confusing primary season. With the race effectively down to just Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, many Democratic leaders have clambered aboard the former vice president's campaign.
After Mr. Biden carried South Carolina on Feb. 29, rivals like former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota quickly dropped out of the race and endorsed him. Once the Super Tuesday results were known, Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, did the same. By contrast, Mr. Sanders has not managed to unify support even on the left; Ms. Warren, a fellow progressive, has declined to issue an endorsement since leaving the race last week.Mr. Biden, 77, and Mr. Sanders, 78, have both faced questions about their ages in recent days, as the race has narrowed to two men who would turn 80 within the space of a first presidential term -- and as fears of a viral epidemic have rippled through the campaign trail. And supporters of Mr. Sanders have been sharply critical of Mr. Biden for his halting public manner and comparatively brief remarks at campaign events, with some suggesting that the former vice president lacked the physical vigor required to win and hold the presidency.Mr. Sanders himself has not gone that far, though in a Fox News forum on Monday he criticized Mr. Biden for speaking for only a few minutes at one of his campaign rallies over the weekend.A day later, Mr. Sanders used a Fox News forum to deliver a critique of Mr. Biden's record, but emphasized he had no interest in ""making personal attacks on Joe.""The two men are slated to meet on a debate stage in Phoenix this weekend, before the Arizona primary on Tuesday, in what would be their first one-on-one encounter in the race. Mr. Sanders could face pressure on Sunday to inflict real damage on Mr. Biden, but doing so could prompt a backlash if by then he is seen as a kind of nuisance challenger with no obvious path to victory.Many Democrats are eager to turn to the task of challenging Mr. Trump: Polls show that both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders will be competitive against the president, and will probably start the general election with something of an advantage. By a wide margin, however, Democratic voters say they view Mr. Biden as having the best chance of winning in November.PhotographJoseph R.

| Jump to first hitAmerican voters must choose between three sharply divergent visions of the future.The incumbent president, Donald Trump, is clear about where he is guiding the Republican Party -- white nativism at home and America First unilateralism abroad, brazen corruption, escalating culture wars, a judiciary stacked with ideologues and the veneration of a mythological past where the hierarchy in American society was defined and unchallenged.On the Democratic side, an essential debate is underway between two visions that may define the future of the party and perhaps the nation. Some in the party view President Trump as an aberration and believe that a return to a more sensible America is possible. Then there are those who believe that President Trump was the product of political and economic systems so rotten that they must be replaced.Nearly any of them would be the most progressive president in decades on issues like health care, the economy and government's allocations of resources. Where they differ most significantly is not the what but the how, in whether they believe the country's institutions and norms are up to the challenge of the moment.Many Democratic voters are concerned first and foremost about who can beat Mr. Trump. But with a crowded field and with traditional polling in tatters, that calculation calls for a hefty dose of humility about anyone's ability to foretell what voters want.Choosing who should face off against Mr. Trump also means acknowledging that Americans are being confronted with three models for how to govern this country, not two. Democrats must decide which of their two models would be most compelling for the American people and best suited for repairing the Republic.The party's large and raucous field has made having that clean debate more difficult. With all the focus on personal characteristics -- age and race and experience -- and a handful of the most contentious issues, voters haven't benefited from a clarifying choice about the party's message in the election and the approach to governing beyond it.It was a privilege for us on the editorial board to spend more than a dozen hours talking to candidates, asking them any question that came to mind. Yet that exercise is impossible for most Americans, and we were left wanting for a more focused conversation for the public. Now is the time to narrow the race.The history of the editorial board would suggest that we would side squarely with the candidate with a more traditional approach to pushing the nation forward, within the realities of a constitutional framework and a multiparty country. But the events of the past few years have shaken the confidence of even the most committed institutionalists. We are not veering away from the values we espouse, but we are rattled by the weakness of the institutions that we trusted to undergird those values.There are legitimate questions about whether our democratic system is fundamentally broken. Our elections are getting less free and fair, Congress and the courts are increasingly partisan, foreign nations are flooding society with misinformation, a deluge of money flows through our politics. And the economic mobility that made the American dream possible is vanishing.Both the radical and the realist models warrant serious consideration. If there were ever a time to be open to new ideas, it is now. If there were ever a time to seek stability, now is it.That's why we're endorsing the most effective advocates for each approach. They are Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar.AT THE DAWN OF 2020, some of the most compelling ideas are not emerging from the center, but from the left wing of the Democratic Party. That's a testament to the effectiveness of the case that Bernie Sanders and Senator Warren have made about what ails the country. We worry about ideological rigidity and overreach, and we'd certainly push back on specific policy proposals, like nationalizing health insurance or decriminalizing the border. But we are also struck by how much more effectively their messages have matched the moment.Senator Sanders has spent nearly four decades advocating revolutionary change for a nation whose politics often move with glacial slowness. A career spent adjacent to the Democratic Party but not a part of it has allowed him to level trenchant criticism of a political party that often caters more to rich donors than to the middle class. Many of his ideas that were once labeled radical -- like paid family leave, a higher minimum wage, universal health care and limits on military intervention -- are now mainstream, and may attract voters who helped elect Mr. Trump in 2016.Mr. Sanders would be 79 when he assumed office, and after an October heart attack, his health is a serious concern. Then, there's how Mr. Sanders approaches politics. He boasts that compromise is anathema to him. Only his prescriptions can be the right ones, even though most are overly rigid, untested and divisive. He promises that once in office, a groundswell of support will emerge to push through his agenda. Three years into the Trump administration, we see little advantage to exchanging one over-promising, divisive figure in Washington for another.Good news, then, that Elizabeth Warren has emerged as a standard-bearer for the Democratic left.Senator Warren is a gifted storyteller. She speaks elegantly of how the economic system is rigged against all but the wealthiest Americans, and of ""our chance to rewrite the rules of power in our country,"" as she put it in a speech last month. In her hands, that story has the passion of a convert, a longtime Republican from Oklahoma and a middle-class family, whose work studying economic realities left her increasingly worried about the future of the country. The word ""rigged"" feels less bombastic than rooted in an informed assessment of what the nation needs to do to reassert its historic ideals like fairness, generosity and equality.She is also committed to reforming the fundamental structures of government and the economy -- her first commitment is to anti-corruption legislation, which is not only urgently needed but also has the potential to find bipartisan support. She speaks fluently about foreign policy, including how to improve NATO relations, something that will be badly needed after Mr. Trump leaves office.Her campaign's plans, in general, demonstrate a serious approach to policymaking that some of the other candidates lack. Ms. Warren accurately describes a lack of housing construction as the primary driver of the nation's housing crisis, and she has proposed both increases in government funding for housing construction, and changes in regulatory policy to encourage local governments to allow more construction.She has plans to sharply increase federal investment in clean energy research and to wean the American economy from fossil fuels. She has described how she would reduce the economic and political power of large corporations and give workers more ability to bargain collectively. And she has proposed a sweeping expansion of government support for Americans at every stage of life, from universal child care to free public college to expanded Social Security.At the same time, a conservative federal judiciary will be almost as significant a roadblock for progressive change. For Ms. Warren, that leaves open questions -- ones she was unwilling to wrestle with in our interview. Ms. Warren has proposed to pay for an expanded social safety net by imposing a new tax on wealth. But even if she could push such a bill through the Senate, the idea is constitutionally suspect and would inevitably be bogged down for years in the courts. A conservative judiciary also could constrain a President Warren's regulatory powers, and roll back access to health care.Carrying out a progressive agenda through new laws will also be very hard for any Democratic president. In that light, voters could consider what a Democratic president might accomplish without new legislation and, in particular, they could focus on the presidency's wide-ranging powers to shape American society through the creation and enforcement of regulations.As an adviser to President Barack Obama, Ms. Warren was the person most responsible for the creation of a new regulatory agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. In her interview with the editorial board, she demonstrated her sophisticated understanding of the different levers of power in an administration, particularly in the use of regulation in areas such as trade, antitrust and environmental policy.When she first arrived in Washington, amid the Great Recession, Senator Warren distinguished herself as a citizen-politician. She showed an admirable desire to shake off the entrapments of many Washington interests in favor of pragmatic problem-solving on behalf of regular people. In her primary campaign, however, she has shown some questionable political instincts. She sometimes sounds like a candidate who sees a universe of us-versus-thems, who, in the general election, would be going up against a president who has already divided America into his own version of them and us.This has been most obvious in her case for ""Medicare for all,"" where she has already had to soften her message, as voters have expressed their lack of support for her plan. There are good, sound reasons for a public health care option -- countries all over the world have demonstrated that. But Ms. Warren's version would require winning over a skeptical public, legislative trench warfare to pass bills in Congress, the dismantling of a private health care system. That system, through existing public-private programs like Medicare Advantage, has shown it is not nearly as flawed as she insists, and it is even lauded by health economists who now advocate a single-payer system.American capitalism is responsible for its share of sins. But Ms. Warren often casts the net far too wide, placing the blame for a host of maladies from climate change to gun violence at the feet of the business community when the onus is on society as a whole. The country needs a more unifying path. The senator talks more about bringing together Democrats, Republicans and independents behind her proposals, often leaning on anecdotes about her conservative brothers to do so. Ms. Warren has the power and conviction and credibility to make the case -- especially given her past as a Republican -- but she needs to draw on practicality and patience as much as her down-and-dirty critique of the system.Ms. Warren's path to the nomination is challenging, but not hard to envision. The four front-runners are bunched together both in national polls and surveys in states holding the first votes, so small shifts in voter sentiment can have an outsize influence this early in the campaign. There are plenty of progressives who are hungry for major change but may harbor lingering concerns about a messenger as divisive as Mr. Sanders. At the same time, some moderate Democratic primary voters see Ms. Warren as someone who speaks to their concerns about inequality and corruption. Her earlier leaps in the polls suggest she can attract more of both.THE LACK OF A SINGLE, powerful moderate voice in this Democratic race is the strongest evidence of a divided party. Never mind the talented, honorable politicians who chose to sit this fight out; just stop and consider the talents who did throw their hat into the ring and never got more than a passing glance from voters -- Cory Booker, Kamala Harris, Steve Bullock, Michael Bennet, Deval Patrick, Jay Inslee, among others.Those candidates who remain all have a mix of strengths and weaknesses.Pete Buttigieg, who is 38 and who was elected mayor of South Bend, Ind., in 2011, has an all-star résumé -- Harvard graduate, Rhodes scholar, Navy veteran who served in Afghanistan, the first serious openly gay presidential candidate. His showing in the lead-up to the primaries predicts a bright political future; we look forward to him working his way up.Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur and philanthropist, is an engaging and enthusiastic candidate whose diagnoses are often thought-provoking. He points to new solutions to 21st-century challenges rather than retrofitting old ideas. Yet he has virtually no experience in government. We hope he decides to get involved in New York politics.Michael Bloomberg served three terms as New York's mayor (and was endorsed twice by this page). A multibillionaire who built his namesake company from scratch, he is many of the things Mr. Trump pretends to be and would be an effective contrast to the president in a campaign. Mr. Bloomberg is the candidate in the race with the clearest track record of governing, even if that record has its blemishes, beginning with his belated and convenient apology for stop-and-frisk policing.Still, Mr. Bloomberg's current campaign approach reveals more about America's broken system than his likelihood of fixing it. Rather than build support through his ideas and experience, Mr. Bloomberg has spent at least $217 million to date to circumvent the hard, uncomfortable work of actual campaigning. He's also avoided difficult questions -- going so far as to bar his own news organization from investigating him, and declining to meet with The Times's editorial board under the pretext that he didn't yet have positions on enough issues. What's worse, Mr. Bloomberg refuses to allow several women with whom he has nondisclosure settlements to speak freely.Few men have given more of their time and experience to the conduct of the public's business than Joe Biden. The former vice president commands the greatest fluency on foreign policy and is a figure of great warmth and empathy. He's prone to verbal stumbles, yes, but social media has also made every gaffe a crisis when it clearly is not.Mr. Biden maintains a lead in national polls, but that may be a measure of familiarity as much as voter intention. His central pitch to voters is that he can beat Donald Trump. His agenda tinkers at the edges of issues like health care and climate, and he emphasizes returning the country to where things were before the Trump era. But merely restoring the status quo will not get America where it needs to go as a society. What's more, Mr. Biden is 77. It is time for him to pass the torch to a new generation of political leaders.Good news, then, that Amy Klobuchar has emerged as a standard-bearer for the Democratic center. Her vision goes beyond the incremental. Given the polarization in Washington and beyond, the best chance to enact many progressive plans could be under a Klobuchar administration.The senator from Minnesota is the very definition of Midwestern charisma, grit and sticktoitiveness. Her lengthy tenure in the Senate and bipartisan credentials would make her a deal maker (a real one) and uniter for the wings of the party -- and perhaps the nation.She promises to put the country on the path -- through huge investments in green infrastructure and legislation to lower emissions -- to achieve 100 percent net-zero emissions no later than 2050. She pledges to cut childhood poverty in half in a decade by expanding the earned-income and child care tax credits. She also wants to expand food stamps and overhaul housing policy and has developed the field's most detailed plan for treating addiction and mental illness. And this is all in addition to pushing for a robust public option in health care, free community college and a federal minimum wage of $15 an hour.Ms. Klobuchar speaks about issues like climate change, the narrowing middle class, gun safety and trade with an empathy that connects to voters' lived experiences, especially in the middle of the country. The senator talks, often with self-deprecating humor, about growing up the daughter of two union workers, her Uncle Dick's deer stand, her father's struggles with alcoholism and her Christian faith.Ms. Klobuchar promises a foreign policy based on leading by example, instead of by threat-via-tweet. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, she serves on the subcommittees responsible for oversight of the Department of Homeland Security, as well as the nation's borders and its immigration, citizenship and refugee laws. In 13 years as a senator, she has sponsored and voted on dozens of national defense measures, including military action in Libya and Syria. Her record shows that she is confident and thoughtful, and she reacts to data -- what you'd want in a crisis.All have helped Ms. Klobuchar to be the most productive senator among the Democratic field in terms of bills passed with bipartisan support, according to a recent study for the Center for Effective Lawmaking. When she arrived in the Senate in 2007, Ms. Klobuchar was part of a bipartisan group of lawmakers that proposed comprehensive immigration reform, including a path to citizenship for 12 million undocumented immigrants, before conservative pundits made it political poison. Her more recent legislative accomplishments are narrower but meaningful to those affected, especially the legislation aimed at helping crime victims. This is not surprising given her background as the chief prosecutor in Minnesota's most populous county. For example, one measure she wrote helped provide funds to reduce a nationwide backlog of rape kits for investigating sexual assaults.Reports of how Senator Klobuchar treats her staff give us pause. They raise serious questions about her ability to attract and hire talented people. Surrounding the president with a team of seasoned, reasoned leaders is critical to the success of an administration, not doing so is often the downfall of presidencies. Ms. Klobuchar has acknowledged she's a tough boss and pledged to do better. (To be fair, Bill Clinton and Mr. Trump -- not to mention former Vice President Biden -- also have reputations for sometimes berating their staffs, and it is rarely mentioned as a political liability.)Ms. Klobuchar doesn't have the polished veneer and smooth delivery that comes from a lifetime spent in the national spotlight, and she has struggled to gain traction on the campaign trail. In Minnesota, however, she is enormously popular. She has won all three of her Senate elections by double digits. In 2016, Hillary Clinton carried nine of Minnesota's 87 counties. Ms. Klobuchar carried 51 in 2018. And it's far too early to count Ms. Klobuchar out -- Senator John Kerry, the eventual Democrat nominee in 2004, was also polling in the single digits at this point in the race.THERE HAS BEEN A WILDFIRE BURNING in Australia larger than Switzerland. The Middle East is more unstable at this moment than at any other time in the past decade, with a nuclear arms race looking more when than if. Basket-case governments in several nations south of the Rio Grande have sent a historic flood of migrants to our southern border. Global technology companies exert more political influence than some national governments. White nationalists from Norway to New Zealand to El Paso use the internet to share ideas about racial superiority and which caliber of rifle works best for the next mass killing.The next president will shape the direction of America's prosperity and the future of the planet, perhaps irrevocably. The current president, meanwhile, is a threat to democracy. He was impeached for strong-arming Ukraine into tampering with the 2020 election. There is no reason patriotic Americans should not be open to every chance to replace him at the ballot box.Yet, Mr. Trump maintains near-universal approval from his party and will nearly certainly coast to the nomination. Democrats would be smart to recognize that Mr. Trump's vision for America's future is shared by many millions of Americans.Any hope of restoring unity in the country will require modesty, a willingness to compromise and the support of the many demographics that make up the Democratic coalition -- young and old, in red states and blue, black and brown and white. For Senator Klobuchar, that's acknowledging the depth of the nation's dysfunction. For Senator Warren, it's understanding that the country is more diverse than her base.There will be those dissatisfied that this page is not throwing its weight behind a single candidate, favoring centrists or progressives. But it's a fight the party itself has been itching to have since Mrs. Clinton's defeat in 2016, and one that should be played out in the public arena and in the privacy of the voting booth. That's the very purpose of primaries, to test-market strategies and ideas that can galvanize and inspire the country.Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Warren right now are the Democrats best equipped to lead that debate.May the best woman win.Credit: By The Editorial BoardPhotograph(PHOTOGRAPHS BY BRITTAINY NEWMAN/THE NEW YORK TIMES) (A24-A25)Word count: 3365Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hit""Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in?"" he said a day after Joe Biden beat him in several key states. ""The answer is no.""BURLINGTON, Vt. -- After losing most Super Tuesday states to Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senator Bernie Sanders delivered a striking assessment of his campaign, acknowledging that he was ""disappointed"" with the results and that his crucial campaign message of inspiring young people to vote was falling short.""Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in?"" he told reporters during a hastily assembled news conference at his campaign office in Burlington, Vt. ""The answer is no.""The concession underscored a fundamental challenge for Mr. Sanders's political revolution, one that has become increasingly clear: In state after state, there has been little evidence -- at least outside California -- that he has generated higher turnout among young voters. And though he has promised to deliver record turnout, it may in fact be Mr. Biden who is accomplishing that, lifted by his strong support among black voters.In Texas, where Mr. Biden prevailed over Mr. Sanders, only 15 percent of voters were younger than 30, and nearly two-thirds were 45 or older, according to exit polls. The age breakdown was similar in California.In no state did people younger than 30 account for more than 20 percent of the electorate, based on exit polls, and in most states they accounted for 15 percent or less.Because so few young people voted, it did not matter that Mr. Sanders won them by huge margins, because Mr. Biden won the much more plentiful older voters.In addition, while Mr. Sanders has succeeded in galvanizing Latino voters -- he won them by about 27 percentage points over Mr. Biden in California -- he has struggled to build support among black voters.In Alabama, where black voters were half of the electorate, Mr. Sanders lost them by more than 60 points. He lost them by more than 50 points in Virginia, and by more than 40 points in Texas and North Carolina. In several states, he came in third among black voters, behind not only Mr. Biden but also Michael R. Bloomberg.In Minnesota, Mr. Sanders had a large gender gap. He had the support of 37 percent of men, according to exit polls, very close to Mr. Biden's 39 percent. But he only won 25 percent of women, compared with 41 percent for Mr. Biden. Mr. Sanders did do unusually well among black voters, who were a point of struggle for him in other states: He won 43 percent of them. But he only won 27 percent of white voters, who account for most of the Minnesota electorate.Unlike in the first nominating contests, when these failures did not stop Mr. Sanders from winning, his inability to expand the electorate was crucial to his losses on Super Tuesday, when Mr. Biden beat him in 10 of 14 states, including Texas, Virginia and North Carolina.After Mr. Sanders's dominant performance in Nevada less than two weeks ago, his aides and advisers had operated with new swagger, cautiously optimistic about his chances even in Southern states like South Carolina that they had expected to lose. He competed especially heavily in Virginia, North Carolina, Massachusetts and Minnesota, holding big rallies that doubled as shows of force.But as the clock ticked toward midnight on Tuesday and his losses began to pile up, the campaign's buoyant tone shifted sharply. When Mr. Sanders took the stage at an election-night rally in Essex Junction, Vt., he was defiant, declaring that he would ""win the Democratic nomination"" despite a series of weaker-than-expected results. Aides and advisers insisted it was still early, and urged reporters not to jump to conclusions.""If you turn off your television at 10 p.m. tonight, you will wake up tomorrow to a different race,"" Mike Casca, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said at one point.But by Wednesday morning, that optimism was gone.""Of course I'm disappointed,"" Mr. Sanders said at the news conference in Burlington. ""I would like to win every state by a landslide. It's not going to happen.""He blamed his underperformance in part on the ""venom"" of the ""corporate media.""As he has begun to do in recent days, he also framed the race as one between him and Mr. Biden, and drew explicit contrasts between his record and the former vice president's.""Joe and I have a very different voting record,"" he said. ""Joe and I have a very different vision for the future of this country. And Joe and I are running very different campaigns.""""My hope is that in the coming months, we will be able to debate and discuss the very significant differences that we have,"" he added.Appearing on ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" on MSNBC on Wednesday night, Mr. Sanders sharply criticized Mr. Biden's record on the Iraq war, bankruptcy and Social Security.Mr. Sanders also said that Michigan, which holds its primary on Tuesday, had been ""decimated"" by trade deals that Mr. Biden supported.""I walked the picket lines against NAFTA,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""I went to Mexico to see what NAFTA would do. Joe voted for those terrible agreements.""Some supporters of Mr. Sanders -- including prominent surrogates like Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota -- have argued that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, by staying in the race while several moderates dropped out, was partly responsible for Mr. Sanders's disappointing performance.But while backers of Mr. Sanders believe many of Ms. Warren's supporters would have migrated to him, exit polls suggested that the shift would have been too small to change the outcome in key states.Take college-educated white women: Ms. Warren's strongest group and one of Mr. Sanders's weakest. If Ms. Warren had dropped out, Mr. Sanders could have benefited twice as much as Mr. Biden among those voters, said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. But Maine would probably have been the only state to flip from Mr. Biden to Mr. Sanders as a result.Mr. Biden would most likely still have won Texas, Minnesota and Massachusetts -- just with somewhat smaller margins, according to Mr. Murray. Warren voters generally like Mr. Sanders, he said; ""it's just her support isn't large enough that it would have split enough in his direction.""In fact, based on exit polls, Mr. Bloomberg almost certainly siphoned more votes from Mr. Biden than Ms. Warren did from Mr. Sanders.Despite Mr. Sanders's wins or near-wins in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, the results in those contests had already challenged his pledge to fundamentally transform the electorate and expand the Democratic base.Turnout in Iowa was lower than expected, up 3 percent from 2016, and the increase was concentrated in well-educated areas where Mr. Sanders struggled, according to a New York Times analysis; in the precincts where he won, turnout increased by only 1 percentage point.There was no sign of a Sanders voter surge in New Hampshire either, or in Nevada, where turnout fell well short of 2008 levels despite a decade of population growth and a new early-voting option that attracted some 75,000 voters.There was also no clear evidence across the early states of much greater participation by young people, a typically low-turnout group that Mr. Sanders has long said he can motivate to get out to the polls. First-time Democratic voters' share of the electorate actually decreased in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada compared with 2016.Sydney Ember reported from Burlington, Vt., and Maggie Astor from New York. Michael Levenson contributed reporting from New York.Photograph""Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in? The answer is no,"" Senator Bernie Sanders said.

| Jump to first hitMr. Sanders said he was not dropping out, but aides said he recognized time was running short. He listed a series of policy items in what could be seen as a wish list of concessions he would want.BURLINGTON, Vt. -- Senator Bernie Sanders on Wednesday made a defiant case for his liberal policy agenda despite suffering big losses in the Democratic primaries this week, saying he planned to continue his bid for the presidency. But he acknowledged that he was ""losing the debate over electability"" to his rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.Mr. Sanders vowed to participate in the scheduled debate on Sunday, and asserted that ""a strong majority"" of Democrats supported his progressive causes, even as his path to the nomination looks increasingly narrow. Still, as he addressed reporters at an afternoon news conference in Burlington, he did not directly attack Mr. Biden or vow to carry his fight to the end, instead signaling he was ready for a de-escalation in their rivalry.In one striking sequence that highlighted his ideological resolve, Mr. Sanders ticked off a list of policy issues and challenged Mr. Biden to explain to the American people how he would address them -- a series of questions that could be seen as an opening gambit for a list of concessions he would seek from Mr. Biden if he were to drop out of the race.""He's pivoting to ensure that the issues that he has built his political career around continue to be front and center in the political dialogue,"" said Nick Carter, who served as political outreach director for the 2016 Sanders campaign. ""I also think he has top of mind ensuring his supporters and those unenthusiastic about a Biden candidacy -- 'don't call it a day.""'Mr. Sanders's decision to continue thrusts the race into a delicate new phase, with Mr. Biden, a moderate, holding a clear path to the nomination but Mr. Sanders wielding the support of the party's liberal wing. How they navigate their differences to try to unite the competing factions will go a long way toward determining whether Democrats assemble a coalition powerful enough to dethrone President Trump in the fall.The race has already been upended by the crisis surrounding the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced both candidates to curtail appearances before big crowds and to plan for a debate on Sunday without a live audience. The Biden campaign announced Wednesday it was canceling two upcoming events in Illinois and Florida. Mr. Sanders has yet to officially announce any public events, but his campaign is planning virtual events such as tele-town halls and live-streamed addresses.Mr. Sanders did not consider dropping out after Tuesday's losses, according to people familiar with his thinking, but he was stunned by how severe they were and now recognizes he needs to reassess his path forward. Mr. Biden scored victories in four states, including Michigan, where Mr. Sanders had counted on a victory to revive his candidacy.In recent days, Mr. Sanders has told people that the campaign is running out of time to recapture its momentum or maintain sufficient leverage to demand the kinds of sweeping progressive policy concessions from Mr. Biden he outlined on Wednesday.Nine times during his remarks, Mr. Sanders cited an issue central to his progressive agenda and asked Mr. Biden, ""What are you going to do?"" -- listing systemic problems related to topics like health care and income inequality.Mr. Sanders is also still fighting to win, some of his aides said, insisting there were more opportunities to accumulate delegates in states like Oregon and Wisconsin, which would require Mr. Sanders to stay in the race into late April and May.But one longtime Sanders confidant, Larry Cohen, also acknowledged the challenges ahead in states like Florida and Ohio, which vote next week, and the daunting coalition of white and African-American voters Mr. Biden has put together. Mr. Cohen, the chairman of Our Revolution, the Sanders-aligned political organization, said the goal was now as much about accruing delegates to use as leverage in negotiations with Mr. Biden as it was an effort to win the nomination.""Every delegate is critical to our agenda and discussions with Joe Biden,"" Mr. Cohen said from Florida, where he met Wednesday with Our Revolution members who are seeking delegate slots at the Democratic National Convention to help Mr. Sanders. Of Mr. Sanders's supporters, Mr. Cohen said, ""Their only voice is to be elected delegate.""Mr. Sanders now finds himself in an awkward position, pressing on despite long odds even as he insists he wants above all for a Democrat to beat Mr. Trump in November. For months, he has been reluctant to attack Mr. Biden directly, which resulted in inconsistent messaging: At times, he and his campaign would attack Mr. Biden, only to pull back and return to his central policy message of transformational change.After Super Tuesday and into this week, some allies expressed frustration, anxious that even if Mr. Sanders were to mount a comeback, it would be too late. On Tuesday night, his most prominent surrogate, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, told viewers on her Instagram live stream that the election results were a setback for the progressive movement.Mr. Sanders has also made it clear that he is aware he cannot continue to campaign indefinitely and defiantly, as he did against Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to former aides and people currently in his orbit.And for all of the criticism he has leveled at Mr. Biden recently, Mr. Sanders feels far more positively in a personal way toward Mr. Biden than he did toward Mrs. Clinton, which could make a reconciliation less contentious, according to a veteran of the last campaign. This person and others briefed on Mr. Sanders's campaign plans insisted on anonymity in order to discuss internal deliberations.Over the past several months, Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, has opened up a line of communication with one of Mr. Biden's top political aides, Anita Dunn. Although the back-channel setup has mostly been used to arrange logistics -- they hashed out an agreement this week to bar a live audience from Sunday's debate -- it is likely to be the main conduit for talks about political matters, according to people on both campaigns.With over half the delegates still to be allocated, aides to Mr. Sanders said they saw more fertile terrain in the coming weeks. They point out that Mr. Sanders narrowly lost Illinois four years ago and see strength in Wisconsin and Puerto Rico. Georgia, with its heavily black electorate, will most likely go to Mr. Biden, who currently leads Mr. Sanders in delegates, 864 to 710, with delegates still to be counted.Mr. Sanders also has about $9 million worth of ads booked through March 17, including a $2 million buy this week.Aides say Mr. Sanders is particularly motivated to participate in the debate on Sunday in Phoenix because he views it as his first and possibly last opportunity to face Mr. Biden one on one and hold him accountable for his record, while trumpeting his own record in contrast.""Donald Trump must be defeated, and I will do everything in my power to make that happen,"" Mr. Sanders said on Wednesday. ""On Sunday night, in the first one-on-one debate of this campaign, the American people will have the opportunity to see which candidate is best positioned to accomplish that goal.""But the rest of his path forward is murky, especially as concerns about the coronavirus threaten to upend a signature facet of his campaign: Mr. Sanders's enormous rallies, where the enthusiasm and passion of his loyal base are on vivid display. It is unclear how he will marshal the energy he boasts about from behind a computer screen or over a telephone line.In his address Wednesday, Mr. Sanders spoke soberly about the signals voters had sent about Mr. Biden being more electable.""I cannot tell you how many people our campaign has spoken to who have said -- and I quote -- 'I like what your campaign stands for. I agree with what your campaign stands for. But I'm going to vote for Joe Biden because I think Joe is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump,""' he said.""Needless to say, I strongly disagree with that assertion, but that is what millions of Democrats and independents today believe.""Mr. Sanders watched the results come in on Tuesday night at his home with his wife, Jane, while aides gathered elsewhere. He did not make any public comments then.On Wednesday at his news conference, Mr. Sanders was cleareyed about the challenges ahead but also resolute about his strengths.""Last night obviously was not a good night for our campaign from a delegate point of view,"" Mr. Sanders said, as his wife looked on. But he asserted that he was ""winning the generational debate,"" saying that while Mr. Biden was appealing to older voters, he was drawing younger Americans, and that the party needed to build around the leaders of the future.""Today, I say to the Democratic establishment, in order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country, and you must speak to the issues of concern to them.""Sydney Ember and Reid Epstein reported from Burlington, Vt., and Glenn Thrush from Washington. Lisa Lerer contributed reporting from Washington and Nick Corasaniti and Alexander Burns from New York.PhotographPHOTO (A1); Senator Bernie Sanders in Burlington, Vt., on Wednesday.

| Jump to first hitOur cybersecurity reporter answers questions about hackers, Burisma and vulnerabilities in November.Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.Nicole Perlroth, a reporter for The Times who covers cybersecurity, recently broke the news that Burisma -- the Ukrainian gas company at the heart of President Trump's impeachment -- was hacked by the same Russian operators who in 2016 broke into the Democratic National Committee and the email inbox of John Podesta, Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman. In an ""ask me anything"" session on the website Reddit, Ms. Perlroth answered questions about that story and cybersecurity threats to November's election. The responses have been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.Could the Russians hack our election machines this year to change vote tallies?Yes. Every year at the annual hacking conferences in Las Vegas, security researchers show just how easily they can break into ballot marking machines to switch votes. The question is: Could Russian hackers (or anyone else do this at scale, without anyone noticing? I think it would actually be easier (and cheaper) to influence the election through other means. This could take the form of disinformation, or by hacking the voter registration databases (something Russian hackers did in 2016) or check-in software to keep voters from casting their ballot in a swing state. This is something I'm particularly worried about, especially in a close election.How big was the Burisma hack?This was a very targeted ""phishing"" campaign against employees who work at Burisma subsidiaries. By getting into those employees's email accounts, Russian hackers would have been able to get into Burisma proper. We still don't know what the Russian hackers got in terms of emails, personal data, etc. The expectation is that they may be likely trying to pull a ""John Podesta 2.0"" and dump emails that could be embarrassing to former Vice President Joe Biden or his son.Is the Trump administration doing anything to protect against hackers for the upcoming election?We've reported that the president has been reticent to do anything to address election security, especially when it concerns Russian interference. The president still questions the idea that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election, viewing such talk as a challenge to his legitimacy. He went as far as to suggest that U.S. officials collaborate with Russian officials on cybersecurity. He also embraced a Russian-backed conspiracy theory that shifted the blame to Ukraine. That said, there are areas where we are more secure than we were in 2016: The Department of Homeland Security is working with state and local officials to assess their cybersecurity defenses. Local election officials are much more aware about threats. Counties that lacked any kind of paper backup record of votes are switching to machines that produce a paper record. And tech companies are working to take down fake accounts, and making it more difficult for foreigners to buy political ads. But experts say we are still nowhere near where we need to be, and our adversaries are becoming more stealthy.What can the average citizen do about any of this?A lot. If you look at the Burisma hacks, it started with ""spearphishing,"" an attack in which hackers get their target to click on a link and enter their username/password. Spearphishing is a lot harder when you turn on ""two factor authentication."" This is an extra security mechanism that will ask you for a second pin code, often one that is texted to your phone, anytime [companies] detect someone trying to log into your account from a strange computer. I highly recommend it.With Russia, what's the worst-case scenario?1. A repeat of the 2016 Russian interference, like the one we are beginning to see play out on Burisma. Russian hackers could dump Burisma emails, real ones, or even plant fake ones. If they mixed in fake emails with the real documents, it would be nearly impossible for reporters to determine which are real and which are faked.2. They hack the election machines. They change votes from one candidate to another, on systems with no paper backup.3. They sabotage the voter registration data, or the software that is used to check voters in at the polls.4. They prop up fake accounts on Facebook, Twitter and other outlets to sow further discord among Americans. If they accomplished all this, what we would get is an election outcome we could not trust, in a partisan and media environment where our faith in institutions is low. And it would take years to suss out what happened.Follow the @ReaderCenter on Twitter for more coverage highlighting your perspectives and experiences and for insight into how we work.PhotographLocal election officials are more aware of threats, but U.S. adversaries are becoming stealthier.

| Jump to first hitMany black voters rallied around Joe Biden in Saturday's primary, eager to send a message that their views of electability are not shaped by predominantly white states like Iowa.NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. -- In 2008 and 2016, black voters in South Carolina's presidential primary set the last two Democratic nominees on their way, backing Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton by huge margins. Rival candidates never managed to catch up in the race for delegates to clinch the nomination.Black Democrats played a far different role in this year's primary vote, coming to the aid of a candidate who is struggling, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They were the decisive factor in Mr. Biden's victory in South Carolina on Saturday night, but it was far from clear if that support would catapult him to victory in other states in the ways that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton enjoyed.Early exit polls indicated that, more than in 2008 and 2016, black voters spread their support across several candidates and split along generational and ideological lines. Senator Bernie Sanders edged ahead of Mr. Biden among black voters who were 29 and younger, and Mr. Sanders, the race's current front-runner, appears formidable in the polls in many upcoming primaries.For many black voters, the South Carolina primary took on significant meaning in another way, too. In interviews across the state in recent days, many said they were eager to send a message to the national Democratic Party: that their views on electability -- which candidate is best suited to beat President Trump -- would not be shaped by outcomes in the predominantly white states Iowa and New Hampshire, which backed former Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders in contests earlier in February.""We're the base, and we're yet to express ourselves,"" said David Cakley, a church deacon from Goose Creek, S.C, referring to black voters. ""Biden needs a boost and we're going to give it to him.""Mayor Stephen K. Benjamin of Columbia, S.C., who has endorsed the former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, summed up the urgency for black voters in this primary by quoting a line from the Atlanta rapper André 3000: ""The South got something to say.""South Carolina signifies a turning point in the campaign: Candidates have been courting black voters in the state for more than a year, and now the Democratic hopefuls will see if their personal appeals and policy plans catch fire with the first predominantly black electorate to vote in the race.Mr. Biden, who lost badly in Iowa and New Hampshire but improved in last weekend's Nevada caucuses, appeared on track to win a majority of black Democrats in South Carolina, with voters citing his familiarity with their concerns and his potential to appeal to moderate Republicans in a general election. But the final margins may reveal fault lines around gender, age, regions and viewpoints.Other Democratic hopefuls from across the ideological spectrum -- liberals like Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren, as well as the billionaire Tom Steyer and moderates like Mr. Buttigieg -- were aiming to demonstrate that African-Americans are not a monolithic voting bloc.Many black Democrats made that point over the last year, as some favored white candidates like Mr. Biden over black contenders like Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, and others embraced a wide variety of political and ideological positions.Mr. Biden led in South Carolina polls all year, but Mr. Sanders and Mr. Steyer gained ground recently, and Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg were seeking to show that they have black support in the primary.""I don't know that anybody's going to walk away with it. And I think there might be some surprises,"" said the Rev. Joseph Darby, a pastor who leads Nichols Chapel A.M.E. Church in Charleston. ""But I don't pay attention to the polls because they never call me.""At a ministers' breakfast in North Charleston on Wednesday hosted by National Action Network, the civil rights organization led by the Rev. Al Sharpton, several voters echoed his point -- stating that the question of ""what Democratic candidate is most electable"" in the primary could not be settled until black voters throughout the South weighed in on the nominee.Chris Richardson, 39, said he was not surprised that many black voters in South Carolina were unfazed by Mr. Biden's poor results in Iowa and New Hampshire. He flipped the question around: Why would anyone assume they'd care?""Black voters know white voters better than white voters know themselves,"" Mr. Richardson said. ""So yeah, we'll back Biden, because we know who white America will vote for in the general election in a way they may not tell a pollster or the media.""Among the most important results in South Carolina is the margin of victory in different parts of the state, which will help determine the awarding of delegates. Mr. Sanders currently leads in delegates, followed by Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren.The final margin of victory for Mr. Biden will also determine if he can argue that he has a ""firewall"" of black support in the highly competitive race; a big victory would also help him make his case in other racially diverse primaries, including the big ones in North Carolina and Virginia on Super Tuesday next week.One major factor in the race that won't be settled in South Carolina is the electoral might of Mr. Bloomberg, who is not competing in the state but will be on the primary ballots on Super Tuesday. Mr. Bloomberg has spent hundreds of millions of dollars courting voters, with particular attention to black and Latino voters in delegate-rich states such as Texas and California, which vote Tuesday.Aides to Mr. Biden have begun openly complaining that Mr. Bloomberg might siphon some black voters from the former vice president and effectively deliver the nomination to Mr. Sanders.Akunna Cook, a former executive director of the Black Economic Alliance, said Mr. Bloomberg ""could become a spoiler"" for Mr. Biden even with a win in South Carolina, because some moderate voters might still decide to back Mr. Bloomberg on Super Tuesday.""My nephew is 21 and is voting in the presidential for the first time. And he's deciding between Bloomberg and Warren,"" Ms. Cook said. ""He sees those Bloomberg ads everywhere. And if you only know him through those ads, he seems like a good candidate. He's taking on Trump, and he's talking like the base.""In South Carolina, the campaign of another self-funding billionaire -- Mr. Steyer -- gave Mr. Biden's team a miniature preview of what it is up against. Mr. Steyer dominated the state's airwaves and invested millions in organizing to chip away at Mr. Biden's black support with some success.""I've had three Steyer people knock on my door this week,"" said Lacy Washington, a 33-year-old from North Charleston. ""This whole thing is a hot mess, and I can't wait for it to be over.""But this past week, Mr. Biden got a clear lift: The state's most powerful Democrat, Representative James F. Clyburn, endorsed him in an impassioned speech Wednesday that cited Mr. Biden's intimate understanding of the state.In a Friday appearance on CNN, Mr. Clyburn said he hoped Mr. Biden would win South Carolina by ""15 or 16"" points, setting the bar at a clear victory -- but far less than the 47.5-point margin of victory for Mrs. Clinton in 2016 (over Mr. Sanders) or the 29-point win by Mr. Obama in 2008 (over Mrs. Clinton).No matter who wins South Carolina, the yearlong primary campaign in the state has shown the power -- and diversity -- among black voters within the Democratic Party.The large field of two dozen candidates provided opportunities for black activist groups to pressure hopefuls on issues that seemed secondary to many past Democratic candidates, including robust criminal justice proposals, economic agendas that target the racial wealth gap and the possibility of reparations for the descendants of slaves.The campaign has also exposed cracks along age, college education level, geography and gender, leading black voters to split across candidates more than they have in previous cycles.There are churchgoing supporters of Mr. Biden and others drawn to the business acumen of Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Steyer. Younger black voters -- drawn to the promise of a ""political revolution"" -- seem likely to boost Mr. Sanders, and policy-focused voters looking for a candidate pitching unity can back Mr. Buttigieg or Ms. Warren.""I see the momentum of Bernie, I see the number of black people for Biden, but I'll be with Elizabeth Warren till she drops out,"" said Herbert Bodison, a 65-year-old resident of North Charleston.Shareef Boddie, a 23-year-old from Goose Creek, said he was torn among three candidates: Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg. He planned to make his decision on the way to the polls.""I may go for Bernie Sanders, because he plans on relieving college debt from students. And that's a big thing,"" Mr. Boddie said.The range of opinion is the electoral manifestation of the oft-repeated mantra ""black voters are not monolithic."" But it could also curb the determinative power of black voters in the Democratic nomination process, considering that they have historically rallied around a single candidate, helping that contender grab all-important delegates in key congressional districts and providing an inside track to the nomination.Rashad Robinson, president of the racial justice organization Color of Change, said black Democrats in this primary had done more than choose the winner: They forced the field of candidates to reshape how they discuss the black community.""We've had a campaign season where people are calling out structural racism and saying 'white supremacy' on the debate stage,"" Mr. Robinson said. ""The fact that black people are being talked about in more nuanced ways -- like black youth vote versus black baby boomers vote -- it speaks to how much the movement building has been translated to electoral power.""Mr. Darby, the Charleston minister, said he believed the whiteness of the Iowa and New Hampshire electorates affects how they view the primary's central question of electability.He contended that many white voters in those states could ""afford"" to base voting decisions solely on policy outlines and ideological promises, while many black voters were conditioned by history to assume the worst about politicians. He said he was not surprised that Mr. Biden was beaten by popular candidates in those states but was favored in South Carolina.He compared Mr. Trump's presidency to a house fire, and said black voters were better at recognizing the urgency.""If your house is on fire, you don't bring the decorators in to redecorate while the flames are still raging,"" Mr. Darby said. ""You put out the fire first -- and then you redecorate.""PhotographVoters selecting presidential candidates at their firehouse on Primary Day in Columbia, S.C.

| Jump to first hitOn the eve of Super Tuesday, the president traveled to North Carolina to once again stage a rally in a state about to hold a Democratic nominating contest and eagerly mocked the candidates.CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- President Trump inserted himself on Monday into the Democratic presidential nomination contest on the eve of its biggest day, belittling the resurgent Joseph R. Biden Jr. as a feebleminded has-been while fanning resentment among supporters of Bernie Sanders.Traveling to one of the larger states holding a Democratic primary on Super Tuesday, Mr. Trump eagerly sought to undercut Mr. Biden at the very moment the former vice president revived his flagging campaign, taunting him for verbal gaffes and memory lapses and portraying him as an old man who even if elected would not govern but instead be committed to a retirement home.As he has for weeks, the president likewise sought to encourage disenchantment on the left by promoting the notion that the Democratic Party establishment was trying to somehow illegitimately take away the nomination from Mr. Sanders. But Mr. Trump did not neglect the rest of the shrinking Democratic field, firing off barbs at the other candidates still in contention and even those who dropped out in the past 48 hours and threw their support to Mr. Biden.""The Democrat party has gone crazy,"" Mr. Trump said to a stadium full of cheering supporters.The president wrapped up his rally not long before Mr. Biden's own election-eve rally in Dallas got underway, and Mr. Trump seemed especially focused on the former vice president as a potential opponent in the fall.He gleefully repeated recent misstatements by Mr. Biden, including his confusion over names and states, his statement that he was a candidate for the Senate, his reference to Tuesday's primaries as ""Super Thursday"" and his head-spinning comment that 150 million Americans have been killed by guns since 2007.""That means 50 percent of our country!"" Mr. Trump said of the gun comment. ""That's a big story!""""Sleepy Joe,"" Mr. Trump continued, ""he doesn't even know where he is or what he's doing or what office he's running for. Honestly, I don't think he knows what office he's running for.""If Mr. Biden won the presidency, Mr. Trump said, his staff would actually do the governing. ""They're going to put him into a home, and other people are going to be running the country,"" the president said, ""and they're going to be super-left, radical crazies. And Joe's going to be in a home and he'll be watching television.""A revival of Mr. Biden's candidacy could scramble the election dynamics, giving Mr. Trump as much at stake on Tuesday as the Democrats. The president and his staff have been excited by the rise of Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator who calls himself a democratic socialist, seeing the contrast as a favorable one in the November general election. But Mr. Trump made clear he would happily go after Mr. Biden if he emerges, too.The rally in North Carolina was the fifth time in a row that the president has flown to a state holding a Democratic contest just before voting opened to force his way into the news cycle and try to shape the conversation. ""We like to troll,"" he boasted to the crowd in Charlotte.As is often the case, the Monday night rally was more of a Trumpian stream of consciousness than a recitation of the official text sitting on the teleprompter in front of him. He accused Democrats of ""trying to politicize the coronavirus"" even as he focused on the politics of coronavirus and asserted that ""fringe globalists"" wanted to keep the borders open to infected visitors.Mr. Trump peppered his speech with a string of false or misleading statements. ""Mexico's paying for the wall,"" he insisted, even though it is not. ""Yes, they are. You'll see. You'll see. You understand."" He boasted of preserving protections for pre-existing conditions even though his administration went to court to overturn the law guaranteeing such protections and supported legislation that would have weakened them.As he sometimes does in these off-the-cuff riffs, he trailed off into comments that raised eyebrows. Twice at different points in his speech, he noted that he knew many parents who ""don't love their children very much."" At another point, he summoned Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, to the stage and gushed over him as if he were a younger brother.""We all have your back,"" declared Mr. Graham, who lost the Republican presidential nomination to Mr. Trump in 2016, when the senator called the eventual winner a ""kook"" who was unfit for office. ""Mr. President, you're going to kick their ass in November.""""Oh, my Lindsey, my Lindsey,"" Mr. Trump said.The president ridiculed the other Democratic candidates, calling former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York ""a disaster waiting to happen"" and ""a mess,"" while again mocking his would-be challenger's height. He recalled how Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whom he once again mocked with a racial slur, ""Pocahontas,"" eviscerated Mr. Bloomberg at a recent debate. ""She's mean, she's very mean,"" he said. ""She came after him and he started choking.""Two candidates who just left the race likewise came under fire: former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Without any evidence, Mr. Trump contended that they made an illicit pact with Mr. Biden for their support.""Sounds like they made a deal,"" he said. ""They both supported Sleepy Joe. You know why? They made a deal. You know why? Quid pro quo. That's why."" Alluding to his own impeachment for using the power of his office to coerce campaign aid from Ukraine, Mr. Trump shouted: ""Impeach them! They should be impeached! They should be impeached! Quid pro quo!""He seemed particularly keen on fomenting discord within the Democratic Party by suggesting that the gathering support for Mr. Biden constituted a conspiracy to deny Mr. Sanders the nomination for a second election cycle in a row.""It's being rigged against Crazy Bernie,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Crazy Bernie's going to go crazy, crazy.""Maggie Haberman reported from Charlotte, and Peter Baker from Washington.PhotographPresident Trump, speaking in Charlotte, N.C., mocked Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitDiscussions with 60 Democratic officials found that three former candidates — Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar — were their leading choices, followed by Stacey Abrams.
WASHINGTON — With former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. now holding an all but insurmountable lead over Senator Bernie Sanders in the presidential primary contest, many Democrats have shifted their attention to a favorite quadrennial parlor game: the vice-presidential search.
Mr. Biden has shown his hand in a big and unusual way for a front-runner, saying he would pick a woman as a running mate. That has opened the path for Democratic officials to start picking favorites — from a socially safe distance.
In discussions with The Times since Mr. Biden’s big primary victories on Tuesday, 60 Democratic National Committee members and congressional and party leaders most frequently proposed three former rivals of Mr. Biden as his running mate — Senator Kamala Harris of California, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Next up was Stacey Abrams, a former state House leader whose defeat in 2018 Georgia governor’s race remains disputed by many in the party.
Other popular suggestions included Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Representative Val Demings of Florida. The Democrats interviewed also proposed seven other women, including Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico.
While de facto presidential nominees typically keep their list of potential running mates closely held, Mr. Biden has helped fuel speculation by eagerly rattling off names for months — nearly all of them women. Even his wife, Jill, offered her take in a private fund-raiser earlier this month, praising Ms. Klobuchar and criticizing Ms. Harris’s debate stage attack on her husband last summer.
Mr. Biden, at various points, has suggested he might choose Ms. Abrams, Ms. Klobuchar, Senators Jeanne Shaheen and Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire or Sally Q. Yates, the former assistant attorney general whom President Trump fired three years ago.
A female vice president would be historic: Only two women — Representative Geraldine Ferraro of New York in 1984 and Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska in 2008 — have been nominated, and none have ever served in the White House. That barrier-breaking appeal could give Mr. Biden’s candidacy a shot of energy, an acknowledgment of the role women have played in boosting the party during the Trump era.
Prominent Democratic activists, officials and leaders have been vocal with their desires that the ticket include a woman, after the demise of the last major female candidate, Ms. Warren, who ended her campaign two weeks ago.
“I’ve been predicting a woman on the ticket since 2017 and demanding it since Warren dropped out,” said Christine Pelosi, a D.N.C. member from San Francisco who is the daughter of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. “It’s really important to have the ability to lead America in the depression we will enter if we don’t flatten the curve and find a cure. The best pick is the woman Joe or Bernie trusts the most to be president and commander-in-chief.”
Some of the party’s most liberal members and supporters of Mr. Sanders suggested that choosing Ms. Warren, a fellow liberal, would help Mr. Biden appeal to the progressive and young voters who have backed the Vermont senator in the primary. Choosing a moderate like Ms. Klobuchar, they say, would dampen general election enthusiasm.
“Whoever ends up the nominee should pick Senator Warren,” said Tefere Gebre, a D.N.C. member from Maryland who is executive vice president of the AFL-CIO. “I would be less enthusiastic if it’s the senator from Minnesota.”
Yet, with the coronavirus upending every part of American society, including the presidential campaign, Mr. Biden may be forced to deviate from the standard playbook.
Mr. Biden’s running mate pick will be viewed through the lens of a public health and economic crisis, perhaps raising the stock of candidates who have more experience, or pushing him to consider someone from outside of government.
“You could imagine some highly successful person from a different walk of life being considered, and that could expand the list a lot,” said John Podesta, who as Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman was involved in her vice-presidential search. “A college president or a medical professional, somebody who would send a pretty powerful signal that what you care about is strength, performance, a commitment to facts and sound decision-making.”
Mr. Biden’s campaign said it was beginning to build a team to conduct a “vigorous vetting process.” Some close to the campaign say the team is in the early stages of compiling a list of potential running mates and then will vet them. Beyond his own experience as Barack Obama’s vice president, Mr. Biden has a deep bench of aides to consult. One of his closest advisers, Ron Klain, helped do vice-presidential vetting for Al Gore in 2000.
Mitt Romney cut his campaign’s list of about 80 potential running mates to 20 in early April 2012. By late July, the list had been narrowed to five men, after the one woman under serious consideration, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, declined the campaign’s invitation to be vetted. (Mr. Romney eventually chose Representative Paul Ryan.)
Donald Trump’s 2016 vetting process was less streamlined, but among those he interviewed during his search was Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa.
Mrs. Clinton started with a list of 40 possible candidates, which was narrowed to nine who underwent a process of serious vetting, an interview and a campaign appearance with the candidate. While she considered a number of women to be vice president, only Ms. Warren advanced to the final stages of the process.
For Mr. Biden, 77, a much younger woman could assuage concerns about his age and critiques about a primary process that started with the most diverse field in history and ended with two white men.
Mr. Biden’s campaign hopes the early announcement that he would select a woman will give his operation a shot of enthusiasm from voters, even as the presidential election heads into a deep freeze because of the coronavirus. On Thursday, his campaign sent a fund-raising appeal asking supporters to “commit to standing with” Mr. Biden and his future female running mate.
By announcing he will pick a woman, Mr. Biden is aiming to give his ticket a modern-day balance in a party focused on issues of racial and gender representation. Past nominees have chosen running mates who provided geographic diversity (Lloyd Bentsen in 1988) or offered the promise of winning a key state (Mr. Ryan, from Wisconsin, in 2012). Mr. Obama, just four years into his Senate term, chose Mr. Biden in 2008 to ease concerns about his own relative lack of experience and help appeal to white working-class voters.
Choosing Ms. Harris, 55, would not only provide not a gender balance but also would add a black woman to the ticket after black voters helped revive Mr. Biden’s campaign in February. But as Jill Biden’s recent criticism indicated, the memory of Ms. Harris’s debate stage attack may hinder her chances.
“I have to tell you that I’m a little torn in terms of my choices,” said Alma Gonzalez, a D.N.C. member from Florida. “If it were me and if I was Joe Biden, I would say to Senator Harris, ‘Do you want to be on the Supreme Court or be my vice president?’”
Presidential candidates rarely place public restrictions on their pick, preferring to keep options open so they can pivot their selection to suit the shifting dynamics of the campaign. Veterans of past vice-presidential searches said the most important elements have been how comfortable the nominees are with their would-be partners.
And while past campaigns spent months vetting candidates and agonizing over running-mate strategy, there’s very little academic research suggesting that the vice-presidential pick has a huge impact on winning the general election.
“The first and most important criteria is, can this person help you win in November and will they at least not hurt you in November,” said Mr. Podesta.
For Mrs. Clinton, that meant ruling out candidates from states with Republican governors, like Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio. If she won, her team feared that Mr. Brown could be replaced in the Senate by a Republican and shift the balance of the chamber away from her future administration.
Unlike any nominee since Mr. Gore, Mr. Biden has a unique view into the selection process, having gone through it himself. While Mr. Obama started with a list of 20 candidates, he faced pressure to select Mrs. Clinton as his running mate and create a “unity ticket.” After Mr. Obama rejected that idea, the choice came down to a “coin toss” between Mr. Biden and Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana. Mr. Biden was more energetic and enthusiastic in his interview, according to aides.
In an interview earlier this month, Mr. Biden cited his close relationship with Mr. Obama as a model for his selection process, saying the president was able to trust him with key pieces of his agenda.
“For me, the most important thing in choosing a vice president is whether or not the person is simpatico with me in terms of where I want to take the country,” he said. “It’s really important that the next president is able to do what Barack was able to do with me.”

| Jump to first hitThe former vice president had the Super Tuesday of his dreams, winning in places he hasn't even set foot in recently.The scene, on its face, might not have been surprising a year ago: Joe Biden -- appraised among Democrats as a decent man and affable sidekick to the party's most popular figure -- racking up primary victories and having fun talking about it.""They don't call it Super Tuesday for nothing!"" he told supporters in Los Angeles, shouting through a list of states he had won amid a medley of fist-pumps and we-did-its.But a week ago, the result would have been something close to unthinkable.Lifted by a hasty unity among center-left Democrats disinclined toward political revolution, Mr. Biden has propelled himself in the span of three days from electoral failure to would-be juggernaut. He has demonstrated durable strength with African-Americans and emerged as the if-everyone-says-so vessel for tactical voters who think little of Senator Bernie Sanders and fear that his nomination would mean four more years of President Trump.Mr. Biden's performance included decisive early wins across the South, victory in delegate-rich Texas and triumphs in some places where he did not even campaign as Super Tuesday approached, like Minnesota and Massachusetts, home to Senator Elizabeth Warren. The dominant showing made clear that the primary has effectively narrowed to a two-man race with Mr. Sanders, as Michael R. Bloomberg's first brush with national voters yielded meager returns on a colossal financial investment.For all Mr. Biden's stumbles -- in Iowa, in New Hampshire, at debates, at his own events -- perhaps all voters needed was to hear him give a victory speech.That happened on Saturday, in South Carolina, where Mr. Biden seemed to temporarily erase every latent concern that had accumulated for nearly a year about his bid.Yet any suggestion that Mr. Biden is now a risk-free option would appear to contradict the available evidence.He is no safer with a microphone, no likelier to complete a thought without exaggeration or bewildering detour.He has not, as a 77-year-old man proudly set in his ways, acquired new powers of persuasion or management in the 72 hours since the first primary state victory of his three presidential campaigns.In fact, Mr. Biden has blundered this chance before -- the establishment front-runner; the last, best hope for moderates -- fumbling his initial 2020 advantages in a hail of disappointing fund-raising, feeble campaign organization and staggering underperformance.When it mattered most, though, the judgment came swiftly from Sanders-averse Democrats.All right, we'll take him.The consequence -- after a yearlong winnowing from a field that once included many women, nonwhite candidates and up-and-coming political talents -- is that Democrats are very likely to nominate one of two septuagenarian white men with conspicuous political baggage. Any safety in that choice is relative.""John Kerry, Al Gore and Hillary Clinton,"" said Rebecca Kirszner Katz, a veteran progressive strategist. ""All safe choices.""Voters wary of Mr. Sanders are probably right that supporting Mr. Biden is the tidiest way to keep the democratic socialist from the top of the ticket. They may yet be right that Mr. Biden would pose the strongest challenge to Mr. Trump. The former vice president is widely admired in the party for moving gracefully through tragedy and serving alongside Barack Obama.Certainly Mr. Trump would appear to have his preferences: Last year, he was impeached after trying to enlist a foreign power's help to damage Mr. Biden. In recent weeks, the president has tweeted mischievous praise of Mr. Sanders, seeming eager to elevate him as a prospective opponent.But what if Mr. Trump is wrong? What if every elected official hustling to endorse Mr. Biden, after long resisting, is wrong, too? Recent election history, especially Mr. Trump's, has been unkind to conventional wisdom.Only a couple of weeks ago, some Biden allies were talking quietly about how he could, at least, end his campaign with dignity: Hang on narrowly in South Carolina, hopefully, and bow out, statesmanlike, if Super Tuesday went sideways as many expected.That Mr. Biden's fortunes have changed says more about the context of this primary than the content of his campaign. Current and former competitors, including Ms. Warren, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar, all strained to connect with black and Latino voters. Mr. Bloomberg flailed on the debate stage as he stepped out from behind the reputational curtain of his ubiquitous advertisements. And many in the party have remained uncomfortable with the kind of unswerving progressivism that Mr. Sanders demands.The depth of this last concern with Mr. Sanders is uncertain. Entering Tuesday, his predictions of runaway progressive turnout to his cause, a central premise of his case for his own electability, had not necessarily come to pass.It is also quite possible, after all the Tuesday states are accounted for, that the delegate picture will look very competitive, particularly as full tallies from California roll in. Mr. Sanders remains popular across much of the party, even among many who did not consider him their first choice.If nothing else, a Biden-Sanders matchup is the logical venue for the party's foremost ideological debate about the proper scope and ambition of government -- about whether Mr. Trump is a symptom of longstanding national ills or an ""anomaly,"" as Mr. Biden has suggested, whose removal should be the party's chief animating priority.""Sanders has more confidence that the voters are ready for big change,"" said Barney Frank, the former Massachusetts congressman. ""Biden, particularly after the eight years with Obama, has more of a sense that more government can be a hard sell.""Mr. Frank said the race boiled down to this question: ""Is the electorate more afraid of government than they are of inequality?""The two contenders were products of the same era, shaped by very different forces within it. Mr. Sanders became a mission-driven lefty, enthralled by socialist and communist governments abroad and the fight for working people at home. Mr. Biden preferred a within-the-system approach, winning a Senate election at 29 and acknowledging some distance from the activist instincts of many contemporaries.""I wore sport coats,"" Mr. Biden told reporters once, explaining his limited involvement in antiwar zeal. ""I was not part of that.""That comment came as Mr. Biden sought the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Sanders ran for Congress that year. They both fell short. They both tried again.For more than two decades, they served in the same Washington, amassing voting records that have often dogged them since. Mr. Sanders has said he regrets his voting history on some gun legislation; Mr. Biden has faced consistent criticism, including from Mr. Sanders, for his vote authorizing the use of military force in Iraq, among other decisions.This paper trail convinced some 2020 strategists that both candidates would be vulnerable. Their own campaigns did not necessarily see it that way.""I always thought that this race would be between the clash of two titans, of Bernie and Biden,"" said Ro Khanna, a California congressman and Sanders campaign co-chair. ""It's odd that it wasn't the conventional wisdom.""Over the past year, alternative outcomes were easy to imagine. There were candidates of virtually every profile, including a half-dozen alone from Super Tuesday states, and a procession of fresh faces like Senator Kamala Harris and former Representative Beto O'Rourke who seemed primed to capitalize on voters' curiosity.Mr. Sanders was often dismissed as a factional candidate and 2016 retread even before he had a heart attack last fall.Mr. Biden was depicted as a lackluster contender out of step with the times.""You cannot go back to the end of the Obama administration and think that that's good enough,"" Mr. O'Rourke said last June, calling Mr. Biden a return to the past.""I just think Biden is declining,"" Tim Ryan, an Ohio congressman who was then running for president, said last September. ""I don't think he has the energy. You see it almost daily.""Both men have now endorsed Mr. Biden's campaign. Other fallen rivals, like Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, have done the same.Mr. Sanders has a theory about all that. ""There is a massive effort trying to stop Bernie Sanders. That's not a secret to anybody in this room,"" he told reporters on Monday. ""So why would I be surprised that establishment politicians are coming together?""Of course, politics is about options, and Democrats suddenly have very few, even as some remaining candidates suggest they are being overlooked.Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Bloomberg have effectively admitted that their only path to the nomination is a contested convention this summer. This has not stopped either from pressing on so far.In California on Monday, Ms. Warren said that ""no matter how many Washington insiders tell you"" to support Mr. Biden, ""nominating their fellow Washington insider will not meet this moment.""Mr. Bloomberg, growing weary on Tuesday of questions about whether his run was aiding Mr. Sanders, framed the issue in reverse: ""Why don't they coalesce around me?"" he asked of moderates during a stop in Florida.By evening's end, he seemed to have his answer. They had settled on someone else.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. lost three of four contests last month, but his fortunes were changed on Tuesday.

| Jump to first hitBoth men have seemed energized by a renewed debate on war and peace, but no two candidates better illustrate the divisions among Democrats about what American leadership abroad should look like.
DECORAH, Iowa — Hours after an American drone strike killed Iran’s top military commander, Joseph R. Biden Jr. stood in a barnlike building in Independence, Iowa, thundering about the importance of electing an experienced president as America faces tumult abroad — and “maybe, God forbid,” war.
About 70 miles away, Senator Bernie Sanders was just as passionate as he denounced military spending and encouraged international diplomacy.
“Maybe what we should be doing is figuring out how as a planet we work together instead of going to war with each other,” Mr. Sanders told the crowd on Friday inside a building on the Winneshiek County fairgrounds. Earlier in the day, he emphasized the need to “get our priorities right” by investing in issues at home rather than on military action abroad.
Amid signs that both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have found their footing in Iowa after months of being overshadowed here, they are now aggressively seizing on the escalating tensions with Iran to press their starkly divergent cases for the presidency as they compete for an overlapping slice of the electorate.
Both men seemed newly energized on the campaign trail, treating the Iran confrontation as a clarifying political moment, as well as a tailor-made opportunity to showcase their long records on international affairs. And yet no two candidates better illustrate the sharp divisions in the Democratic Party about what American leadership abroad should look like.
Mr. Biden, the former vice president, has focused on highlighting his decades-long résumé in foreign policy and his relationships overseas, casting himself as the candidate best prepared to assume the commander-in-chief title “on Day 1.”
In contrast, Mr. Sanders is emphasizing his long-held aversion to war while steadfastly promoting a domestic political agenda for America’s working class.
The rising tensions with Iran have also afforded Mr. Sanders a fresh opportunity to highlight his diplomacy-centered vision for foreign policy — and in particular his opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a stance that underscores his contrast with Mr. Biden, who voted to authorize that war.
“Joe Biden has prided himself on foreign policy experience for the last several decades,” said Sean Bagniewski, the Democratic chairman in Polk County. “I’ve heard Iowans say they think this election may focus more on foreign policy than many of us expected and that he’s now their guy.”
He added, “On the flip side, Bernie was one of the few Democrats to vote against the war in Iraq. I’ve heard folks say that reinforces their decision to support someone who they think had been right all along.”
The competition to gain the upper hand on national security played out in vivid relief on the campaign trail over the weekend, as tensions escalated between the two candidates over their judgment on matters of war and peace. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders both delivered forceful remarks in several of the same towns and cities in eastern Iowa, offering sharpened messages about America’s role in the world and their visions of presidential leadership.
In temperament, ideology and style on the campaign trail, the gregarious, gaffe-prone, relatively moderate Mr. Biden and the disciplined, democratic socialist Mr. Sanders could not be more different. Yet polling and interviews on the ground demonstrate that they have some overlapping appeal here, especially with the white, working-class voters who are skeptical of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., the other two front-runners in Iowa who have done well with college-educated voters.
Less than one month before the caucuses, as Ms. Warren struggles to regain her momentum in the state, Mr. Biden is drawing notably more energized crowds — even if they are often smaller than those of his chief rivals — and attendees at his events frequently say that he makes them feel safe. Mr. Sanders, lifted by his loyal supporters, has displayed enduring political strength despite having a heart attack in October.
Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders both appear to be “doing fairly well” in Dubuque, a heavily Catholic, blue-collar city along the Mississippi River where they campaigned this past week, said Steven Drahozal, the Democratic chairman of Dubuque County.
“This is the type of community, I think, that actually, interestingly, plays well to both of them,” Mr. Drahozal said. Mr. Biden, a Catholic, has longstanding relationships in the city, but Mr. Drahozal added that Dubuque also had a “very vocal, very active, very progressive community that is very supportive of Senator Sanders.”
Mr. Sanders views his consistent diplomacy-over-conflict stance — dating to his opposition to the Vietnam War and his anti-interventionist foreign policy as mayor of Burlington, Vt. — as an advantage with working-class Americans who are frustrated with the country’s involvement in costly and distant wars.
“I know that it is rarely the children of the billionaire class who face the agony of reckless foreign policy — it is the children of working families,” he said on Friday, reading from prepared remarks at an event in Anamosa.
Aides to Mr. Sanders view him as well positioned against Mr. Biden — who in many ways embodies the centrist Washington establishment Mr. Sanders dislikes — and they have urged him for months to go after the former vice president more directly. With foreign affairs, Mr. Sanders’s campaign sees an opportunity not just to call attention to the senator’s consistent resistance to war but also to draw an easy-to-grasp contrast between the two candidates.
Even before the airstrike in Iraq last week, Mr. Sanders’s aides had been eager to highlight his foreign policy views. But though he speaks on the trail about his opposition to America’s support for Saudi Arabia’s war in Yemen, foreign policy has so far taken a back seat in his campaign to domestic policy proposals like “Medicare for all” and tuition-free public college.
At an event in Dubuque on Saturday, however, Mr. Sanders called on Congress to “take immediate steps to restrain President Trump from plunging our nation into yet another endless war.”
His foreign policy views have struck a chord with voters in Iowa like Peggy Ross, 67, a bookseller from Decorah. “I think he has the right idea,” she said after seeing Mr. Sanders speak. “No one likes war.”
Yet Mr. Sanders’s dovish stances and his emphasis on domestic matters could also prove to be liabilities with voters who want a firmer response to foreign aggression than he appears to promote. They could also weaken his standing among Americans who are clamoring for an experienced hand in the international arena at a moment of global turmoil.
A CNN poll from late November found that 48 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters thought Mr. Biden was best equipped to handle foreign policy; Mr. Sanders was a distant second at 14 percent.
Mr. Biden, who chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when he represented Delaware, is perhaps at his most fluent and comfortable when discussing international affairs, and he has made that issue a centerpiece of his message in a race that has been largely limited to domestic debates.
His campaign has run ads emphasizing his national security experience, and on Friday posted some of them on Twitter after news broke of the drone strike. On Sunday, the campaign announced endorsements from three Democratic members of Congress, all of whom are military veterans.
Mr. Biden’s allies say that renewed national focus on foreign policy allows him to strike a clear contrast with both Mr. Trump and his Democratic rivals, and injects fresh urgency into the question of who is the most electable candidate.
The gravity of the moment “propels deep interest among people in seeing the strongest candidate against Trump,” said Thomas E. Donilon, who was former President Barack Obama’s national security adviser and is supporting Mr. Biden.
And Mr. Biden, he said, was “a natural person to look to as a steady, experienced hand to deal with these issues on Day 1.” (Mr. Donilon’s brother, Mike Donilon, is Mr. Biden’s chief strategist.)
Throughout his latest Iowa bus tour, Mr. Biden frequently emphasized his relationships abroad and depth of experience as he warned against war in the Middle East. The next president, he said, will “inherit a country that is divided, and a world that’s in disarray.”
He added, “There can be no time for on-the-job training” — a message that could apply, he has suggested, to any of his leading rivals.
“With all due respect, I think I’m best prepared” on leadership matters compared to “anybody running,” Mr. Biden told an applauding crowd of about 700 on Saturday night in Des Moines.
It was not always a message delivered crisply, or accurately; on several occasions he suggested that Iran had a population of around 40 million people even though it is a nation of more than 80 million people. He also cited Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, when he intended to refer to Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaeda leader.
In Des Moines, when Mr. Biden was pressed by an attendee on his foreign policy record, he noted, as he often does, that he had quickly grown disillusioned with the Bush administration’s handling of Iraq and that he had become a vocal opponent of the war. A CNN fact-check published Monday found his remarks about when his opposition to the war began to be misleading.
He was also questioned on his view of the raid that killed bin Laden; Mr. Biden’s answer on that issue has changed over the years.
“It’s not to suggest I haven’t made mistakes in my career, but I will put my record against anyone in public life in terms of foreign policy,” Mr. Biden said.
At weekend events for both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, attendees viewed the unfolding developments in Iran with anxiety, if not grave apprehension.
“We don’t need to waste any more time,” said Korlu P. Jallah, 22, who attended an event for Mr. Biden in Waterloo on Saturday morning and said she was supporting him because of his experience. “We’re in a huge mess given the fact that we could possibly go to war with Iran.”
Still, she said, Mr. Sanders is her second choice.

| Jump to first hitJoseph R. Biden Jr. and Bernie Sanders will be auditioning for the presidency, trying to convey leadership, against the backdrop of an unfolding national emergency.For the first time in the long Democratic primary campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will meet in a one-on-one debate, facing off Sunday night as Mr. Sanders fights for the future of his candidacy against a rival who has taken a commanding position in the race.But that isn't why this debate is different from most others in modern politics.Both men will be auditioning for the presidency amid an unfolding national emergency over the coronavirus; the last candidates to debate in such urgent circumstances were Barack Obama and John McCain during the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Sanders will be under added pressure to show why he is still running, at a time when people are worried about far more than presidential politics, while Mr. Biden -- often uneven in these debate settings -- must navigate far more speaking time as he tries to appear capable of uniting the country and leading it through a crisis.Rarely has a debate been so shaped by palpable anxiety: The event has been relocated from a Phoenix theater to a Washington, D.C., television studio to limit any unnecessary travel. There will be no live audience and no spin room. One moderator who had potentially been exposed to the virus has bowed out to avoid spreading it.Debates are often unpredictable, but it is especially hard to game out how this debate featuring a moderate standard-bearer and a liberal challenger will unfold and how people will process it. Hundreds of thousands of viewers, if not millions, will have been personally affected by Sunday, as public gathering spaces are shuttered, schools are closed and on Thursday the stock market plunged by the largest percentage in decades (it snapped back upward on Friday).""It is going to be a different kind of debate,"" Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, an early ally and surrogate for Mr. Biden, said with more than a little understatement.The extraordinary situation offers an unusual challenge and opportunity. It will provide a national platform and audience for Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders to preview their own brands of presidential leadership, especially in contrast to that of President Trump, who had spent weeks downplaying the threat that the coronavirus presented.""You have to throw the entire playbook out the window and focus on what people care about because the agenda has shifted dramatically since they were last onstage together,"" said Jared Leopold, a Democratic communications strategist who worked for Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington during his 2020 presidential bid. ""It's like you were preparing to pitch in the World Series and suddenly you found yourself at bat at a key moment. The dynamics have totally shifted.""Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist who worked on the Obama campaigns, said moments like this are when ""voters want to see leaders, not politicians,"" warning against anything that would look like ""petty politics.""""This is a time for leadership and demonstrating that you have the judgment and vision to fix the incompetence that we're seeing out of the White House,"" Ms. Cutter said. ""That is job No. 1 in this debate.""Then there are less consequential questions: Will Mr. Biden, 77, and Mr. Sanders, 78, shake hands? And in a new moment of ""social distancing"" should these two septuagenarian men who are in an at-risk age group make a gesture of doing something else entirely -- like an elbow bump?The state of the race itself has been fundamentally upended since the last debate, too.Back then -- less than three weeks ago -- Mr. Sanders had won the most votes in three consecutive contests and was threatening to seize control of the nominating contest. Now, Mr. Biden has romped through two straight weeks of sizable victories, so much so that Mr. Sanders's campaign is facing what experts see as a nearly insurmountable delegate climb.Mr. Sanders now trails Mr. Biden by more than 150 delegates after losing four states last Tuesday and 10 the week before. His defeats were so thorough in Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan (a state Mr. Sanders won four years ago) that he trailed in every county. The states that vote next week -- Ohio, Florida, Illinois and Arizona -- are challenging for Mr. Sanders, as well.That difficult math might typically suggest an aggressive new posture for Mr. Sanders, who needs a real restructuring of the race to be successful. But his speech after last week's disappointing elections -- ""we are losing the debate over electability"" -- was widely interpreted as an effort at de-escalation, as he pressed Mr. Biden to win over his liberal supporters on issues ranging from the environment to student debt, repeatedly asking ""Joe, what are you going to do?""In his own speech on Tuesday night, Mr. Biden offered an olive branch to Mr. Sanders and his supporters, thanking them for their contributions to the contest.Mr. Coons expected more of that approach on Sunday. ""I suspect that we will see Joe say he wants to work with Bernie on some of his policy proposals,"" Mr. Coons said. But, he said, ""if Bernie insists on simply picking up tools and swinging at Joe the whole time, I think it will be harder to do that.""""They have a shared fundamental goal of preventing Donald Trump's election and the longer that Bernie Sanders spends attacking Joe Biden the more likely he is to undermine the strength of his candidacy against Donald Trump in the fall,"" Mr. Coons added.Still, for Mr. Sanders, the rapid spread of the coronavirus and the predicted shortcomings of America's medical system are shining a spotlight on his signature issue: a universal and government-run health care system.""It's obviously a health care crisis and so Bernie's longstanding support for providing affordable health care for everyone through 'Medicare for all' is particularly relevant today,"" said Ben Tulchin, a pollster for Mr. Sanders. ""And he is consistently seen as the most trusted candidate on health care.""Mr. Tulchin said the coronavirus's economic fallout would shape the debate to Mr. Sanders's benefit, too.""Bernie has a lot of credibility talking about economic issues especially for those being left behind in today's economy and there are soon going to be millions of more people facing financial challenges,"" Mr. Tulchin added. ""There are millions of workers who don't have paid sick leave, millions of workers who are living paycheck to paycheck, and if you're out of work for a few weeks that is potentially catastrophic.""The two candidates offered a preview of their contrasting approaches to the crisis in a pair of speeches on Thursday.Standing in front of a row of American flags, in Wilmington, Del., Mr. Biden adopted the scene and serious tone of a statesman, calling for collective action as a country. ""The coronavirus does not have a political affiliation,"" he said. ""It will affect Republicans, independents and Democrats alike and will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or ZIP code.""Mr. Sanders, speaking from Burlington, Vt., with the state and American flags positioned in front of ""Bernie"" signage, warned starkly of casualties that could top World War II, while pivoting to his central message of the urgent need for universal health care.""Our country is at a severe disadvantage compared to every other major country on Earth because we do not guarantee health care to all people as a right,"" Mr. Sanders said.PhotographThe Democratic debate stage in Charleston, S.C., last month before the state's primary election.

| Jump to first hitAttention has centered on four Republicans who might break ranks in President Trump's impeachment trial. But Democrats have their own list of potential defectors.WASHINGTON -- Nothing would please President Trump more than to wrap up his impeachment trial with support from a handful of Democrats. He might get his wish.As the Senate nears a vote on Mr. Trump's fate, possibly as early as Friday, attention has focused on the few moderate Republicans who might break ranks by voting to hear from witnesses or perhaps even to convict. But Democrats have their own list of possible defectors who could vote to acquit.They are focusing on four Democrats from states won by Mr. Trump: Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, Doug Jones of Alabama and Gary Peters of Michigan. Should one or more vote to clear the president on either of the charges he faces, it would hand him a coveted talking point during an election year -- and deliver a blow to Democrats, who lost two votes in the House when Mr. Trump was impeached in December.""Every one of us knows -- and if our leadership didn't know, we would tell them -- that this is an individual decision every senator has got to make,"" Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, said in an interview, adding that Democrats' closed-door meetings did not include discussions of how members would vote. ""So I don't know how that plays out, or what the numbers will be.""Mr. Jones suggested Wednesday morning that he was open to acquitting Mr. Trump on one of the charges, obstruction of Congress, though he said the president's behavior was strengthening the case against him. Mr. Trump is accused of abusing his oath of office and obstructing Congress in connection with his decision to withhold military aid from Ukraine while pressuring that country's leader to investigate his political rivals, and concealing his conduct from lawmakers.""I'm still looking at that very closely,"" Mr. Jones said, without elaborating. ""There are some things that trouble me about it. But I will tell you this about the obstruction charge: The more I see the president of the United States attacking witnesses, the stronger that case gets.""Later, after a spate of news articles about him, Mr. Jones backtracked: ""Don't go putting some damn headline in there, 'Still open to acquit.' I'm open to acquit. I'm open to convict. I want to hear all the evidence. I want to hear witnesses.""On Thursday night, as the Senate neared the end of its two-day question-and-answer period, Mr. Jones joined with Mr. Manchin and Ms. Sinema in a query that suggested skepticism of the obstruction charge: Should the House have ""initiated a formal accommodations process"" with the Trump White House that might have yielded the documents Democrats sought?""We've been trying that route for 9 months now,"" Representative Adam B. Schiff, the lead impeachment manager, replied, adding, ""What we've seen was there was no desire on the part of the president to reach any accommodation.""Mr. Jones won a special election in 2017 in deeply conservative Alabama after defeating a Republican, Roy S. Moore, the former chief justice of the state Supreme Court who was accused of sexually assaulting teenagers when he was in his 30s. Now Mr. Jones faces re-election and a crowded Republican primary race that includes Mr. Moore and Jeff Sessions, Mr. Trump's former attorney general.His voting record is largely with his party -- he has sided with Mr. Trump only 37 percent of the time, according to the website FiveThirtyEight -- and he has been vocal in his demand for witnesses, including in an opinion piece in The Washington Post that raised questions about whether his colleagues would commit to finding ""the whole truth.""But there will be a backlash against Mr. Jones at the ballot box in November if he votes to convict the president, said Scott Jennings, a Republican strategist and former adviser to Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.""I know that if I'm the senator from Alabama and I vote to throw Donald Trump out of office and off the ballot,"" Mr. Jennings said, ""my chances drop from whatever they were to zero.""For his part, Mr. Manchin said on Wednesday that he was frustrated with what he called the ""hypocrisy"" of Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and Mr. McConnell. Both have reversed positions they took in 1999 during the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, when Mr. McConnell was for impeachment and Mr. Schumer was against it.The West Virginia senator has spoken strongly in favor of having witnesses testify. But he has irked fellow Democrats by saying that Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose work for a Ukrainian energy company has been an issue in the trial, might be considered a relevant witness. Asked about that on Wednesday, Mr. Schumer grew testy.""We have had total unity on the issue that will be before us,"" he said. ""It's not up to Joe Manchin whether to call Hunter Biden.""Mr. Manchin is hard to predict. At the outset of the administration, Mr. Trump courted him and tried to persuade him to become a Republican. But Mr. Manchin stuck with Democrats in voting against repeal of the Affordable Care Act and against Mr. Trump's tax bill. Then he crossed party lines to become the lone Democratic vote in favor of confirming Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.He has been using his Twitter feed to encourage his constituents to call or email a new address his office has created: impeachment@manchin.senate.gov.""It's not as simple as saying, 'It's a red state, he's a conservative Democratic senator, therefore he'll do X or Y,"" said Mike Plante, a Democratic strategist in West Virginia. ""This is history. It's not simply politics.""Ms. Sinema's intentions are even more difficult to determine. She issued a statement at the outset of the trial saying she would ""treat this process with the gravity and impartiality that our oaths demand"" and has refused to talk to reporters ever since. She has been virtually silent on social media about impeachment.But after Mr. Trump's defense team wrapped up its opening statements on Tuesday, Ms. Sinema remained in the Senate chamber for more than 10 minutes, deep in conversation with Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and a close ally of Mr. McConnell. On Wednesday, during the question-and-answer portion of the trial, she asked a question that seemed intended to undercut the president's defense: Why was the aid to Ukraine withheld in secret?""Kyrsten is in an interesting spot because she ran in her campaign as a moderate but also really stayed away from the partisan politics -- she always referred to what Arizonans want, making it very local,"" said Mike Noble, a Republican strategist in Arizona. ""So she's kind of doing this balancing act.""Then there is Mr. Peters, who has cut a low profile in the Senate -- and at home, which is one reason he faces a tough race. ""I am in the undecided category,"" he told reporters in the Capitol. ""I'm going to listen, give it a fair hearing.""Mr. Trump already promotes the House's vote to impeach him as bipartisan vindication, citing the two Democrats (Representatives Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey, who has since become a Republican, and Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota) who voted against. The president's allies caution that he does not expect a repeat in the Senate, though he would be pleased to see it.""While it would be ideal to have a Democrat or two cross over and oppose impeachment like we saw in the House vote, I don't think it matters in the grand scheme of things,"" said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former adviser to Mr. Trump, adding, ""Most Americans outside of the Beltway have tuned this entire impeachment circus out of their minds.""Mr. Schumer has said he is not counting votes and is instead encouraging each senator to follow his or her conscience. On Thursday, he brushed aside a question about possible Democratic defections, saying he was solely focused on getting the four Republican votes he needed to force the Senate to subpoena witnesses.""That's where the focus will be,"" he said. ""Our caucus is totally united on that issue, which will determine where we go from there.""Democrats do appear largely unified on the question of whether to have witnesses, and they may get some Republican support. Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, has said he will vote to have witnesses, and Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, has said she is ""very likely to do so.""Mr. Jennings said at least one thing was nearly certain: ""Trump is going to claim exoneration no matter what.""PhotographSenator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, above, has irritated fellow Democrats by saying that Hunter Biden might be considered a relevant witness. Senator Doug Jones of Alabama, left, said, ""I want to hear all the evidence.""

| Jump to first hitThe former vice president had the Super Tuesday of his dreams, winning in places he hasn’t even set foot in recently.
The scene, on its face, might not have been surprising a year ago: Joe Biden — appraised among Democrats as a decent man and affable sidekick to the party’s most popular figure — racking up primary victories and having fun talking about it.
“They don’t call it Super Tuesday for nothing!” he told supporters in Los Angeles, shouting through a list of states he had won amid a medley of fist-pumps and we-did-its.
But a week ago, the result would have been something close to unthinkable.
Lifted by a hasty unity among center-left Democrats disinclined toward political revolution, Mr. Biden has propelled himself in the span of three days from electoral failure to would-be juggernaut. He has demonstrated durable strength with African-Americans and emerged as the if-everyone-says-so vessel for tactical voters who think little of Senator Bernie Sanders and fear that his nomination would mean four more years of President Trump.
Mr. Biden’s performance included decisive early wins across the South, victory in delegate-rich Texas and triumphs in some places where he did not even campaign as Super Tuesday approached, like Minnesota and Massachusetts, home to Senator Elizabeth Warren. The dominant showing made clear that the primary has effectively narrowed to a two-man race with Mr. Sanders, as Michael R. Bloomberg’s first brush with national voters yielded meager returns on a colossal financial investment.
For all Mr. Biden’s stumbles — in Iowa, in New Hampshire, at debates, at his own events — perhaps all voters needed was to hear him give a victory speech.
That happened on Saturday, in South Carolina, where Mr. Biden seemed to temporarily erase every latent concern that had accumulated for nearly a year about his bid.
Yet any suggestion that Mr. Biden is now a risk-free option would appear to contradict the available evidence.
He is no safer with a microphone, no likelier to complete a thought without exaggeration or bewildering detour.
He has not, as a 77-year-old man proudly set in his ways, acquired new powers of persuasion or management in the 72 hours since the first primary state victory of his three presidential campaigns.
In fact, Mr. Biden has blundered this chance before — the establishment front-runner; the last, best hope for moderates — fumbling his initial 2020 advantages in a hail of disappointing fund-raising, feeble campaign organization and staggering underperformance.
When it mattered most, though, the judgment came swiftly from Sanders-averse Democrats.
All right, we’ll take him.
The consequence — after a yearlong winnowing from a field that once included many women, nonwhite candidates and up-and-coming political talents — is that Democrats are very likely to nominate one of two septuagenarian white men with conspicuous political baggage. Any safety in that choice is relative.
“John Kerry, Al Gore and Hillary Clinton,” said Rebecca Kirszner Katz, a veteran progressive strategist. “All safe choices.”
Voters wary of Mr. Sanders are probably right that supporting Mr. Biden is the tidiest way to keep the democratic socialist from the top of the ticket. They may yet be right that Mr. Biden would pose the strongest challenge to Mr. Trump. The former vice president is widely admired in the party for moving gracefully through tragedy and serving alongside Barack Obama.
Certainly Mr. Trump would appear to have his preferences: Last year, he was impeached after trying to enlist a foreign power’s help to damage Mr. Biden. In recent weeks, the president has tweeted mischievous praise of Mr. Sanders, seeming eager to elevate him as a prospective opponent.
But what if Mr. Trump is wrong? What if every elected official hustling to endorse Mr. Biden, after long resisting, is wrong, too? Recent election history, especially Mr. Trump’s, has been unkind to conventional wisdom.
Only a couple of weeks ago, some Biden allies were talking quietly about how he could, at least, end his campaign with dignity: Hang on narrowly in South Carolina, hopefully, and bow out, statesmanlike, if Super Tuesday went sideways as many expected.
That Mr. Biden’s fortunes have changed says more about the context of this primary than the content of his campaign. Current and former competitors, including Ms. Warren, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar, all strained to connect with black and Latino voters. Mr. Bloomberg flailed on the debate stage as he stepped out from behind the reputational curtain of his ubiquitous advertisements. And many in the party have remained uncomfortable with the kind of unswerving progressivism that Mr. Sanders demands.
The depth of this last concern with Mr. Sanders is uncertain. Entering Tuesday, his predictions of runaway progressive turnout to his cause, a central premise of his case for his own electability, had not necessarily come to pass.
It is also quite possible, after all the Tuesday states are accounted for, that the delegate picture will look very competitive, particularly as full tallies from California roll in. Mr. Sanders remains popular across much of the party, even among many who did not consider him their first choice.
If nothing else, a Biden-Sanders matchup is the logical venue for the party’s foremost ideological debate about the proper scope and ambition of government — about whether Mr. Trump is a symptom of longstanding national ills or an “anomaly,” as Mr. Biden has suggested, whose removal should be the party’s chief animating priority.
“Sanders has more confidence that the voters are ready for big change,” said Barney Frank, the former Massachusetts congressman. “Biden, particularly after the eight years with Obama, has more of a sense that more government can be a hard sell.”
Mr. Frank said the race boiled down to this question: “Is the electorate more afraid of government than they are of inequality?”
The two contenders were products of the same era, shaped by very different forces within it. Mr. Sanders became a mission-driven lefty, enthralled by socialist and communist governments abroad and the fight for working people at home. Mr. Biden preferred a within-the-system approach, winning a Senate election at 29 and acknowledging some distance from the activist instincts of many contemporaries.
“I wore sport coats,” Mr. Biden told reporters once, explaining his limited involvement in antiwar zeal. “I was not part of that.”
That comment came as Mr. Biden sought the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Sanders ran for Congress that year. They both fell short. They both tried again.
For more than two decades, they served in the same Washington, amassing voting records that have often dogged them since. Mr. Sanders has said he regrets his voting history on some gun legislation; Mr. Biden has faced consistent criticism, including from Mr. Sanders, for his vote authorizing the use of military force in Iraq, among other decisions.
This paper trail convinced some 2020 strategists that both candidates would be vulnerable. Their own campaigns did not necessarily see it that way.
“I always thought that this race would be between the clash of two titans, of Bernie and Biden,” said Ro Khanna, a California congressman and Sanders campaign co-chair. “It’s odd that it wasn’t the conventional wisdom.”
Over the past year, alternative outcomes were easy to imagine. There were candidates of virtually every profile, including a half-dozen alone from Super Tuesday states, and a procession of fresh faces like Senator Kamala Harris and former Representative Beto O’Rourke who seemed primed to capitalize on voters’ curiosity.
Mr. Sanders was often dismissed as a factional candidate and 2016 retread even before he had a heart attack last fall.
Mr. Biden was depicted as a lackluster contender out of step with the times.
“You cannot go back to the end of the Obama administration and think that that’s good enough,” Mr. O’Rourke said last June, calling Mr. Biden a return to the past.
“I just think Biden is declining,” Tim Ryan, an Ohio congressman who was then running for president, said last September. “I don’t think he has the energy. You see it almost daily.”
Both men have now endorsed Mr. Biden’s campaign. Other fallen rivals, like Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, have done the same.
Mr. Sanders has a theory about all that. “There is a massive effort trying to stop Bernie Sanders. That’s not a secret to anybody in this room,” he told reporters on Monday. “So why would I be surprised that establishment politicians are coming together?”
Of course, politics is about options, and Democrats suddenly have very few, even as some remaining candidates suggest they are being overlooked.
Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Bloomberg have effectively admitted that their only path to the nomination is a contested convention this summer. This has not stopped either from pressing on so far.
In California on Monday, Ms. Warren said that “no matter how many Washington insiders tell you” to support Mr. Biden, “nominating their fellow Washington insider will not meet this moment.”
Mr. Bloomberg, growing weary on Tuesday of questions about whether his run was aiding Mr. Sanders, framed the issue in reverse: “Why don’t they coalesce around me?” he asked of moderates during a stop in Florida.
By evening’s end, he seemed to have his answer. They had settled on someone else.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump's national security adviser intimated that the Russians were backing Bernie Sanders, as Joe Biden blamed Mr. Trump and other Republicans for the continued interference.As accusations swirled Sunday about Russia's efforts to interfere with the 2020 election, President Trump's national security adviser and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. could not agree on what Moscow is, or is not, doing.Their disagreement came as intelligence officials disputed reports that emerged last week about a briefing of the House Intelligence Committee. The officials now maintain that the House members either misheard or misinterpreted a key part of the briefing, and that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not mean to say that it believes the Russians are currently intervening in the election explicitly to help President Trump.They do believe that Russia is intervening in the election, and that Moscow prefers Mr. Trump, a deal maker it knows well. But at least for now, those two objectives may not be linked.The differing interpretations only made it easier for the Trump administration and Democrats to put forward their own version of what the Russians are doing. As the national security adviser, Robert C. O'Brien, defended Mr. Trump and intimated that the Russians favored the Democratic presidential front-runner, Senator Bernie Sanders, Mr. Biden blamed the president and other Republicans for allowing Russia to continue to interfere in the election.Mr. O'Brien, who took office at the end of last summer, insisted on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" that he had never seen any intelligence suggesting that the Russians were interfering on behalf of Mr. Trump.""There's no briefing that I've received, that the president has received, that says that President Putin is doing anything to try and influence the election in favor of President Trump,"" Mr. O'Brien said, referring to the Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin. ""We just haven't seen that intelligence. If it's out there, I haven't seen it.""He was referring to an assessment provided to the House Intelligence Committee on Feb. 13. That briefing outlined the breadth of Russian efforts to get involved in the November election -- from hacking into voting systems to disinformation.At the root of the confusion is what Shelby Pierson, a senior intelligence official responsible for overseeing the issues of election interference, said in that briefing.Ms. Pierson, a longtime intelligence official, said there was no doubt the Russians were continuing to insert themselves in the election process. That would be consistent with past intelligence reports, and the effort by the United States Cyber Command in 2018 to block Russian intelligence from manipulating social media before the midterm congressional elections.But some intelligence officials said Ms. Pierson did not say that the current interference was explicitly on Mr. Trump's behalf. Others in the briefing said that in response to lawmakers' follow-up questions, officials made the connection between the Russian preference for Mr. Trump and Moscow's efforts to interfere in the election.The difference between actively backing Mr. Trump and preferring his re-election is a subtle nuance, officials say, but an important one: It is probably too early for the Russians to begin any significant move to bolster a specific candidate. In 2016, they at first sought to cause chaos and hurt Hillary Clinton, intelligence reports released later that year said, but only in the last few months before the election did they actively work to elect Mr. Trump.If they go the same route now, it would not be inconsistent with backing Mr. Sanders for the Democratic nomination, in part because Mr. Sanders has voted against new sanctions on Russia and because he is considered a noninterventionist. And they may conclude, rightly or wrongly, that Mr. Trump could beat Mr. Sanders.Mr. O'Brien seemed to have little doubt that the Russians preferred Mr. Sanders. ""What I've heard from the F.B.I.,"" he said, ""is that Russia would like Bernie Sanders to win the Democrat nomination. They'd probably like him to be president, understandably, because he wants to spend money on social programs and probably would have to take it out of the military.""He did not give the source of that intelligence.Mr. Sanders has denounced Russia and warned it not to interfere in the election.Mr. Trump also leapt into the fray on Sunday, accusing Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, of leaking information from the briefing.He demanded in on Twitter that someone tell ""Adam 'Shifty' Schiff to stop leaking Classified information or, even worse, made up information, to the Fake News Media.""""Someday he will be caught, & that will be a very unpleasant experience!"" Mr. Trump added.When Mr. Trump made similar comments earlier on Sunday, Mr. Schiff accused the president of deflection.""Your false claims fool no one,"" he said in a tweet. ""You welcomed Russian help in 2016, tried to coerce Ukraine's help in 2019, and won't protect our elections in 2020. Now you fired your intel chief for briefing Congress about it. You've betrayed America. Again.""Mr. Biden, who was in office as the Obama White House struggled over how to respond to Russian interference in 2016, saw some advantage in claiming he was the candidate Mr. Putin hated.""The Russians don't want me to be the nominee,"" he said on ""Face the Nation."" ""They spent a lot of money on bots on Facebook, and they've been taken down, saying Biden is a bad guy. They don't want Biden running. They're not -- no one's helping me to try to get the nomination. They have good reason.""Mr. Biden said he had not been informed of any specific intelligence. But intelligence officials say the reports they have generated have been consistent: Russian activity did not end with the 2016 election.Mr. Biden suggested that Mr. Trump was still denying Russia's involvement in 2016, even though American intelligence officials have testified on the issue every year of his presidency.""The president denies they're involved,"" Mr. Biden said. ""They've been involved. I was deeply involved in the intelligence apparatus and how it functioned before we left the vice presidency. It was clear they were involved. The president continues to deny their involvement. It's overwhelming. And the fact is that everybody knows.""He accused the Republican leadership in the Senate of failing to act to secure electoral systems.While Congress allocated several hundred million dollars for election security immediately after the 2016 election, gaping holes in the system remain, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has repeatedly blocked additional legislation from coming to the floor for a vote.PhotographRobert O'Brien said that Russia favors Senator Bernie Sanders as the Democratic nominee.

| Jump to first hitAfter Joe Biden's fourth-place finish in Iowa, some supporters fear that a damaging result in Tuesday's primary could hurt his financial resources to compete in later contests.MANCHESTER, N.H. -- His donors and supporters around the country are uneasy. His poll numbers in New Hampshire and nationally look increasingly shaky. He faces intense competition for moderate Democratic support and uncertainty about his viability in future contests.As New Hampshire votes on Tuesday in its presidential primary, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is confronting the possibility of a fourth- or even fifth-place finish, an outcome that could present existential political and financial threats to his once poll-topping presidential campaign and upend his bet on dominating later-voting, more diverse states like South Carolina.He has been banking on showing strength in the South and the West, but there are increasing signs of fluidity in the Democratic race in those regions.""Nothing is guaranteed,"" said Anthony Daniels, the state House minority leader in Alabama, a Super Tuesday state where Mr. Biden is hoping to have a muscular showing early next month. ""People want to know that whoever the candidate that is chosen can go the distance.""Mr. Biden has sought to keep expectations low in New Hampshire, going so far as to say in a debate on Friday night that he would ""probably take a hit"" in Tuesday's primary.And there are already signs that he is eager to move on.On Monday, Mr. Biden held a phone call with top South Carolina supporters in which he expressed excitement about visiting the state, which has a predominantly black electorate in Democratic primaries, and promised to be there soon, according to people on the call. They added that he and a senior adviser, Symone D. Sanders, had both suggested that the race for the nomination would be heavily influenced by the outcome of the Feb. 29 primary in South Carolina, a state that is more representative of the party and that stands in contrast to heavily white Iowa and New Hampshire.Yet a damaging loss in New Hampshire could put constraints on the resources Mr. Biden will have available to compete in subsequent contests. Several donors and other Democrats inclined toward Mr. Biden have privately expressed jitters about a fourth-place finish or worse in New Hampshire, and are closely watching the result. Another weak outcome, after Mr. Biden's fourth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, would be alarming, some have said.Mr. Biden entered 2020 with the smallest amount of cash on hand among the top four finishers in Iowa, but he insisted on Monday that he had enough money to fund his campaign.He said his campaign had been raising about $500,000 per day; the amount could not be independently verified. His campaign raised about $250,000 per day in the fourth quarter of 2019, the last period for which candidates have reported their fund-raising to the Federal Election Commission.If Mr. Biden is collecting $500,000 per day, he would still be lagging far behind Senator Bernie Sanders's fund-raising pace in the month of January, when Mr. Sanders raised roughly $800,000 per day. Mr. Biden would also be trailing what Hillary Clinton raised per day in February 2016.""They've struggled with money all year long and, you know, losses tend to slow down your money,"" said David Axelrod, the prominent Democratic strategist who served as a top adviser to Barack Obama. ""Even to do what they need to do in Nevada and South Carolina, they need to keep the money going. This has to be a huge concern.""At a breakfast with reporters on Monday hosted by Bloomberg News, Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager on Mr. Biden's team, said, ""We're absolutely going to have the resources that we need to compete on Super Tuesday."" She said she believed that Mr. Biden's perceived firewall in South Carolina would hold regardless of the New Hampshire primary results, pointing to his deep relationships with black Democrats there.Several candidates, including Mr. Sanders and the billionaire Tom Steyer, have been making concerted attempts to cut into his lead with black voters, efforts that could accelerate if Mr. Biden is viewed as even more vulnerable after Tuesday's vote.Ms. Bedingfield also previewed how the campaign might try to frame a disappointing loss in New Hampshire: by alluding to the state's demographics and warning the news media against writing anyone off before voters of color participate in a significant way.""Doing well means we compete here, we make our case to New Hampshire voters, and we continue on,"" she said. ""We continue on with our plan which is to ensure that diverse voices have their say before you guys call this race.""Mr. Biden has kept up the hunt for votes in New Hampshire in the final days before the primary. On Monday morning, he brought doughnuts to a school bus depot in Nashua and asked workers there to consider supporting him. ""Look me over, O.K.?"" Mr. Biden said after explaining that he had worked as a school bus driver in upstate New York when he was in law school.In a brief visit to a field office in Salem, Mr. Biden repeatedly projected an upbeat attitude, and almost immediately brought up South Carolina, which he suggested he would visit soon. ""I feel good,"" he told a small group of volunteers. ""It's feeling good,"" he said at another point. ""We're feeling good,"" he declared. ""It just feels good,"" he affirmed.""Keep the faith,"" he said as he concluded.Mr. Biden could surprise in New Hampshire: He has long made overtures to Republicans and independents, and undeclared voters are an important constituency in the primary. Some of his crowds have seemed livelier than the ones he drew in Iowa, where his events often felt gloomy and small. He has the support of prominent Democrats in the state from across the ideological spectrum and has continued to emphasize experience and portray himself as the best prepared and battle-tested Democrat to take on President Trump.But on the ground, signs of Mr. Biden's challenges are palpable. Over and over, voters who would seem to be natural Biden supporters -- moderate, opposed to proposals like ""Medicare for all,"" fond of the Obama era -- said they were drifting toward other candidates.Janice Dennis, 57, an Uber driver who takes care of her grandchildren, said she had once been a Biden supporter. She even had her daughter's commitment card for Mr. Biden in her car on Monday morning. But she was impressed by Senator Amy Klobuchar in Friday night's debate, she said, and worried about the energy level of Mr. Biden, 77, and his ability to take on Mr. Trump. She also suggested that he wasn't sufficiently forward-looking.""The main reason why I went toward Joe Biden is I felt he brought back the morality, the respect, to the office,"" said Ms. Dennis, of Tilton, N.H. But, she went on, ""I feel like he is giving himself a lot of credit for what Obama did. I don't feel like he's saying anything to me.""Warren Curtin of Litchfield, N.H., a retired letter carrier and a ticket-taker for the Boston Red Sox who attended an event for former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., in New Hampshire last week, said he wanted to build on the Affordable Care Act rather than put in place Medicare for all, and said he was staunchly opposed to the most progressive candidates in the race, Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren. He was exactly the kind of voter Mr. Biden is targeting in New Hampshire -- but Mr. Buttigieg, he said, was his first choice. He liked the young former mayor's ideas, he said. As for Mr. Biden, whom he saw a few weeks ago?""Low-key,"" said Mr. Curtin, 79. ""It wasn't a fired-up rally.""He questioned ""whether he can stand up to this guy, to Trump.""One potentially bright spot for Mr. Biden: Some of his supporters in later-voting states say that they are uninterested in following the leads set by the first two contests in the primary race.""Many South Carolinians have no orientation to Iowa except we know they grow corn,"" said State Senator Marlon Kimpson of South Carolina, who is supporting Mr. Biden. ""New Hampshire is even more foreign because at least in Iowa you've got big football teams. New Hampshire is a very small state, it's not representative at all. I don't even know that I would give the results there a footnote.""PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is confronting the possibility of a finish outside the top three in New Hampshire.

| Jump to first hitOn his first campaign stop for the Martin Luther King holiday in South Carolina, Joe Biden denounced the president in some of his strongest language yet.COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. paid a visit to Sunday services at Bethlehem Baptist Church, a large black congregation here, urging the crowd to fight back against hatred and condemning President Trump in some of his strongest language yet for heightening racial divisions in the country.""This president and his -- the Ku Klux Klans and the rest of them, they think they've beaten us again. But they have no idea -- we're just coming back,"" Mr. Biden told the congregation.""I thought you could defeat hate,"" he said. ""But hate only hides. It never fully goes away,"" he added, pointing to the outbreak of white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. ""And they asked the president what he thought, and he said, 'There were very fine people on both sides.""'Referring to what he called a historic inflection point -- when the police aimed fire hoses at civil rights activists in Birmingham, Ala., during the 1960s, galvanizing more of the country behind their movement -- Mr. Biden said that the country had reached a similar moment.His remarks to the 1,300-member congregation were among the strongest condemnations of the president to date in a campaign season in which a number of leading candidates have harshly criticized the president's posture on race and immigration.Mr. Biden also made the comments as he seeks to position himself as the inevitable Democratic challenger to Mr. Trump. One of his main rivals in the primary race, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has sought to more forcefully confront the former vice president, tangling with him in recent days over his record on Social Security.On Sunday, Mr. Sanders continued that line of attack, saying in New Hampshire that ""time and time again, Joe Biden has been clear in supporting cuts to Social Security.""Mr. Sanders, for his part, has been trying to move on from his sudden rift with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Asked at a separate event in New Hampshire on Sunday if gender remained an obstacle for female politicians, he responded ""yes,"" then quickly changed the subject to age.""The answer's yes, but I think everybody has their own sets of problems,"" he said. ""I'm 78 years of age. That's a problem. There are a lot of people who say, 'Well, I like Bernie, he's a nice guy, but he's 78 years of age.' So we have to argue, 'Please look at the totality of who I am.""'In South Carolina on Sunday, Mr. Biden left his seat at one point during the joyful services to hug and shake hands with church members, joining them in hymns and applause. ""It's contagious when you're in a black church,"" he quipped during his 12-minute remarks to the congregation, to much laughter.Mr. Biden was seated in the front pew with his sister, Valerie Biden Owens, and Representative Terri Sewell, Democrat of Alabama, who introduced Mr. Biden and spoke about her recent endorsement of him.He also picked up the endorsement of the Rev. Anthony A. McCallum, the congregation's pastor, who compared him to former President Barack Obama. ""Let's get behind this soldier,"" Pastor McCallum told his congregation. ""Someone who could touch all people, not just the 1 percent, but to the common folk.""It was the first event of a Martin Luther King's Birthday weekend visit here in South Carolina by Mr. Biden, who is aiming to cement his support in the early primary state, where polls six weeks before the election show he is the strong front-runner, at least partly on the strength of his association with Mr. Obama.Mr. Biden, who stayed after the service for more than an hour to talk with members of the congregation, invoked the name ""Barack"" twice during his remarks.On Monday, he is expected to join seven of his 2020 Democratic rivals in a King Day rally at the state Capitol, an annual event that began 20 years ago and has become practically mandatory for Democratic presidential candidates during election years as they try to win over black voters.Other candidates also attended church services here in Columbia on Sunday morning. The only African-American candidate remaining in the race, Deval Patrick, the former Massachusetts governor, was offering remarks at nearby Bethel African Methodist Episcopal.Both men were expected to attend a breakfast sponsored by the Urban League on Monday morning.Campaigning on Sunday in Tulsa, Okla., the site of what is regarded as the single worst massacre of black citizens by their white counterparts in history, Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, recalled the slaughter of hundreds of African-Americans by white mobs in that city as well as in East St. Louis, Ill.; Elaine, Ark.; and Rosewood, Fla.""In just that short period, from 1917 to 1923, more than 1,000 black Americans were killed by white mobs in cities and towns all across the country,"" said Mr. Bloomberg, one of the few candidates who were not scheduled to appear this weekend in South Carolina as he pursues an unusual campaign strategy with a national focus. ""But the truth is: What happened during that period was part of a continuum of violence that black Americans faced even after the end of slavery -- violence that denied them their lives, their liberty and their pursuit of happiness.""Mr. Biden arrived in South Carolina on Sunday morning and attended an oyster roast later in the day. A busload of surrogate campaigners had arrived earlier this past week, crisscrossing the state on a bus in what was called his ""Soul of the Nation Tour.""Speaking to predominantly black audiences at church social halls as well as in beauty shops and barber shops, the group of Biden surrogates included Randall Woodfin, the mayor of Birmingham, Ala.; Sean Patrick Thomas, an actor who grew up in Mr. Biden's home state, Delaware; and Symone Sanders, a former spokeswoman for Mr. Sanders during his 2016 campaign who has become a top adviser to Mr. Biden.While those attending the events in South Carolina were mostly supportive of Mr. Biden, at least two people raised questions about his role as a senator in helping write a 1994 crime bill that was regarded by many crime experts as contributing to the mass incarceration of black men.In his church remarks, Mr. Biden recalled meeting clients near the Amtrak station in Wilmington, Del., when he was a young public defender and later standing at the same station for his inauguration as vice president in January 2009.Forty years later, Mr. Biden said, ""I was standing on that same platform waiting for a black man to come down on a train 27 miles from Philadelphia to pick this white boy up and go 127 miles down to Washington to be sworn in as president and vice president of the United States.""Choking up when he mentioned his deceased son, Beau Biden, Mr. Biden said that on that day, he told his children that things had changed.Mr. Biden also invoked Dr. King's dream that all men are created equal. ""Dr. King didn't give up on the dream, and I'm asking you all, don't give up on it,"" he added. ""We can defeat this moment of hate.""Mr. Biden did not say anything at the church about his back-and-forth a day earlier with Mr. Sanders over Social Security. But Mr. Sanders returned to it during remarks with reporters on Sunday in Conway, N.H., where he leveled a broad critique of Mr. Biden's record.""If you run for office, you defend your record,"" Mr. Sanders said. Characterizing Mr. Biden's Senate votes authorizing military action in Iraq and on other issues, he said: ""Joe voted for the war in Iraq. I vigorously opposed it. Joe voted for a bankruptcy bill, which I think has been very harmful to working families. I vigorously opposed it. Joe voted for a number of trade agreements,"" like the North American Free Trade Agreement, which Mr. Sanders said undercut good jobs in the United States.""And on the issue of Social Security, time and time again, Joe Biden has been clear in supporting cuts to Social Security,"" Mr. Sanders argued, citing Mr. Biden's support for a balanced-budget amendment in the 1990s that the Vermont senator said would have harmed the program.And in Concord, N.H., on Sunday, Mr. Sanders addressed questions about gender during a New Hampshire Public Radio forum, noting that age and other factors could also sway voters' decisions.""If you're looking at Buttigieg, he's a young guy, people will say, 'Well, he's too young to be president,""' Mr. Sanders said, referring to Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind. ""'Look at this one, she's a woman.""'""So everybody brings some negatives, if you like,"" he went on. ""I would just hope, very much, that the American people look at the totality of a candidate, not at their gender, not at their sexuality, not at their age, but at everything. Nobody is perfect. There ain't no perfect candidate out there.""Patrick Healy contributed reporting from New York.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitMs. Harris, who ended her own presidential campaign in December, is the latest in a parade of prominent Democrats to throw their support behind Mr. Biden.Senator Kamala Harris of California endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for president on Sunday, becoming the latest of his formal rivals for the Democratic nomination to get behind his presidential bid.""I have decided that I am with great enthusiasm going to endorse Joe Biden for president of the United States,"" Ms. Harris said in a video posted on Twitter. ""I believe in Joe. I really believe in him, and I have known him for a long time.""In a tweet, Mr. Biden expressed gratitude and invoked his late son, Beau Biden, who served as Delaware's attorney general when Ms. Harris held that post in California: ""Kamala -- You've spent your whole career fighting for folks who've been written off and left behind -- and no small part of that alongside Beau. From our family: thank you.""Ms. Harris is certain to draw speculation as a potential running mate for Mr. Biden.Ms. Harris made her endorsement after the primary race narrowed to what is effectively a two-person race between Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Moderate-leaning Democrats have rapidly coalesced behind Mr. Biden, whose campaign has been rolling out new endorsements seemingly nonstop in recent days.In a written statement about her endorsement, Ms. Harris noted the absence of a top female candidate in the primary. ""Like many women, I watched with sadness as women exited the race one by one,"" she said, adding that ""we find ourselves without any woman on a path to be the Democratic nominee for president.""""This is something we must reckon with and it is something I will have more to say about in the future,"" Ms. Harris said. ""But we must rise to unite the party and country behind a candidate who reflects the decency and dignity of the American people and who can ultimately defeat Donald Trump.""Ms. Harris announced her endorsement five days after Super Tuesday, when Mr. Biden captured 10 of 14 states, and ahead of another round of contests on Tuesday in six states, including Michigan. Ms. Harris will join Mr. Biden at a rally in Detroit on Monday night.Ms. Harris ended her presidential bid in December, two months before the Iowa caucuses. Now, she is following several of her former rivals for the presidential nomination in getting behind Mr. Biden. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York left the race last week and endorsed the former vice president. Former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas also backed Mr. Biden last week.Mr. Sanders pointed on Sunday to Ms. Klobuchar's and Mr. Buttigieg's decisions to drop out as the reason he lost several key states to Mr. Biden on Super Tuesday.""The establishment put a great deal of pressure on Pete Buttigieg, on Amy Klobuchar, who ran really aggressive campaigns,"" he told Chuck Todd on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""If they had not withdrawn from the race before Super Tuesday, which is kind of a surprise to a lot of people, I suspect we would have won in Minnesota, we would have won in Maine, we would have won in Massachusetts.""For Ms. Harris, the decision to endorse Mr. Biden is particularly striking, because one of the biggest moments of her campaign was a forceful debate-stage exchange with him.""It was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country,"" she said in June during the first Democratic debate.""And it was not only that, but you also worked with them to oppose busing,"" she added. ""And, you know, there was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools, and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me.""The exchange gave her a lift in the polls and a temporary burst of momentum that she was not able to sustain. At a fund-raiser on Friday, Mr. Biden's wife, Jill Biden, described Ms. Harris's attack at the debate as a ""punch to the gut.""Some of Ms. Harris's advisers were privately frustrated that she endorsed Mr. Biden after California voted on Super Tuesday and when it was already clear that he had become the front-runner. Some were hoping in January that she would rally to Mr. Biden at a point when her endorsement would have been more valuable -- and more politically daring.An aide to Ms. Harris, trying to pre-empt questions about why she waited until after several other primary contenders had weighed in, said the senator wanted to give space to Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Ms. Warren ended her campaign on Thursday.Ms. Harris is facing re-election in 2022 and her allies made clear earlier this year that she did not want to alienate the left in California. Mr. Biden's advisers had hoped she would have endorsed him sooner and have made little attempt to mask their irritation at her monthslong indecision.But the delay will not necessarily diminish her chances of being on the ticket should Mr. Biden become the nominee. The former vice president has a famously short memory for slights and, despite their bitter clash on the debate stage, he is fond of Ms. Harris.Maggie Astor contributed reporting.PhotographSenator Kamala Harris in January.

| Jump to first hit""Unfortunately, this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,"" Mr. Biden said. In his own address, Mr. Sanders said the coronavirus crisis was ""on the scale of major war.""WILMINGTON, Del. -- Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday delivered a forceful rebuke of President Trump's leadership amid the coronavirus crisis, seeking to project steadiness and resolve from his perch as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.In his own speech about the pandemic, Senator Bernie Sanders, Mr. Biden's main rival, also flamed the president's response. He provided a long list of policy proposals aimed in particular at helping low-income and working-class families, providing a glimpse of the extraordinary measures he might take if he were president.""The crisis we face from the coronavirus is on a scale of a major war,"" he said at a news conference in Burlington, Vt. ""And we must act accordingly.""Taken together, the candidates' blistering denunciations of the president's handling of the outbreak signaled that the coronavirus has fully overtaken the 2020 race, forcing the candidates to cancel events and propose new ways of campaigning, putting fresh political pressure on Mr. Trump, and placing matters of public health and trust at the forefront of the contest.Mr. Biden, the former vice president, spoke Thursday afternoon from the Hotel du Pont in Wilmington, Del., about the grave challenges the country faces, and he detailed his ideas for managing the outbreak. He also aimed to draw sharp contrasts with Mr. Trump a day after the president addressed the nation from the Oval Office, establishing a preview of what Mr. Biden hopes will be a general election matchup.""Unfortunately, this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,"" Mr. Biden said, speaking from the hotel where he announced his 1972 bid for the Senate. ""Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president fueled by adversarial relationship with the truth that he continues to have.""This moment of national anxiety, some of Mr. Biden's allies believe, throws into sharp relief the choice Americans would face in a general-election matchup between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump, and the stakes of that contest. Mr. Biden has been seeking to frame the race as a two-person contest against the president, in ways overt and subtle, even as he continues a primary battle with Mr. Sanders.In his remarks, Mr. Biden offered his own plan for combating the virus, with proposals that included rapidly and vastly expanding testing -- tests, he said, should be available at no charge -- moving aggressively to boost hospital capacity and supporting an accelerated push for a vaccine that he said should be ""again, free of charge."" And he argued that ""the administration's failure on testing is colossal.""""We are not ready yet, and the clock is ticking,"" he warned.He also described plans to help those who are struggling financially at a time of economic peril, appeared dismissive of corporate tax subsidies and said it was a ""national disgrace that millions of our fellow citizens don't have a single day of paid sick leave.""Mr. Sanders, for his part, urged the president to declare the pandemic a national emergency, and encouraged the public and private sectors to work together to combat the virus and its effects. Like Mr. Biden, he outlined a list of recommendations to deal with the pandemic, including establishing national and state information hotlines, making all treatment ""free of charge,"" providing ""emergency unemployment assistance"" to those who lose their jobs, and expanding the Meals on Wheels and school lunch programs and SNAP ""so that no one goes hungry during this crisis."" He also urged a ""moratorium on evictions, on foreclosures and on utility shut offs.""Perhaps above all, he used the health crisis as another opportunity to call for his signature health care plan, ""Medicare for all.""""Our country is at a severe disadvantage compared to every other major country on earth because we do not guarantee health care to all people as a right,"" he said.His remarks amounted to a vigorous critique of Mr. Trump, cloaked in the kind of sweeping, uncompromising proposals that have long defined his democratic socialist agenda. He left the news conference without taking questions.Mr. Biden's appearance here in Delaware came as his campaign underwent another shake-up after an initial shuffling last month. He brought on a new campaign manager as his team works to build out what has been an underfunded operation with major organizational challenges -- despite a flurry of primary victories over the past two weeks.Amid those successes, Mr. Biden has further intensified his focus on Mr. Trump, acting as if the general election were already underway. On Wednesday, his team announced the formation of a ""Public Health Advisory Committee"" studded with prominent health leaders and alumni of former President Barack Obama's administration -- a rollout that seemed intended to conjure the actions a president might take.Members included Vivek Murthy, a former surgeon general; Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a prominent oncologist and a vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania; and Lisa Monaco, who served as a homeland security and counterterrorism adviser to Mr. Obama. And when he spoke on Thursday, he did so against a backdrop of American flags, reading from teleprompters to the click of cameras and beginning with a nod to his ""fellow Americans,"" a setting reminiscent of a White House address.""No president can promise to prevent future outbreaks,"" he said. ""But I can promise you this. When I'm president, we will be better prepared, respond better and recover better. We'll lead with science. We'll listen to the experts. We'll heed their advice. And we'll build American leadership and rebuild it to rally the world to meet the global threats.""Throughout his remarks, Mr. Biden nodded -- as he often does -- to what he cast as the resiliency and potential of the American people.Mr. Biden, who is 77, did not stop to take shouted questions about his own health.He has previously expressed shock and frustration at Mr. Trump's past skeptical remarks about the severity of the virus, and has sketched out other steps he would take as president to fight it, noting his work as vice president in combating Ebola. Ron Klain, who was Mr. Obama's Ebola ""czar,"" is a top Biden adviser.Mr. Trump's own somber address Wednesday night, in which he announced he was blocking most travel from continental Europe and promised new aid for workers and businesses, was a break from his previous efforts to play down the effects of the outbreak. But he also mischaracterized some of his administration's new travel policies and described the threat as a ""foreign virus,"" though Americans are infected along with many in other countries.The Trump campaign quickly issued a response to Mr. Biden's remarks on Thursday. ""In times like this, America needs leadership and Biden has shown none,"" said Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman. ""President Trump acted early and decisively and has put the United States on stronger footing than other nations. His every move has been aimed at keeping Americans safe, while Joe Biden has sought to capitalize politically and stoke citizens' fears.""As for Mr. Sanders, Mr. Murtaugh said in another statement, ""He's just another Democrat candidate for president trying to score political points by recklessly provoking anxiety and fear."" He also argued that the proposal from Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator -- who supports a sweeping single-payer system -- would ""drive doctors and other medical workers away from the profession, leaving America woefully unprepared for public health emergencies.""Even as the candidates sought to project images of leadership, they are still politicians who face another debate and another round of primary elections in the coming days, and they are scrambling to adjust to a presidential contest now unfolding amid a pandemic.In one sign of the major changes the virus is forcing on the presidential race, Mr. Biden's team on Wednesday announced that previously scheduled campaign events in Chicago and Miami would be transformed into ""virtual events"" ahead of next Tuesday's primaries in Illinois, Florida and several other large, delegate-rich states. And Mr. Biden -- whose famously tactile campaigning style is off-putting to some and delights others -- acknowledged the need for ""radical changes in our personal behaviors"" that could affect ""deeply ingrained behavior like handshakes and hugs.""An internal campaign memo released Thursday instructed all staff members to begin working from home starting on Saturday, announced the closing of all offices to the public and said that the campaign would ""hold smaller events like roundtables, house parties, and press statements, as well as virtual events."" Fund-raisers, the memo said, would ""become virtual fund-raisers indefinitely.""Mr. Sanders likewise canceled a rally in Cleveland on Tuesday, and his campaign has not scheduled any new public events. Jane Sanders, Mr. Sanders's wife, told reporters on Thursday after he concluded his remarks that he would return to the Senate after the debate, and that he would stay in Washington.Still, surrogates are continuing to make the rounds in key upcoming contests, and volunteers may be encouraged to head to states like Illinois and Georgia to help with activities like door-knocking, according to Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina state senator and a Biden supporter who has been in touch with the campaign.The remarks on Thursday were not the first time Mr. Biden has sought to assume the mantle of a sober, statesmanlike leader through a highly produced speech: In January, he delivered a sharp rebuke of Mr. Trump's stewardship of tensions with Iran against a backdrop that appeared reminiscent of the White House briefing room.Yet that issue faded from the national forefront, and Mr. Biden went on to a fourth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses a few weeks later as he competed against what was, at the time, a crowded and competitive Democratic field.He entered this speech, however, having amassed a big delegate advantage, and facing just one Democratic opponent, Mr. Sanders.Katie Glueck reported from Wilmington, Del., and Sydney Ember from Burlington, Vt.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitWhy there's a wide split in recent surveys in the state.With one week to go until the Iowa caucuses, Joe Biden finds himself in a seemingly unimaginable position: needing to mobilize older voters who are usually the most consistent voters.This helps explain why recent polls diverge so much on Mr. Biden's standing in Iowa.He trailed in the New York Times/Siena College poll of Iowa caucusgoers released Saturday. Yet he very well might have led a Times/Siena poll of a hypothetical Iowa primary, because he had a substantial advantage among Democrats in the survey who regularly turn out in primary elections.But the Iowa race is a caucus, not a primary. And while analysts know very little about the nature of caucus electorates, there is reason to think that caucuses attract very different kinds of voters.On the one hand, many regular voters don't participate in caucuses. One-third of people who participated in a recent Iowa Democratic primary -- usually considered all but certain voters -- said they weren't likely to caucus, and these voters backed Mr. Biden by 11 points in the Times/Siena poll. The large number of Democratic primary voters who seem uninterested in attending the Iowa caucuses is all the more surprising given that recent Iowa primary elections for Senate, House, governor or local offices were not particularly competitive and certainly did not attract national attention.On the other hand, a presidential caucus -- and perhaps especially Bernie Sanders -- draws a large number of voters to the polls who do not vote regularly. As a result, it was Mr. Sanders who led the Times/Siena poll -- by seven points -- despite weakness among regular and consistent voters. His supporters may not vote so often, but he led among those who said they had caucused before, including in 2016. Most important, he led among those who said they would show up next week, and therefore led the poll.This mismatch -- between the voters who say they will participate in a caucus, and the voters who typically show up in primaries -- may be at the heart of the wide split in recent Iowa polls.Many pollsters rely, in some way, on past vote history to conduct their surveys. Some pollsters use it to define which voters could be selected to participate in a survey, like a recent Monmouth University poll that selected registered Democrats or independents who turned out in 2018 or in a recent primary, or who registered since 2018. A Neighborhood Research and Media poll was even more limited in its model for who was likely to vote: voters who turned out in either the 2016 or 2018 primary. These polls in Iowa showed Mr. Biden with the lead, and the Times/Siena poll also found Mr. Biden tied or ahead among these groups.The Times/Siena poll does not use past vote history to define the universe of voters eligible to participate in the caucus poll. Neither do the Ann Selzer/CNN/Des Moines Register or CBS/YouGov polls, which also show Mr. Sanders in the lead.The question is whether it is reasonable to assume that the caucus electorate is largely confined to these groups of highly regular voters. It's an understandable assumption: Caucuses are very low-turnout elections, and so one might assume they are mainly composed of the most reliable voters. One might even note that the 2018 midterm primaries in Iowa had about the same number of voters as the 2016 Democratic presidential caucus, and suppose they're probably the same people as well.If that assumption is right, the Times/Siena poll and others showing Mr. Sanders in the lead include many irregular young voters with little chance of actually showing up. Over all, voters over age 65 made up 42 percent of the Iowa primary electorate in 2018, compared with 24 percent in the Times/Siena poll. And in fairness, it is hard to know with certainty either way, given the lack of authoritative public data on the composition of caucus electorates in Iowa or elsewhere.But there is reason to think caucus electorates are fundamentally different from primaries or even typical elections.Just consider the actual results of recent caucuses. In both Democratic and Republican contests, they are plainly different from the results of primaries in demographically similar areas, or even in the same states. They tend to favor outsider, activist-backed candidates, including Mr. Sanders. The only plausible explanation for the difference is that low-turnout caucuses tend to attract the sort of highly informed political activists who are passionate enough to sit through a laborious, multi-hour, public caucus and favor ideologically consistent candidates.One reason for the difference seems to be age. Caucus electorates appear to be fairly young, and primary electorates fairly or even very old. This shouldn't be a huge surprise. The kinds of Democrats who have excelled in caucuses in recent years, like Mr. Sanders and Barack Obama, were backed overwhelmingly by younger voters. The young represented a large share of the caucus electorates in the 2004, 2008 and 2016 entrance polls -- the only publicly available data on the composition of the caucus electorate, even if it's of uncertain quality.The results of the Times/Siena poll of Iowa also indicate that past caucusgoers are quite different from past primary voters -- at least if you believe our respondents, since we can't prove they actually participated.Past caucusgoers back Mr. Sanders by four points, even as past primary voters support Mr. Biden. Voters who say they participated in the 2016 Democratic caucus, specifically, back Mr. Sanders by nine points; he's at 25 percent and Pete Buttigieg at 16 percent. These 2016 caucusgoers say they voted for Hillary Clinton over Mr. Sanders, 49 percent to 46 percent, with 3 percent for Martin O'Malley -- very close to the actual result, perhaps lending credibility to the overall Times/Siena finding.The poll indicates that caucusgoers are poised to behave differently from the broader electorate yet again in 2020. The Democrats who say they will caucus back Mr. Sanders; those who say they won't attend a caucus back Mr. Biden by a six-point margin.Mr. Biden's turnout disadvantage persists even among the voters who said they would caucus. In a second likely-voter question -- which asks Democratic caucusgoers to evaluate their likelihood of voting -- Mr. Biden does worst among the voters who say they're ""almost certain"" to vote, and falls to just 15 percent of the vote. On the other hand, he is at 30 percent among those who said they would caucus but specified in the follow-up question that they were ""somewhat"" or ""less likely"" to caucus.In the Times/Siena poll, younger voters are likelier than older voters to say they will participate in the Democratic caucus. Among registered Democrats, 53 percent of those 18 to 29 said they were ""almost certain"" or ""very likely"" to caucus, compared with 35 percent over age 65. It's not because this is just a group of exceptionally high-turnout young people: 58 percent of these same 18-to-29-year-old Democrats turned out in 2018, according to data from the L2 voter file, while 85 percent of the respondents over age 65 were voters in 2018.Self-reported vote intention is far from perfect; people can mislead pollsters, intentionally or unintentionally. But the finding should be taken seriously. Of the more than 100 pre-election Times/Siena surveys in the last four years, the two Iowa caucus polls stand out as the two cases where self-reported turnout among young voters significantly outpaced that of older voters, and it is not a close call. In the only two other cases where self-reported youth turnout was higher, the samples of young voters were far smaller, and so was the difference.Of course, there's no guarantee that youth turnout will be so high. But for Mr. Sanders, it might not need to be. He would have led the Times/Siena poll even without any 18-to-29-year-old voters at all. His strength among older voters is enhanced in a caucus setting as well, because even older caucusgoers tend to be more liberal than older Democrats who say they intend to stay home.If Mr. Biden can mobilize older, regular voters over the next week, it might be a different story.PhotographLining up to see Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitO.K., maybe there will be a clear winner on Monday night. But let me explain what else might happen.AMES, Iowa -- Driving through the snowy cornfields of Iowa today, I couldn't stop dreaming about next Tuesday, the day after the Iowa caucuses. After more than a year of campaign entrances and exits, debates and dance moves, we'll finally get some real clarity about this crowded Democratic primary race.People will have voted! There will be winners! And losers!Or not.Dear readers, it's time for a talk.I know we've spent an awful lot of time discussing the Iowa caucuses. But like a mom explaining how, exactly, your little sister got here, I might have been glossing over some of the details.Like, there could be multiple winners.I know, I know. Presidential campaigns aren't peewee soccer. There are no participation trophies.But when it comes to this year's Iowa caucuses, there might as well be. That's because changes in the caucus rules intended to increase transparency will give us a lot more information -- and there will be more opportunities for candidates to declare victory.Under the new rules, the Iowa Democratic Party will report more than one set of results. For the first time, we'll see the vote totals from the first round of voting at the caucuses, when everyone shows up.  We'll also see the final vote totals after ""realignment,"" when supporters of the weaker candidates may be forced to switch sides and back stronger ones. (Here's an explanation of how that works and why second choices are so important.)  And we'll see an estimate of the total delegates each candidate won to the state convention.  For the first time, we'll see the vote totals from the first round of voting at the caucuses, when everyone shows up.We'll also see the final vote totals after ""realignment,"" when supporters of the weaker candidates may be forced to switch sides and back stronger ones. (Here's an explanation of how that works and why second choices are so important.)And we'll see an estimate of the total delegates each candidate won to the state convention.This is a significant change. In past years, the state party reported one number, the delegate total.The Associated Press, the media barometer for campaign race calling, said this month that it would call a winner based on that last measure -- the ""state delegate equivalents"" -- because delegates are used to decide the eventual winner of the nomination.But for the campaigns, the delegate totals aren't really the point when it comes to Iowa. The state awards only 41 of the 3,979 pledged delegates to the national convention. (California, by comparison, awards 415.)But Iowa can give a candidate something more important than delegates.Here's how Pete Buttigieg put it, as he tried to persuade a group of voters in Jefferson to come out and caucus for him on Monday night.""What happens on Monday will set the tone for the entire rest of the election,"" he told voters gathered in the back of a furniture store. ""What happens on Monday will reverberate throughout the country.""The name of the game is beating expectations, creating the kind of momentum that can propel a candidate into New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina and beyond with a burst of enthusiasm.For Amy Klobuchar, who's been languishing in fifth place in the Iowa polls, that might mean placing third in delegates. For Elizabeth Warren, who's been sliding behind Bernie Sanders in recent polls, it might mean besting her liberal rival in raw votes.So, now imagine this scenario, one strategists say is not an impossibility, given how close recent polls have shown the race to be: Mr. Sanders wins the raw vote total, Joe Biden wins the delegate count and Mr. Buttigieg wins the rural counties.Aides are already signaling that all three would come out of Iowa declaring victory.Mr. Sanders could argue he has the most support, at least when it comes to sheer numbers of voters. Mr. Buttigieg might say he can win the kinds of swing counties that voted for Donald Trump in 2016 and flipped back to Democrats two years later, making him the strongest general election contender. And Mr. Biden could argue he won on the metric that will eventually decide the nomination.We know that many Democratic voters are desperate to find their standard-bearer so they can turn their attention to beating Mr. Trump. But that kind of mixed result in Iowa would leave them with no more clarity than they have right now.Did you recently pay off your student loans? We want to hear from youAre you still paying off your student debt? Are you hoping the next president will erase your loans? Or do you find that proposal infuriating? We want to hear from people who paid off their student loans in the past year, or from those who are still making payments. Share your thoughts at this link.Our Buttigieg story hits a nerveIt's well established by now that the most disliked Democratic candidate among the other presidential campaigns is Pete Buttigieg.So it was no surprise that there was some schadenfreude among Mr. Buttigieg's rivals over an article we published Tuesday that explored grievances held by staff members of color at the Buttigieg campaign headquarters.It found a receptive audience in Sawyer Hackett, an aide to Julián Castro, the former housing secretary who dropped out of the race and is now a full-time surrogate for Elizabeth Warren.""If you're an Iowan who cares about our nominee's ability to beat Trump, ask yourself: If a candidate not only turns off Black and Brown voters (our most loyal voters), but also their own staff, can they beat Trump?"" Mr. Hackett wrote in a tweet, one of a few he posted about the article.The article also zipped around text groups of rival campaign staff members, particularly among people of color, according to other campaign aides.Inside the Buttigieg campaign headquarters, a bunker mentality took hold. There was a morning staff call Tuesday in which the article was discussed, but Mr. Buttigieg didn't call in. Asked in Ottumwa, Iowa, if he had addressed the issues with his staff, Mr. Buttigieg dodged the question.Rodericka Applewhaite, who works on Mr. Buttigieg's rapid response team, posted a heartfelt Twitter thread about race and the campaign.""We will continue to approach fostering inclusion with the ongoing deliberation it deserves,"" she wrote. ""We will continue to live by our Rules of the Road of Belonging, Respect, Responsibility, and Truth.""But by Wednesday, the questions for Mr. Buttigieg from reporters at his campaign stop in Ames had moved on to Middle East policy. Five days from now, Iowa's caucusgoers will render their judgment....

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump appeared eager to bask in the warm reception of a conservative audience, who spent the conference listening to speakers road-testing messages for his re-election campaign.WASHINGTON -- President Trump crouched underneath his microphone on Saturday, mimicking the height of Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City who is running for president.Mr. Trump pointed at the ceiling above him, marveling at all of his own success. ""Maybe it's right there, right?"" he said. ""Thank you. Thank you, God.""Throughout an animated 90-minute speech in front of conservative activists at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, a confident Mr. Trump attacked his rivals in nasty terms while gloating about and inflating his own achievements.He even exited the stage by embracing the American flag in both of his arms, mouthing the words ""I love you"" and planting a kiss on the stars and stripes.Mr. Trump talked up what he said were his administration's successes: the appointment of conservative judges, the killing of terrorists, tax cuts and the passage of trade deals. But he appeared most animated when riffing about the Democratic presidential field, on the same day that voters in South Carolina headed to the polls to vote in the first primary where a majority-black electorate is set to weigh in.Mr. Bloomberg, whose mammoth spending has privately concerned Mr. Trump, ""writes checks like a drunken sailor,"" the president said, ribbing the former mayor for spending more than half a billion dollars on a presidential bid that Mr. Trump predicted would not make it past Super Tuesday on March 3.""That was probably the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates,"" he said of Mr. Bloomberg's debut this month on the debate stage, which was widely viewed as a bubble-bursting showing for a potential dark horse candidate. ""It just shows you, you can't buy an election. You got to bring the goods a little bit, too.""Handicapping the Democratic primary, Mr. Trump said that he expected to face off against Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, or former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.""Everyone knows he's not a communist,"" he said of Mr. Biden. ""With Bernie, there's a real question about that."" But Mr. Trump said his concern about Mr. Biden was his mental acuity.""The difference is Joe's not going to be running the government,"" he said. ""He's just going to be sitting in a home some place.""Mr. Trump, who arrived late at CPAC after holding a last-minute news conference at the White House to announce expanded travel restrictions related to the spread of the coronavirus, mentioned the outbreak only in passing.Congratulating himself on his administration's response, Mr. Trump said the decision to impose early travel restrictions ""has been now given very good grades, like an A +++."" And he promised a nonpartisan response to the coronavirus, even as he attacked Democrats.""The extreme fringes called us racists,"" he said. ""They wanted to let infected people pour into our country.""On Friday, Mr. Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, addressed the same audience at CPAC, and accused journalists of hyping the coronavirus because ""they think this will bring down the president -- that's what this is all about.""On Saturday afternoon, however, Mr. Trump appeared less interested in discussing the outbreak that has been the first public health crisis of his presidency. Instead, he was eager to bask in the warm reception of the conservative audience, who spent the past four days listening to a procession of speakers road-testing messages for Mr. Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.He lauded his decision to fire James B. Comey as the F.B.I. director. ""That was a great firing,"" he said.He claimed that even Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, the lone Republican to vote to impeach Mr. Trump on one article, abuse of power, had split the baby. ""Even him, I got half a vote,"" he said. ""He couldn't do it all. He wanted to get nice free publicity for himself.""Mr. Trump also falsely characterized the 2017 tax cut as the ""largest"" in history (several others outrank it), and claimed that he had eliminated the estate tax. In reality, the 2017 law increased the threshold but the tax still exists.Mr. Trump has been a regular speaker at CPAC for years, and has credited the organization for giving him a platform long before he officially declared his run for president. In 2015, however, when he was still a New York businessman, the crowd booed him when he proposed fighting ISIS with troops on the ground in the Middle East.But for the past four years, he has been the main attraction and headliner of the conference, which has been molded in his image. Last year, Mr. Trump delivered the longest speech of his presidency from the CPAC stage, clocking in at two hours five minutes. (That year, he opened, rather than closed, with a flag hug.)In an election year, his address was more in line with the staple speeches he has been giving at campaign rallies, and it set no records for length.But he appeared particularly awed by his own abilities to keep the spotlight on himself.""I can get elected twice over the wall, can you believe this,"" he told the crowd, while claiming, falsely, that Mexico was paying for the construction of a wall along the southern border.""Yes they are, they are paying for it,"" he said, adding, without explaining himself, ""oh, they're going to die when I put in what I'm going to do.""Mr. Trump also claimed he was not bothered that Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist whom Time named its person of the year, occupied a magazine cover he has long coveted, even though he chose to bring up an issue that was published over two months ago. ""The whole world revolves around this person,"" he said, referring to himself. ""Every story is Trump or Trump-related.""Linda Qiu contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographThose at CPAC have spent four days listening to speakers road-testing messages for President Trump's re-election campaign.

| Jump to first hitBoth men have seemed energized by a renewed debate on war and peace, but no two candidates better illustrate the divisions among Democrats about what American leadership abroad should look like.DECORAH, Iowa -- Hours after an American drone strike killed Iran's top military commander, Joseph R. Biden Jr. stood in a barnlike building in Independence, Iowa, thundering about the importance of electing an experienced president as America faces tumult abroad -- and ""maybe, God forbid,"" war.About 70 miles away, Senator Bernie Sanders was just as passionate as he denounced military spending and encouraged international diplomacy.""Maybe what we should be doing is figuring out how as a planet we work together instead of going to war with each other,"" Mr. Sanders told the crowd on Friday inside a building on the Winneshiek County fairgrounds. Earlier in the day, he emphasized the need to ""get our priorities right"" by investing in issues at home rather than on military action abroad.Amid signs that both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have found their footing in Iowa after months of being overshadowed here, they are now aggressively seizing on the escalating tensions with Iran to press their starkly divergent cases for the presidency as they compete for an overlapping slice of the electorate.Both men seemed newly energized on the campaign trail, treating the Iran confrontation as a clarifying political moment, as well as a tailor-made opportunity to showcase their long records on international affairs. And yet no two candidates better illustrate the sharp divisions in the Democratic Party about what American leadership abroad should look like.Mr. Biden, the former vice president, has focused on highlighting his decades-long résumé in foreign policy and his relationships overseas, casting himself as the candidate best prepared to assume the commander-in-chief title ""on Day 1.""In contrast, Mr. Sanders is emphasizing his long-held aversion to war while steadfastly promoting a domestic political agenda for America's working class.The rising tensions with Iran have also afforded Mr. Sanders a fresh opportunity to highlight his diplomacy-centered vision for foreign policy -- and in particular his opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a stance that underscores his contrast with Mr. Biden, who voted to authorize that war.""Joe Biden has prided himself on foreign policy experience for the last several decades,"" said Sean Bagniewski, the Democratic chairman in Polk County. ""I've heard Iowans say they think this election may focus more on foreign policy than many of us expected and that he's now their guy.""He added, ""On the flip side, Bernie was one of the few Democrats to vote against the war in Iraq. I've heard folks say that reinforces their decision to support someone who they think had been right all along.""The competition to gain the upper hand on national security played out in vivid relief on the campaign trail over the weekend, as tensions escalated between the two candidates over their judgment on matters of war and peace. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders both delivered forceful remarks in several of the same towns and cities in eastern Iowa, offering sharpened messages about America's role in the world and their visions of presidential leadership.In temperament, ideology and style on the campaign trail, the gregarious, gaffe-prone, relatively moderate Mr. Biden and the disciplined, democratic socialist Mr. Sanders could not be more different. Yet polling and interviews on the ground demonstrate that they have some overlapping appeal here, especially with the white, working-class voters who are skeptical of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., the other two front-runners in Iowa who have done well with college-educated voters.Less than one month before the caucuses, as Ms. Warren struggles to regain her momentum in the state, Mr. Biden is drawing notably more energized crowds -- even if they are often smaller than those of his chief rivals -- and attendees at his events frequently say that he makes them feel safe. Mr. Sanders, lifted by his loyal supporters, has displayed enduring political strength despite having a heart attack in October.Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders both appear to be ""doing fairly well"" in Dubuque, a heavily Catholic, blue-collar city along the Mississippi River where they campaigned this past week, said Steven Drahozal, the Democratic chairman of Dubuque County.""This is the type of community, I think, that actually, interestingly, plays well to both of them,"" Mr. Drahozal said. Mr. Biden, a Catholic, has longstanding relationships in the city, but Mr. Drahozal added that Dubuque also had a ""very vocal, very active, very progressive community that is very supportive of Senator Sanders.""Mr. Sanders views his consistent diplomacy-over-conflict stance -- dating to his opposition to the Vietnam War and his anti-interventionist foreign policy as mayor of Burlington, Vt. -- as an advantage with working-class Americans who are frustrated with the country's involvement in costly and distant wars.""I know that it is rarely the children of the billionaire class who face the agony of reckless foreign policy -- it is the children of working families,"" he said on Friday, reading from prepared remarks at an event in Anamosa.Aides to Mr. Sanders view him as well positioned against Mr. Biden -- who in many ways embodies the centrist Washington establishment Mr. Sanders dislikes -- and they have urged him for months to go after the former vice president more directly. With foreign affairs, Mr. Sanders's campaign sees an opportunity not just to call attention to the senator's consistent resistance to war but also to draw an easy-to-grasp contrast between the two candidates.Even before the airstrike in Iraq last week, Mr. Sanders's aides had been eager to highlight his foreign policy views. But though he speaks on the trail about his opposition to America's support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, foreign policy has so far taken a back seat in his campaign to domestic policy proposals like ""Medicare for all"" and tuition-free public college.At an event in Dubuque on Saturday, however, Mr. Sanders called on Congress to ""take immediate steps to restrain President Trump from plunging our nation into yet another endless war.""His foreign policy views have struck a chord with voters in Iowa like Peggy Ross, 67, a bookseller from Decorah. ""I think he has the right idea,"" she said after seeing Mr. Sanders speak. ""No one likes war.""Yet Mr. Sanders's dovish stances and his emphasis on domestic matters could also prove to be liabilities with voters who want a firmer response to foreign aggression than he appears to promote. They could also weaken his standing among Americans who are clamoring for an experienced hand in the international arena at a moment of global turmoil.A CNN poll from late November found that 48 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters thought Mr. Biden was best equipped to handle foreign policy; Mr. Sanders was a distant second at 14 percent.Mr. Biden, who chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when he represented Delaware, is perhaps at his most fluent and comfortable when discussing international affairs, and he has made that issue a centerpiece of his message in a race that has been largely limited to domestic debates.His campaign has run ads emphasizing his national security experience, and on Friday posted some of them on Twitter after news broke of the drone strike. On Sunday, the campaign announced endorsements from three Democratic members of Congress, all of whom are military veterans.Mr. Biden's allies say that renewed national focus on foreign policy allows him to strike a clear contrast with both Mr. Trump and his Democratic rivals, and injects fresh urgency into the question of who is the most electable candidate.The gravity of the moment ""propels deep interest among people in seeing the strongest candidate against Trump,"" said Thomas E. Donilon, who was former President Barack Obama's national security adviser and is supporting Mr. Biden.And Mr. Biden, he said, was ""a natural person to look to as a steady, experienced hand to deal with these issues on Day 1."" (Mr. Donilon's brother, Mike Donilon, is Mr. Biden's chief strategist.)Throughout his latest Iowa bus tour, Mr. Biden frequently emphasized his relationships abroad and depth of experience as he warned against war in the Middle East. The next president, he said, will ""inherit a country that is divided, and a world that's in disarray.""He added, ""There can be no time for on-the-job training"" -- a message that could apply, he has suggested, to any of his leading rivals.""With all due respect, I think I'm best prepared"" on leadership matters compared to ""anybody running,"" Mr. Biden told an applauding crowd of about 700 on Saturday night in Des Moines.It was not always a message delivered crisply, or accurately; on several occasions he suggested that Iran had a population of around 40 million people even though it is a nation of more than 80 million people. He also cited Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, when he intended to refer to Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaeda leader.In Des Moines, when Mr. Biden was pressed by an attendee on his foreign policy record, he noted, as he often does, that he had quickly grown disillusioned with the Bush administration's handling of Iraq and that he had become a vocal opponent of the war. A CNN fact-check published Monday found his remarks about when his opposition to the war began to be misleading.He was also questioned on his view of the raid that killed bin Laden; Mr. Biden's answer on that issue has changed over the years.""It's not to suggest I haven't made mistakes in my career, but I will put my record against anyone in public life in terms of foreign policy,"" Mr. Biden said.At weekend events for both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, attendees viewed the unfolding developments in Iran with anxiety, if not grave apprehension.""We don't need to waste any more time,"" said Korlu P. Jallah, 22, who attended an event for Mr. Biden in Waterloo on Saturday morning and said she was supporting him because of his experience. ""We're in a huge mess given the fact that we could possibly go to war with Iran.""Still, she said, Mr. Sanders is her second choice.PhotographJoseph R. Biden Jr. in Independence, Iowa.

| Jump to first hitJoe Biden swept Arizona, Florida and Illinois and Bernie Sanders continued to lose ground in the Democratic primary's delegate count.Joseph R. Biden Jr. swept the three states that voted Tuesday: Florida, Illinois and Arizona. Bernie Sanders lost ground badly in the delegate count. And the coronavirus pandemic continued to wreak havoc on the most basic facets of American life, threatening to disrupt if not derail the remaining primary calendar.With nearly 60 percent of the delegates allocated in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, Mr. Biden holds a commanding lead of nearly 300 delegates over Mr. Sanders -- a sum that makes it statistically improbable that Mr. Sanders could ever catch up.""Is this race over?"" Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the House Democratic caucus chairman, asked on Twitter Tuesday night.In a sign of his diminished standing, Mr. Sanders did not even try to spin the results for the second straight week, choosing to make no public remarks after the states were called.Yet it's not clear what comes next -- for Mr. Sanders or the primary itself.Georgia was supposed to vote next week, but that primary has been delayed. And given his string of poor performances, the pressure on Mr. Sanders to exit the race is likely only to grow, even as the pandemic has frozen traditional campaigning and pushed multiple states to delay their planned elections.Here are four takeaways from a primary night in three key states for both parties:Biden is winning almost everywhere -- by a lotIt has been only 35 days since Mr. Biden's low point in the 2020 primaries: a fifth-place finish in New Hampshire so embarrassing that he bolted the state before the polls closed and decamped to South Carolina for what looked like a potential last stand.Now Mr. Biden is routing Mr. Sanders in every region of the country. In Florida, a voter survey showed Mr. Biden winning men and women, white voters and nonwhite voters, those with college degrees and those without -- all with more than 60 percent of the vote. The victory was so thorough that Mr. Biden was even leading in Florida among ""very liberal"" Democrats, a typical Sanders base. He was similarly dominant in Illinois.In fact, Mr. Biden was leading in every county in Florida -- sometimes tripling and quadrupling the vote total of Mr. Sanders, just as the former vice president had swept every county in Michigan, Mississippi and Missouri a week ago.On Mr. Sanders's website, just below where he asks visitors to enter their email address, there is a giant banner that reads, ""Bernie beats Trump."" But his lopsided losses in Florida and Arizona, a week after Mr. Biden crushed him in the key Midwestern swing state of Michigan, has severely undercut any electability case that Mr. Sanders hoped to make.The lone remaining source of electoral strength for Mr. Sanders has proved to be younger voters, whom he continued to win over but who comprise only a small share of the electorate.""The results tonight only confirmed what we knew a week ago -- that Joe Biden is the prohibitive favorite to be the nominee of the Democratic Party,"" said Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, a leading Democratic super PAC devoted to the 2020 race. ""It's critical that Democratic organizations and allies need to be focused on taking on Donald Trump and on not allowing any of the lies he is telling about the likely nominee to take hold.""Sanders still relishes his megaphoneMr. Sanders may have skipped the traditional election night speech, but he did hold a live-streamed event on Tuesday evening and rolled out a proposal for counteracting the potential looming recession from the coronavirus: $2,000 monthly cash payments to Americans for the duration of the crisis.The live-stream was, almost unintentionally, an encapsulation of where Mr. Sanders is in the race: a candidate pressing more for his ideas than himself -- and wedded deeply to the platform that running for president provides his agenda. Mr. Sanders urged that any fiscal countermeasures from Washington to the pandemic would not amount to ""another money making opportunity for corporate America and for Wall Street.""Still, some members of the Sanders team seem to be itching for a prolonged primary fight, even as few know what exactly Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane, plan to do next.Mr. Sanders made one other announcement on Tuesday: that he had processed more than 10 million contributions in his 2020 campaign, adding up to more than $191 million.That includes $2 million on Sunday, even as the nation was facing a financial standstill from the mass closures of businesses and ""stay home"" edicts from health officials.In other words, Mr. Sanders is likely to have the money to keep running if he wants to.But as traditional organizing and campaigning come to a halt -- and with the media glare almost entirely on the virus -- the path forward now seems narrower than ever.Biden is pivoting to the general (while trying to bring in Sanders fans)Addressing the country on Tuesday night from his home in Wilmington, Del., Mr. Biden spoke first and foremost about the virus upending people's lives, looking far more toward the general election in the fall than the evening's primary election results.""This is a moment where we need our leaders to lead,"" Mr. Biden said.He invoked empathy for the suffering, offered prayers for the sick, expressed concerns over hospitals being overloaded and cited the hardships being endured by average Americans.Mr. Biden also explicitly, again, tried to reach out to supporters of Mr. Sanders, citing the ""remarkable passion and tenacity"" of his rival and those supporters. ""We share a common vision,"" he said, referring specifically to providing ""affordable health care to all Americans"" and tackling climate change.He addressed young voters directly.""I hear you. I know what's at stake,"" Mr. Biden said, ""I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign, and my goal as a candidate, is to unify this party and unify this nation.""Coronavirus clouds the future of the primaryWhat comes next is one giant question mark.Georgia postponed its primary, originally scheduled for next week. Ohio was supposed to have voted on Tuesday but the governor pushed back its primary. Kentucky, Maryland and Louisiana have delayed theirs as well. And most future contests are in limbo given the restrictions on group gatherings being pressed by state and federal officials.""As our country deals with the uncertainty of Covid-19, it is critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters,"" Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said on Tuesday, as he urged the remaining states to allow vote-by-mail balloting.Mr. Perez worried about ""moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.""In New York, for instance, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Tuesday the peak of the virus could come in 45 days -- right around the current April 28 primary date.Overall, turnout on Tuesday represented a mixed bag.In Arizona, the mayor of Phoenix, the largest city in the state, ordered the shut down of bars and restaurants as of 8 p.m. local time on Tuesday -- not long after the polls closed. Yet turnout among voters who physically went to the polls in Maricopa County (home to Phoenix) was actually higher in the 2020 primary than in 2016.In Florida, total turnout ended up topping the 2016 Democratic primary but that appeared largely because of heavy early voting. In Illinois, the total vote was far below the 2 million who turned out for the 2016 primary.For now, Mr. Biden can hope that the next time voters go to the polls, he will be the only candidate still running.PhotographAfter a three-state sweep, Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitIf you support a lower-tier candidate in Iowa, don't be surprised if people look at you ... hungrily.INDEPENDENCE, Iowa -- Is Senator Amy Klobuchar the key to the Iowa caucuses?Maybe. But not for the reason you might think.Sure, Ms. Klobuchar is running a vigorous campaign in the state. Stuck in the Senate for the impeachment trial most of the week, she flew back for a hastily scheduled event in Council Bluffs on Tuesday night. Her daughter, Abigail Bessler, has been traveling across Iowa in her stead, wooing voters with Ms. Klobuchar's family hot dish recipe.But in poll after poll, Ms. Klobuchar still hasn't hit the 15 percent threshold needed to win delegates. Her standing hints that her supporters could be up for grabs on the second ballot in many precincts. And four days before the caucuses, rival camps are already coming courting, trying to increase their margins by scooping up some of her caucusgoers.Call it the second-place shuffle.""Second choice matters,"" said Norm Sterzenbach, a caucus adviser to Ms. Klobuchar. ""You have to be careful in how you talk about not only your own candidacy and your strengths but the strengths of the other candidates as well.""Already, aides to former Vice President Joe Biden reached out to Ms. Klobuchar's team to try to broker a caucus-night alliance -- and were rebuffed, according to her advisers. Her team says she's running to win in Iowa and plans to remain in the race at least through the New Hampshire primary eight days later. There are no plans to direct her backers to a second choice.But chances are, if you're a lower-tier candidate, your supporters are being eyed by the higher-ups like a heaping serving of hot dish.Andrew Yang said he anticipated that much of his backing would naturally gravitate to Senator Bernie Sanders, though he declined to give the ""Yang Gang"" specific directions.""The people that support my campaign are very diverse in their leanings,"" Mr. Yang told reporters. ""I frankly think I'd have a hard time getting them to do anything that they weren't naturally inclined to do.""With nearly 1,700 caucuses across the state, even some of the higher-polling candidates are unlikely to make the 15 percent threshold in all of them. On Wednesday, the former mayor Pete Buttigieg declined to point his supporters toward another candidate when asked by reporters.This isn't the first time Democratic strategists have tried to play a game of caucus chess. In 2008, some supporters of Bill Richardson flocked to Barack Obama after rumors circulated of a pact between the two campaigns -- even though they were denied by both camps.How these kinds of efforts will actually play out is harder to predict, say old Iowa caucus hands. In the moment, individual caucuses can be chaotic, making it hard to pull off the kinds of deals that the campaigns and their top aides might like to strike.Even more important, voters often think about the race in ways the political experts might not anticipate. That may be particularly true this year when many caucusgoers are considering a wide -- and ideologically diverse -- field of candidates.At an event for Mr. Buttigieg on Wednesday evening, Ginger Thompson, 63, said she was considering Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Yang. ""I think Bernie and Biden are too old,"" said Ms. Thompson, a retiree. ""They're younger, and to me, it seems they give us hope.""Facing a big field packed with well-known names, Democrats sometimes seem as if they want to back multiple people at once. In town hall meetings, voters have frequently asked the candidates whom they would consider as a running mate.On Jo Walter's list? Mr. Buttigieg, along with Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren.""Well, they're all Democrats. We got to get the Trumpster out of there,"" said Ms. Walter, an emergency medical technician from Clarksville. ""None of them are anything like him.""Maggie Astor contributed reporting from Des Moines.Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We'll try to answer it. Have a comment? We're all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com .The final countdownWith just four days remaining before the Iowa caucuses, we're all in the homestretch before voting begins. I was curious how the candidates are ending their campaigns in this crucial state. Fortunately, I have a whole bunch of friends who can help answer that question.Here's what our campaign reporters are hearing from the leading candidates as they crisscross the state:Astead Herndon:Elizabeth Warren has shifted away from her policy focus in the run-up to the Iowa caucuses. Instead, she's making the case that she's best suited to beat President Trump and unite the Democratic Party. The plans are still there, but she focuses on rooting out Washington corruption and outlining her path to victory more.Reid Epstein:Pete Buttigieg is closing his Iowa campaign by pitching himself as the arbiter of a new era in American politics, attacking Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders and calling for the party to move past the ""the same Washington playbook.""Thomas Kaplan:Joe Biden is emphasizing the need to defeat Mr. Trump. He's leaning hard into contrasting himself with the president, speaking of bringing people together and unifying the country, and telling voters that ""character is on the ballot.""Sydney Ember:Bernie Sanders's closing argument has hardly differed from his core message: He is fighting for the working class, emphasizing ""Medicare for all"" and climate change. But he is also focusing more than ever on voter turnout, and his campaign is urging people to ""fight for someone you don't know.""And me:Amy Klobuchar is casting the election as a ""decency check"" on Mr. Trump, arguing that she can unite the country -- including moderate Republicans -- around the idea of restoring American values.The week in impeachmentWith the impeachment trial possibly headed toward its conclusion after a wild week, my colleague Noah Weiland , who writes our Impeachment Briefing newsletter , volunteered to catch us up on the latest. Here's what happened this week:The trial could end in the next few days. In the last 48 hours, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, and the rest of the Republican leadership team have rallied their senators against tomorrow's vote to hear new witnesses and consider more evidence, effectively shutting down the trial and speeding toward a presumed acquittal. Mr. McConnell argued that opening the trial to witnesses would extend it indefinitely and introduce a degree of uncertainty that would cede control of the proceedings to Democrats, who are eager to call several top current and former White House officials to testify.John Bolton could be left hanging. The Times reported on Sunday night that Mr. Bolton, President Trump's former national security adviser, had submitted to the White House a draft of his upcoming book. In it, he gave a firsthand account of Mr. Trump's conditioning security assistance to Ukraine on help with investigations into Democrats. The revelation threatened to turn the trial on its head -- Republicans suddenly anticipated a majority vote to hear witnesses, and began to suggest that they would call Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, in a kind of witness exchange. Within days, though, the prospects of a Bolton appearance had seriously declined.We finally heard from senators on the Senate floor -- sort of. Yesterday and today, Democrats and Republicans had a chance to ask the House managers and White House lawyers anything related to the impeachment inquiry. Their questions, submitted in writing and read aloud by Chief Justice John Roberts, were wide-ranging: about the definition of obstruction, the history of security aid to Ukraine and the whistle-blower whose complaint led to the inquiry. Many of them were merely prompts from one party to its respective side to deliver talking points, including a response from White House lawyers that showed a startlingly expansive view of executive power.Democrats warned that a trial without witnesses would be illegitimate. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said today that if the Senate refused to call new witnesses or subpoena more documents, Mr. Trump's acquittal would not count. ""He will not be acquitted,"" she told reporters at her weekly news conference. ""You cannot be acquitted if you don't have a trial, and you don't have a trial if you don't have witnesses and documentation.""Subscribe to the Impeachment Briefing here ....

| Jump to first hitMr. Sanders has now won the most votes in each of the first three states and has more momentum than all his rivals and more money than everyone besides two self-funding billionaires.LAS VEGAS -- Senator Bernie Sanders won big on Saturday and is now the clear front-runner. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. saved enough face to march on to his must-win in South Carolina a week from now. Pete Buttigieg finished in the top tier again and embraced the urgency of knocking down a rising Mr. Sanders, though it is not clear where he wins next. And Senator Elizabeth Warren is awash in cash after her debate dismantling of Michael R. Bloomberg -- $9 million in three days -- but the performance did not nudge her up in the standings in Nevada.Here are five takeaways from Saturday's results and what they'll mean for the rest of the Democratic primary:Bernie Sanders has taken command of the raceMr. Sanders did not just win Nevada. Entrance polls show that he dominated.Those polls showed Mr. Sanders winning men and women; whites and Latinos; voters in all but the oldest age group (17-29, 30-44 and 45-64); those with college degrees and those without. He was carrying union households and nonunion households, self-identified liberal Democrats (by a wide margin) and moderate and conservative ones (narrowly).""Welcome to the revolution,"" said Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for Justice Democrats, a progressive group.The Sanders victory was built upon three distinct and yet overlapping bases of support: young people (56 percent support among those 44 and under), very liberal voters (49 percent) and a majority of Hispanic voters. The latter was a new factor in Nevada after two heavily white opening states, Iowa and New Hampshire, and particularly important as the race expands to big and diverse states on Super Tuesday with large Latino populations, none more significant than California and Texas.Mr. Sanders has now won the most votes in each of the first three states (Mr. Buttigieg appears to have edged him in delegates in the still-disputed Iowa results) and has more momentum than all his rivals and more money than everyone besides the two self-funding billionaires, Tom Steyer and Mr. Bloomberg.It was no accident that Mr. Sanders spent much of the day before the Nevada caucuses in California and had two rallies in Texas on Saturday: His campaign is looking ahead to Super Tuesday, March 3, as the day he breaks away from the rest of the Democratic field.Speaking of which ...The rest of the field isn't shrinkingNot long after the first results began rolling in, a super PAC supporting Mr. Buttigieg announced it was buying TV ads in Super Tuesday states. Mr. Biden's campaign manager declared that ""the Biden comeback"" had just begun. Senator Amy Klobuchar dropped from her New Hampshire showing yet claimed to have ""exceeded expectations."" And Ms. Warren's campaign manager said her performance at last week's debate would prove more important than the actual election.Translation: No one is about to quit this race.And the longer all the alternative candidates remain, the longer Mr. Sanders can keep carrying states and consolidating his own coalition without a singular rival.""The Nevada results reinforce the reality that this fragmented field is putting Bernie Sanders on pace to amass an insurmountable delegate lead,"" said Kevin Sheekey, the campaign manager for Mr. Bloomberg.Each has their own arguments for staying.Mr. Biden, who carried black voters in Nevada, is the best positioned to beat Mr. Sanders in an upcoming state (South Carolina). Mr. Buttigieg has had the strongest showings overall besides Mr. Sanders. Ms. Warren, whose campaign announced a $21 million haul for February, argues she has the money and organization to compete. Mr. Bloomberg has his billions. Ms. Klobuchar's path -- which is taking her to Fargo, N.D., on Sunday -- seems less clear and may be more about grabbing spare delegates than the nomination.The collective impact is clear. A remarkable six candidates all had at least 12 percent of the vote among voters over 45 in Nevada, an almost impossibly even level of fracture.Joe Biden's best finish yet is still second placeThe Biden case for the nomination has been straightforward: He's the guy to beat President Trump. Yet for the third time in three races, Mr. Biden did not win. He did improve from his bad fourth-place finish in Iowa and his disastrous fifth place in New Hampshire (as of late Saturday both Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Biden were claiming second as Nevada sloooowly processed results).But throughout February, Mr. Biden had said that his fortunes would be reversed now that more diverse states were voting. Except it was Mr. Sanders who soundly defeated Mr. Biden among Latino voters, according to entrance polls, while Mr. Biden's lead among African Americans -- his strongest base -- continued to shrink to 12 percentage points.""Y'all did it for me. Y'all did it,"" Mr. Biden nonetheless told his supporters in Las Vegas.He notably sharpened his contrast with Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bloomberg, who has vied to take over the moderate lane the former vice president occupied for virtually all of 2019.""I ain't a socialist. I ain't a plutocrat. I'm a Democrat,"" he said. ""And proud of it!""Mr. Biden could well still win in South Carolina, where he has consistently led in the polls, and that could be a springboard to Super Tuesday. But his schedule has him locked down in the must-win state for much of the week as rivals cross the nation.And don't forget: Mr. Biden led in the Nevada polling averages for much of the last year.Until he didn't.Buttigieg wants to be the anti-BernieOf all the victory and concession speeches on Saturday, Mr. Buttigieg's was the most revealing. He used the big platform not just to make the case for himself but to slash at Mr. Sanders, whom he accused of pushing an ""inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans.""He talked about the urgency of beating Mr. Trump and the importance of nominating a Democrat who ""actually gives a damn"" about down-ballot races. Speaking on MSNBC, one of the campaign's national chairs, Representative Anthony Brown, called Mr. Buttigieg the leader in the ""non-revolutionary lane"" of the primary, though if such a lane exists, it is more a tangled mess.Going forward, the problem is that Mr. Buttigieg's early successes in Iowa, New Hampshire and, to a lesser extent, Nevada, have not yet lifted him nationally.The Nevada entrance polls had him carrying a meager 2 percent of black voters. Advisers to his rivals and Democratic strategists who want to see Mr. Sanders stopped have been frustrated with Mr. Buttigieg's campaign, arguing that while he has been relatively successful so far, he is now in a demographic cul-de-sac.But Mr. Buttigieg has a compelling counterpoint, as he said pointedly in his speech: ""Ours is the only campaign that has beaten Senator Sanders anywhere in the country this whole campaign cycle.""After sizzling debate, Warren doesn't get Nevada bumpIf Wednesday's debate performance was going to turn Ms. Warren's political fortunes, it did not do so fast enough for the Nevada caucuses.The results trickling in delivered another round of frustration for a candidate who fell below expectations in both Iowa and New Hampshire and had her campaign manager, Roger Lau, arguing on Saturday that the days-old debate would prove more significant than the actual election.""We believe the Nevada debate will have more impact on the structure of the race,"" Mr. Lau wrote on Twitter. He called the actual results a ""lagging indicator"" because so many votes -- true -- were cast before the debate.The problem is that election results create their own new gravitational reality in politics and the race itself will be reset with the next debate on Tuesday. Then comes South Carolina, which was long seen as her weakest of the four early states. Then, suddenly, Super Tuesday, where Mr. Sanders seems to be making a play for Ms. Warren's home state, Massachusetts.Ms. Warren still has fans. Before one of the largest crowds of her campaign in Seattle on Saturday, she told supporters that she had raised $9 million in the last three days, a huge sum. That gives a financial cushion to a campaign that was so close to running out of money in January it took out a $3 million line of credit.But on a day that Mr. Sanders won and was building momentum, Ms. Warren was still focused on her preferred target: Mr. Bloomberg, reliving some of the greatest hits from the debate.And she added some new, off-brand material for a candidate who rose in the polls last year on the strength of her myriad plans and reputation as a wonkish fighter.She cracked a height joke.Mr. Bloomberg, she said, posed ""a big threat, not a tall threat, but a big one.""Her rivals had not even mentioned her in their assessments.PhotographSenator Elizabeth Warren told supporters in Seattle on Saturday that she had raised $9 million after her strong debate performance.

| Jump to first hitCandidates seem to be channeling voters so intent on defeating President Trump that they don't want to see Democrats attacking other Democrats.Four years ago in Iowa and New Hampshire, a political circular firing squad erupted during nearly every prime-time commercial break. Republican presidential candidates and their allied super PACs unleashed a cacophony of personal, caustic attack ads as they sought to break through in a historically large field.This year, with an even larger field on the Democratic side, the tone on televisions in Iowa and New Hampshire is decidedly different. Almost universally, the Democratic ads seek to address and quell a source of national anxiety -- be it about President Trump, prescription drug costs, corruption, foreign policy or a changing economy.And they're doing it politely.""Give people a fair deal and real economic power,"" Tom Steyer, the biggest advertiser in Iowa, says in his most recent ad.""Put humanity first,"" intones Andrew Yang in his newest ad.In total, Democrats spent nearly $30 million on the airwaves in Iowa and New Hampshire in 2019, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm.Not a single candidate has run a negative ad on television targeting other Democrats.The relatively placid ads of the 2020 Democratic campaign reflect the risk-averse primary contest, in which candidates have been loath to unleash any negativity on an opponent. Instead, they are channeling voters still unnerved by the 2016 election and so wholly concerned with defeating Donald Trump that any potential damage done during the Democratic primary could be viewed as unforgivable.While Democratic voters in Iowa find negative advertising particularly off-putting, it appears that they want to both get rid of Mr. Trump and eradicate his confrontational approach to politics.""In Iowa, those voters, they don't like negative ads in general, and they don't like them right now because Trump is so negative,"" said Kelly Gibson, a Democratic media strategist who has advised both the Andrew Yang and Julián Castro campaigns. She added that the obsession with beating Mr. Trump had made Democrats overly anxious about the primary process, as well.""The idea of cutting each other down somehow hurting us in the general election, whichever campaign did that would get a lot of pushback, pitchforks and torches from the voters,"" Ms. Gibson said. ""There's just seemingly no tolerance for it.""Also in play are memories of 2016, when the bitter campaign between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders left many supporters of Mr. Sanders alienated enough to stay home or vote for a third-party candidate.In place of any negativity has been a focus on generally positive, biographical messaging. More than 25 percent of all ads in both Iowa and New Hampshire were either a general positive message or one about a candidate's character, according to Advertising Analytics. In Iowa, the top issue was health care, addressed in about 9 percent of ads. In New Hampshire, it was the economy, also addressed in about 9 percent of ads.There is also the tsunami of ads from Michael R. Bloomberg, who isn't spending on ads in the first four early states but has dropped more than $165 million on television and digital ads in Super Tuesday states and beyond, according to Advertising Analytics. But Mr. Bloomberg has also not gone on the attack against other Democrats.The apprehension toward negativity among the Democratic candidates has largely been evident in real time as well; when the debates have been marked by hostile attacks -- Representative Tulsi Gabbard attacked Senator Kamala Harris's record as prosecutor, Ms. Harris went after Joe Biden's record on busing, to name a couple -- other candidates are often quick to try to tamp down any bubbling anger.""I did not come here to listen to this argument,"" interjected Senator Amy Klobuchar at the sixth debate as a heated discussion over a fund-raiser at a wine cave boiled over. She added that the only way Democrats would win was ""not by arguing with each other, but by finding what unites us in getting this done.""The relative comity among the candidates on the airwaves comes after Republican presidential primaries in 2012 and 2016 that were overwhelmingly negative and seemed to signal a new era for presidential campaigns. With the injection of billions of dollars into such races after the Citizens United decision, leading to the proliferation of deep-pocketed super PACs, an explosion of negative advertising was becoming the norm. The so-called Eleventh Commandment popularized by President Ronald Reagan, which declared that ""thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican,"" seemed destined for history.Indeed, at this point in the 2016 presidential primary, Republican candidates and outside groups had spent $55 million on ads, according to Advertising Analytics. But $22 million of that alone came from Right to Rise, the super PAC supporting Jeb Bush, which ran a torrent of negative ads about other candidates.Larry McCarthy, the chief media strategist for Right to Rise in the 2016 campaign, said the nature of those races was what led to the early onslaught of negative advertising.In the 2012 and 2016 Republican primaries, he said, ""negative ads appeared earlier because the common wisdom was that if poll leaders Gingrich or Trump scored an early victory, they could use that momentum to get on a roll that couldn't be stopped."" He added, ""The '20 Democratic race looks different, with Biden, Sanders, Buttigieg and Warren closely bunched, all thinking they have a chance to win or place in one of the first four states.""The closest any ad came to a negative attack in the 2020 race was aired by a super PAC backing Cory Booker, the candidate whose defining message is one of harmony and unity.""He's a Rhodes Scholar, a uniter, a successful mayor,"" a narrator says with a hint of sarcasm, as ""Hail to the Chief"" plays while a Pete Buttigieg photo montage appears onscreen. The images and soundtrack suddenly fizzle. ""No, not that guy,"" the narrator says, with a big ""Not that guy"" splashed across Mr. Buttigieg's face. ""It's Cory Booker.""The ad, backed by roughly $300,000 from the super PAC, ""United We Win,"" ran exclusively in Iowa. When he was shown the ad during an interview with CNN, Mr. Booker said he had not seen it, and was caught ""off guard"" by its existence.""I celebrate the people who are in the race, and my campaign is not about tearing anybody down,"" he said.Another contributing factor to the lack of hostility on the airwaves can be attributed to the absence of major super PACs in the Democratic primary, as most of the leading candidates have sworn off any support from a super PAC.""If you look in any advertising campaign, outside groups are the ones who are much more likely to go negative,"" said Ken Goldstein, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco. ""So if you remove them from the playing field, you remove a big well of money for negative ads.""History, Dr. Goldstein noted, could also be guiding the campaigns in 2020. Though the 2008 and 2016 Democratic presidential primaries were contentious, neither featured a particularly negative attack ad. While Mr. Sanders released an ad in 2016 criticizing banks that corrupt politics with ""speaking fees,"" he made no mention of Hillary Clinton. In 2008, Ms. Clinton's famous ""3 a.m."" ad implied that Barack Obama wasn't prepared for sudden foreign crises, but it made no mention of Mr. Obama.In the 2004 campaign, however, Howard Dean and Richard A. Gephardt began trading attacks on the air in the months leading up to the Iowa caucuses. While the negative advertising was effective in bringing down both Mr. Dean and Mr. Gephardt's poll numbers, neither candidate actually benefited. Instead, John Kerry, the eventual nominee, did.""In any multicandidate race, there's a danger in going negative in that your negative ad works in knocking down one of your opponents, but benefits a third opponent,"" Dr. Goldstein said. ""That's even more the case now when you have five or six top candidates.""But, he said, the cease-fire may not hold for long after a vast field begins to winnow.""This is the case when it's multicandidate,"" Dr. Goldstein noted, ""But if it's Biden vs. Sanders or Buttigieg vs. Warren -- if this is a two-person race -- forget all that.""PhotographFom top: Tom Steyer, the biggest advertiser in Iowa; Andrew Yang, whose ad says, ""Put humanity first""; and Senator Amy Klobuchar, who said Democrats would win ""not by arguing with each other.""

| Jump to first hitBernie Sanders and Joseph R. Biden Jr. have been seeking to take control of the race in its early stages, trying to deny momentum to their top two rivals, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg.Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., two front-runners in the Democratic presidential race, are mounting a late push to gain a decisive advantage in the early primary and caucus states, aiming to avert a monthslong delegate battle against two insurgent rivals -- and each other.Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden appear nearly deadlocked in the early states with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Mr. Sanders held a slim lead in Iowa in a poll published Friday by The Des Moines Register and CNN, while recent polls in New Hampshire have found the leading candidates closely bunched. Mr. Biden has held a more consistent advantage in Nevada and South Carolina, the other states to vote in February.In a sign of how extraordinarily fluid the race remains less than a month before voting, all four of the top candidates are in a position to win both Iowa and New Hampshire, an outcome that could transform the race for any of them.Mr. Biden, the leading candidate in national polls, is especially determined to deny his challengers a chance to seize sudden momentum in the first few primary and caucus states. Hopeful of an early victory, Mr. Biden quietly dispatched his deputy campaign manager, Pete Kavanaugh, to move to Des Moines late last year to oversee his Iowa campaign. And in recent weeks Mr. Biden has made Iowa the most urgent priority on his travel schedule.His support in the state has remained flat, however, and he will need a late surge to win the Feb. 3 caucuses. In the Register poll on Friday, Mr. Sanders held the lead there with 20 percent, followed by Ms. Warren at 17 percent, Mr. Buttigieg at 16 percent and Mr. Biden at 15 percent. The poll, which had a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points, is likely to both embolden supporters of Mr. Sanders and galvanize moderate Democrats who are fiercely opposed to his nomination.This is the first time that Mr. Sanders, 78, has finished atop the Register poll, another sign that he has reinvigorated his campaign just three months after having a heart attack. Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said on Friday night that the campaign was ""extremely encouraged"" by the poll and that Mr. Sanders was focused on driving up turnout in the caucuses.""Clearly the trajectory is in the right direction,"" Mr. Weaver said, adding, ""If we have a big caucus turnout, Bernie Sanders will win the Iowa caucuses.""Both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden have been seeking to take control of a race that has been shaken and shaped for much of the year by candidates with fresher faces and new ideas. Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg are chief among them, having built strong campaigns in Iowa and New Hampshire and each seizing the lead there for a time. Now, both are girding for a monthslong quest for delegates across 50 states.Against a backdrop of impeachment in Washington and violence in the Middle East, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden are trying to turn President Trump's clash with Iran to their own advantage in Iowa, a Midwestern state with strong strains of antiwar sentiment and ideological moderation. Mr. Sanders has used his powerful financial position to mount the largest advertising campaign of any candidate in the state, and he has been emphasizing his long antiwar record while delivering increasingly pointed criticism of Mr. Biden's past support for foreign trade deals and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.Mr. Biden has begun airing ads in Iowa calling this ""the most dangerous moment in a generation,"" and at a speech in New York this week he sought to re-engage in a direct debate not with his primary rivals but with Mr. Trump. At a meeting of political donors in New York on Wednesday, close advisers to Mr. Biden argued that the atmosphere of crisis would work to his advantage, people who attended the meeting said.Both men brought valuable advantages into the race from the start, including sharply defined public images, Mr. Biden's popularity among black voters and Mr. Sanders's immense donor base. Mr. Biden has consistently led the field in national polls, while Mr. Sanders has been by far the most successful fund-raiser, collecting nearly $35 million in the last quarter of 2019.""The story of the race is the resilience of those two guys,"" said Paul Begala, a longtime Democratic strategist.It is by no means certain that either Mr. Biden or Mr. Sanders can secure a tight grip on the nomination without a long fight, and that possibility could evaporate if Ms. Warren or Mr. Buttigieg were to score an upset victory or two at the start. Ms. Warren was set to campaign in Iowa this weekend beside Julián Castro, while Mr. Buttigieg announced plans for a town hall with the singer and actress Mandy Moore.Right now, veteran Democrats in the early states say voters remain overwhelmed by all the options in a field that still features 13 candidates. In the Register poll, only two-fifths of respondents said they had made up their minds, far fewer than at this point in 2016.""It's almost like with a little kid -- if you offer them too many choices, they're frozen,"" said Representative Annie Kuster of New Hampshire, who is still determining whom she'll support. ""Because the stakes are so high, they don't want to get it wrong.""It's not just voters who are reluctant to pick a candidate. Traditional party allies like labor organizations are also taking their time.""I just don't see any of us doing anything before Iowa,"" Randi Weingarten, the president of American Federation of Teachers, said about her fellow unions.The Democratic Party's delegate allocation rules virtually ensure a drawn-out primary season if there are still three or four competitive candidates after the so-called Super Tuesday primaries on March 3, when about 40 percent of all the delegates are at stake. Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, will also become a factor then, since he has opted to skip the first four states to concentrate on later contests.Mr. Bloomberg's advisers, however, have indicated to Democratic officials that he would not be inclined to keep pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into a prolonged contest with Mr. Biden for the nomination. If the former vice president emerged as an overwhelming favorite after Super Tuesday, Mr. Bloomberg would reorient his campaign into an organization dedicated to battering Mr. Trump, the advisers said.Mr. Biden and his allies hope the race will not last long enough for Mr. Bloomberg to become a troublesome factor, and there have been new signs over the last week that the Democratic Party establishment is eager to help. Mr. Biden has unveiled a series of endorsements from Democratic leaders from battleground districts, including Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles on Friday.And after months of internal pessimism and external expectation-setting about his prospects in Iowa, Steve Ricchetti, a top adviser to the former vice president, has told other Democrats he thinks they can win the state outright.But Mr. Biden's advisers privately concede that a fourth-place finish could be damaging, and the Register poll indicated that he could capture political gold or be out of the medal hunt there altogether.""If Biden were to finish first in Iowa and then first or second in New Hampshire, it's very hard to see him being stopped,"" said David Plouffe, who ran former President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign.The same could be true of Mr. Sanders: His campaign believes he is well positioned to win three of the first four states -- with the Biden stronghold of South Carolina as the lone holdout -- and then cement his control of the race on Super Tuesday, when Mr. Sanders's financial strength and popularity with Latino voters could give him an edge in states like California and Texas.But Sanders allies concede that he will have to add more support from racial minorities, especially African-Americans, in order to clinch the nomination.""The hope is that our momentum gives people a chance to look at Bernie's record on civil rights, on mass incarceration, on a lot of other issues,"" said Representative Ro Khanna of California, a co-chairman of the Sanders campaign.Unlike Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders would have to overcome deep reservations in the party establishment about his strength as a general-election candidate.""Bernie is a disaster for me in South Florida,"" said Representative Donna Shalala, a first-term Democrat who faces re-election in a swing district where Mr. Sanders's embrace of socialism is deeply unpopular with many Latino voters. Ms. Shalala, who has not endorsed a candidate, suggested the nomination might be resolved in a brokered convention and predicted Mr. Sanders would ""stay in the primary right down till the end.""For all his team's optimism, Mr. Biden has yet to gain ground in Iowa and is no better than tied for the lead in New Hampshire, and his campaign could be stretched thin in bigger primary states, where he has done less than his top rivals to build out operations. Even some allies of Mr. Biden concede that Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have superior campaign organizations in many of the February and March states.Still, at a meeting with Democratic donors in New York this week, advisers to Mr. Biden projected confidence. Mr. Ricchetti told the group that voters would reward Mr. Biden for consistently delivering a moderate message, while Tom Donilon, a former national security adviser in the Obama administration, said the Iran crisis had reinforced the value of ""a pair of safe hands"" in the presidency.""I think the objective fact is that Biden is the most experienced foreign policy person in the field, and I think that's been highlighted,"" Mr. Donilon said in an interview, adding that Mr. Biden's critique of Mr. Trump, delivered in Manhattan on Tuesday, ""was a really sharp contrast"" with the incumbent.Other campaigns are not convinced that events abroad will work so neatly to Mr. Biden's advantage, since they also highlight his support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.Representative Anthony Brown of Maryland, who on Thursday became the first black member of Congress to endorse Mr. Buttigieg, said in an interview that Mr. Biden's credentials would not decide the race.""Certainly, Vice President Biden, we know his résumé,"" said Mr. Brown, who like Mr. Buttigieg is a military veteran. Mr. Buttigieg ""understands the drag on the nation, being in these forever wars, because he served in one of those, not because he made the decision to send us,"" Mr. Brown said.There is still hope among the underdog candidates that an unsettled race could lead to a late breakout. But the Register poll offered little encouragement: The next-strongest challengers, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and the tech executive Andrew Yang, were both stuck in the mid-single digits.Sydney Ember contributed reporting from Des Moines, and Katie Glueck from New York.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders's campaign believes he is in position to win three of the first four nominating contests. Joe Biden, left, at Corinthian Baptist Church in Des Moines this month, has led in most polls, however, and remains popular among black voters.

| Jump to first hitAs he runs for president, Mr. Biden has repeatedly faced questions about the overseas business dealings of his son, Hunter Biden. He has mostly kept his cool -- but not always.SPARKS, Nev. -- Joseph R. Biden Jr. called an octogenarian voter a ""damn liar"" and challenged him to a push-up contest. He dismissed a heckler as an ""idiot."" He commanded the news media to focus on President Trump instead of the overseas business dealings of his son, Hunter Biden, demanding of one reporter, ""Ask the right question!""For months now, Mr. Biden has been confronted on the campaign trail with questions, attacks and misinformation concerning his son -- encounters that have taken on a dramatic feel, given the uncertainty of how Mr. Biden will respond. As he began to address the crowd in a high school gym in Sparks this month, a group of protesters held up letters spelling out a taunt that Mr. Trump uses regularly: ""Where's Hunter?"" Mr. Biden responded by saying his son ""sends his best regards.""As the Senate impeachment trial of the president continues this week, there is renewed focus in Washington on Hunter Biden, who held a seat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company at a time when his father was vice president and handling diplomacy with the country.And Mr. Biden is no longer just dealing with questions about his son from hecklers: On Wednesday, he rejected the suggestion that he and his son testify in the trial in a swap for the testimony of current or former Trump administration officials, an idea raised by an attendee at an Iowa campaign event that has been dismissed by congressional Democrats. ""This is a constitutional issue, and we're not going to turn it into a farce, into some kind of political theater,"" Mr. Biden said.For Mr. Biden, the stream of questions about his son touches on a vulnerability for his candidacy and presents a fine line for him to navigate. As a former vice president, he wants to show that he exudes statesmanship but also wants to prove to Democrats desperate to oust Mr. Trump that he has the fortitude and temperament to take on the president.He can be by turns calm or curt as he stresses that his son committed no wrongdoing in his overseas business dealings. For the most part, he has kept his cool, but he has also been prone to displays of anger.""It's a very personal issue,"" said Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, who worked closely with Mr. Biden in the Obama administration when he acted as the de facto labor liaison. She said Mr. Trump was ""an evil genius on the issue of trying to cut other people up, and cut them up this way.""She said the ""raw emotion"" Mr. Biden displayed in response was perfectly understandable. ""This is a dad defending his son,"" she said.At issue is an unsubstantiated theory pushed by Mr. Trump that Mr. Biden took action in Ukraine as vice president in order to help his son, who at the time held a lucrative position as a board member of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian energy company.Mr. Trump has claimed without evidence that Mr. Biden pushed for the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor in order to derail an investigation into Burisma. The president's phone call in July to the Ukrainian president asking him to investigate the activities of the Bidens in that country is at the center of the impeachment charges.There is no evidence of any illegality by either Biden. But Hunter Biden's position with Burisma -- for which he was paid as much as $50,000 in some months -- worried some members of President Barack Obama's administration at the time, and Hunter Biden has since acknowledged that, in hindsight, he exercised ""poor judgment"" in taking the position.The scrutiny of his son could pose a difficult political problem for Mr. Biden: He is presenting himself to voters as a regular guy with working-class Pennsylvania roots, and his son's high-paying position with an overseas business could strike some as the type of insider arrangement long familiar in Washington.And for Democratic primary voters weighing how to defeat Mr. Trump, the fact that they can now picture the general-election playbook the president would use against Mr. Biden carries risk for him, some strategists have warned.In subtle and overt ways, the issue remains alive on the campaign trail -- even among people who are sympathetic to Mr. Biden. In Centerville, Iowa, on Sunday, Mr. Biden's wife, Jill Biden, was asked whether her family was prepared for an onslaught of attacks. She replied that the Bidens are resilient.Mr. Biden's national poll numbers have been remarkably steady, including in recent months after the news broke of Mr. Trump's effort to get Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Initially, many Democrats worried that Mr. Biden appeared slow and uneven in his response, as he vacillated between lashing the president and trying to change the subject. His advisers, too, were torn in internal deliberations over how to handle the developments.Mr. Biden eventually settled on a rhythm of insisting that he and his son did nothing wrong, and seeking to bring the attention back to Mr. Trump. All along, Mr. Biden and his surrogates have argued that Mr. Trump's attacks prove that the president is most concerned about facing Mr. Biden in a general election.His campaign has also aggressively tried to shape the media narrative on Ukraine. This week, it circulated a memo urging the news media to make clear that Mr. Trump's claims about Mr. Biden are unfounded. And it released a video in which a Biden spokesman, Andrew Bates, walked through Mr. Trump's claims and explained, sometimes in profane terms, why they were bogus.""Why is Donald Trump doing this?"" Mr. Bates asked. ""He knows he can't beat Joe Biden.""But questions about Hunter Biden have followed Mr. Biden around the country -- from a news conference in Los Angeles to a town hall event in rural Iowa to interviews with reporters aboard his campaign bus. On multiple occasions, he has been interrupted by protesters invoking his son.Mr. Biden has occasionally flashed his anger and frustration.""Let's focus on the problem,"" he told reporters this fall, aiming his fire at Mr. Trump. ""Focus on this man, what he's doing, that no president has ever done. No president!"" By the end of that declaration, he was practically shouting.At other times he has responded calmly, as he did in Sparks when the protesters held up letters spelling out ""Where's Hunter?""""This new Republican Party, I've been the object of their attention and affection for a while here,"" Mr. Biden said later at that event. ""You saw, for example -- I understand what it's like to have my surviving son maligned as he has. I understand what it is to have lies told about me.""In late December, a succession of hecklers interrupted him at the beginning of a town hall event in Milford, N.H., including one who asked, ""How much money did you make in Ukraine with your son?""Mr. Biden responded by saying that he had released 21 years of tax returns. ""Your guy hasn't released one,"" he said. ""What's he hiding?"" The crowd roared with approval. But as the disruption continued, Mr. Biden offered his own appraisal of the heckler: ""He's an idiot.""A particularly combative moment came in December at a town hall event in New Hampton, Iowa, when an 83-year-old man took issue with Mr. Biden's age (he is 77) and then proceeded to accuse him, falsely, of having sent his son to work in Ukraine and having sold access to the president.""You're a damn liar, man,"" Mr. Biden responded in a tense exchange that also included Mr. Biden challenging the man to a push-up contest or an I.Q. contest. At another point, Mr. Biden ordered the man, ""Get your words straight, Jack!"" (Mr. Biden later said he probably should not have challenged the man to a push-up contest.)The reaction to that episode varied. In a primary race in which Democratic voters are eager for a candidate who can stand up to Mr. Trump, Mr. Biden's fiery responses may provide encouragement that he can handle himself in a heated back-and-forth.""If anybody's wondering if Joe Biden can take on Donald Trump and is ready for a fight, I'd point you to the video in Iowa,"" Symone D. Sanders, a senior adviser for the Biden campaign, said at an event hosted by Politico.The next day, Joe Stutler, 56, who came to see Mr. Biden in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, spoke approvingly of his response. As a cautionary tale, Mr. Stutler cited the discredited attacks on John Kerry's military record made during the 2004 campaign by the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, and said he wanted a candidate ""that has the gumption to push back.""""There are folks that are saying, 'Oh, well, you know, maybe he should have been a little nicer, blah, blah, blah, blah,""' he said. ""No. If somebody's going to talk smack, call him on it.""But there is also a delicate line between fiery and bellicose. In response to the tense exchange with the Iowa voter, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee said Mr. Biden ""became unglued,"" adding, ""A hallmark of Biden's 2020 campaign is him losing it on voters and reporters when pressed about Ukraine.""For his part, Mr. Biden has plenty of critical things to say about Mr. Trump, but he has publicly set a boundary for how he talks about the president. Campaigning in New Hampshire late last month, Mr. Biden noted that he had not ""said a thing, and I'm not going to, about his family.""""The way I was raised,"" Mr. Biden said, ""you don't go after somebody's kids.""Thomas Kaplan reported from Sparks, and Katie Glueck from Osage, Iowa.Thomas Kaplan reported from Sparks, Nev., and Katie Glueck from Osage, Iowa.PhotographJoseph R.

| Jump to first hit""As we enter the moment in this campaign where we come down to a two-person race, I think it important for us to differentiate our records, and I intend to do that,"" Mr. Sanders said.DETROIT -- Calibrating his approach for a tough head-to-head primary matchup in a year when many Democratic voters want to put up a united front, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Friday renewed his attacks on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s record on trade while also conceding that Mr. Biden could defeat President Trump.In Michigan, where the Sanders campaign is running a TV ad featuring an autoworker who says his community has been ""decimated"" by free trade deals, Mr. Sanders attacked Mr. Biden for his support of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s.""Joe Biden and I have a very serious disagreement with regards to NAFTA,"" Mr. Sanders said at a round table he convened of workers, union leaders and economists in Detroit before a rally attended by thousands. ""Just last year -- I'm not talking about 20 years ago -- Joe said that voting for NAFTA, quote, was not a mistake, end of quote, and a few years before that he called NAFTA a success,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""Joe, you're wrong. NAFTA was not a success. Voting for it was a big, big mistake.""As a long line of mostly young supporters filed into a downtown convention center, organizers called out for any union members to identify themselves. After major disappointments on Super Tuesday, Mr. Sanders is hoping for a comeback next Tuesday as six states go to the polls, none more crucial for him than Michigan, the first of several Midwestern industrial states to vote in the next two weeks. Four years ago, he pulled off one of the biggest surprises of his first presidential campaign when he upset Hillary Clinton in Michigan.""We are in the midst of a very, very difficult primary process,"" Mr. Sanders told reporters before taking the stage at his rally. ""Come Tuesday, maybe Michigan is the most important state.""Asked about Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's endorsement of Mr. Biden on Thursday, Mr. Sanders sounded miffed. ""Well, that wasn't her thoughts when I came here to help her get elected, as a matter of fact,"" he said.Speaking earlier on Friday with reporters in Phoenix, Mr. Sanders also condemned Mr. Biden's votes as a senator on trade agreements, while brandishing new attacks over Mr. Biden's record on federal funding for abortions, same-sex marriage and the former ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy.But in a sign of the careful approach both candidates are taking while seeking to draw distinctions between their campaigns, Mr. Sanders reiterated multiple times that he would support Mr. Biden if he eventually won the presidential nomination, and, pressed by a reporter, said he believed Mr. Biden could beat Mr. Trump in November.""I think we are the stronger campaign to defeat Donald Trump, but you have not heard me say that I think that Biden cannot defeat Trump,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""I will certainly do everything I can if he is the nominee.""Speaking by phone to attendees at a fund-raiser in Bethesda, Md., on Friday night, Mr. Biden said: ""What we can't let happen is let this primary become a negative blood bath. I know I'm going to get a lot of suggestions on how to respond to what I suspect will be an increasingly negative campaign that the Bernie Brothers will run. But we can't tear this party apart and re-elect Trump.""The Biden campaign sent one of its most high-profile new surrogates to Michigan, Senator Amy Klobuchar, but she was far less visible than Mr. Sanders. She toured the backstage areas of an MGM Grand hotel and casino with union leaders, but the event was off-limits to out-of-town reporters.Mr. Biden plans to visit Michigan on Monday, but Mr. Sanders -- who canceled an appearance in Mississippi -- intends to campaign intensely in the state, visiting Dearborn, Flint, Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor.After other major candidates quit the Democratic primary race this week, Mr. Sanders has relentlessly and repeatedly contrasted himself with Mr. Biden.""As we enter the moment in this campaign where we come down to a two-person race, I think it important for us to differentiate our records, and I intend to do that,"" Mr. Sanders said in Phoenix.""Joe has been around for a long time; so have I. And I think people would want to take a look at those records,"" he added. ""All I can tell you, whether it's Iraq, whether it's DOMA, whether it's 'don't ask, don't tell' -- those were difficult votes. I was there, on the right side of history, and my friend Joe Biden was not.""He was referring to the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman, and the policy that prohibited openly gay people from serving in the military.As a senator, Mr. Biden supported a broad defense bill in 1993 that included the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, but also voted for a failed amendment that would have removed the policy from that bill. He also voted for the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996.But as vice president, he said in an interview on ""Meet the Press"" in 2012 that he was ""absolutely comfortable"" with same-sex marriage, a stance that was ahead of the Obama White House's policy at the time.Mr. Sanders also offered a fresh critique on Friday of Mr. Biden's record on the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for most abortions. Until June of last year, Mr. Biden had supported the measure, which critics say disproportionately affects poor women and women of color. He reversed his position after sustaining attacks early in his campaign.""At a time when women are under severe political assault,"" Mr. Sanders said, ""I think people all over this country -- women and men -- are going to look at the record of which candidate has been consistent and strong in terms of defending a woman's right to choose. On this issue, Joe Biden repeatedly voted for the Hyde Amendment.""Mr. Sanders has watched his delegate lead evaporate after the first three nominating contests as Mr. Biden racked up wins in South Carolina and several Super Tuesday states, including some that Mr. Sanders had hoped would wind up in his column.Moving forward, the two candidates will essentially go head-to-head next week in six states including Michigan, which will present one of their first tests in a major general-election swing state.On Friday, Mr. Sanders, who is Jewish, also addressed an episode at a rally for his campaign in Phoenix on Thursday, when a man in the crowd unfurled a flag bearing a swastika before he was removed.""It is horrific,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""It is beyond disgusting to see that in the United States of America there are people who would show the emblem of Hitler and Nazism. And I was shocked to learn about that.""Separately, Mr. Sanders acknowledged that his team had communicated with the federal authorities about the possibility of Secret Service protection for him. Some Democratic lawmakers have called for added security after Mr. Biden's Super Tuesday address was disrupted by protesters who were able to gain access to the stage.Trip Gabriel reported from Detroit, and Matt Stevens from New York. Sydney Ember contributed reporting from Phoenix, and Thomas Kaplan from Washington.PhotographBernie Sanders at a rally in Phoenix on Thursday, where he repeatedly contrasted his record with Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitMr. Booker's endorsement of Mr. Biden came one day after Kamala Harris's, and a day before primary elections in Michigan, Washington State and elsewhere.Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for president on Monday, adding to what has become a nearly complete consolidation of support from Mr. Biden's former top rivals to push him to the Democratic nomination.Mr. Booker's endorsement came one day after Senator Kamala Harris of California endorsed Mr. Biden, and the two senators appeared with him at a rally in Detroit on Monday night. Mr. Booker also campaigned alongside Mr. Biden in Flint, Mich., earlier in the day and attended a fund-raiser with him.""It a time for us to beat Donald Trump and it became very clear to me that Joe Biden is the right person to do that,"" Mr. Booker said in an interview on ""CBS This Morning,"" after announcing his endorsement in a tweet.The event in Michigan, which holds its delegate-heavy primary on Tuesday, was yet another public show of moderate Democratic support for the former vice president on the eve of a major vote in the presidential race.It recalled last Monday night, when Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas all spoke out for Mr. Biden on the eve of Super Tuesday.Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris were two of the most prominent black candidates to run for president, and their endorsements came as Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont scrambles to make up ground among black voters in Michigan, where they make up a sizable part of the electorate.At Mr. Biden's rally on Monday night, held at a high school in Detroit, attendees were given hand sanitizer as they entered, a reflection of growing worries about the coronavirus.The former vice president was joined by Mr. Booker and Ms. Harris as well as Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, who endorsed Mr. Biden last week and was named a national co-chair of his campaign.""I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,"" Mr. Biden told the crowd. ""There's an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country.""Ms. Harris said, ""I believe Joe is right when he says that this election is a fight for the soul of America."" Earlier in the day, Mr. Biden and Ms. Whitmer visited a community health center in Grand Rapids.At the health center, Mr. Biden criticized Mr. Sanders over ""Medicare for all,"" saying that his rival's pursuit of a single-payer health care system would be a ""long and expensive slog, if it can get done at all.""""They can't afford to wait for a revolution,"" Mr. Biden said of patients at the health center. ""They're looking for results.""Mr. Sanders made his pitch to voters Monday night during a town hall event televised on Fox News.In addition to a discussion of policy, he was asked about divisions within the Democratic Party, including criticism from his 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton.Shown footage of Mrs. Clinton's new Hulu series in which she declared that ""nobody likes"" Mr. Sanders, he did not return fire but cast her as a creature of the past.""Unlike Secretary Clinton, I don't want to relive 2016,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""We're in 2020 now. But what I would say on a good day my wife likes me.""""If you guys look at some of the polling that they do for United States senators,"" he went on. ""In most cases I turn out to be the most popular United States senator in the whole country.""Later in the town hall, Mr. Sanders was asked if he had any doubts about Mr. Biden's ""mental acuity."" Mr. Sanders did not address the question directly but questioned the length of Mr. Biden's recent stump speeches.""Joe was somewhere, where was he, Michigan or somewhere the other day, and he spoke for seven minutes,"" said Mr. Sanders, whose events often run an hour or longer. ""I don't know how you say anything other than, you know, minimal discussion for seven minutes.""Though six states vote on Tuesday, Michigan, where Mr. Sanders's surprise victory in 2016 signaled the strength of his insurgent presidential campaign, has become a critical battleground for Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden to show both their ability to turn out key blocs of support and to expand the electorate in a state that will undoubtedly be a major target for President Trump in the general election.Mr. Sanders canceled events this weekend in Mississippi to focus his efforts on Michigan, effectively ceding another state in the South to Mr. Biden while redoubling his effort in Michigan.Mr. Biden also picked up two major endorsements, as two national gun control advocacy groups -- Everytown for Gun Safety and the Brady Campaign -- announced their support for Mr. Biden, evidence that Mr. Sanders's past positions on gun control could undermine his support on an issue popular with many Democratic voters.Mr. Booker, despite dropping out of the presidential race before the nation's first primary contest, had campaigned in Detroit this cycle in an effort to pitch himself as the best candidate to re-energize the fractured Obama coalition and excite black voters in swing states that Hillary Clinton lost in 2016.Though Mr. Biden has indicated that he would most likely select a woman as his running mate, Mr. Booker's support for Mr. Biden will inevitably draw some speculation as to the New Jersey senator's future.Elected to the Senate in 2013, Mr. Booker, the telegenic former mayor of Newark, was long seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party, destined for an eventual national campaign. But he struggled to break through in the crowded 2020 field and ended his campaign early, dropping out of the presidential race three weeks before the Iowa caucuses.Mr. Biden, who achieved sweeping victories in both the South Carolina primary and in the Super Tuesday contests on the strength of black voters across the country, now counts the backing of all the major former black candidates for president, having earned the endorsements of Ms. Harris and former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts in recent days.Mr. Booker is up for re-election in New Jersey this year, and when he dropped out of the presidential race he immediately moved some of his campaign apparatus over to his Senate re-election bid.Though his favorability rating in the state took a small dip as he campaigned across the country for president, Mr. Booker is still immensely popular at home at a time when New Jersey is shifting ever bluer, becoming one of the most Democratic states in the country. Of the 12 members of the state's Congressional delegation, only two are Republican.New Jersey is one of the last states to vote in the Democratic primary, and the 126 pledged delegates up for grabs there in June were seen as a possible final stand for whoever was left fighting for the Democratic nomination. But with the field essentially winnowed to a two-person race, it's unlikely that the state will play a major role in helping to decide the nominee.Though Mr. Booker is in the middle of his own campaign, he temporarily turned over his fund-raising list and apparatus to the Biden effort early Monday, sending an email that directed people to the Booker for Senate page with a disclosure: ""100% of your contribution will go to the Biden for President campaign.""The email contained a slightly retooled applause line from Mr. Booker's own stump speech.""Because Joe Biden understands that beating Donald Trump is the floor,"" Mr. Booker wrote. ""It is not the ceiling.""Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from Detroit, and Reid J. Epstein from Romulus, Mich.PhotographSenator Cory Booker praised former Vice President Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump claims Nancy Pelosi has intentionally undermined Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign by delaying the impeachment trial. Mr. Sanders denounced that theory on Friday.WASHINGTON -- The first version of the conspiracy theory was hatched on Twitter last Friday, Jan. 10.""Don't rule out that the reason Pelosi hasn't sent impeachment to the Senate is to hurt Warren and Sanders, and to help Biden,"" Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary for President George W. Bush, tapped out on his iPad. ""By timing the trial so it takes place during the Iowa lead-up, she has leverage over the liberals.""Mr. Fleischer's message was retweeted 1,400 times.Seven days later, Mr. Fleischer's theory that Speaker Nancy Pelosi was attempting to influence the Democratic primary -- for which there is no evidence -- was being promulgated by President Trump.""They are rigging the election again against Bernie Sanders, just like last time, only even more obviously,"" Mr. Trump tweeted on Friday, claiming his Senate trial was designed to keep Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator, grounded in Washington instead of campaigning in Des Moines ahead of the Feb. 3 caucuses.""Crazy Nancy thereby gives the strong edge to Sleepy Joe Biden, and Bernie is shut out again,"" the president added.An idea that caught fire on Twitter and became grist for Mr. Trump demonstrates how the same echo chamber of right-wing media that boosted him in 2016 is exerting its power again just before the first primary votes are cast in 2020.There was nothing new in terms of the process that got the idea in front of Mr. Trump. But the evolution from online conspiracy theory to Fox News fodder to presidential talking point demonstrated how a world of conservative influencers, Republican lawmakers and online media outlets can drive disinformation through repetition and amplification.Two days after Mr. Fleischer's tweet, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House minority leader, appeared on Maria Bartiromo's show on Fox News and repeated it. ""This is the dirty little secret nobody is talking about: why the Speaker held these papers,"" Mr. McCarthy said on Sunday. ""This benefits Joe Biden. This harms Senator Sanders, who is in first place and could become their nominee.""In fact, Mr. Sanders is not the national front-runner for the nomination and never has been, although he had a narrow lead in a recent poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers. But Mr. Trump's re-election campaign in recent weeks has been seeking to elevate Mr. Sanders, viewing the self-described democratic socialist as the president's ideal Democratic opponent in November.The Trump camp, in turn, is worried about Mr. Biden's competitiveness against the president in Midwestern battleground states, and would like to do anything possible to trip up the moderate former vice president in his tight primary race against the liberal Mr. Sanders.Mr. McCarthy has continued to repeat the theory and profess support for Mr. Sanders, repeating the talking points in an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News. His television commentary was then written up by Breitbart News, the right-wing news and opinion site.On Thursday, The Federalist, a conservative website, ran an article with the headline: ""Is Impeachment Delay How Democrats Are Rigging Iowa Against Bernie Again?"" It said Ms. Pelosi's decision to delay impeachment ""provokes the question whether she is deliberately helping Joe Biden.""One day later, the message had reached the White House, where Mr. Trump, a frequent purveyor of conspiracy theories, presented the idea as a fact.""It's easy to see why Bernie and his supporters would think the establishment is screwing them again,"" said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, noting that the campaign often looks to Mr. Trump's Twitter feed for its daily message.Conspiracies surrounding Mr. Sanders's political fortunes have been a particular fixation for Mr. Trump, dating back four years. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump circulated the false and unsourced claim that an ""analysis"" -- he did not say who wrote it or where it was published -- concluded that Mr. Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if not for superdelegates, the party leaders and officials who were not bound to vote for the winner of their states' primaries or caucuses.At the time, Mr. Trump and his advisers realized the potential political benefit in lobbing these kinds of accusations. Their campaign, which relied heavily on depressing Democratic turnout as a way to win battleground states like Florida and Michigan, stood to gain by fanning the flames of the rivalry between Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton and dredging up the bitterness that many Sanders supporters felt over their loss.Even after winning the election, Mr. Trump continued to claim that Mrs. Clinton had somehow robbed Mr. Sanders of victory. When Donna Brazile, the former Democratic National Committee chairwoman, released a memoir in 2017, Mr. Trump inaccurately said the book showed that Mrs. Clinton ""bought the DNC & then stole the Democratic Primary"" from Mr. Sanders.In an interview, Mr. Fleischer said he had not seen the idea about the timing of the impeachment trial anywhere else and had not consulted with anyone when he first pitched it on Twitter. ""I just do my best to realistically assess what's happening in Washington,"" he said. Mr. Fleischer said he believed that Ms. Pelosi does not think Mr. Sanders can beat Mr. Trump in November, and that ""she has one big thing on her mind: that's winning the White House.""He said his tweet took off because ""if it has merit, it starts to gather momentum.""""If it has no merit, it's just another tweet,"" he added.Republican staff members on Capitol Hill said the theory gained traction because of a broader narrative -- pushed by Mr. Sanders's own supporters -- that Mr. Sanders was generally getting a raw deal from the mainstream news media and other candidates in the race.In a statement on Friday, in response to a question from The New York Times about the president's conspiracy tweet, Mr. Sanders denounced the theories. ""Let's be clear about who is rigging what: It is Donald Trump's action to use the power of the federal government for his own political benefit that is the cause of the impeachment trial,"" he said. ""His transparent attempts to divide Democrats will not work, and we are going to unite to sweep him out of the White House in November.""Ms. Pelosi's team has also made it clear she was not trying to meddle in the nominating process.""Impeachment has nothing to do with politics or the presidential race,"" a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, Drew Hammill, wrote on Twitter this week, responding to Mr. McCarthy's accusation. ""As usual, the Minority Leader has no idea what he's talking about.""On Friday, he added: ""Regardless, Senator Sanders isn't the only senator running, so this doesn't make any sense.""Annie Karni reported from Washington, and Jeremy W. Peters from New York.A journey from Twitter to Fox News to the president's feed.PhotographPresident Trump claimed without evidence that Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, was ""rigging"" the Democratic presidential primary.

| Jump to first hitWeeks ago, his advisers were counting on a strong economy and a Democratic opponent easily portrayed as too far left. But the political landscape has sharply shifted.President Trump faces the biggest challenge yet to his prospects of being re-elected, with his advisers' two major assumptions for the campaign -- a booming economy and an opponent easily vilified as too far left -- quickly evaporating.After a year in which Mr. Trump has told voters that they must support his re-election or risk watching the economy decline, the stock market is reeling and economists are warning that a recession could be on the horizon because of the worsening spread of the coronavirus.And instead of elevating Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, as Mr. Trump made clear was his hope, Democrats have suddenly and decisively swung from a flirtation with socialism to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has run a primary campaign centered on a return to political normalcy.""Biden's success in the suburbs makes him an acceptable alternative to Trump,"" said Scott Reed, the top political adviser for the United States Chamber of Commerce. ""His turnout in the suburbs threatens the Republican Senate.""That presents Mr. Trump with a confounding new political landscape, one that close advisers concede he had seemed unwilling or unable to accept until Wednesday, when he addressed the nation about the pandemic.""If it was Warren or Bernie and you don't have coronavirus, I think Trump might sneak by,"" said Kevin DeWine, the former chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. ""But if it's Biden, 'My I.R.A. has tanked,' and we're going to have complete disruption because of coronavirus, I think it's a totally different story.""Ohio, a traditional presidential battleground that has been trending Republican, would be in play again, Mr. DeWine said. Such Midwestern states were central to Mr. Trump's election in 2016, and are likely to be similarly crucial this year.Of course, what happens in March may ultimately have little bearing in November. Mr. Trump maintains the bully pulpit of the presidency, and Mr. Biden largely avoided intense scrutiny from rivals in a crowded, up-and-down primary campaign.And if there's any constant in the Trump era, it is that what's in the news at a given moment will change in a matter of hours, days or at most weeks. The virus may be mitigated, the economy could rebound, and Mr. Biden's decades of life in Washington and propensity for gaffes may render him as weak a candidate as some of his rivals in the primary had long predicted.Yet if Mr. Trump does lose re-election, the seeds of demise may prove to have been planted in early spring.One challenge for the president is that the type of management response required of chief executives during crises like a pandemic has never been his strength. Empathy and public displays of emotion do not come easily to him. On Twitter, his favorite medium, he has been consumed by how people are perceiving his handling of the crisis and has focused on criticizing Democrats.And so far, he has resisted entreaties from advisers to cancel events, or to send a strong signal that he's willing to put the political season on hold as the full effects of the coronavirus are assessed.""A leader needs to be transparent, clear, empathetic, serious, and all-in,"" said Jeb Bush, a former governor of Florida who ran against Mr. Trump in the 2016 Republican primary and received bipartisan praise for how he handled hurricanes during his tenure. ""A leader needs to communicate consistently and regularly. A leader needs to show his or her heart, which has to be done outside the governor's mansion or the White House.""Mr. Bush added that a leader needs ""to shut down partisan politics and campaigning"" and ""to trust the experts and allow the strategy to be developed with them,"" as well as think about how to deal with the recovery.Mr. Biden, by contrast, has had his entire political life defined by his personal tragedies -- including the death of his wife and daughter decades ago, and then his eldest son, Beau, more recently -- and his efforts to rise from them and encourage others to do the same.On Wednesday afternoon, shortly before he was scheduled to speak to reporters, Mr. Trump rebuked congressional Democrats, who have indicated they aren't waiting for the president's guidance on an economic package to help the economy. ""Someone needs to tell the Democrats in Congress that CoronaVirus doesn't care what party you are in. We need to protect ALL Americans!"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.In interviews, a half-dozen Republicans close to the president's campaign said that his re-election effort had become a political battleship, slow and creaky to turn, unlike the nimble race Mr. Trump ran in 2016. Several advisers worked on Tuesday to persuade Mr. Trump not to let the campaign announce a rally tentatively scheduled for the end of the month in Florida; those advisers ultimately won.Aides have sent mixed signals about how they plan to approach Mr. Biden, with some wanting to portray him as a 2020 version of Hillary Clinton, and others wanting to try to define him as interchangeable with Mr. Sanders because of some of the progressive stances Mr. Biden has adopted.Primary results cannot easily be projected onto general elections, but the surge in Democratic turnout so far has not only helped Mr. Biden, it has also illustrated what may be Mr. Trump's most glaring vulnerability. The former vice president has established a commanding delegate lead in part because of a surge of suburban voters including many from affluent jurisdictions.In Virginia, North Carolina and Michigan -- each a general election battleground -- Mr. Biden benefited from a large increase in turnout among moderate voters in the Washington, Charlotte and Detroit suburbs.In Michigan, for example, over a million and a half voters participated in the Democratic primary Tuesday -- up from just over 1.2 million in 2016 there. But it was where the turnout jumped so much that was revealing and, for Mr. Trump, ominous. In affluent Oakland County, Mitt Romney's boyhood home and an epicenter of the Democrats' 2018 midterm election gains, turnout went from approximately 180,000 in 2016 to about 260,000 on Tuesday.Mr. Trump's team of actual political strategists is small, despite the large staff employed by his campaign, and his campaign manager only recently relocated to Washington, where the headquarters is based. After data leaked early on, information is closely guarded and formal polling is ordered only every few months. On Tuesday, as Mr. Trump sat with advisers in the late morning going over the results of the latest campaign surveys, some of the data was already out of date.Representative Francis Rooney, a Florida Republican who is not seeking re-election, said the likelihood that Mr. Biden would be the nominee alone ""makes this a race.""Mr. Rooney said Mr. Biden was ""moderate, well-reasoned and genuinely likable -- none of those things are what Sanders are.""And echoing a number of leading officials in both parties, Mr. Rooney said that if Mr. Biden wins the nomination, it would illustrate the degree to which 2016 was a referendum on the Democratic nominee rather than on Mr. Trump.""The question is how many people voted for him because they didn't want Hillary Clinton,"" he said, arguing that Mr. Biden's center-left politics effectively made him ""Hillary without the other negatives.""Mr. Trump's advisers argue otherwise -- and indeed it was their enthusiasm for digging into the record of Mr. Biden's son Hunter that led to the president's impeachment.But what alarms many Republicans about the political impact of the virus is that it will so overwhelm the news that it will be difficult to highlight their opposition research about Mr. Biden or draw attention to his gaffes.One prominent party strategist working on a number of congressional races this year said a series of polls taken in the last two weeks showed the president's approval ratings receding to where they were before the 2018 midterms, giving back the gains he made in the aftermath of his impeachment acquittal.This strategist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about Mr. Trump, said he worried the virus and its effects on the economy would make this campaign entirely about the president, much like the 2018 midterms.And no modern president may perform better with a foil or worse when measured in his own right than Mr. Trump.Nonetheless, there have been some constants in terms of how Mr. Trump is perceived by voters.""The president's job approval has bounced around between 42 percent and 46 percent ever since the spring of 2018, so variation within that range should not be interpreted as anything particularly significant,"" said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. ""If he should break above 46 percent or below 42 percent in the polling averages, then I'll start to take that seriously.""Representative Chip Roy, a Texas Republican facing a potentially competitive re-election, said it was premature to make sweeping assessments about an election so far off. ""That's a lifetime in politics, especially today,"" he said.But he did offer Mr. Trump a dose of tough-love advice and, in doing so, he suggested that the president's prospects might hinge in part on how he handles the current health crisis.""Don't talk about politics, just march forward and do your job,"" Mr. Roy said, adding that voters would ask, ""'Did we react properly?' That's how the judgment will fall.""Mr. Rooney was even more pointed, urging Mr. Trump to show leadership and take drastic steps to curb the spread of the virus. ""He ought to be doing what other countries are doing,"" he said, such as urging people to stay home, closing schools and demanding public events be rescheduled. ""It's a serious health risk here and you've got to ask: Where is the United States?""But former Representative Kevin Yoder, a Kansas Republican swept out in the 2018 suburban backlash to Mr. Trump, said that Mr. Biden's ascent had greatly complicated Mr. Trump's prospects.""Joe Biden will be very palatable to some of the same moderates who voted against Republicans in the midterms,"" said Mr. Yoder, predicting that Republicans would need embittered Sanders supporters to stay home because ""we're not going to see a flip back of suburban independents.""Mr. DeWine put it more bluntly: ""If it's Biden, you'll have disaffected Republicans run to the polls to vote for Biden because they're just looking for normal and sane,"" he said.PhotographPresident Trump, who was counting on a racing economy and a strong showing by Senator Bernie Sanders, now faces the prospect of a moderate opponent in former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., left, and a possible recession.

| Jump to first hitOlder voters have easily carried Mr. Biden to victory in multiple primaries. But if he wants to beat President Trump, he will have to win younger voters too -- and that may not be easy.The magnitude of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s recent primary victories has obscured an important schism within the Democratic Party: between the older voters who carried Mr. Biden to victory and the younger voters who overwhelmingly rejected him.The dividing line is around age 45, and it is as stark as a flipped switch. In some states on Tuesday, Mr. Biden won two-thirds or more of voters older than 45, while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont won about two-thirds of voters younger than that.Comparatively low turnout among young voters helped save Mr. Biden in the primaries. But in the general election, a similar lack of turnout could become a huge liability -- a point Mr. Sanders made explicitly on Wednesday as he announced that he would continue his campaign at least through the next debate on Sunday.""I say to the Democratic establishment: In order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""You must speak to the issues of concern to them. You cannot simply be satisfied by winning the votes of people who are older.""Mr. Biden's campaign and some of his supporters have acknowledged this. Unite the Country, a pro-Biden super PAC, said in a memo on Wednesday that winning in November would depend on bringing young voters in. And Mr. Biden's wife, Jill Biden, said at a fund-raiser in Illinois last week that her husband was talking to his staff about ""engaging the youth vote and coming up with some youth advocacy.""But Mr. Biden has been campaigning for nearly a year to represent a party that young voters often prefer, and his lack of support among those voters has been evident for a long time.""What I'm a little nervous that we're in the middle of right now is a repeat of 2016,"" said Sarah Audelo, executive director of the Alliance for Youth Action, who worked on Hillary Clinton's campaign and said it did not invest enough in outreach to young voters during the primaries. ""What that meant was the campaign had to start from scratch in the general, and that is not something Joe Biden can afford to do.""The New York Times spoke with more than 30 young Democrats from 17 states this week, ranging in age from 17 to 34. Most of them said they had voted for Mr. Sanders or planned to do so if he stayed in the race through their state's primary. Some had voted for Senator Elizabeth Warren before she dropped out. Only two said they wanted Mr. Biden to be the nominee.And while many said they would reluctantly vote for Mr. Biden in November for the sake of beating President Trump, about a third said they would consider staying home or voting for a third-party candidate unless Mr. Biden made significant concessions to the party's left wing.They were well aware of his plans to address climate change, student debt and other issues that matter to them -- plans that would help Mr. Biden appeal to young voters, his wife said. But those plans, the young Democrats said, were not the solution to the generational gap among the candidates' supporters; they were a cause.""The plan the Biden campaign put forward for climate change is nowhere near good enough to save our Earth,"" said Benjamin Brumer, 28, who lives in California and said he felt hopeless about his future under either Mr. Trump or Mr. Biden. ""It will be hard, if not impossible, for them to convince me to vote for Biden. But a good first step toward reconciliation would be to make bolder promises for solving climate change.""Lindsay Huber, 29, who lives in Oregon, said that at an ""absolute bare minimum,"" to win her vote, Mr. Biden needed to stop accepting super PAC money and endorse both ""Medicare for all"" and the Green New Deal.""And it would still be difficult to trust that he's being truthful, because he has decades of racist, sexist, corporatist, warmongering votes,"" Ms. Huber said. ""To win us back, the Democratic Party needs to actually listen to us and serve us. Or else they need to die and we will create a new party ourselves.""Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr. Biden's campaign, said his agenda ""would be the most progressive of any administration since the Great Society.""Mr. Trump's ""values and record are repellent to young Americans, who deserve a leader that will mobilize the whole country to overcome the climate emergency, defeat the N.R.A. in order to heal the epidemic of mass shootings, and deliver universal health care,"" Mr. Bates said. ""Both the vice president and Senator Sanders have pledged that either of them will be all in for whomever the Democratic nominee is, and surging turnout has proven how energized our party is to defeat Donald Trump in 2020.""The campaign also pointed to the geographic sweep of Mr. Biden's victories on Tuesday, particularly in Michigan: He won every county there, including those home to the University of Michigan and Michigan State University, which Mr. Sanders won by double-digit margins in 2016, though Mr. Biden's margins there were much smaller than in other parts of the state.From the start, Mr. Biden's argument for his candidacy has centered explicitly on a return to ""normalcy"" after four years of life under Mr. Trump. And that is not what many young voters are looking for.""The Republican Party has moved farther to the right than Democrats have moved to the left, which leaves this huge vacuum, I feel, for younger people who actually want to be a part of a truly progressive movement,"" said Hajar Khalid, 20, a student at Columbia University.Ms. Khalid said she supported Medicare for all and would feel somewhat better about voting for Mr. Biden, should he win the nomination, if he had a more comprehensive health care plan or if he chose a truly progressive running mate.""I want to say that despite all of this, I will still vote for the Democratic Party in the general no matter who it is,"" she said. ""But it's really hard to say that when the other candidate is Joe Biden, who doesn't have any real attractive attributes and whose main message seems to be: 'I won't change anything to help progressive causes, really, but at least I'm not Trump.""'Beyond the disconnect between young progressives' ideals and Mr. Biden's more moderate proposals, there is also a deeper problem: While Mr. Sanders has actively engaged with young people, Mr. Biden has never given much indication that he is seeking their votes at all. At times, he has appeared openly disdainful or condescending toward them.Groups that work with young voters said winning their votes would require speaking more to the policies they want to see enacted, but also considering them in event planning, advertising and communications. And it could mean enlisting surrogates who have more credibility among young voters than Mr. Biden does.""It's going to be up to the campaign to craft messages for young people and develop a really good surrogate program,"" said Anne Moses, founder and president of Ignite, which encourages young women to enter politics. ""I don't think Biden is the best person to speak directly to young people.""The lack of political attention is a tremendous source of frustration for young people: both those who are considering not voting because they feel they are being ignored, and those who are angry with their peers for not voting because it perpetuates their exclusion.""Biden and other Democrats would be more receptive to young people if they actually voted,"" said Ariel Schwartz, 21, a student at SUNY New Paltz. ""Would I like a candidate like Bernie Sanders, who puts young people at the forefront? Of course I would. But young voters didn't turn out in the primaries to support him. That's our generation's mistake. We can't make that same mistake in the general election.""There are many reasons young people are less likely to turn out, ranging from structural obstacles -- including voter suppression on college campuses -- to disillusionment or distaste for all of the available candidates. But one rationale that came up repeatedly this week was that they did not want to be taken for granted.Democrats assume progressives will vote for them ""even as they ignore and dismiss the policy positions most young and progressive voters care about, and yet enough people voted for Jill Stein to lose Hillary the election in multiple key states,"" said Sam Anderson, 25, a New Yorker who plans to vote only in down-ballot races unless the party crafts a more progressive platform and Mr. Biden chooses a progressive running mate.""I worry, win or lose, that the party will learn nothing from this election and continue to dismiss the concerns and policy goals of the younger generation they rely upon,"" Mr. Anderson said. ""The most I can do to influence that at this point is simply not vote and reduce the margin of victory in New York.""Katie Glueck contributed reporting.PhotographLast month, Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitWith President Trump facing an impeachment trial over his efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden, Russian military hackers have been boring into the Ukrainian gas company at the center of the affair, according to security experts.The hacking attempts against Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Hunter Biden served, began in early November, as talk of the Bidens, Ukraine and impeachment was dominating the news in the United States.It is not yet clear what the hackers found, or precisely what they were searching for. But the experts say the timing and scale of the attacks suggest that the Russians could be searching for potentially embarrassing material on the Bidens -- the same kind of information that Mr. Trump wanted from Ukraine when he pressed for an investigation of the Bidens and Burisma, setting off a chain of events that led to his impeachment.The Russian tactics are strikingly similar to what American intelligence agencies say was Russia's hacking of emails from Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman and the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 presidential campaign. In that case, once they had the emails, the Russians used trolls to spread and spin the material, and built an echo chamber to widen its effect.Then, as now, the Russian hackers from a military intelligence unit known formerly as the G.R.U., and to private researchers by the alias ""Fancy Bear,"" used so-called phishing emails that appear designed to steal usernames and passwords, according to Area 1, the Silicon Valley security firm that detected the hacking. In this instance, the hackers set up fake websites that mimicked sign-in pages of Burisma subsidiaries, and have been blasting Burisma employees with emails meant to look like they are coming from inside the company.The hackers fooled some of them into handing over their login credentials, and managed to get inside one of Burisma's servers, Area 1 said.""The attacks were successful,"" said Oren Falkowitz, a co-founder of Area 1, who previously served at the National Security Agency. Mr. Falkowitz's firm maintains a network of sensors on web servers around the globe -- many known to be used by state-sponsored hackers -- which gives the firm a front-row seat to phishing attacks, and allows them to block attacks on their customers.""The timing of the Russian campaign mirrors the G.R.U. hacks we saw in 2016 against the D.N.C. and John Podesta,"" the Clinton campaign chairman, Mr. Falkowitz said. ""Once again, they are stealing email credentials, in what we can only assume is a repeat of Russian interference in the last election.""The Justice Department indicted seven officers from the same military intelligence unit in 2018.The Russian attacks on Burisma appear to be running parallel to an effort by Russian spies in Ukraine to dig up information in the analog world that could embarrass the Bidens, according to an American security official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence. The spies, the official said, are trying to penetrate Burisma and working sources in the Ukrainian government in search of emails, financial records and legal documents.Neither the Russian government nor Burisma responded to requests for comment.American officials are warning that the Russians have grown stealthier since 2016, and are again seeking to steal and spread damaging information and target vulnerable election systems ahead of the 2020 election.[Read: Even as American election defenses have improved, Russian hackers and trolls have become more sophisticated .]In the same vein, Russia has been working since the early days of Mr. Trump's presidency to turn the focus away from its own election interference in 2016 by seeding conspiracy theories about Ukrainian meddling and Democratic complicity.The result has been a muddy brew of conspiracy theories that mix facts, like the handful of Ukrainians who openly criticized Mr. Trump's candidacy, with discredited claims that the D.N.C.'s email server is in Ukraine and that Mr. Biden, as vice president, had corrupt dealings with Ukrainian officials to protect his son. Spread by bots and trolls on social media, and by Russian intelligence officers, the claims resonated with Mr. Trump, who views talk of Russian interference as an attack on his legitimacy.With Mr. Biden's emergence as a front-runner for the Democratic nomination last spring, the president latched on to the corruption allegations, and asked that Ukraine investigate the Bidens on his July 25 call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. The call became central to Mr. Trump's impeachment last month.The Biden campaign sought to cast the Russian effort to hack Burisma as an indication of Mr. Biden's political strength, and to highlight Mr. Trump's apparent willingness to let foreign powers boost his political fortunes.""Donald Trump tried to coerce Ukraine into lying about Joe Biden and a major bipartisan, international anti-corruption victory because he recognized that he can't beat the vice president,"" said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign.""Now we know that Vladimir Putin also sees Joe Biden as a threat,"" Mr. Bates added. ""Any American president who had not repeatedly encouraged foreign interventions of this kind would immediately condemn this attack on the sovereignty of our elections.""The corruption allegations hinge on Hunter Biden's work on the Burisma board. The company hired Mr. Biden while his father was vice president and leading the Obama administration's Ukraine policy, including a successful push to have Ukraine's top prosecutor fired for corruption. The effort was backed by European allies.The story has since been recast by Mr. Trump and some of his staunchest defenders, who say Mr. Biden pushed out the prosecutor because Burisma was under investigation and his son could be implicated. Rudolph W. Giuliani, acting in what he says was his capacity as Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, has personally taken up investigating the Bidens and Burisma, and now regularly claims to have uncovered clear-cut evidence of wrongdoing.The evidence, though, has yet to emerge, and now the Russians appear to have joined the hunt.Area 1 researchers discovered a G.R.U. phishing campaign on Ukrainian companies on New Year's Eve. A week later, Area 1 determined what the Ukrainian targets had in common: They were all subsidiaries of Burisma Holdings, the company at the center of Mr. Trump's impeachment. Among the Burisma subsidiaries phished were KUB-Gas, Aldea, Esko-Pivnich, Nadragas, Tehnocom-Service and Pari. The targets also included Kvartal 95, a Ukrainian television production company founded by Mr. Zelensky. The phishing attack on Kvartal 95 appears to have been aimed at digging up email correspondence for the company's chief, Ivan Bakanov, whom Mr. Zelensky appointed as the head of Ukraine's Security Service last June.To steal employees' credentials, the G.R.U. hackers directed Burisma to their fake login pages. Area 1 was able to trace the look-alike sites through a combination of internet service providers frequently used by G.R.U.'s hackers, rare web traffic patterns, and techniques that have been used in previous attacks against a slew of other victims, including the 2016 hack of the D.N.C. and a more recent Russian hack of the World Anti-Doping Agency.""The Burisma hack is a cookie-cutter G.R.U. campaign,"" Mr. Falkowitz said. ""Russian hackers, as sophisticated as they are, also tend to be lazy. They use what works. And in this, they were successful.""PhotographAt the offices in Kyiv of Esco-Pvinich, a subsidiary of the Ukrainian energy company Burisma.

| Jump to first hitThe largest presidential battleground state looked to be slipping away from Democrats. Then Joe Biden started winning primaries.MIAMI -- A sense of doom spread not long ago among weary Florida Democrats, and not over a viral pandemic.They had lost winnable races for governor and Senate two years ago in nail-biter recounts. Many now feared that the state's voters, with their reflexive disdain for political revolution, would spurn Bernie Sanders in November, giving President Trump a far easier path to re-election.Florida's long status as a swing state could be over.Then came Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s resurgence. Democratic leaders, who expect Mr. Biden to trounce Mr. Sanders in Tuesday's primary, began breathing more easily. But come November, clawing back votes in the nation's biggest battleground state will still be a daunting task.For all of the state's foibles, from Florida Man to hanging chads, Florida remains a microcosm of the country, a mirror reflecting the contradictions and divisions of the national electorate. It is a primary state that offers a glimpse of the general election, in terms of which candidates win and, perhaps more important, which voters show up.""If you can win in Florida, you can win anywhere,"" said Rosy González Speers, executive director of Forward Florida Action, a voter registration organization. ""You have a tough electorate, an unpredictable electorate, a close electorate.""Florida is a political amalgamation of several regions of the country. The liberal southeast, from Miami to West Palm Beach, votes like the Northeast. The traditional southwest, including Naples and Sarasota, votes like the Midwest. The conservative north, especially the Panhandle, votes like the South. The swing middle -- the Interstate 4 corridor that political pundits drool over during election years -- is up for grabs.This diversity poses big campaign challenges. For every expanding demographic force (Puerto Ricans in the Orlando area for Democrats), there is another force to match or surpass it (Midwestern retirees on the Gulf Coast for Republicans). For every sterling economic indicator, such as the state's 3 percent unemployment rate, there is a sobering statistic to counter it, such as the 13 percent of people without health insurance.And there is no telling what the coronavirus, which threatens the state's $86 billion-a-year tourism industry and its more than five million people over the age of 60 -- about a quarter of Floridians -- will do to the state's economy and population.""I no longer buy this whole notion of the American dream,"" said Maritza Lacayo, 29, a curator at the Pérez Art Museum in Miami, echoing the concerns of other younger Democrats. ""I hear all of my friends, who come from so many different countries, and they're like, 'Of course we're living a better life, but I have $100,000 in student debt. I can't open a credit card.""'Ms. Lacayo volunteered for Mr. Sanders's primary campaign in 2016, but preferred Elizabeth Warren this time around, thinking she might be more electable. Ms. Lacayo, whose parents emigrated from Nicaragua in 1981, said she had seen opportunities shrink for her generation, especially in Miami, a city of expensive housing and low-paying service jobs that consistently ranks as one of the most unequal in the country. ""My parents had it a little bit easier,"" she said.For Democrats, winning requires a Goldilocks-style balance: turning out base voters in cities in South and Central Florida while also keeping Republican margins close in rural and exurban areas in Southwest and North Florida. In 2016, Hillary Clinton did the former exceptionally well but the latter not so much, costing her the state and the presidency.The party's subsequent 2018 losses offered little clarity on how to cobble together a winning coalition. In a successful year for Democrats nationally, Senator Bill Nelson, a moderate Democratic incumbent, lost his seat by about 10,000 votes, and Andrew Gillum, the progressive nominee for governor, lost by about 32,000 votes. Florida, which has not elected a Democratic governor since 1994, felt like it was slipping away from the party.Since then, party leaders have made several calculations about how to try to win in 2020: Mobilize black voters, as Mr. Gillum did. Hold on to Jewish voters, as Mr. Nelson did. Focus on health care, education and climate change, issues that lifted moderate candidates in competitive congressional districts by attracting suburban voters, especially women.Given big suburban turnouts in the recent Virginia and Michigan primaries, it could be a promising sign for Democrats on Tuesday night if they see more interest than in 2016 from voters in places like Pasco County, near Tampa, and St. Johns County, near Jacksonville.""The Republicans, I feel, have lost their way,"" said Caroline Zucker, 81, the chairwoman of the Sarasota County school board and a lifelong Republican who switched parties last month to vote Democratic for the first time. ""They're not for the people -- they're for the more affluent people. I found the inclusiveness of the Democratic Party to be much more appealing.""""This country was built on immigrants, and to see what's happening with the kids left at the border,"" Ms. Zucker added with a deep sigh, ""it just breaks my heart.""Cecilia Tavera-Webman, 63, who attended a Biden campaign event in Doral last week, said worrying over politics and the state of the country has made her gain weight since 2016: ""The Trump 10, I call them.""""My health insurance keeps going up -- I'm paying $750 a month,"" said Ms. Tavera-Webman, a realtor. ""There's no maternity leave, no paternity leave. And the guns -- putting people with guns in our schools? We need to do better.""When voters approved a landmark ballot measure two years ago to restore the voting rights of Floridians with felony convictions, Democrats hoped that expanding the electorate might give the party a boost. But the Republican-controlled Legislature and Gov. Ron DeSantis imposed financial requirements last year that would keep nearly 775,000 former felons ineligible, according to a recent analysis conducted for civil-rights organizations that are challenging the restrictions in court.An urgent task for Democrats has been to ease the concerns of Hispanics who are spooked by how the party has jogged to the political left. Latinos have flocked to Mr. Sanders elsewhere in the country, but not in Florida, the heart of the diaspora of Cubans, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who fled left-wing authoritarianism and whose support Mr. Trump has worked to consolidate.Other than older Cubans, Florida Hispanics tend to lean Democratic, but often have a visceral negative reaction toward any discussion of socialism. Mr. Sanders describes himself as a democratic socialist who wants to resurrect New Deal-style policymaking. Still, a Telemundo poll this week showed 70 percent of Florida Hispanics would not vote for a candidate who describes himself as socialist.At stake is the voter math in all-important Miami-Dade County, the most populous county in the state, where 69 percent of residents are Hispanic. If Democrats fail to win big in Miami-Dade, they cannot make up the deficit elsewhere. Mrs. Clinton routed Mr. Trump by 290,000 votes in the county, and even that margin was not wide enough for statewide victory.After the defeats of 2018, even Mr. Gillum, who initially dismissed the Republican attack that he was a ""socialist,"" has concluded that Democrats must come up with a good response.One approach has been to cast Mr. Trump as authoritarian.The Florida arm of Priorities USA, a leading Democratic super PAC, began calling the president a ""caudillo,"" a word used in Latin America to refer to strongmen. This came after interviews with Hispanic voters in the state, who said unprompted that they feared the United States could slide into authoritarianism reminiscent of what they or their families had fled in Latin America. Earlier this month, the Florida Democratic Party devoted one of its weekly paid programs on Spanish-language radio in Miami to the subject.""The attacks on the press, the insults to politicians -- all of this behavior by Donald Trump tracks a lot with what us Venezuelans saw with Hugo Chávez,"" said Maurizio Passariello, a political consultant and talk radio host.The goal is to hold on to voters like Natacha Ferrera, 45, who was persuaded by her daughter to register as a Democrat in 2018. The family immigrated to Miami from Cuba in 2001 and felt a natural inclination toward Republicans, Ms. Ferrera said, until the party nominated Mr. Trump.""We started changing when we heard President Trump's rhetoric, which at times we found offensive, especially against women and immigrants -- legal and illegal,"" Ms. Ferrera said. ""It's not about voting for a party. It's about voting for a better future as immigrants.""Her daughter, Daniela Ferrera, 22, said hearing Mr. Sanders push for government-run health care reminded her of seeing her cousin in Cuba dying at a hospital last year without drinking water or medication. She fears that a too-liberal platform in the general election would cost Democrats dearly.""It's heartbreaking to me,"" said Ms. Ferrera, who is enthusiastic about Mr. Biden's candidacy. ""Because we've been making so many inroads with the Cuban-American community.""Susan C. Beachy contributed research.PhotographThe polling site at West Miami City Hall, above, is set up for Tuesday's presidential primary.

| Jump to first hitMr. Sanders and his aides are now struggling to reconcile a sense of resignation with a desire to press on, and some allies are urging the senator to stay in the race.Senator Bernie Sanders jabbed his finger in the air. He left Joseph R. Biden Jr. resorting to misstatements to defend his stance on bankruptcy legislation. He instructed viewers to ""go to the YouTube"" to check out the former vice president's record themselves.It was not the kind of debate performance suggesting a candidate ready for reconciliation.After delivering a speech last week that appeared aimed at de-escalating the primary battle against Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders laced into his opponent on Sunday night with a vigor that signaled that the fight -- if not for delegates, then for the soul of the Democratic Party -- was not over.Under intense pressure to win nominating contests and already grappling with the effects of the coronavirus on the election, Mr. Sanders and his aides are now struggling to reconcile a sense of resignation and a desire to press on.Yet even as his path to the nomination looks increasingly bleak, with Mr. Biden favored in three more primaries on Tuesday, some allies are publicly urging Mr. Sanders to remain in the race, eager for him to continue to pitch voters on a liberal agenda that he has promoted for decades.""I want the senator to stay in,"" Nina Turner, one of the campaign's national co-chairs, said in an interview on Monday. ""I think other voters have a right to have a choice. This is not a coronation. We know what happened last time in 2016 -- it gave us Donald J. Trump.""This campaign, she added, was ""the culmination of this man's life's work.""The decision on whether to drop out or continue the campaign is one that ultimately rests with Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane Sanders, allies and friends say. His inner circle has only grown smaller in recent days, and hardly anyone on his campaign is willing to speculate where he may land.Some Sanders aides and supporters privately acknowledge that his chances are daunting if not impossible given the broad coalition of Democrats that Mr. Biden appears to have assembled, and Mr. Sanders's inability to bring new voters under his tent. But they describe Mr. Sanders as a fighter, and a headstrong one, whose instinct will be to keep battling. They also see an advantage in continuing to accrue delegates to use as leverage in negotiations with Mr. Biden over potential policy concessions.To several Sanders aides and allies, the aggressiveness their candidate showed on the debate stage was a way of holding Mr. Biden accountable on the issues Mr. Sanders cares deeply about, perhaps fueled by the faint hope that he can persuade voters that he remains the best choice to consolidate the party and defeat President Trump.""Even though Joe Biden is ahead in delegates at the moment, he is far from unifying the party,"" Jeff Weaver, a longtime Sanders adviser, said after the debate. ""And he hasn't made the case that he can provide the kind of inspired leadership necessary to beat Donald Trump.""Still, the campaign has not made a major television ad buy since last Wednesday, when it added about $2 million worth, though it did add another $250,000 worth on Thursday, spread across three states originally scheduled to vote on Tuesday: Florida, Illinois and Ohio (on Monday Ohio moved to postpone its primary). And Mr. Sanders risks looking out of step with the times if he persists in extending the primary against long odds, while the nation is in the middle of a public health crisis.Even some of his biggest supporters suggested that the race was effectively over and that the time had come for Democrats to unite behind Mr. Biden.""The chance of getting the nomination is so tiny, the stakes are so high given Trump and coronavirus and the economic fallout, that he does need to face that reality,"" Robert Reich, a former labor secretary who endorsed Mr. Sanders, said in an interview on Monday.Mr. Reich said that some onus was on Mr. Biden to demonstrate to Mr. Sanders that he is sufficiently devoted to progressive causes. The former vice president could do that, Mr. Reich said, by naming Mr. Sanders as a top policy adviser to his campaign or by naming Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as his running mate.""It's the only way he's going to get the type of enthusiasm he needs,"" he said.With the Democratic primary at an inflection point as Mr. Sanders considers his next steps, Mr. Biden's campaign has tried to strike a balance between acting presidential, as if he will be the nominee, and not alienating Mr. Sanders and his loyalists. Last Wednesday, hours after Mr. Biden had collected four more victories, his aides seemed reluctant to call on Mr. Sanders to drop out even as they sent out a memo describing Mr. Biden's lead as nearly insurmountable.""Should our broad base of support remain -- and we have seen no signs that would indicate otherwise -- it will be nearly impossible for Sanders to recoup his current delegate disadvantage,"" the Biden campaign memo said.After Mr. Sanders refrained from attacking Mr. Biden at a news conference that afternoon, and instead presented a list of policy priorities, some of Mr. Biden's backers hoped the debate would be the next step toward unifying the party around his candidacy. Mr. Biden's team believed it had extended an olive branch to Sanders loyalists in the hours before the debate, embracing a version of a plan Mr. Sanders has championed that calls for tuition-free public college for many students.So some Biden backers said they were caught off guard when Mr. Sanders spent much of Sunday's debate criticizing Mr. Biden's long record, which revived their broader frustrations with some of Mr. Sanders's surrogates who have slashed Mr. Biden in more starkly personal terms.""I didn't expect some of the sharp elbows we saw from the senator,"" said state Representative Malcolm Kenyatta, Democrat of Pennsylvania and a Biden supporter, even as he praised Mr. Sanders's pledge to support the eventual nominee.There were more overt indications of displeasure from the Biden camp directly after the debate. Anita Dunn, Mr. Biden's chief strategist, compared Mr. Sanders to a political demonstrator, telling reporters that the former vice president had spent the debate ""graciously dealing with the kind of protester who often shows up at campaign events, on live television.""Some Sanders advisers are still hoping to eke out victories on Tuesday in Illinois and Arizona but are also cognizant that the outlook looks increasingly challenging. A poll released on Monday showed Mr. Sanders trailing Mr. Biden in Arizona by 20 percentage points. Florida also votes on Tuesday, and aides acknowledge that the state at this point is effectively out of reach. And in a blow that was long in coming, Washington State's final results were announced on Monday, with Mr. Biden emerging as the victor after nearly a week of counting ballots.Beyond that, the crisis surrounding the coronavirus has cast a cloud of uncertainty over the race, scrambling the primary, forcing Mr. Sanders to forgo his signature rallies and making the process even more unpredictable.Speaking with CNN after the debate, Mr. Sanders openly questioned the wisdom of holding primaries during a pandemic.""I would hope governors listen to the public health experts and what they are saying is, you just indicated, we don't want gatherings of more than 50 people,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""I'm thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people, all that stuff. It does not make a lot of sense.""Establishment Democrats are desperately hoping to avoid a reprise of 2016, when Mr. Sanders battled to the bitter end against Hillary Clinton; his posture enraged some in the party who later blamed him for stoking division among Democrats that led to her loss to Mr. Trump.There have been more recent signs that he is reluctant to give up without a fight.Asked recently whether his attacks would weaken Mr. Biden in the general election against Mr. Trump, Mr. Sanders grew exasperated. ""I heard that back in 2016,"" he told reporters in Phoenix, before asking whether anointing a candidate before the race was over was ""really what democracy is about.""In an enduring sign of strength, his campaign said it raised $2 million on Sunday, and has hit 10 million individual contributions.Those close to Mr. Sanders say he may want to forge ahead not because he thinks he can still win but to keep his political revolution alive.""This is about building that movement for change, not just about him,"" said Larry Cohen, the chairman of the Sanders-aligned group Our Revolution. ""Obviously, he wants to be the president on every level, but it's much deeper than that.""Even if Mr. Sanders does decide to soldier on, his campaign will be severely curtailed because of guidelines for containing the coronavirus demand, a new reality that is not lost on many of his advisers.In recent days, some of Mr. Sanders's closest advisers, including his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir; Ari Rabin-Havt, a deputy campaign manager; and Mr. Weaver, decamped to Burlington to strategize there. Several of them gathered around a wood-burning stove on Saturday as Mr. Sanders live-streamed a ""fireside chat.""None have said much publicly, but on Monday the campaign sent a fund-raising email noting that ""this primary is far from over.""Nick Corasaniti, Reid J. Epstein and Katie Glueck contributed reporting.PhotographSome allies are urging Bernie Sanders to press on in the race for the Democratic nomination.
