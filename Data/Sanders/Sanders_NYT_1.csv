| Jump to first hitAs the primary race becomes a battle of all against all, and the field suddenly seems to be constricting, the divisiveness and negative attacks are rising.No one has tagged a rival with a bully-boy nickname like ""Sleepy"" or ""Liddle.""But as push comes to shove in the Democratic primary, candidates and their surrogates have descended to a level of personal animus that was rare before the era of President Trump.On Monday, Joseph R. Biden Jr. launched a digital ad in South Carolina saying Bernie Sanders ""can't be trusted"" after weighing a 2012 primary against ""our first African-American president,"" Barack Obama.After Pete Buttigieg attacked Mr. Sanders's victory in Nevada, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York lectured Mr. Buttigieg on Twitter, saying ""not to be so smug when you just got your ass kicked.""And lest last week's Democratic debate recede into history (it was just five days ago), one memorable and searing moment was a highly personal exchange in which Mr. Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar dripped contempt for each other, with Ms. Klobuchar saying, ""I wish everyone was as perfect as you, Pete.""As the primary race becomes a battle of all against all, ""Hunger Games""-style, and the field suddenly seems to be constricting, the divisiveness and negative attacks are rising. Mr. Sanders's commanding win in Nevada -- he earned 24 pledged delegates as the final results were tallied Monday, with Mr. Biden taking nine and Mr. Buttigieg, three -- has triggered alarm among some center-left Democratic officials and voters. His moderate challengers have sought in vain to push one another to the exits to consolidate the anti-Sanders vote.Past presidential primaries certainly had their share of negative campaigning. But much of the intraparty warfare used to be waged behind the scenes -- through ""oppo dumps"" of compromising research against opponents or anonymous criticism in newspaper stories. Today the combination of social media democratization and Mr. Trump's habit of lobbing nasty personal attacks have removed the filters.""Candidates always tried to stay above it and never get down deeply in the mud,"" said Joe Lockhart, a former press secretary for former President Bill Clinton. ""Trump has changed that. He's modeled the idea that the presidential candidates are the ones to make the sharpest attacks, and there's no bottom.""On Saturday night, after Mr. de Blasio, a surrogate for Mr. Sanders, tweeted at Mr. Buttigieg, saying ""Dude, show some humility,"" Mr. Lockhart immediately replied to the New York mayor, ""Who cares what you think?""Four or five years ago, Mr. Lockhart said in an interview, he would have had to phone a reporter to weigh in, and the mainstream press, acting as gatekeeper, might or might not have quoted him.Now, ""there's the ability for people to have their own platforms,"" he said. ""I tweeted it, and got back to my dinner.""David Pepper, chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party, lamented that the last debate, which smashed records as the most watched Democratic presidential debate ever, was so intensely negative. ""My worry is that everyone looked so mad at each other,"" he said. ""When every person on the stage has their oppo ready to go and delivers it with such ferocity, you may win that individual skirmish, but you're giving away the bigger picture -- the need for people to be inspired.""Yes, there are many examples of Democratic rivals turning negative in past primary races. Strategists for Hillary Clinton in 2008 dangled Mr. Obama's youthful drug use. In 2016, Mrs. Clinton accused Mr. Sanders of smearing her for receiving donations from rich people.But those digs feel pretty innocent compared to this year, when a burst of gloves-off negativity seems to have been triggered by the prospect of a staunchly leftist nominee in Mr. Sanders, the late entry of Michael R. Bloomberg and a fierce fight over which moderate candidate ought to be Mr. Sanders's leading foil.On Sunday night, Mr. Sanders praised Fidel Castro for Cuba's literacy program on ""60 Minutes."" Many responses from fellow Democrats were searing, including two congresswomen from Florida with sizable Cuban electorates. ""As the first South American immigrant member of Congress who proudly represents thousands of Cuban Americans, I find Senator Bernie Sanders' comments on Castro's Cuba absolutely unacceptable,"" Representative Debbi Mucarsel-Powell, one of the Florida congresswomen, said on Twitter.Fernand Amandi, a pollster and political consultant in South Florida, went further: ""Democrats, nominating this man will absolutely re-elect @realDonaldTrump and end our Constitutional republic,"" he wrote.With seven Democrats set to appear in another presidential debate on Tuesday in South Carolina, the negativity is unlikely to let up. Mr. Buttigieg previewed that he would continue to try to undermine Mr. Sanders as a high-risk choice. On Monday, he tweeted that after Mr. Sanders's ""60 Minutes"" interview, it would be disastrous to nominate the self-described democratic socialist ""after four years of looking on in horror as Trump cozied up to dictators.""On election night in Nevada, Mr. Buttigieg, who has been the most aggressive in taking on Mr. Sanders, said his rival ""believes in an inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans.""Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, is also highly likely to be a broad target again. At the debate last week, Elizabeth Warren pushed Mr. Bloomberg hard over derogatory comments he had made about women, and his settlements with former employees that kept some women from discussing such incidents. The blowback led Mr. Bloomberg later to release three women from nondisclosure agreements.Not everyone is unhappy about a fierce primary fight.Former Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia said it was entirely reasonable that candidates were probing one another's vulnerabilities. ""Senator Sanders, the current front-runner, has not faced true sustained scrutiny in either of his runs for president,"" Mr. McAuliffe said. ""So it's much better to understand his electability now in the primary than to not know until he's facing Donald Trump's smear machine.""And Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist, was glad for the new tenor of the primary. It reveals who has the steel for the coming showdown of the general election, he said.""It's one thing to tell people about your agenda, it's another to show people how hard you'll fight for it, but that's what candidates are starting to do, and it's about time,"" said Mr. Ferguson, who worked for Mrs. Clinton in 2016.""Democrats want a nominee who will be the general to lead us into battle against Donald Trump,"" he continued. ""They're not going to promote someone to that role unless they've proven they can win a few skirmishes first.""PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at the debate last week in Las Vegas. Mr. Biden has been attacking Mr. Sanders's trustworthiness as the South Carolina primary approaches.

| Jump to first hitIn the most contentious debate so far, Joseph R. Biden Jr. challenged Bernie Sanders over gun regulation, and Amy Klobuchar accused Pete Buttigieg of presenting himself as a ""cool newcomer.""MANCHESTER, N.H. -- The two victors in the Iowa caucuses, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., came under sharp and sustained criticism in a Democratic presidential debate on Friday, as their rivals tried to stop their momentum by assailing Mr. Sanders for his left-wing ideas and past opposition to gun control while targeting Mr. Buttigieg over his thin résumé and ties to big donors.In the most contentious debate so far, taking place four days before the New Hampshire primary, the runners-up in Iowa charged at Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg, who appeared in the best position among the top candidates to win New Hampshire and perhaps take command of the race.But their opponents, several of whom have significant advantages of their own, showed that they would not give way without a fight: Mr. Buttigieg especially came in for bruising treatment, drawing tough challenges from every other candidate onstage, including over his criminal-justice record as mayor and his failure so far to appeal to black and Latino voters.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., seeking to recover from his limp finish in Iowa, raised the issue of Mr. Buttigieg's lack of support among minorities in the opening moments of the debate, saying Mr. Buttigieg had not shown he could ""get a broad scope of support."" He repeatedly alluded throughout the evening to his own base among African-Americans, especially in South Carolina, whose primary is this month and is considered a political firewall if his flagging campaign does not recover before then.But Mr. Buttigieg was not Mr. Biden's only target: He also warned that nominating Mr. Sanders would taint down-ballot Democratic candidates with the label of socialism, and, in his most blunt attack so far on Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden rebuked him for having opposed gun control legislation in the 1990s. Mr. Sanders, who has long since disavowed that stance, called it a function of representing ""a very, very rural state.""The gun issue was a major point of vulnerability for Mr. Sanders in his 2016 bid for the Democratic nomination, but until now had not been a significant part of the 2020 campaign.More than a year after the first candidates entered the race, the main divide in the party, whether to enact incremental policy steps or pursue transformational change, was on vivid display throughout the night, and the question of which approach would be more appealing to general election voters was just as divisive.For Mr. Biden, and two other major candidates, Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, the debate was a crucial, and perhaps final, opportunity to reassert themselves in the race and to prevent Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders from establishing a tight grip on their respective wings of the party -- Mr. Sanders on the left, and Mr. Buttigieg closer to the political center.Yet despite the high stakes there were no standout moments of the sort that have transformed past primaries here, and the most aggressive of the seven candidates on the stage, Ms. Klobuchar, was polling well behind the New Hampshire front-runners.Just as he benefited in Iowa from his moderate challengers' slicing up the same share of voters, Mr. Sanders enjoyed the most speaking time on Friday. He used much of it to reprise his well-honed progressive argument while his center-left rivals often assailed one another and Ms. Warren declined multiple opportunities to attack him.Mr. Sanders, however, has taken heat before in presidential debates. For Mr. Buttigieg -- apparently the joint winner, with Mr. Sanders, of the split-decision Iowa caucuses -- the debate on Friday was by far his most strenuous test of the campaign.Ms. Klobuchar, reprising a familiar role as Mr. Buttigieg's sternest critic, said he was presenting himself as a ""cool newcomer"" by dismissing the value of government experience. ""It's easy to go after Washington, because that's a popular thing to do,"" she said. ""It is much harder to lead and much harder to take those difficult positions.""Ms. Klobuchar added, ""We got a newcomer in the White House and look where it got us.""But she was not the only candidate to go after Mr. Buttigieg. When the former mayor repeatedly deflected a moderator's question about racial disparities in drug arrests by the South Bend police, Ms. Warren said flatly that Mr. Buttigieg had not given a substantial answer. ""You have to own up to the facts,"" she said.Mr. Sanders, too, took on Mr. Buttigieg, despite having largely ignored him in previous debates. When Mr. Buttigieg attacked his rival's signature health care proposal, known as ""Medicare for all,"" Mr. Sanders swiped at Mr. Buttigieg's close ties to ""big money interests.""""Unlike some of the campaigns up here,"" Mr. Sanders said, ""I don't have 40 billionaires, Pete, contributing to my campaign.""Even Andrew Yang, the former tech entrepreneur who has rarely used his debate appearances to target his rivals, saw an opportunity to take on Mr. Buttigieg. ""Pete, fundamentally, you are missing the lesson of Donald Trump's victory,"" Mr. Yang said after Mr. Buttigieg denounced the Trump presidency. ""Donald Trump is not the cause of all of our problems. And we are making a mistake when we act like he is.""But like Mr. Sanders himself, in the moments when he was under attack, Mr. Buttigieg gave no ground, arguing determinedly for his own distinctive approach to the 2020 race. He batted away skepticism of his lack of service in the highest levels of government and rejected Mr. Sanders's demand for purity in political fund-raising. The Trump campaign would be coming at the eventual Democratic nominee with an immense war chest, Mr. Buttigieg said, arguing that ""we need to go into that fight with everything that we've got.""And in a sign of his confidence in his positioning as a Washington outsider, Mr. Buttigieg conceded the point on his lack of traditional qualifications for the presidency, seeming to imply that voters who were looking for a candidate with that profile already had an option in Mr. Biden.""I freely admit that if you're looking for the person with the most years of Washington establishment experience under their belt,"" Mr. Buttigieg said, ""then you've got your candidate and of course it's not me.""He countered criticism from Mr. Biden and Ms. Klobuchar, who accused him of minimizing his party's work in Washington, by respectfully relegating those accomplishments to the past. ""Those achievements were phenomenally important because they met the moment,"" Mr. Buttigieg said. ""But now we have to meet this moment, and this moment is different.""The flurry of attacks and reprisals was unsurprising so close to the primary here, and with polls showing the two top-performing Iowa candidates also leading in New Hampshire. What was striking, though, was that, after finishing in a distant third in Iowa, Ms. Warren recited her familiar attacks on corruption and largely shied away from confronting her rivals. Even when given the chance to take on Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg, she offered only the most glancing critiques before returning to her broader message.The debate came at a moment of tumult and anxiety for Democrats, whose leadoff contest in Iowa on Monday turned into a fiasco of technical breakdowns, stalled and fumbled vote-counting and accusations of electoral illegitimacy from multiple presidential campaigns. On Friday afternoon, Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders both claimed victory in Iowa on different grounds, with Mr. Sanders brandishing his lead in the popular vote and Mr. Buttigieg staking his claim on a hairbreadth lead over Mr. Sanders in state delegates, the traditional metric for judging a winner in the caucuses there.In his first answer of the night, Mr. Biden conceded that the political currents were against him in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, and tried to set high expectations for Mr. Sanders, who captured the state easily in 2016.""I took a hit in Iowa and I'll probably take a hit here,"" Mr. Biden said, adding, ""Bernie won by 20 points last time.""The discussion of electability was not confined to Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg: Ms. Warren, hammering at a theme that has come to define her campaign, argued that Democrats could unite their party and win crossover support in the general election by campaigning against corruption. ""We can bring in independents and Republicans on that,"" Ms. Warren said. ""They hate the corruption as well.""Tom Steyer, the wealthy investor, said the party's nominee had to be able to win support from minority voters, a feat he noted that Mr. Buttigieg had not yet managed. By contrast, Mr. Steyer added, in an awkwardly clinical turn of phrase, that a recent poll showed that he had ""24 percent of blacks in South Carolina"" supporting him.One of the most searing exchanges involved Mr. Sanders's record on gun regulation. Defending himself against Mr. Biden's criticism, Mr. Sanders noted his poor ratings from the National Rifle Association, and said his votes in the past owed in part to his representing a state with a gun-owning tradition.""I represented that perspective,"" he said. ""The world has changed.""Sensing an opening, Mr. Biden noted he had represented gun owners in Delaware but still pushed through gun control legislation as a senator.""While I was pushing the Brady background checks, Bernie voted five times against them when he was in the House,"" Mr. Biden said. And the former vice president went even further, alluding to the wave of gun violence in the 1990s.""Bernie, while you were representing your constituency, a lot of people came around,"" he said, citing those who were ""getting killed by the thousands during that same period.""While the candidates attacked and counterattacked one another with gusto, they saved their most searing critiques for President Trump. Mr. Biden played to the Democratic-leaning live audience on the campus of St. Anselm College by urging everyone to stand and applaud for Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the decorated Iraq war veteran on the National Security Council who testified in the impeachment hearings and was marched out of the White House on Friday. ""Stand up and clap for Vindman,"" Mr. Biden said. ""That's who we are. We are not who Trump is.""In a series of exchanges on foreign policy, the candidates expressed an overlapping skepticism about the continuing American military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. Ms. Warren, departing from her usual focus on domestic policy, said she believed it was ""time to stop this endless war in Afghanistan,"" noting without naming names that there were candidates willing to leave troops there for years to come.""We cannot wait five more years or 10 more years,"" she said, ""or until we turn the corner 10 more times.""Mr. Biden, who has faced criticism a number of times, including from Mr. Buttigieg on Friday night, for having supported the 2003 invasion of Iraq, said for the first time in a debate that he had disagreed with the Obama administration's approach to Afghanistan.""I was totally opposed to the whole notion of nation-building in Afghanistan,"" Mr. Biden said, adding that he still believed it was possible to stop ""attacks from the region"" targeting the United States.The most sweeping expression of skepticism about military engagement overseas came from Mr. Sanders, who stood by his criticism of the American strike last month that killed Qassim Suleimani, the Iranian military commander, which the senator characterized as an assassination.""You cannot go around saying, 'You're a bad guy, we're going to assassinate you,"" Mr. Sanders said, predicting that would lead to ""international anarchy.""PhotographFrom left, Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitThe rift between Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren over electability rose to the surface in the Democratic debate, and the candidates also sparred over their stances on war.DES MOINES -- The Democratic presidential candidates clashed in starkly personal terms Tuesday over who had the best chance to defeat President Trump, as Senator Elizabeth Warren sought to jump-start her campaign in the last debate before the Iowa caucuses by highlighting her electoral success and that of other female candidates in the Trump era.Prompted by the moderators, Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders continued a back-and-forth over the fraught subject of whether a woman could be elected president, an issue that in recent days had caused the first serious breach in their relationship. One day after she confirmed a report that Mr. Sanders had told her in a private meeting that he did not think a woman could defeat Mr. Trump, Ms. Warren trumpeted her Senate victory over an incumbent Republican and then gestured down the debate stage toward the four male candidates.""Collectively they have lost 10 elections,"" she said, before acknowledging the only other female candidate present, Senator Amy Klobuchar. ""The only people on this stage who have won every single election they have been in are the women: Amy and me. And the only person on this stage who has beaten an incumbent Republican in the past 30 years is me.""Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren's top rival for progressive support, flatly denied that he had made the comment when the two lawmakers met without aides in 2018. He said it was ""incomprehensible that I would think that a woman couldn't be president of the United States,"" noting Hillary Clinton had won the popular vote in the 2016 general election.Meeting less than three weeks before Iowans vote, the Democrats disagreed over international affairs and keeping troops in the Middle East, whether to support Mr. Trump's trade deal for North America, how aggressively to tackle climate change and, yet again, health care. But the issue animating much of the evening was the same question that has shaped the primary race for the past year: which of them would be the most formidable contender against Mr. Trump.The contest has increasingly revolved around questions of electability, but the matter has become more urgent in the weeks since hostilities increased between the United States and Tehran after the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the powerful Iranian commander. Much of Tuesday's debate, which featured six of the remaining candidates, touched on national security as the Democrats excoriated Mr. Trump, urged caution in the Middle East and laid claim to the mantle of being the best potential commander in chief.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. came under far less scrutiny than his standing as the national front-runner might have merited in the final debate before voting begins in Iowa on Feb. 3. Just as notable, Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., who has slipped in Iowa, seemed satisfied to make his own case without sharply criticizing his top rivals.New polls in Iowa show that Democratic voters are roughly split between four top candidates: Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders of Vermont, Ms. Warren of Massachusetts and Mr. Buttigieg.But while Mr. Sanders was criticized for the cost of his plans, Ms. Warren for how many people would be turned off by hers and Mr. Buttigieg for the scope of his ambitions, Mr. Biden went long stretches on Tuesday receiving scant attention.The debate unfolded at an extraordinarily volatile moment in American politics, with impeachment looming and escalated tensions with Iran. Yet befitting the setting and the stakes of the debate, multiple candidates -- Ms. Warren, Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Klobuchar -- were just as eager to invoke Iowa and stories of specific Iowans they had met along the campaign trail, tailoring their pitch to the crucial state.But the contretemps between Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders was the most memorable moment in the lead-up to the caucuses here. It was a remarkable exchange between the two senators, in part because they are friends and have labored to abide by a de facto nonaggression pact for the past year. But more important, it also crystallized the competing cases that the leading Democratic contenders were making for why they were best positioned to defeat Mr. Trump.Even as Ms. Warren said ""Bernie is my friend and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie,"" she flashed him a smile after Mr. Sanders noted that he, like Ms. Warren, had once defeated an incumbent Republican. ""Just to set the record straight, I defeated an incumbent Republican running for Congress,"" he said, before Ms. Warren pointed out that it had been 30 years ago.Acknowledging that she was facing doubts about her chances to defeat Mr. Trump, she pointed out that John F. Kennedy had addressed questions about his Catholicism and, more recently, Barack Obama had overcome doubts that he could win the presidency as a black man.Both times, Ms. Warren said, ""the Democratic Party stepped up and said yes.""It was an unusual closing argument in Iowa for a candidate who first rose to contention on the basis of her policy proposals, but it reflected the urgency she was facing to reverse her decline in a state where she led in the polls last year.For his part, Mr. Sanders did not seem rattled by the confrontation, at least during the forum. But in the immediate aftermath of the debate, CNN cameras captured Ms. Warren appearing to refuse to shake Mr. Sanders's hand, and the two senators engaged in what seemed to be a pointed conversation.Tom Steyer, the California billionaire, who was standing nearby during the exchange, said later in the spin room, ""Whatever they were going on between each other, I was trying to get out of the way as fast as possible.""During the debate, Mr. Sanders used the exchange with Ms. Warren to make his own case for why he was the most electable candidate: because he could lure a stream of new voters to the polls. ""The real question,"" he said, ""is how do we beat Trump? And the only way we beat Trump is by a campaign of energy and excitement and a campaign that has, by far, the largest voter turnout in the history of this country.""Mr. Biden, who has placed his own polling strength against Mr. Trump at the center of his candidacy -- including in a new television ad timed with Tuesday's debate -- was just as emphatic that he was best equipped to win the general election.""The real issue is who can bring the whole party together,"" said Mr. Biden, citing his endorsements from a variety of Democrats, including many who were racial minorities. ""I am the one who has the broadest coalition of anyone running up here."" Later, alluding to Mr. Trump's attempt to press the Ukrainians to investigate the work of his son in Ukraine, Mr. Biden said of the president: ""I've taken all the hits he can deliver.""Ms. Klobuchar cited her success appealing to a range of voters in her home state of Minnesota and even boasted that every one of her Republican opponents had left politics since they lost to her. ""I think that sounds pretty good with the president we have right now,"" she said.But Ms. Klobuchar struggled momentarily when she sought to highlight the success of other Midwestern Democratic women and forgot the name of Gov. Laura Kelly of Kansas before receiving a cue.""Kansas has a woman governor right now and she beat Kris Kobach,"" she began. ""And her name, um, is, I'm very proud to know her, and her name is, uh, Governor Kelly. Thank you.""Mr. Steyer, whose television ads have blanketed Iowa and the other early-voting states, said his economic experience would position him well against a businessman turned president. ""Whoever is going to beat Donald Trump is going to beat him on the economy,"" he said, ""and I have the experience and expertise to show he's a fake there and a fraud.""Not long after the debate, Mr. Trump responded on Twitter: ""Steyer is running low on cash. Nobody knows him. Made his money on coal. So funny!""In a rare policy split, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren disagreed on the new North American trade deal that Mr. Trump is trying to push through Congress. Mr. Sanders said it was not worth supporting -- even if it made a ""modest"" improvement. ""We can do much better than a Trump-led trade deal,"" he said.Ms. Warren, however, said that was the reason to support it. ""We have farmers here in Iowa who are hurting,"" she said.The back-and-forth was an example of how Ms. Warren has sought to position herself as a progressive more willing to get things done than Mr. Sanders.The candidates clashed, as they have in all of the debates, on health care. Mr. Sanders was pressed by the moderators about the cost of his ""Medicare for all"" package; unlike Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders has not said what his proposal would cost or revealed which taxes he would increase to pay for it.Ms. Warren, who has found herself on the defensive over her embrace of Medicare for all in recent months, pitched her plan as more expansive than those offered by Ms. Klobuchar or Mr. Buttigieg.""You would kick 149 million Americans off their health insurance,"" Ms. Klobuchar said to Ms. Warren at one point. ""It's just not true that the plan I'm proposing is small,"" Mr. Buttigieg said at another, suggesting Ms. Warren's approach would turn off too many voters.""We've got to move past a Washington mentality that suggests that the bigness of plans only consists of how many trillions of dollars they put through the Treasury, that the boldness of a plan only consists of how many Americans it can alienate,"" Mr. Buttigieg said pointedly.Mr. Buttigieg was asked directly about his lack of support among black voters, whom he will need to activate not just to win the nomination but also a potential general election against Mr. Trump. Mr. Buttigieg said those who know him best -- in South Bend -- support him, cited his African-American backers in Iowa and noted that his new campaign co-chairman was a member of the Congressional Black Caucus.Mr. Sanders had the opportunity right from the start to emphasize his pacifist credentials as the debate opened with questions about the heightened tensions with Iran and who was best positioned to serve as commander in chief. Mr. Sanders immediately seized the opportunity to trumpet his past opposition to the war in Iraq. ""I not only voted against the war, I helped lead the effort against the war,"" he said.Mr. Sanders warned that both the Iraq and Vietnam wars had been based on ""lies."" ""Right now, what I fear very much is that we have a president that is lying again and could drag us into a war that is even worse than the war in Iraq,"" he said.Mr. Sanders drew a distinction with Mr. Biden, who had supported the Iraq war resolution in the Senate. ""Joe and I listened to what Dick Cheney and George Bush and Rumsfeld had to say,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""I thought they were lying. Joe saw it differently.""Mr. Biden said he regretted his vote for that war. ""It was a mistake and I acknowledge that,"" Mr. Biden said, while noting that as vice president he had brought thousands of troops home from the Middle East.The race here remains extremely fluid. A large part of the electorate is up for grabs in a contest that many of the campaigns believe will produce record-setting turnout. A Des Moines Register-CNN poll last week indicated that 45 percent of caucusgoers said they could still be persuaded to support a different candidate.In a final twist that had the potential to affect the race in Iowa, four candidates who will be deliberating on Mr. Trump's fate are confronting a looming challenge: how to mount a successful Iowa campaign while their duties in Congress require them to be in Washington.With the senators likely to be in the Capitol for up to six days a week for the impeachment trial of Mr. Trump, they will be unable to make their final appeals to Iowa voters in person as frequently as Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg.""Some things,"" Ms. Warren said, ""are more important than politics.""PhotographFrom left, Tom Steyer, Elizabeth Warren, Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitWith the Iowa caucuses set to kick off the primary season on Monday night, a Democratic race that began as a contest of ideas and ideologies has given way to a fixation on electability.SIOUX CITY, Iowa -- After a long campaign of ideological clashes, policy debates and talk of a grand reckoning on the direction of the Democratic Party, the presidential primaries starting on Monday will be shaped by a less lofty but increasingly urgent matter: determining the best candidate to defeat an incumbent who has already proved to be a political survivor.With Republicans ready to acquit President Trump of two impeachment charges next week, the nation's political table has been set for 2020: Congress will not remove him from office, despite the wishes of many liberals, leaving the fate of Mr. Trump to the November general election and the candidate nominated by Democrats in the coming months.From the liberal left to the moderate middle, the major presidential contenders are now honing or recalibrating their final appeals before Iowa's caucuses to make the case that they represent the party's best chance to overcome Mr. Trump's well-funded re-election operation and win back the White House this fall.If impeachment rarely comes up on the Democratic campaign trail, the imperative of beating Mr. Trump has come to outweigh all other considerations for many voters -- an extraordinary turn of events for a party that spent the last year sparring over plans to implement ""Medicare for all"" and how far to go in overhauling immigration laws, the financial sector and the criminal justice system.A 2020 primary season that was initially seen as a contest of ideas, with liberal activists largely setting the agenda, has given way to jockeying over notions about electability and who can assemble the strongest coalition of voters in the fall.""I think that's increasingly what's on voters' minds,"" Pete Buttigieg, one of the leading candidates in Iowa, said in an interview, referring to electability. ""If they're making up their minds now and still thinking through us, it means they appreciate that we've got common values and they want the person most likely to beat Donald Trump.""The five leading Democratic candidates in Iowa descended on the state on Saturday ahead of the caucuses Monday night, with polls showing no clear front-runner and voters still torn about whom to support. Three of these contenders -- Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar -- returned after being away for most of the last two weeks at the Senate impeachment trial; no one can say with certainty if their absences will affect their chances in the caucuses.In last-minute rallies, pamphlets and television advertising and even in electric signs placed atop cars that resemble pizza delivery advertisements, the candidates are running more explicitly on their purported viability than in any modern presidential primary.Mr. Sanders, the leading progressive in the field, is increasingly linking his populist platform to an argument that he can peel away disaffected voters from Mr. Trump while a more moderate candidate like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. could imperil that effort. Mr. Biden is closing his Iowa campaign with a commercial highlighting his advantage over Mr. Trump in some national and swing-state polls while his leading supporters in Iowa are introducing him to voters by arguing that he could win over their Republican friends.And Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren, who are struggling to match the appeal of their rivals on the party's ideological poles, are infusing their 11th-hour messaging with barely veiled claims that they are safer choices because they won't alienate one flank of the party like Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden.Returning to the Iowa campaign trail on Saturday, Ms. Warren presented herself as the candidate best prepared to rally Democrats for the general election. She addressed a group of volunteers in Urbandale, before a wall of signs reading ""Unite the Party."" In a Cedar Rapids gymnasium, Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts praised Ms. Warren as ""both empathetic and electable.""""We will, we must, come together as a party and beat Donald Trump,"" Ms. Warren said. ""And I've got a plan for that.""This turn toward I-can-win pragmatism reflects a simple fact of political life in a contest in which at least a third of likely caucusgoers remain undecided just days before the vote. The candidates are responding to the marketplace: Their voters, while deeply split across ideological and generational lines in ways that could still force a showdown at this summer's convention, are united by an all-consuming hunger to unseat Mr. Trump.""What I'm focused on most is getting that fool out of the White House,"" said Debbie McAllister, who attended a Sioux City rally Friday for Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and is leaning toward him over Ms. Klobuchar.John Norris, who has caucused here every four years since 1976 and is a leading supporter of Ms. Warren, said his fellow Iowa Democrats feel a burden heavier than any he can recall.""It's Trump,"" said Mr. Norris. ""We saw it a little bit in '04 -- it was we got to stop George W., Iraq war -- but this is that on steroids.""Even the most bluntly negative campaign tactics have been framed in terms of general-election odds. An outside-spending group, Democratic Majority for Israel, that has dedicated $700,000 to advertising against Mr. Sanders in the last week of the caucus race, has put that whole sum behind a commercial warning that his far-left platform could throw the election to Mr. Trump.""Democrats believe there is nothing more important than replacing Donald Trump,"" said Mark Mellman, the president of Democratic Majority for Israel and a longtime Democratic pollster. Regarding Mr. Sanders, he added, ""A lot of Democrats don't disagree with him on a lot of positions he has, but we and others are concerned about electability.""Perhaps most remarkable are the closing appeals of Mr. Sanders of Vermont, whose calls for ""a political revolution"" vaulted him to contention in the 2016 race but who scarcely mentioned his prospects back then against Mr. Trump or Senator Ted Cruz, the two leading Republicans. Mr. Sanders has not diluted his progressive message, but as he stakes out a lead in some Iowa polls the self-proclaimed democratic socialist is turning to hardheaded pragmatism.His campaign ads warn against nominating a candidate without his own unblemished record of opposing cuts to Social Security -- an unmistakable reference to Mr. Biden and his past support for overhauling the program. And at Mr. Sanders's Sioux City field office, his campaign was distributing a pamphlet that read, ""An effective leader with the toughness to defeat Donald Trump.""Addressing supporters on Saturday in Indianola, Iowa, some of whom wore ""Bernie Beats Trump"" buttons, Mr. Sanders argued that his mammoth volunteer effort in Iowa presaged the sort of organization he could build this fall.""We are going to knock on 500,000 doors in the month of January and the first two days of February,"" he said, adding: ""That is what we need to do in order to win against Trump.""Vowing to ""bring millions of people into the political process who normally do not vote,"" Mr. Sanders warned that Democrats will lose ""in a low turnout election.""Mr. Biden's single-minded focus on electability also stands out, as he goes further than his rivals in attempting to replace political inspiration with cold calculus about cobbling together the 270 Electoral College votes needed to defeat Mr. Trump.""He beats Trump by the most nationally, and in the states we have to win,"" a narrator says in one of his concluding Iowa television ads.The appeals are no more subtle at his events in Iowa, which often feature former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa and his wife, Christie. At a rally in suburban Des Moines, Ms. Vilsack talked up Mr. Biden's potential appeal among her Republican friends, and Mr. Vilsack rattled off the former vice president's head-to-head advantage in general-election surveys in the traditional swing states.And in an only-in-2020 moment that underscored how the horse race has overtaken policy as a focus right now, Mr. Vilsack drew some of the loudest applause at the entire event by making this observation about polling: ""He's within the margin of error in Texas!""Two other candidates, Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, have used the voter fixation on electability to cast themselves as candidates with the broadest appeal within the party.Mr. Buttigieg organized his campaign schedule in the final weeks of the caucuses around visiting counties that voted for former President Barack Obama before flipping to support Mr. Trump. His aides have circulated statistics about past elections to reporters in each locale, and Mr. Buttigieg has sought to liken himself -- in kind if not by name -- to past general-election winners, like Bill Clinton and Mr. Obama.""In the last half-century in this country,"" Mr. Buttigieg said at a rally in Marshalltown, Iowa, ""every single time my party has won the White House, without exception, we've done it with a nominee who is looking to the future, moving past the arguments of the past, not a creature of Washington, and opening the door to a new generation.""In Ankeny, Mr. Buttigieg invoked the impeachment trial -- and Mr. Trump's likely acquittal -- to emphasize the stakes of the election. ""This is our only chance, unless the Senate really surprises us,"" he said, to laughter from the crowd.Ms. Warren has also sought to portray herself as a consensus candidate, airing a commercial that features Iowa supporters of Mr. Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump from 2016 who all say they are now supporting the Massachusetts senator.And in a plain acknowledgment of voters' concerns about sexism in the general election, Ms. Warren released another spot showing a former supporter of Mr. Trump -- an older man from rural Iowa -- directly addressing worries among some voters about nominating a woman. ""For people that say that a woman can't win, I say: nonsense,"" he says, holding up a photograph showing a Trump sign and declaring: ""This is the man to beat, and Elizabeth can do it.""At a kickoff event for Warren canvassers on Friday morning in Clive, a suburb of Des Moines, Michelle Wu, a Boston city councilor, urged them to reassure anxious voters with a version of that argument, stressing Ms. Warren's victory in 2012 over a popular Republican senator -- the ""barn jacket-wearing, pickup truck-driving Scott Brown"" -- and promising that her economic message would appeal to independents and disaffected Republicans.Not to be outdone on electability is Ms. Klobuchar, who for months has been blunt about why Iowans should turn to her: because she's won every race she's run in an increasingly competitive Midwestern state, Minnesota.While that pitch has made her competitive in Iowa, she has been outspent and has polled below the four leading Democrats.In the campaign's closing days, Ms. Klobuchar, too, is becoming even less subtle: She has printed T-shirts in her signature green reading, ""Amy Klobuchar Will Beat Donald Trump.""PhotographFor Democratic candidates and voters alike, the overarching factor appears to be boiling down to who is best positioned to defeat President Trump. While former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. goes the furthest in emphasizing electoral calculus over political inspiration, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren are both casting themselves as having the broadest appeal within the party.

| Jump to first hitThe move by the group of young climate activists was another sign that left-wing advocacy organizations have increasingly coalesced around the Vermont senator's candidacy.The Sunrise Movement, the collection of young climate activists who have roiled Capitol Hill and the Democratic presidential primary, announced on Thursday that it was endorsing Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, in another sign that left-wing advocacy groups have increasingly coalesced around his candidacy.In a landslide vote -- more than 75 percent of respondents -- Mr. Sanders earned the backing of members of the group, which has quickly become politically influential since its founding in 2017.Once a fledgling collection of college students, frustrated that Democrats and Republicans were not acting more quickly to curb climate change, Sunrise has grown to 318 chapters nationwide, with more than 10,000 members.Sunrise will host an event on Jan. 12 with Mr. Sanders in Iowa City to formally announce the endorsement. ""We believe a Bernie Sanders presidency would provide the best political terrain in which to engage in and ultimately win that struggle for the world we deserve,"" Varshini Prakash, a founder and the executive director of the movement, said in a statement. ""Senator Sanders has made it clear throughout his political career and in this campaign that he grasps the scale of the climate crisis, the urgency with which we must act to address it, and the opportunity we have in coming together to do so.""The move represents another step into electoral politics for the group of young activists. After the 2018 midterm elections, the group made national headlines by staging a protest in the office of the incoming House speaker, Nancy Pelosi.Sunrise's signature policy, the ambitious proposal known as the Green New Deal, became a crucial litmus test splitting moderates and liberals on climate change, embraced by top-tier candidates like Mr. Sanders, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Even moderate candidates like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the race's current front-runner, have cited the policy as an inspiration and said its goal of drastically reducing greenhouse gas emissions while also addressing economic inequality was an important framework.But on the scorecard Sunrise released ranking the top three candidates' plans and support for the Green New Deal, Mr. Biden, with a score of 75, trailed far behind Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, who earned 183 and 171, respectively. Mr. Biden received low marks for how frequently he talks about the proposal and a 35 out of 100 for his ""Green New Deal vision.""Mr. Biden also had a tense exchange with a Sunrise organizer in September, who pressed him on his commitment to environmental issues.""Look at my record, child,"" Mr. Biden told the 18-year-old organizer.The group's announcement is one of the last presidential endorsements to arrive from major progressive groups, almost all of which have backed Mr. Sanders. His candidacy in 2016 helped develop much of the left-wing political infrastructure in the Democratic Party -- and had huge support among young Democrats in particular -- but when the 2020 campaign cycle began, it was not inevitable that he would retain that support.Young Democratic voters had a bevy of options, including fresh faces like Mr. Buttigieg, former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas and Senator Kamala Harris of California. In Ms. Warren, there was another candidate with progressive bona fides -- who would also be the first woman in the Oval Office if elected.In September, the Working Families Party endorsed Ms. Warren over Mr. Sanders, saying that she was better positioned to create a cross-ideological coalition around liberal values and that grass-roots groups needed to choose a side in the primary.Over the next several months, however, and after Ms. Warren drew significant criticism for a health care proposal that stepped away from an immediate push for ""Medicare for all,"" the energy on the Democrats' left flank began to move away from her.In October, Mr. Sanders announced endorsements from popular House Democrats including Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who is a sponsor of the Green New Deal legislation. He has also gained the backing of labor organizations such as National Nurses United, and left-wing advocacy groups including the Center for Popular Democracy Action and People's Action.This week, Mr. Sanders was endorsed by Dream Defenders, a Florida-based collection of activists that focuses on criminal justice reform.Sunrise gave its members two choices -- whether to back any presidential candidate at all, and if so, which one. More than 80 percent wanted to support a candidate. About 20 percent chose Ms. Warren.Ms. Warren sent Sunrise a positive message on Twitter in the wake of the announcement, restating her commitment to a Green New Deal. In recent weeks, with Sunrise likely to back Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren announced she would hold a climate-focused town-hall-style event in New Hampshire and rolled out an endorsement from Rhiana Gunn-Wright, a lead author of the Green New Deal proposal.Ms. Warren has called for a $10.7 trillion investment in the economy to implement a Green New Deal and create what she calls green new jobs, and she has also released proposals specific to fighting climate change, including one that calls for $3 trillion in spending over a decade. Mr. Sanders released a $16.3 trillion plan for a Green New Deal that called for the United States to eliminate fossil fuel use by 2050 while similarly transforming the economy.Evan Weber, the political director for the Sunrise Movement, said the group's advocacy would continue no matter who is the nominee.""Should Senator Sanders become the next president of the United States, we will push to ensure that he make delivering upon the promise of his Green New Deal platform the top priority of his administration,"" he said. ""If Senator Sanders does not win the nomination, the stakes of the climate crisis also demand that we can't sit this election out.""PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders in California last month. His candidacy in 2016 helped develop much of the left-wing political infrastructure.

| Jump to first hitAs the liberal Bernie Sanders tightens his grip in Iowa, more traditional Democrats remain split among his four leading competitors, or are unsure altogether of whom to support.BETTENDORF, Iowa -- As they streamed out of the ballroom following a Scott County fund-raising banquet Saturday night, one after the other Iowa Democrats admitted that they still had not decided whom to support just over a week before the state's presidential caucuses.But by not mentioning his name as they rattled off their short lists, they made it clear whom they would not support: Senator Bernie Sanders, the democratic socialist from Vermont who has taken the lead in recent polls.Instead, every one of the 30 still-undecided Democratic activists here rattled off some combination of the same four names -- Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.As Mr. Sanders tightens his grip on the party's young and left-wing voters in Iowa, more traditional Democrats, the ones who happily sit through marathon banquet dinners to hear the candidates and their representatives, remain split between his four leading competitors or remain unsure altogether about whom to rally behind.""I have told my colleagues all along: Bernie Sanders can win with 27 percent of the vote here,"" said Representative Dave Loebsack, an Iowa Democrat supporting Mr. Buttigieg, alluding to his fellow lawmakers, many of whom are deeply uneasy about running with Mr. Sanders on top of the ticket.The fracture among mainstream Democrats here carries profound implications for a primary that has already unsettled the party establishment and prompted late entrants into the race.Mr. Sanders is threatening to seize control in the early states, taking narrow but clear polling leads in Iowa and New Hampshire and increasingly menacing Mr. Biden's advantage in national polls. With his mammoth online fund-raising operation, Mr. Sanders appears to be in a position of financial strength unmatched by any other candidate besides Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City.Mr. Sanders's endurance, and his apparent rise in the earliest primary and caucus states, reflects both the loyalty of his core supporters and their conviction that Mr. Sanders would bring the same fighting resilience to the general election. But even among many liberals who admire Mr. Sanders's campaign, or some of his policy ideas, there is deep concern about the implications of nominating a candidate from the left whom President Trump is sure to portray as extreme.""I think that Bernie is just a bridge too far for the country,"" said Bonnie Campbell, a former Iowa attorney general who is supporting Mr. Biden. Ms. Campbell said she would have no difficulty supporting Mr. Sanders in the general election, but added, ""I can tell you, I hear from friends and colleagues who say: 'Oh my God, what are we going to do if Bernie wins?""'But in Iowa, Democrats who hope to avert that outcome do not appear close to settling on another candidate as an alternative to Mr. Sanders. And if more moderate voters don't coalesce behind an alternative by next week's caucus, party traditionalists fear, Mr. Sanders could win Iowa with only a modest plurality, emboldening his leading rivals to remain in the race, and then notch another victory again a week later in New Hampshire. No Democrat in modern times has lost contested races in both Iowa and New Hampshire and claimed the nomination.The early primary and caucus outcomes could have an outsize impact on later primaries, including the large states voting in March, some of which begin collecting mail-in and early ballots in the immediate aftermath of Iowa. If a candidate like Mr. Sanders were to seize momentum next week, it could help him build a head start in states like California and Texas.It is a scenario that is deeply alarming to establishment-aligned Democrats, if not unfamiliar. Four years ago, convinced Donald Trump could not win the presidency, they watched with delight as he snatched the Republican nomination without winning majorities because his more traditional rivals divided the vote and refused to bow out.The Democrats in this race have been as reluctant to target Mr. Sanders as the Republicans were to target Mr. Trump four years ago; in each case they were skeptical of his staying power and believed they had more to gain by attacking other rivals.Even now, as Mr. Sanders takes a lead in the first two early states, his opponents have not delivered a sustained argument against his candidacy, and remain reluctant to take him on: while Mr. Buttigieg drew attention for warning in a fund-raising solicitation that a Sanders nomination would be too risky, he notably declined to amplify his rhetoric in television interviews over the weekend. The closest he has come to confronting his rival on the left is to make oblique references to the often-bitter 2016 primary between Hillary Clinton and Mr. Sanders.""Most of us would agree the less 2020 resembles 2016 the better -- in all respects,"" Mr. Buttigieg said in a brief interview. Each of the would-be Stop Sanders candidates has built enough political strength to justify forging ahead: Mr. Biden remains the national front-runner, with unmatched support among black voters; Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren both have double-digit support in New Hampshire polls, and sizable war chests; Ms. Klobuchar has the thinnest operation beyond Iowa of the group, but over the weekend she earned the endorsement of New Hampshire's influential Union Leader newspaper.Should all four move forward from Iowa, with their perceived strengths and weaknesses, it could make it difficult for any of them to become a rallying point for voters uneasy about Mr. Sanders.Complicating matters further for traditionalists, and making this race potentially even messier than Mr. Trump's primary, is the presence of Mr. Bloomberg, who is not contesting the traditional early states in February but has already poured more than $270 million in advertising into later contests and made clear to allies that he will remain in the race should Mr. Sanders come roaring into March.Mr. Bloomberg was on Ms. Klobuchar's mind as she left the dinner here Saturday. She was asked if she would remain in the race if she did not break into the top three in the caucuses, which has often been the number of viable candidates who leave the state.Even if you're in fourth, she was asked?""You think it's only going to be down to four candidates even by New Hampshire?"" she said before answering the question. ""No, it's not.""Then, pointing to Mr. Bloomberg, she explained why the Democratic vote may remain splintered.""Why would I get out while he's still in?"" Ms. Klobuchar demanded.With nearly 40 percent of Iowa voters indicating in a new New York Times-Siena College poll that they were still not certain about whom to support, Mr. Sanders could still suffer a reversal of fortune here.That's in part because of the state's complex, multiphase caucusing process, which allows supporters of underdog candidates to shift to stronger contenders. If Mr. Sanders has the most enthusiastic base of support in Iowa, he may be less well positioned to expand his bloc in later rounds should moderate voters rally to one of the four other leading candidates.And it's Ms. Klobuchar whom Iowa Democrats are watching most closely. If she does not reach 15 percent in most precincts, her supporters could determine the statewide winner if they migrate mostly to one candidate.Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa, Mr. Biden's most prominent supporter in the state, was blunt about why Ms. Klobuchar's backers should support the former vice president.Mr. Biden has the best chance of winning the general election, he shares Ms. Klobuchar's pragmatic politics and ""Joe is going to need a running mate,"" Mr. Vilsack said.A more urgent concern for Mr. Vilsack was the prospect of Iowa producing a muddled result, a scenario that's more likely this year because the state party, for the first time, is releasing raw vote totals from the initial round of balloting as well as the final results and delegate allocations.""If I had to make one prediction, there will be a split decision and that'll have repercussions,"" he said. ""Because whoever quote-unquote wins can claim that they won, and talk about it going into New Hampshire.""So while they still hope to best Mr. Sanders in Iowa or New Hampshire, several of Mr. Sanders's rivals have begun emphasizing their strengths in states later in the calendar.Mr. Biden's advisers and surrogates have been stressing his support among minority communities that become important starting with the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 22, while Ms. Warren's campaign circulated a memo last week detailing its preparations in the March primaries that will award most of the delegates that will settle the Democratic nomination.And in a conversation with volunteers before a town hall-style meeting in Davenport on Sunday, Ms. Warren reiterated her determination to compete into March and beyond, telling supporters she already has staff in 30 states, according to a volunteer who attended the meeting and spoke on the condition of anonymity.""We all know that this is very likely to be a long nomination process,"" said California Assemblyman David Chiu, who on Sunday was opening a campaign headquarters in San Francisco for Ms. Warren and said of her campaign: ""They are going to put up a tremendous fight here in the state.""That phase of the race is also when Mr. Bloomberg, with his vast personal fortune, could become a more urgent factor, either rising as an obstacle for Mr. Sanders or further fracturing the party's moderate wing.In California, Mayor Robert Garcia of Long Beach, who endorsed Mr. Biden this month, said he expected the former vice president to consolidate support there ""once it becomes clear that there's a few candidates left.""But gathering support around just a few candidates could also be difficult in California, Mr. Garcia noted, because the state's mail-in ballots would list the names of candidates who falter or withdraw over the course of February.""There are going to be a lot of candidates in California, because they are going to be on the ballot,"" he said. ""There will be some drop-off, but they're all competitive here and that's going to continue.""PhotographBernie Sanders is leading polls in Iowa and New Hampshire with the support of left-wing voters.

| Jump to first hitWith a broad coalition, Joseph R. Biden Jr. defeated Bernie Sanders in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, in a rout that could add to pressure on Mr. Sanders to end his campaign.Joseph R. Biden Jr. easily defeated Senator Bernie Sanders in three major primaries on Tuesday, all but extinguishing Mr. Sanders's chances for a comeback, as anxious Americans turned out to vote amid a series of cascading disruptions from the coronavirus pandemic.Mr. Biden, the former vice president, won by wide margins in Florida and Illinois and also carried Arizona, sweeping the night and achieving a nearly insurmountable delegate lead. The emphatic outcome could greatly intensify pressure on Mr. Sanders to end his campaign and allow Democrats to unify behind Mr. Biden as their presumptive nominee.The routs in Florida and Illinois, two of the biggest prizes on the national map, represented both a vote of confidence in Mr. Biden from most Democrats, and a blunt rejection of Mr. Sanders's candidacy by the kind of large, diverse states he would have needed to capture to broaden his appeal beyond the ideological left.Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, has struggled since his first presidential campaign in 2016 to win over black voters in larger numbers and to persuade voters who do not share his ethos of democratic socialism that he can be trusted to lead the party into the general election.In the two biggest states voting on Tuesday, Florida and Illinois, Mr. Sanders failed. Mr. Biden carried Illinois by a wide margin, keeping intact his winning streak in the large Midwestern primary states, after previously winning in Minnesota and Michigan. And the victory in Florida was a particularly sharp repudiation of Mr. Sanders; many moderate and conservative Hispanic voters in the state had recoiled from his past praise of leftist governments in Latin America, including his admiring remarks about certain achievements of Fidel Castro's Cuba.But the day of voting may have been most notable for the disruptions to the electoral calendar. The turmoil caused by the coronavirus upended plans for a primary election in Ohio, where state officials postponed voting scheduled for Tuesday, in an abrupt maneuver that barely survived last-minute legal scrutiny. Four other states have also taken steps to delay their primary elections until late this spring, with Maryland on Tuesday becoming the latest to push back voting.In the states that did vote, there were signs that the virus had dampened voter turnout, and that the Democratic presidential campaigns and other party leaders were not engaged on Tuesday in the traditional all-out push to drive supporters to the polls. Still, more than a million people cast ballots early or by mail in advance of Tuesday's primaries, according to election officials in the three states, suggesting that the contests could represent a clear enough statement on the trajectory of the Democratic campaign.It made for an extraordinary day in the country's electoral history, featuring candidates who could not campaign in public and party officials who were navigating the delicate line between protecting public safety and the civic right to nominate a candidate for the nation's highest office.In a gesture to the gravity of the moment, Mr. Biden used much of his brief victory address -- via a balky live stream from his home in Wilmington, Del. -- to discuss the virus and to reassure the country.""We'll get through this together,"" Mr. Biden said, trying to project a presidential bearing to a rattled nation. He only fleetingly mentioned Tuesday's results, noting he had ""a very good night,"" before directly speaking to Mr. Sanders's youthful supporters, a voting group he is trying to court.""I hear you, I know what's at stake, I know what we have to do,"" Mr. Biden said. ""Our goal as a campaign, and my goal as a candidate, is to unify this party and unify this nation.""Praising the ""remarkable passion and tenacity"" of Mr. Sanders and his supporters, the former vice president said he and the senator disagree on tactics but ""share a common vision.""Mr. Sanders did not deliver a speech about the primary results, but earlier in the evening he broadcast his own online address calling for sweeping government action to remedy the economic damage of the crippling virus, including an initiative to give people $2,000 monthly payments for the duration of the crisis.""We must make certain that this health and economic crisis is not another moneymaking opportunity for corporate America and for Wall Street,"" Mr. Sanders said, eschewing any mention of the primaries.Mr. Biden's victories in all three states relied on the same coalition of voters who have powered his candidacy since his turning-point victory in South Carolina last month: African-Americans, political moderates and voters over 50, according to a pre-election poll. While Mr. Biden routed Mr. Sanders in Florida -- even besting him with people who described themselves as very liberal -- the results were somewhat more competitive in Illinois and Arizona, where Mr. Sanders dominated with voters under 45 and with the most liberal Democrats to cast ballots.Voters in all three states said by huge margins that they believed Mr. Biden was the candidate best prepared to handle a major crisis.The virus drove down turnout in some Florida localities, but even with the pandemic, turnout was still higher than in 2016 in a handful of suburban and affluent communities, such as Naples and suburban Jacksonville. Mr. Biden won both jurisdictions handily, as he had in other upscale precincts since Super Tuesday, a sign of his strength with the sort of voters who could swing the general election.Mr. Biden had built a formidable lead over Mr. Sanders since the start of the month, leaping far ahead of him in national polls and collecting 151 more delegates out of the 1,805 allotted so far, according to a New York Times analysis. Influential leaders at every level of Democratic politics have swung behind Mr. Biden, reinforcing his position as the overwhelming choice of the party's moderate establishment.Mr. Sanders has not indicated that he is likely to stand down as his losses mount, and his advisers indicated in the run-up to Tuesday's primaries that he was likely to stay in the race and continue collecting as many delegates as he can. He used a debate on Sunday to deliver his most focused critique so far of Mr. Biden's policy record and personal judgment, on a range of defining issues for Democratic voters.But both candidates are still adapting to the halting new pace of the campaign, which is now strictly confined by several factors: a patchwork of travel restrictions and local shutdowns; a near-blackout of news unrelated to the pandemic; and the two aging candidates' concerns for their own health.For Mr. Sanders, 78, the country's sudden turn away from the campaign may have the effect of smothering even the most determined effort to block Mr. Biden, 77, or broaden his own political appeal.The Vermont senator has long relied on huge rallies and a loud microphone in the national news media to advance his candidacy, and for the moment both tools appear to be unavailable. And Mr. Sanders may face growing complaints, even from liberal Democrats, that he is keeping the party divided at a moment when the stakes of the election have never been clearer or more urgent.Yet the campaign freeze may be an obstacle for Mr. Biden, too, particularly if Mr. Sanders persists with a long-shot challenge that could take months to resolve. Mr. Biden had been hoping to extinguish Mr. Sanders's candidacy with a string of landslide victories, continuing his momentum into the contests this week and then into the Georgia primary this coming Tuesday.But like Ohio, Georgia recently announced it was moving its primary election. There is now the possibility of a major backlog of primaries in the late spring that could tempt Mr. Sanders to stay in the race and hope for a major shift in its political fundamentals.Even if Mr. Sanders is largely sidelined by the coronavirus crisis, his continued presence in the race could hinder Mr. Biden's ability to establish himself as the presumptive Democratic nominee and to turn his attention exclusively toward President Trump.While he has been off the trail over the past week, Mr. Biden has begun to run something like a Rose Garden campaign, or whatever the equivalent is for someone who is not already the president: He appointed a public health task force and unveiled a detailed policy agenda for addressing the coronavirus in a formal speech on Thursday. Over the weekend Mr. Biden held a phone call with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, his progressive former rival, and endorsed liberal policies on higher education and bankruptcy reform in an effort to woo the left.It is not clear how long Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders might be kept from campaigning altogether. Both men are confronting the likelihood that they will not be able to hold traditional campaign events until well into the spring, at the earliest, and even the possibility that the summer nominating conventions could be endangered by the imperatives of fighting the coronavirus.The elections on Tuesday offered new evidence of just how difficult it had become to hold any semblance of normal primary elections. There were reports in multiple states of election workers not showing up at the polls; even in densely populated and heavily Democratic areas, like Miami-Dade County in Florida and Cook County in Illinois, voter turnout appeared low on Tuesday morning.Most of all, the frenzy of sudden, and sometimes contradictory, last-minute announcements in Ohio underscored the potential for outright chaos at the polls. Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, declared late on Monday that he would not allow Ohio's primary to go forward.After an initial setback in court, Mr. DeWine's state health director issued an order closing the polls as a health emergency, and early on Tuesday morning a state court allowed that decision to go forward. Election officials in the other three states voting on Tuesday conceded that the coronavirus was a cause for concern but said that they were taking steps to sanitize the polls. And in perhaps a bleak reflection of the country's present condition, Katie Hobbs, Arizona's secretary of state, warned that there was ""no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future.""""The longer we wait, the more difficult and dangerous it could become,"" she said.PhotographFilling out a ballot, above, in Doral, Fla.

| Jump to first hitVladimir Putin is eager both to take the sheen off U.S. democracy and for a counterpart who is less likely to challenge his territorial and nuclear ambitions.At first glance, it may seem contradictory that the nation's intelligence agencies were telling Congress that President Vladimir V. Putin is presumably striving to get President Trump re-elected, while also warning Senator Bernie Sanders of evidence that he is the Russian president's favorite Democrat.But to the intelligence analysts and outside experts who have spent the past three years dissecting Russian motives in the 2016 election, and who tried to limit the effect of Moscow's meddling in the 2018 midterms, what is unfolding in 2020 makes perfect sense.Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders represent the most divergent ends of their respective parties, and both are backed by supporters known more for their passion than their policy rigor, which makes them ripe for exploitation by Russian trolls, disinformation specialists and hackers for hire seeking to widen divisions in American society.But in this election, the broad strategy -- as opposed to the specific tactics -- is not exactly a mystery. Mr. Putin, the analysts agree, mostly seeks anything that will further take the sheen off American democracy and make presidential elections in the United States seem no more credible than his own. After that, he is eager for a compliant counterpart in the White House, one less likely to challenge his territorial and nuclear ambitions.Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders disagree on almost everything, but both share an instinct that the United States is overcommitted abroad: Neither is very likely to pursue policies that push back aggressively on Mr. Putin's plan to restore Moscow's influence around the world, from the former Soviet states to the Middle East.And if you are trying to sow chaos in an a vitriolic election, Mr. Putin can hardly hope for better than a face-off between an incumbent with a history of race-baiting who is shouting ""America First"" at rallies -- while suggesting that the coming election is rigged -- and a democratic socialist from Vermont advocating a drastic expansion of taxes and government programs like Medicare.""Any figures that radicalize politics and do harm to center views and unity in the United States are good for Putin's Russia,"" said Victoria Nuland, who in a long diplomatic career had served both Republican and Democratic administrations, and had her phone calls intercepted and broadcast by Russian intelligence services.The intelligence reports provided to the House Intelligence Committee, inciting Mr. Trump's ire, may make the American understanding of Mr. Putin's plans sound more certain than they really are, according to intelligence officials who contributed to the assessment. Those officials caution that such reports are as much art as science, a mixture of informants, intercepted conversations and intuition, as analysts in the nation's 17 intelligence agencies try to get into the heads of foreign leaders.Though intelligence officials have disputed that the officer who delivered the main briefing said Russia was actively aiding the president's re-election, people in the room said that intelligence officers' responses to lawmakers' follow-up questions made clear that Russia was trying to get Mr. Trump re-elected.Intelligence is hardly a perfect process, as Americans learned when the nation went to war in Iraq based in part on an estimate that Saddam Hussein was once again in search of a nuclear weapon.Not surprisingly, the Kremlin says this is all an American fantasy, aimed at demonizing Russia for the United States' own failings. ""These are more paranoid announcements which, to our regret, will multiply as we get closer to the election,"" Mr. Putin's confidant and spokesman, Dmitry S. Peskov, was quoted by Reuters as telling reporters on Friday. ""They have nothing to do with the truth.""No matter who is elected, Mr. Putin has probably undermined one of his own primary goals: getting the United States and its allies to lift sanctions that were imposed after he annexed Crimea and accelerated a hybrid war against Ukraine.""By actively exploiting divisions within American society and having its activities revealed, the Kremlin has ensured that its longer-term goal of having the U.S. remove sanctions and return to a less confrontational relationship so far has been thwarted,"" Angela E. Stent, a former national intelligence officer for Russia and now a professor at Georgetown University, said in her book ""Putin's World: Russia Against the West and With the Rest.""Ms. Stent noted on Saturday that if the Russians were in fact interfering in this election, ""it could bring about new energy sanctions."" She said that one piece of legislation in the Senate would require new sanctions if evidence of Russian meddling emerged from intelligence agencies. So far, Mr. Putin may have concluded that the penalties are a small price to pay if he can bring his geopolitical rival down a few more notches, she added. And the early intelligence analyses suggested that by backing Mr. Sanders in the primary and Mr. Trump in the general election, Mr. Putin would probably have a good chance of maximizing the electoral tumult.Robert O'Brien, the president's national security adviser, said in an interview with ABC to be broadcast on Sunday that he had not seen evidence that Russia sought to intervene in Mr. Trump's favor, and that the reports of Mr. Putin helping Mr. Sanders's campaign came as ""no surprise.""Mr. Sanders, for his part, on Friday warned Moscow to stay out of the election.The senator is hardly a new target for the Russians. The 2018 indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers for their activities in the last presidential election -- issued by the Justice Department under the Trump administration -- claimed that the officers ""engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.""Robert S. Mueller III, in the report on his investigation into Russian operations, concluded that the release of memos hacked from the Democratic National Committee were meant to inflame Mr. Sanders's supporters by revealing that the committee was funneling assets to Mrs. Clinton.The more recent public reports emerging from the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I., and classified reports generated by the C.I.A. and others suggest that while the Russian objectives have remained the same, the techniques have shifted.""The Russians aren't going to use the old playbook -- we know that,"" said Christopher C. Krebs, who runs the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.His organization, along with the National Security Agency and British intelligence, has been steadily documenting how Russian operatives are becoming stealthier, learning from the mistakes they made in 2016.As they focus on evading more vigilant government agencies and technology companies trying to identify and counter malicious online activity, the Russians are boring into Iranian cyberoffense units, apparently so that they can initiate attacks that look as if they originate in Iran -- which itself has shown interest in messing with the American electoral process. Russians are putting more of their attack operations on computer servers in the United States, where the National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies -- but not the F.B.I. and homeland security -- are prohibited from operating.And, in one of the most effective twists, they are feeding disinformation to unsuspecting Americans on Facebook and other social media. By seeding conspiracy theories and baseless claims on the platforms, Russians hope everyday Americans will retransmit those falsehoods from their own accounts. That is an attempt to elude Facebook's efforts to remove disinformation, which it can do more easily when it flags ""inauthentic activity,"" like Russians posing as Americans. It is much harder to ban the words of real Americans, who may be parroting a Russian story line, even unintentionally.Mr. Krebs said that this was why the Department of Homeland Security had to focus on educating Americans about where their information was coming from. He asked last year: ""How do you explain, this is how you're being manipulated? This is how they're hacking your brain?""In 2018, the United States Cyber Command and the National Security Agency mounted a new and more public campaign to push back at the Russians, attacking and blocking their Internet Research Agency for a few days around the November elections and texting warnings to Russian intelligence officers that they were being watched. The N.S.A. is preparing for similar counterattacks this year: On Thursday, the United States cited intelligence and blamed Russia for a cyberattack last fall on the republic of Georgia, another place where Mr. Putin seems to be holding dress rehearsals.Now American intelligence agencies face a new question: How do they run such operations, and warn Congress and Americans, at a moment when the president is declaring that the intelligence on Russian election meddling is ""another misinformation campaign"" that is ""launched by Democrats in Congress""?The intelligence agencies are loath to cross Mr. Trump. The acting director of national intelligence at the time, Joseph Maguire, had resisted appearing in public to provide the ""Worldwide Threat Assessment,"" which is usually given to Congress before the president's State of the Union address. (He was dismissed this week before he had to testify.) Because Mr. Trump was so angered by how the testimony of Mr. Maguire's predecessor contradicted his own statements last year -- particularly on Iran, North Korea and the Islamic State -- Mr. Maguire was in no hurry to repeat the experience.Mr. Maguire's successor, Richard Grenell, the current American ambassador to Germany, is known for his political allegiance to Mr. Trump, not for his knowledge of the American intelligence agencies. He is widely viewed by career officials as more interested in making sure public intelligence reports do not embarrass Mr. Trump than sounding the clarion call that the Russians are coming -- again.PhotographPresident Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, center. He wants to restore Moscow's influence in the world.

| Jump to first hitThe former mayor of South Bend, Ind., has cherry-picked his record on minority poverty and arrests, overstated his consistency on health policy and used a questionable rationale to attack a rival.Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., has had strong showings in the first two Democratic presidential nominating contests. As he seeks to build support ahead of Nevada's vote on Saturday, Mr. Buttigieg has sought to explain his record with black residents of South Bend, distinguish himself from his competitors on health care, and parry attacks on the issue of campaign finance. Here's a fact check.Mr. Buttigieg has cherry picked statistics, sometimes misleadingly, to defend his record on poverty and arrests among minorities in South Bend.""The reality is on my watch drug arrests in South Bend were lower than the national average and specifically to marijuana lower than in Indiana."" 
 -- at the Democratic debate in FebruaryThis is misleading. African-Americans make up about a quarter of South Bend's population, but account for more than than half of drug arrests in the city. Pressed by a debate moderator, Linsey Davis of ABC, on this racial disparity, Mr. Buttigieg deflected with a half-true claim.Mr. Buttigieg's campaign cited arrest rates across his second term. From 2016 to 2018 (data for 2019 is not yet available), 0.43 percent of black South Bend residents were arrested annually for marijuana possession (lower than the 0.48 percent figure for the state of Indiana) and 0.82 percent on general drug charges (lower than the national average of 0.83 percent and the state average of 0.9 percent).But his claim of lower arrest rates is less true for his entire tenure. From 2012 to 2018, 0.43 percent of black residents were arrested for marijuana possession (roughly equivalent to the 0.42 percent figure for both Indiana and the nation) and 0.75 percent arrested on general drug charges (level with the state rate and lower than the 0.97 percent national rate).Experts also said those are not particularly meaningful comparisons. For one, the difference between South Bend and Indiana rates is relatively small and therefore statistically insignificant.Additionally, the city's drug arrests rates for white residents are also slightly lower than the state and national averages. So that could reflect lower drug use in general, ""not that local officials have consciously changed"" their policing practices, said Marc Mauer, the executive director of the Sentencing Project, an advocacy group that compiles criminal justice data.As Ms. Davis noted and as The Intercept first reported, black residents of South Bend were 4.2 times more likely than white residents to be arrested for possessing marijuana while Mr. Buttigieg was mayor from 2012 to 2018. That's higher than the disparity of 3.6 to one across the state and 3.1 to one across the country. For drug charges in general, South Bend's disparity of 2.8 to one was higher than the national ratio of 2.4 to one, but lower than the state's 2.9 to one ratio.""The larger point, which comparisons to the rest of the state obscures, is that these are serious disparities,"" said Joseph E. Kennedy, a law professor at University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and expert in criminal justice racial disparities. ""Who cares how bad things are in the rest of the state? A mayor can have a much bigger impact on arrests by his city's police force than a governor can have in a state where multiple agencies make arrests.""The South Bend Police Department changed how it reported crime data to the F.B.I. in 2018, using a more detailed reporting system, a Buttigieg campaign spokesman said. Experts agreed that the switch likely accounts for a perceived uptick in drug-related arrests that year. Omitting 2018 from the time frame, though, black residents of South Bend were still 2.7 times more likely than white residents to be arrested on drug charges and 4.1 times more likely for marijuana possession.""Poverty rates for black residents decreased by nearly 40 percent since Pete took office and poverty rates for Latino residents decreased by half -- far outpacing their counterparts in Indiana and across the country over the same time period."" 
 -- on his campaign websiteThis is exaggerated. The poverty rates for South Bend's black and Latino communities did decrease during Mr. Buttigieg's two terms as mayor, in line with a decade-long trend across the country. But he's selectively highlighting one set of data to show a greater decline over a more precise data set showing a smaller, but still notable, reduction.The Census Bureau currently produces two main sets of data through its rolling American Community Survey: one-year estimates, which are more current, and five-year estimates, which have a lower margin of error. The bureau noted that the second set is more reliable for ""smaller geographic areas and small population groups."" South Bend has a population of roughly 102,000, including about 27,000 black residents and about 16,000 Latino residents.As other fact checkers have noted, Mr. Buttigieg is using the one-year estimates for his figures. By this metric, poverty in South Bend declined by 39.3 percent for black residents from 2011 to 2018, and by 49.9 percent for Latino residents. In this same frame, poverty declined in Indiana by 21.6 percent among African-Americans and by 38.3 percent among Latinos, and the reductions were 19.9 percent and 27.1 percent nationwide.By the five-year estimates, though, black poverty declined by 14.6 percent in South Bend and Latino poverty by 25.9 percent. That still outpaces the rates in the state (2.7 percent and 10.6 percent) and country (6.2 percent and 9.5 percent). A spokesman for Mr. Buttigieg said the five-year estimates did not fully capture the economic investments in the city in recent years.Mr. Buttigieg was once more supportive of 'Medicare for all' than he is now, and he has exaggerated the potential economic effect of moving to a single-payer system.""The truth is that I have been consistent throughout in my position on delivering health care for every American.""
-- at the New Hampshire debateThis is exaggerated. Mr. Buttigieg was rebutting a claim from Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota that he has reversed his position on ""Medicare for all.""""Pete has always said he wants to get to a Medicare for all environment,"" said Sean Savett, a spokesman for Mr. Buttigieg. ""What Pete would not do is rob Americans of their right to choose what plan is best for themselves or their families and kick more than 150 million Americans off their health insurance.""If ""Medicare for all environment"" refers to universal coverage, then Mr. Buttigieg has been consistent on that front. But he currently does not support Medicare for all -- a term that typically refers to a single-payer system, in which all Americans are insured through Medicare -- and instead prefers to create a public option, where Americans can choose between a government plan and private insurance.Mr. Buttigieg has evolved from setting Medicare for all as a long-term goal prefaced by intermediate steps to describing it as a possible result, but not an imperative, of a system based on the public option. He calls his plan ""Medicare for all who want it.""Ms. Klobuchar quoted a Twitter post from Mr. Buttigieg in February 2018 where he said, ""I, Pete Buttigieg, politician, do henceforth and forthwith declare, most affirmatively and indubitably, unto the ages, that I do favor Medicare for All, as I do favor any measure that would help get all Americans covered.""That caveat about universal coverage could arguably apply to a public option. Mr. Savett argued that at the time, ""Medicare for all"" did not refer to the single-payer legislation championed by Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. He said Mr. Buttigieg never supported Mr. Sanders's bill.But in the same Twitter conversation, Mr. Buttigieg linked to a newspaper column he wrote in college where he specifically aspired to a future where ""we could finally see a single-payer health care system.""""I am all for implementing a single-payer health care system,"" Mr. Buttigieg said in January 2019. ""I also recognize that along the way to getting there, along the road to Medicare for all, maybe Medicare for more is part of how we make that happen.""Mr. Buttigieg struck a similar tone early last year, repeatedly saying a public option would create a ""natural glide path to a single-payer environment"" that he said was the ""the right place for us to head as a country.""By May, Mr. Buttigieg's language on that pathway had become more open ended. He told NPR that if single-payer did not come to fruition and if ""corporate alternatives can somehow step it up and be more affordable and more comprehensive and more inclusive than they've been, well, that's not the worst outcome, either.""Recently, he has described his public option plan as a preferable alternative, rather than transitional phase, to Medicare for all. His approach is ""a better governing strategy"" that allows consumers ""to choose what makes sense for you,"" Mr. Buttigieg said in September. Moreover, he argued in October, it is ""paid for, unlike the Medicare for all, whether you want it or not, plans that still have this giant question mark over how it's supposed to work.""""Now, what I do know is there are some voices in the Democratic primary right now, who are calling for a policy that would eliminate the job of every single American working at every single insurance company in the country.""
-- in an interview on MSNBC in DecemberThis is exaggerated. There's no question that implementing Medicare for all would drastically transform the health care industry. Eliminating private health insurance and cutting administrative costs -- which supporters champion as a major benefit of such a system -- would mean widespread job losses. But Mr. Buttigieg goes too far in his prediction that all the claims adjusters, insurance underwriters and brokers in the country would be laid off.A spokesman for Mr. Buttigieg cited a study from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. It said ""only a subset of the jobs"" in the health insurance industry and related sectors would be affected by Medicare for all. Out of some 1.6 million workers in these fields, about 834,000 would be displaced, including 369,000 people employed directly by insurance carriers and health and welfare funds.Out of the 4.3 million workers who are involved with insurance administration but employed in doctors' offices and hospitals, more than 1.6 million would lose their jobs, according to the study.Candidates supporting single-payer have acknowledged its employment ramifications, and have sought to address them. Mr. Sanders's latest Medicare for all bill funds assistance programs for laid-off workers. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts also endorsed this provision on her website and asserted that ""no worker will be left behind.""Mr. Buttigieg mounted a campaign finance attack on Bernie Sanders that requires context.""Bernie Sanders is outraising us and he has the support of nine dark money groups.""
-- in Facebook ads in FebruaryThis is exaggerated. Mr. Buttigieg was referring to ""People Power for Bernie,"" a coalition of nine outside advocacy groups backing the candidacy of Mr. Sanders and organizing voter mobilization efforts on his behalf.The nine groups are the Democratic Socialists of America; Sunrise Movement, the youth environmental activist group; Our Revolution, the political group founded by Mr. Sanders after his 2016 campaign; Dream Defenders, a youth activist group formed after the shooting death of the unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin; and the progressive groups the Center for Popular Democracy Action, Make the Road Action, People's Action, Student Action and Progressive Democrats of America.Lia Weintraub, a spokeswoman for the Center for Popular Democracy Action, said that all nine groups are ""nonprofit membership-based organizations that aim to bring a multiracial, working-class and young electorate into the political process."" She and the other organizations objected to Mr. Buttigieg's characterization.Whether or not the groups qualify as ""dark money"" -- a generic term for organizations that spend money on political activities or candidate advocacy but do not disclose their funding -- is somewhat of a subjective assessment. But at least two do not appear to fit the bill.Progressive Democrats of America is a hybrid political-action committee that can accept unlimited amounts of money but discloses all of its donors to the Federal Election Commission. Dream Defenders Fight is the ""super PAC"" of the tax-exempt nonprofit Dream Defenders. Both are considered ""fully disclosing"" organizations by the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog.The other groups are 501(c)(4) organizations or social welfare nonprofits, which are not required to disclose their donors. If they do not do so fully, they would qualify as ""dark money,"" said Anthony Corrado, a professor at Colby College and expert in campaign finance.At least one of them lists partial sources of funding. Our Revolution names donors who contribute more than $250, but not the amounts or those who do not meet the threshold. Because of this, it does not meet the Center for Responsive Politics' definition of ""dark money,"" said Anna Massoglia, a researcher with the center, though it is also not considered a fully disclosing group.""Unless a group has expressed opposition to disclosing donors, I generally try to reach out to them to see if they are willing to provide you with their donors or a copy of their donor disclosure policy before definitively applying the 'dark money' label,"" she said.Of the others, the Sunrise Movement receives about half of its funding from grants by foundations. That group and a spokesman for People's Action said Mr. Buttigieg had previously sought their endorsements. Neither appears to publicly disclose individual donors.Half of funding for Democratic Socialists of America comes from member dues, according to a 2018 financial report. A spokesman for the group said it did not list contributors out of privacy concerns, but the average donation is $18.80 and it does not take corporate funding.Curious about the accuracy of a claim?

| Jump to first hitWith the coronavirus as a backdrop, and with no audience in attendance, the two Democrats were at times feisty discussing their differences over health care. Mr. Biden also committed to choosing a woman as a running mate.Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders called for vastly more aggressive government action to battle the coronavirus but split over some of the details along familiar ideological lines on Sunday night, as the two Democrats tangled over the right to lead their party into a campaign overshadowed by the pandemic inflicting havoc on the country's economy and its social fabric.In their first one-on-one debate of the primary race, Mr. Sanders, a democratic socialist from Vermont, demanded sweeping economic reform and the creation of a single-payer health care system to address crises like the virus. Mr. Biden said he would call up the military to help and enact a ""multi-multi-billion dollar program"" of disease containment and economic rescue, and said that there were more issues at hand that could not wait on reinventing the health care system.Mr. Biden, the former vice president, said managing the coronavirus was ""like a war,"" while Mr. Sanders said it had exposed ""the dysfunctionality"" of the country's patchwork health care system.Yet on matters beyond the virus, the two men careened from making gestures toward party cohesion and personal comity to clashing over their divergent policy agendas and records in office.Mr. Biden repeatedly sought to play down criticism from Mr. Sanders and to play a unifying role. He offered lengthy praise for a proposal by Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, his progressive former rival, to reform the bankruptcy code, and in a striking commitment he made an ironclad pledge to name a woman as his running mate. Mr. Sanders said that ""in all likelihood"" he, too, would choose a female running mate.But Mr. Sanders persistently challenged Mr. Biden over his positions on core Democratic issues, leaving the former vice president struggling to explain -- and in some cases misrepresenting -- his past record on matters like funding Social Security and the war in Iraq. And Mr. Biden also went on offense, especially over Mr. Sanders's history of praising leftist governments in Latin America.Still, with Democrats single-mindedly focused on defeating President Trump, and with the country as a whole dismayed by a growing pandemic, both candidates offered assurances of mutual support for the general election. ""It's much bigger than either of us,"" Mr. Biden said, vowing to campaign for Mr. Sanders if he were the nominee.""If I lose this thing, Joe wins -- Joe, I will be there for you,"" Mr. Sanders promised.Their sparring represented what may be the last vestiges of a once-uncertain contest that -- after his commanding victories over the past two weeks -- now clearly favors Mr. Biden. Indeed, the growing threat of the coronavirus, combined with the former vice president's significant advantage in delegates, lowered the debate stakes and might have rendered it most memorable for Mr. Biden's promise to choose a woman as his running mate.He has been widely expected to do so, but his pledge was sure to draw attention, fuel speculation about who the woman may be and generally tilt attention toward the general election and away from the primary race.The specter of the coronavirus pervaded their encounter from their first moments onstage: Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders declined to shake hands at the start and stood six feet apart from each other at a television studio in Washington, D.C., following the guidelines for social distancing prescribed by public health authorities. In deference to the same regulations, the debate took place without a live audience.Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders approached each other at first with caution, splitting over matters of policy but largely declining to go on the attack in sharp terms, before clashing in a feistier manner as the event wore on. Their early restraint was notable, because the debate was their first encounter since Mr. Biden reclaimed his once-wobbly status as the Democratic front-runner and Mr. Sanders lost the surging momentum he captured in the race for a time last month.Where the two men agreed was in deploring Mr. Trump's approach to the coronavirus, and in demanding a more far-reaching government strategy to contain the outbreak and patch up the economic wreckage it is causing. Mr. Biden argued that every resource of the government should be mobilized to limit short-term damage, while Mr. Sanders said that countering it would require a more drastic overhaul of economic and health care systems.""This is like we are being attacked from abroad,"" Mr. Biden said. ""This is something that is of great consequence. This is like a war.""Mr. Sanders called the coronavirus crisis an ""unprecedented moment in American history,"" and said it drew attention to the fact that the country lacked ""a system that is prepared to provide health care for all people.""In an early barb directed at Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders said it would take a direct confrontation with the insurance and pharmaceutical industries to remedy the situation, including enacting his proposal for a ""Medicare for all""-style system that he has championed.""Do we have the guts to take on the health care industry, some of which is funding the vice president's campaign?"" Mr. Sanders asked.But Mr. Biden pushed back aggressively on the notion that Mr. Sanders's signature proposal could mitigate the virus, invoking Europe's hardest-hit country.""With all due respect to Medicare for all, you have a single-payer system now in Italy,"" he said, arguing that such a system ""would not solve the problem.""Beyond their familiar disagreements on health care, Mr. Sanders leveled a larger critique of Mr. Biden's approach to leadership, accusing him of compromising too readily with Republicans and corporate interests. He also challenged the former vice president over decades' worth of votes on abortion, gay rights, foreign wars, bankruptcy regulation and retirement-security programs.At times, the debate became a kind of tense colloquy between longtime colleagues, as Mr. Sanders prodded Mr. Biden to account for his past positions.In the most heated moments, the two candidates scolded each other by name -- interjecting ""Joe!"" and ""Bernie!"" -- and showed visible exasperation. Mr. Biden laughed at one of Mr. Sanders's rebukes and muttered ""Give me a break"" when the Vermont senator urged him to disavow a super PAC supporting his campaign.""I won't give you a break on this one, Joe,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""You've condemned super PACs. You've got a super PAC. It's running negative ads.""Indeed, Mr. Sanders repeatedly forced Mr. Biden onto the defensive, leading the former vice president to play down or misstate portions of his own record. Challenged by Mr. Sanders for his role championing bankruptcy legislation backed by the credit card industry, Mr. Biden said he did not help write the legislation and ""made it clear to the industry that I did not like the bill"" -- though Mr. Biden was among its most vocal Democratic supporters.Pressed by Mr. Sanders about his past comments in the Senate suggesting it could be necessary to rein in Social Security and other popular entitlement programs, Mr. Biden gave a halting series of answers that prompted Mr. Sanders to urge him to ""be straight with the American people.""Mr. Biden was not shy about defending other elements of his record from his liberal rival: When Mr. Sanders dismissed the 2008 bailout of the financial sector as a gift to Wall Street executives, Mr. Biden chided him and argued that if the banks had not been stabilized the country would have plunged into ""a great depression.""""All those people Bernie said he cares about would have been in deep trouble,"" Mr. Biden said.Mr. Biden confronted Mr. Sanders with some of his past votes as well, including his opposition to some gun-control legislation.Two days before Florida's crucial primary, Mr. Sanders came prepared with an answer about recent comments that have set off a wave of criticism -- his praise for some elements of Fidel Castro's rule in Cuba. He vowed that as president he would ""put the flag down"" for ""democracy and human rights.""But when he was pressed by Mr. Biden and the moderators, Mr. Sanders returned to his longstanding position that it was possible to condemn authoritarians while also praising positive elements of their governments. He held up China, which he said had made significant strides in reducing poverty, a comment that prompted Mr. Biden to assail him for praising ""a dictatorship.""Even as they feuded, the candidates stopped well short of the kind of scorched-earth attacks that have characterized the climactic debates in past nomination fights, including both the Democratic and Republican primary campaigns in 2016.After one extended attack on him, Mr. Biden good-naturedly noted that he had tried to give Mr. Sanders ""credit for some things"" but that he was ""making it harder for me,"" causing the Vermont senator to smile.Both candidates highlighted their own new habits: online gatherings instead of in-person campaign rallies and no more handshaking -- and lots of handwashing. ""I'm using a lot of soap and hand sanitizers,"" Mr. Sanders said. Added Mr. Biden, ""I wash my hands God knows how many times a day with hot water and soap.""Mr. Sanders addressed a broader electoral issue in an interview on CNN after the debate, when asked if the primaries in four states on Tuesday should go on. ""That is a very good question,"" he said, adding that he was ""not sure it makes a lot of sense"" to have older people who are susceptible to the virus gathered at polling places.The debate showed Mr. Sanders in fighting form, and perhaps sounding further away from conceding than Mr. Biden's camp had hoped. After the debate, Anita Dunn, Mr. Biden's chief strategist, likened Mr. Sanders to a political demonstrator, saying the former vice president had spent the debate ""graciously dealing with the kind of protester who often shows up at campaign events, on live television.""The forum on Sunday was originally set to be held in Phoenix, before a live audience. But in a series of incremental announcements over the past week, CNN and the Democratic National Committee declared that there would be no live audience; that the debate would be moved to Washington; and that one of the planned moderators, Jorge Ramos, would be replaced because he might have been exposed to the coronavirus.The unusual circumstances reflected a larger freeze in the presidential campaign: Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have all but halted public campaign activity since last week's primaries.Both candidates are in their late 70s and could face the risk of contracting the virus themselves from prolonged exposure to large numbers of voters. Aides to Mr. Biden, 77, and Mr. Sanders, 78, have said that neither man has been tested for the virus or shown any symptoms of the disease.Amid the slowdown in campaigning, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have been trying to match their core themes to the moment of crisis. There is now a general view among all of the political campaigns -- including Mr. Trump's -- that the coronavirus could well redraw the existing contours of the presidential race. The crisis might undermine Mr. Trump's plans to run on promises of continued prosperity and instead focus public attention above all on the difficult process of managing a contagion and rebuilding a shaken economy.PhotographJoseph R.

| Jump to first hitMr. Biden's attack on his rival in Iowa came hours after another leading candidate, Pete Buttigieg, criticized both men, in a day of sparring that underscored the pressure they all face to excel in Monday's caucuses.PELLA, Iowa -- In one of his most direct confrontations yet with his top rival in the Iowa caucuses, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday called out Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for not being a Democrat even as Mr. Sanders makes a competitive run for that party's presidential nomination, and Mr. Biden also jabbed Mr. Sanders's record on gun control in among his most detailed remarks on the matter to date.""I'm a Democrat,"" said Mr. Biden, who moments earlier had told reporters at a Dairy Queen here that the contrasts between himself and his top rivals were ""self-evident."" Asked to elaborate, Mr. Biden swiped at Mr. Sanders, who represents Vermont as an independent in the Senate. ""Well, he says he's not. He says -- you know, he's not registered as a Democrat, to the best of my knowledge. And Bernie has a different view.""The remarks, in response to reporters' questions, capped a day of sparring among the leading Democratic presidential contenders here, four days before the Iowa caucuses. Earlier in the day, Pete Buttigieg escalated his attacks on Mr. Biden as well as Mr. Sanders, taking direct aim at the two leading presidential candidates as he tries to gain ground before the Iowa caucuses. And Mr. Biden, when asked about Mr. Sanders's record on gun control, directly attacked him for opposing one of the most popular Democratic-backed gun measures in the 1990s, something he had resisted doing in detail as recently as last week.""I think Bernie has made his verbal amends for his record on guns,"" he said in a barely veiled jab. Asked whether that was sufficient, he said, ""Well yeah I do, I think he means it. I think that, you know, the fact that he gave the gun manufacturers an exemption that no other, no other industry in the world -- in the United States -- has, I think he regrets having done that.""Mr. Biden also noted that Mr. Sanders had voted against the Brady Bill, which instituted background checks on handguns, five times. ""I think he's regretted that, I think he's changed his mind,"" Mr. Biden said. ""So I take him at his word.""Asked for comment, Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, replied, ""Last-minute cheap barbs of desperation aren't a good look for a candidate who proclaims his desire to unite the party."" Throughout his career Mr. Sanders has also voted to support background checks and other gun control measures.Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, two poll-leaders in the race, are competing for an overlapping slice of blue-collar voters here in Iowa, and Mr. Sanders's evident traction has privately alarmed some of Mr. Biden's donors. The two men have clashed before, on issues ranging from Social Security to the Iraq war. (Pressed on his Social Security record on Thursday night, Mr. Biden handed a CBS News reporter a print-out of talking points titled: ""Bernie false attack on Social Security."") Mr. Biden's remarks on guns marked a sharp escalation over a new point of contrast.Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., dismissed disputes between the two men as a kind of politics of the past, saying their debates repeat the party's mistakes.""This is not the time to get caught up in reliving arguments from before,"" he told several hundred people gathered in a hotel ballroom in Decorah, Iowa. ""The less 2020 resembles 2016 in our party, the better.""In his stump speeches and in answers at campaign events, Mr. Buttigieg has steadfastly avoided direct hits on his opponents, instead drawing opaque contrasts that reporters and the most engaged Democratic voters have understood to be whacks at Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders.His decision to call out his chief rivals by name underscores the pressure Mr. Buttigieg faces for a strong finish and signals an intensification of a race that has been relatively polite for nearly a year, as it enters its final days before caucusing on Monday.""I hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new,"" he said. ""But history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up is to look to the same Washington playbook.""Mr. Buttigieg also argued that Mr. Sanders's plans for ""Medicare for all"" and free college go farther than what most in the Democratic Party can support.""I hear Senator Sanders calling for a kind of politics that says you got to go all the way here or nothing else counts,"" he said. ""It's coming at a moment when we actually have a historic majority, not just a line around what it is we're against, but agreeing on what it is we're for.""Speaking in Newton on Thursday, in an apparent response to Mr. Buttigieg's remarks, Mr. Biden warned against letting ""this Democratic race slide into a negative treatment of one another. We can't let this happen. The temptation is too much for some running. We just can't do it. As Barack said, the last thing we need to do is form a circle, a circular firing squad.""Yet at his next stop, in Pella, as he purchased ice cream for himself and his team, he was far more pointed when speaking with reporters.""He must be deciding things are getting a little tight,"" he said of Mr. Buttigieg. Asked about differences between himself and opponents such as Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders, he said, ""You guys have seen Pete. He's a good guy. You've seen Bernie, you've seen me. I mean, some things are just self-evident, the contrast. You know, I've gotten more than 8,600 votes in my life.""The earlier comments from Mr. Buttigieg were in keeping with his effort to paint himself as the type of transformational figure he argues neither Mr. Biden nor Mr. Sanders can be because of their decades of experience in Washington's political battles.For days the Buttigieg campaign has been sending out fund-raising appeals warning that it would be too ""risky"" to nominate Mr. Sanders and suggesting that President Trump wants to face the Vermont senator in November.""We risk nominating a candidate who cannot beat Donald Trump in November -- and Trump's team knows this,"" Mr. Buttigieg's deputy campaign manager, Hari Sevugan, wrote in one of the emails on Tuesday. ""They're working to make sure it happens.""It is a more aggressive version of the political contrast he has sought to paint in Iowa since Labor Day, when he was the first of the leading candidates to begin broadcasting TV ads in the state. He highlighted those messages with subtle arguments against the progressive politics of Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who at the time was the state's polling leader.Though Mr. Buttigieg began his TV ad campaign in Iowa first, there are fewer ads on the air for him in the final week before the caucuses than there are for his competitors. Mr. Buttigieg is being outspent by Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and the super PAC backing Mr. Biden -- though with the local airwaves saturated by political ads there can be just as much value in making news by going on the attack on the stump as there is in buying more TV time.Pressed by reporters earlier this week, Mr. Buttigieg had resisted calling Mr. Sanders a risk himself and would not say if he believed Mr. Sanders could beat Mr. Trump. On Thursday, he cast his new remarks as airing an ""honest and respectful"" difference between the visions of the three men. He also acknowledged that he needs a ""strong finish"" in the Iowa race.""This is certainly the moment when folks are choosing, and I want to make sure everyone understands the choice between us,"" he told reporters. ""We're competing, it's a respectful but important competition about what the best approach is going to be.""In a moment when many Democrats want party unity around the goal of defeating Mr. Trump, a message that Mr. Biden has often pressed from the stage despite swipes at rivals, there's a chance that the harsher hits could backfire.Aides to other candidates say Iowa Democrats aren't eager for a contentious race. ""I don't think there's an appetite for the negativity among Iowa caucusgoers,"" said Norm Sterzenbach, who advises Senator Amy Klobuchar's caucus strategy. ""I think historically when there have been aggressive negative campaigns, it has not necessarily worked out the way the candidates had wanted it to.""Now that Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden are ahead of him, Mr. Buttigieg has shifted from an argument against a progressive revolution toward one focused around his rivals' age, albeit without explicitly calling Mr. Sanders, 78, and Mr. Biden, 77, old.Many of Mr. Buttigieg's campaign stops have the words ""TURN THE PAGE"" spelled out in large blue letters behind the stage, a reminder of both his own far younger age, 38, and the idea that he would be free of the political entanglements and baggage that he ascribes to Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders.A political newcomer, he argues, would have both a better chance of defeating Mr. Trump in a general election and a more unfettered mandate to enact progressive policies in Washington.Katie Glueck reported from Pella, and Lisa Lerer from Decorah.

| Jump to first hitInterviews with dozens of Democratic Party officials, including 93 superdelegates, found overwhelming opposition to handing Mr. Sanders the nomination if he fell short of a majority of delegates.WASHINGTON -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, hear constant warnings from allies about congressional losses in November if the party nominates Bernie Sanders for president. Democratic House members share their Sanders fears on text-messaging chains. Bill Clinton, in calls with old friends, vents about the party getting wiped out in the general election.And officials in the national and state parties are increasingly anxious about splintered primaries on Super Tuesday and beyond, where the liberal Mr. Sanders edges out moderate candidates who collectively win more votes.Dozens of interviews with Democratic establishment leaders this week show that they are not just worried about Mr. Sanders's candidacy, but are also willing to risk intraparty damage to stop his nomination at the national convention in July if they get the chance. Since Mr. Sanders's victory in Nevada's caucuses on Saturday, The Times has interviewed 93 party officials -- all of them superdelegates, who could have a say on the nominee at the convention -- and found overwhelming opposition to handing the Vermont senator the nomination if he arrived with the most delegates but fell short of a majority.Such a situation may result in a brokered convention, a messy political battle the likes of which Democrats have not seen since 1952, when the nominee was Adlai Stevenson.""We're way, way, way past the day where party leaders can determine an outcome here, but I think there's a vibrant conversation about whether there is anything that can be done,"" said Jim Himes, a Connecticut congressman and superdelegate, who believed the nominee should have a majority of delegates.From California to the Carolinas, and North Dakota to Ohio, the party leaders say they worry that Mr. Sanders, a democratic socialist with passionate but limited support so far, will lose to President Trump, and drag down moderate House and Senate candidates in swing states with his left-wing agenda of ""Medicare for all"" and free four-year public college.Mr. Sanders and his advisers insist that the opposite is true -- that his ideas will generate huge excitement among young and working-class voters, and lead to record turnout. Such hopes have yet to be borne out in nominating contests so far.Jay Jacobs, the New York State Democratic Party chairman and a superdelegate, echoing many others interviewed, said that superdelegates should choose a nominee they believed had the best chance of defeating Mr. Trump if no candidate wins a majority of delegates during the primaries. Mr. Sanders argued that he should become the nominee at the convention with a plurality of delegates, to reflect the will of voters, and that denying him the nomination would enrage his supporters and split the party for years to come.""Bernie wants to redefine the rules and just say he just needs a plurality,"" Mr. Jacobs said. ""I don't think we buy that. I don't think the mainstream of the Democratic Party buys that. If he doesn't have a majority, it stands to reason that he may not become the nominee.""This article is based on interviews with the 93 superdelegates, out of 771 total, as well as party strategists and aides to senior Democrats about the thinking of party leaders. A vast majority of those superdelegates -- whose ranks include federal elected officials, former presidents and vice presidents and D.N.C. members -- predicted that no candidate would clinch the nomination during the primaries, and that there would be a brokered convention fight in July to choose a nominee.In a reflection of the establishment's wariness about Mr. Sanders, only nine of the 93 superdelegates interviewed said that Mr. Sanders should become the nominee purely on the basis of arriving at the convention with a plurality, if he was short of a majority.""I've had 60 years experience with Democratic delegates -- I don't think they will do anything like that,"" said former Vice President Walter Mondale, who is a superdelegate. ""They will each do what they want to do, and somehow they will work it out. God knows how.""As for his own vote, Mr. Mondale, the 1984 Democratic presidential nominee, said, ""I vote for the person I think should be president.""'I've had 60 years experience with Democratic delegates. I don't think they will do anything like that.'-- Former Vice President Walter MondaleWhile there is no widespread public effort underway to undercut Mr. Sanders, arresting his rise has emerged as the dominant topic in many Democratic circles. Some are trying to act well before the convention: Since Mr. Sanders won Nevada's caucuses on Saturday, four donors have approached former Representative Steve Israel of New York to ask if he can suggest someone to run a super PAC aimed at blocking Mr. Sanders. He declined their offer.""People are worried,"" said former Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut, a former Democratic National Committee chairman who in October endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ""How you can spend four or five months hoping you don't have to put a bumper sticker from that guy on your car.""That anxiety has led even superdelegates to suggest ideas that sound ripped from the pages of a political drama.In recent weeks, Democrats have placed a steady stream of calls to Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who opted against running for president nearly a year ago, suggesting that he can emerge as a white knight nominee at a brokered convention -- in part on the theory that he may carry his home state in a general election.""If you could get to a convention and pick Sherrod Brown, that would be wonderful, but that's more like a novel,"" Representative Steve Cohen of Tennessee said. ""Donald Trump's presidency is like a horror story, so if you can have a horror story you might as well have a novel.""Others are urging former President Barack Obama to get involved to broker a truce -- either among the four moderate candidates or between the Sanders and establishment wings, according to three people familiar with those conversations.William Owen, a D.N.C. member from Tennessee, suggested that if Mr. Obama was unwilling, his wife, Michelle, could be nominated as vice president, giving the party a figure they could rally behind.""She's the only person I can think of who can unify the party and help us win,"" he said. ""This election is about saving the American experiment as a republic. It's also about saving the world. This is not an ordinary election.""People close to Mr. Obama say he has no intention of getting involved in the primary contest, seeing his role as less of a kingmaker than as a unifying figure to help heal party divisions once Democrats settle on a nominee. He also believed that the Democratic Party shouldn't engage in smoke-filled-room politics, arguing that those kinds of deals would have prevented him from capturing the nomination when he ran against Hillary Clinton in 2008.'This election is about saving the American experiment as a republic.'-- William Owen, a D.N.C. member from TennesseeOfficials at the Democratic National Committee maintain that it is highly improbable to head to the convention without an assured nominee. Historically, superdelegates had always supported the candidate who won the most pledged delegates, which accrue from primary and caucus wins. While those delegates are proportioned based on the results of those elections, they are not legally bound -- meaning that they are technically free to change their votes as the race progresses.In recent days, both Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said that Mr. Sanders should not become the nominee if he arrived at the convention short of a delegate majority. ""Bernie had a big hand in writing these rules,"" Ms. Warren said during a CNN forum on Wednesday night. ""I don't see how he thinks he gets to change them now that he thinks there's an advantage for him.""Slightly less than 3 percent of delegates have been allocated in the race so far, and Mr. Sanders, of course, can win a majority, making him the nominee. But while Mr. Sanders has demonstrated momentum in the race, winning the most votes in each of the first three contests, he has yet to show that he can expand his coalition enough to set his campaign on a path to capturing the majority of delegates. As a result, some within Mr. Sanders's own campaign foresee a possible brokered convention.The argument of Mr. Sanders and his allies -- that a plurality of delegates should be sufficient to clinch the nomination -- is a different standard than the one laid out in party rules that his team helped draft two years ago. It's also a reversal of their stance in 2016, when Mr. Sanders encouraged superdelegates to support him over Mrs. Clinton, who secured the majority of pledged delegates.""The will of the people should prevail,"" he said when asked during last week's debate if the candidate with the most pledged delegates should be the Democratic nominee. ""The person who has the most votes should become the nominee.""Supporters of Mr. Sanders said that blocking him from the nomination if he had the most delegates would repel progressives, and would deliver a second term to Mr. Trump.""If Bernie gets a plurality and nobody else is even close and the superdelegates weigh in and say, 'We know better than the voters,' I think that will be a big problem,"" said Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington state, a Sanders supporter who is co-chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.'We don't have to freak out.'-- Jane Kleeb, the Nebraska Democratic chairwomanNot only would a messy convention fight risk alienating a sizable part of the Democratic base that supports Mr. Sanders, it would also give Republicans ammunition to use in the general election.""We don't have to freak out,"" said Jane Kleeb, the Nebraska Democratic chairwoman, who helped write Democrats' presidential nominating rules and supported Mr. Sanders in 2016. ""We shouldn't be second-guessing voters. If that's what our party leaders are going to do, you'll see rebellion not just in the presidential race, but in down-ballot races as well.""Others in the party view Mr. Sanders as such an existential threat that they see stopping him from winning the nomination as less risky than a public convention fight. Many feared that putting Mr. Sanders on the top of the ticket could cost Democrats the political gains of the Trump era, a period when the party won control of the House, took governor's mansions in deep red states and flipped statehouses across the country.""Bernie seems to have declared war on the Democratic Party -- and it's caused panic in the House ranks,"" said Representative Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey, a supporter of former Mayor Michael Bloomberg of New York. Private polling of Mr. Gottheimer's northern New Jersey district, for example, shows a double-digit gap in the approval ratings of Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders.Representative Veronica Escobar of Texas said that if Mr. Sanders arrived at the convention with 40 percent of the delegates, it wouldn't be enough to convince her to vote for him on the second ballot.""If 60 percent is not with Bernie Sanders, I think that says something, I really do,"" she said.Results in the Super Tuesday contests should give Democrats a strong indication of where the nominating contest is headed.'If 60 percent is not with Bernie Sanders, I think that says something, I really do.'-- Representative Veronica Escobar of TexasShould Mr. Sanders win big in the 16 states and territories holding primaries and caucuses on Super Tuesday next week, he could be on a path to the 1,991 pledged delegates needed to capture the nomination on the first ballot at the party's convention. But if the Super Tuesday vote is sharply divided among Mr. Sanders and two or more other rivals, the Vermont senator could find himself with more delegates than the competition but not enough to win the nomination outright.Under the current rules, the convention would then go to a second ballot. On that vote, all 3,979 pledged delegates and 771 superdelegates would be free to vote for any candidate they chose.That would give Democratic delegates a huge amount of power to determine the nominee, setting off a fierce round of jockeying by the candidates to win over 2,375.5 delegates and superdelegates. (Superdelegates from Democrats Abroad count as half a vote each.)""It is a mini primary process in the making,"" said Leah Daughtry, who ran the party's 2008 and 2016 conventions. She's been warning Democratic donors about the prospect of a contested convention for nearly a year. ""If you don't have a political operation that will get you through a second ballot then what are you going to do in a general?""The campaigns are already strategizing about how they will handle a protracted convention battle. Superdelegates, too, are brushing up on the rules: Ms. Pelosi invited House Democrats to a meeting at D.N.C. headquarters on Thursday to review the details of the convention process.""Whatever the atmosphere is, and I would hope that everyone would say, no matter who the nominee is for president, we wholeheartedly embrace that person,"" she said, in a private caucus meeting on Wednesday morning, according to an aide in the room.According to a person familiar with the private conversations, Mr. Schumer told people he had so far stayed out of the primary because many members of his caucus were running. He argued that there was one school of thought that you needed to win the base and one that you needed to bring new voters in, and said that he did not yet know which candidate would be able to accomplish those goals.A number of superdelegates dream of a savior candidate who is not now in the race, perhaps Mr. Brown, or maybe someone who already dropped out the race, like Senator Kamala Harris of California.Representative Don Beyer of Virginia cast an even wider net, suggesting senators from Virginia and Delaware, along with Ms. Pelosi, as possible nominees.""At some point you could imagine saying, 'Let's go get Mark Warner, Chris Coons, Nancy Pelosi,""' he said, while preparing to introduce the former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., at a campaign event near his home on Sunday. ""Somebody that could win and we could all get behind and celebrate.""PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders has yet to show he can expand his coalition enough to be on a path to gaining the majority of delegates.

| Jump to first hitFor some college students who support Mr. Sanders, leaving campus means more time to phone bank, and a captive, if skeptical, audience at home.With the country in crisis mode, Melat Eskender, 19, has assumed battle position: In her parents' living room making phone calls for Senator Bernie Sanders, with quarantine rations of Flamin' Hot Cheetos at her side.The coronavirus outbreak has scattered college students across the country. Thousands left their campuses to return to their childhood bedrooms, as universities have announced that they are moving to remote learning and recommending, or requiring, that students leave. For many, that can mean a wistful sense of time lost with friends and school rituals missed, not to mention cabin fever. But there's an upside, as Ms. Eskender put it: ""Being isolated in my home and not having classes, it gives me time to focus on this campaign.""Ms. Eskender, a Yale freshman from Columbus, Ohio, believes that the Covid-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on Mr. Sanders's strengths as a candidate, both in his health care-focused policy platform and leadership style. ""I don't see him as an authoritative leader, I see him as a healer,"" Ms. Eskender said. ""His policies and leadership are what the country need right now.""For many young Sanders supporters, recent weeks have brought a sense of angst and grief: Their preferred candidate's shot at the nomination has rapidly declined, as the country has been swept into a public health disaster. And the coronavirus pandemic has underscored their belief in Mr. Sanders's ""Medicare for all"" plan, just as his chance of election seems more elusive than ever. He is behind former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, who ended Tuesday with victories in Florida, Illinois and Arizona -- and overtures to the Sanders base in remarks over a livestream from his home in Delaware. ""Let me say especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you.""Many of those young voters, though, aren't so ready to move on.""It feels like everything is so dark and spiraling quickly for our country,"" said Kathe McCormick-Evans, 23, a Sanders supporter in Cambridge, Mass. ""Coronavirus feels really scary and uncertain and I was previously feeling a lot of hope around Bernie and the primaries. Seeing him fall in the polls is just another reminder that things are slowly falling apart.""Before the world was completely upended -- a.k.a., earlier this month -- Ms. McCormick-Evans defended Mr. Sanders's merits in a ""heated"" group chat with family and friends who supported Senator Elizabeth Warren, in the days leading up to the Massachusetts primary. She fended off accusations that supporting Mr. Sanders was sexist, and told her mom how excited she would be to live in a country led by a Democratic Socialist. Now the pandemic feels to her like proof of the country's leadership crisis, but the unease of the moment makes it hard to hold onto the hope she had just weeks ago, when she cast her ballot.It's a blow to the young people fueled for months by the sense of possibility they felt in his candidacy. But a belief in the underdog is something endemic to the Sanders base, and many are intent on transferring their anxieties into action.Ruth Geye, 21, a college student in New York, was disappointed to see her senior spring cut short when New York University announced on March 9 a move to remotely hold classes. But she quickly realized that going back to Shaker Heights, Ohio, meant closer proximity to family members she can enlist in campaign work for Mr. Sanders. ""My parents pride themselves on doing a lot of driving people to the polls, but given that won't be a thing, maybe I can channel that energy into making calls for Bernie,"" Ms. Geye said.For Ms. Geye, the pilgrimage home to her boomer parents was a reminder of the generational fissures that Mr. Sanders's campaign exposed. While she was able to persuade her mom to pledge support for Mr. Sanders in the now delayed Ohio primary, it took some convincing.Earlier in the primaries, they disagreed especially on the role of female representation. Ms. Geye's mother liked the idea of supporting ""a very smart woman"" like Ms. Warren, while Ms. Geye's view on gender was more straightforward: ""I truly don't care.""She wasn't impressed by Joe Biden's commitment to selecting a female vice president at Sunday's debate, the first since Ms. Warren dropped out of the race, nor deterred by Mr. Sanders' lack of a commitment.Like other young female Sanders supporters, voting for a woman doesn't feel pressing -- especially at a time of social, economic and now public health crisis.""Seeing yourself in political leaders only goes so far,"" Ms. Geye said. To ensure her mom's support for Mr. Sanders, she reached deep into her political arsenal: ""I told her the only way I could afford grandchildren was the world Bernie was working toward. So I may have leveraged grandchildren, but it worked.""That desperate times call for desperate measures is a view almost axiomatic to some Sanders supporters. And some feel that in upending work, school and economic routines, the coronavirus outbreak could make voters more sympathetic to Mr. Sanders's message of remaking government and a larger social safety net. Mr. Sanders made the point himself during Sunday night's debate, telling viewers that the pandemic exposes ""dysfunctionality"" in the country's health care system.Kirsten Gronlund, 24, who is in self-isolation in her East Village, New York City, apartment, said amid her fears about the coronavirus, she's also held on to hope that it could be a catalyst for ""sweeping, fundamental changes to American life."" The anxieties of quarantine make it challenging for her to focus on day-to-day work, she said, but more meaningful to talk to voters about a brighter vision for the country's future.""It's hard to focus on work when everything feels so apocalyptic,"" she said. ""It feels like we're so helpless watching world leaders scramble and flail. But something like organizing for real political change feels like an appropriate response.""The coronavirus quarantines could even offer Sanders phone-bankers a logistical boost. Shivam Shukla, 20, a student at University of South Florida, said he thinks people might be more willing to answer his calls for Sanders and engage rather than hanging up immediately, since many are home and lacking social interaction.Mr. Shukla realizes that the weeks ahead will be rocky for the Sanders campaign, but he's known since the start that the campaign would be an uphill battle. ""It was always going to be a tough ride, but if anytime now is the time to pitch health care for all,"" he said. So he's stocked up on M&M packets and decked out his parents' Tampa home with cutouts of Mr. Sanders. ""My bedroom looks kind of like a campaign office,"" he said.Some young Sanders supporters say they're already seeing the effects of their quarantine campaigns. Katelin Penner, 19, a sophomore at Wesleyan, moved back in with her parents in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York, for the remainder of the semester. Since returning home she has been phone-banking for Mr. Sanders from her bedroom, but she's living in a house divided; her parents and sister support Mr. Biden. For months, she's argued with them over policy and electability to no avail -- until last weekend.Watching the news on coronavirus in her living room, Ms. Penner's mother turned to her and said she was beginning to see the appeal of Medicare for all.""I think coronavirus might make it a more palatable idea,"" Ms. Penner said. And fortunately, she added, she has more than a month left at home before the New York primaries.PhotographOn March 2, supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders gathered in Salt Lake City. From now on, they must band together online.

| Jump to first hitAnd Michael Bloomberg and Bernie Sanders are competing fiercely in places like Fresno, where candidates very rarely go.FRESNO, Calif. -- ""There's nothing magical about California,"" Michael R. Bloomberg declared after a day flying through the state -- or Iowa, for that matter, he added.But here he was in California, not any of the four early nominating states, trying to make the magic happen.So there were free carne asada tacos in front of Fresno City College, along with free Mike 2020 T-shirts, designed to draw a lunchtime crowd to hear the former New York mayor speak in a courtyard lined with citrus trees.""I have never backed down from a bully or run away from a fight,"" Mr. Bloomberg said, standing in front of dozens of signs urging supporters to ""vote early."" Then he turned to the core of his appeal: ""I'm the un-Trump.""It is simple math -- with 415 delegates, California has more electoral power than all four early states combined. And while the political world waited for, then pored over, the partial results from not quite 170,000 voters in Iowa, there are currently about 20 million registered voters in California, and roughly 15 million of them received mail-in ballots this week.Typically a late-spring afterthought in the nominating contests, and largely ignored in the general election because their state is so reliably blue, the voters of California aren't accustomed to culling national candidates.But this year, state officials moved voting day to Super Tuesday, the earliest the California primary has been since 2008.California matters now. And the earlier primary means that presidential candidates are spending time and money in parts of the state that rarely see big-name politicians of any kind. Democratic Senate candidates and would-be governors often skip over the Central Valley, the agricultural heart of California, reasoning there are far more votes to be had outside the relatively rural and conservative part of the state.""The Appalachia of California,"" is how Antonio Villaraigosa, the former mayor of Los Angeles, referred to the Central Valley as he traveled with Mr. Bloomberg Monday in Fresno, the region's largest city by population, after offering his endorsement and becoming a national political co-chair for the campaign.While the coastal cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco have long been treated as political ATMs, the less wealthy Central Valley and Inland Empire have often struggled for attention and power.But now California's Inland Empire, as the region about 50 miles east of Los Angeles is known, is a must-stop. Senator Bernie Sanders and Mr. Bloomberg, the candidates who have devoted the most resources to California, have both come to campaign in person and opened up field offices in the area, as well as in the Central Valley.""People here have been beaten down for so long that they feel like their vote doesn't matter,"" said Michael Gomez Daly, the executive director for Inland Empire United, a left-leaning political advocacy group.Smaller communities in other parts of the country have gotten attention from politicians for years, he said. ""Now it's our turn to say: 'These are the issues and what are you going to do about it?""'Like many other local leaders, Mr. Gomez Daly lists homelessness, poverty, immigration and the environment as some of the most pressing concerns for the region. In an area packed with warehouses used to distribute imported goods all over the country, activists in the region have been focusing their ire on Amazon, blaming the behemoth for stagnant low wages and pollution.When Mr. Sanders visited, he too spoke out against Amazon by pitching the Green New Deal, which would crack down on truck emissions that pollute the region.Just as in other Super Tuesday states, Michael Bloomberg is spending lavishly to get on the airwaves here -- so far paying nearly $34 million to advertise on television across the state, including roughly $1.8 million on Spanish-language stations, according to Advertising Analytics.His money is by far eclipsing other candidates who remain focused elsewhere. Only the other billionaire in the race, Tom Steyer, has come anywhere close, spending nearly $15 million since last summer. Mr. Sanders's campaign has spent roughly $3 million on television in California so far, and has said it plans to spend over $2.5 million more, spread between California and Texas, another delegate-rich Super Tuesday state. (None of the other top candidates have advertised on television so far.)But the attention goes beyond the airwaves. The Sanders and Bloomberg campaigns are testing the theory that California is not a place that can be organized with foot soldiers.So far, Mr. Bloomberg has 220 staff members throughout the state, a number his campaign expects to grow to 800 by the end of the month. Mr. Sanders's campaign, which has operated several offices throughout the state, has about 90 organizers.Though longtime political operatives in the state dismiss the notion that reaching out to individual voters is effective in a statewide election, the Sanders campaign boasts of knocking on 400,000 doors and making 3.5 million phone calls in California in the last year.Both the Sanders and Bloomberg campaigns are specifically targeting the Inland Empire and Central Valley, two of the only regions in the state that still send Republicans to Congress. While Mr. Bloomberg's supporters believe he can attract moderate voters from the area, Mr. Sanders's staff is focusing on voters who backed Barack Obama and then switched to Donald J. Trump in those regions -- especially white working-class men.""Riverside is our Des Moines,"" said Anna Bahr, a California spokeswoman for the Sanders campaign, describing efforts in the Inland Empire city.Other campaigns seem to be taking a more traditional approach, waiting for more results to shake out in the early states before pouring money into California.Senator Elizabeth Warren has held several large rallies in the state, but so far has a smaller staff operation. Advisers to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. say that their internal polling shows that he consistently meets the 15 percent threshold -- the number needed to secure delegates -- in each of the state's congressional districts.Current polling shows Mr. Sanders leading, ahead of Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren. Both Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Mr. Bloomberg have yet to break into the top tier in the state.A candidate needs to capture at least 15 percent of the vote in a congressional district or statewide in order to win delegates in California. Because the state has such a large number of delegates, it is possible for a candidate to rack up many delegates toward the nomination, even if he or she does not win the popular vote here. And if the race is tight, it is possible it will take days or weeks before the final results are clear.Mr. Bloomberg, thanks to his resources, remains the biggest unknown factor. Campaign officials say they are confident they have more time to ramp up, with many voters still undecided and Mr. Biden's top-tier standing in question after a weak performance in the Iowa caucuses.Jerry Brown, the former governor who remains one of the state's most popular political figures, said he believes the Democratic nomination may not be decided until the summer convention, but that Mr. Bloomberg could easily shift the dynamics with his spending alone. Though California has a history of rejecting self-funded candidates, Mr. Brown recalled watching his own internal polls steadily tick up during his 2010 race for governor, as he began spending heavily on television ads.""I had been behind from May to September, then we started on television after Labor Day and I started going up a point or two every week,"" he said. ""California voters are swayed by what they see on their televisions.At his rallies across the state Monday, several people in the crowds said they remained undecided, but were considering Mr. Bloomberg in part because of his willingness to spend lavishly to beat Mr. Trump and his experience in running the largest city in the country.Still, there were signs of Mr. Bloomberg's uphill battle, particularly among people of color, several of whom mentioned the stop-and-frisk policing tactic that he pursued for a decade and that disproportionately targeted black and Latino men. Mr. Bloomberg defended the policy for years before apologizing late last year.""We've heard a lot of candidates make a lot of promises to the African-American community and then no follow through,"" said Nina Childs, 36, a writer who lives in Compton. ""A lot of people I know, a lot of black millennials are really excited by Sanders. Are they going to get excited by someone who supported stop and frisk, like Bloomberg? No.""Latinos make up roughly 24 percent of likely voters in California, and the Sanders campaign has made getting their votes a cornerstone of its strategy here.So far, Mr. Sanders's campaign has spent roughly $1.7 million on Spanish-language television advertising, according to Advertising Analytics, about the same as Mr. Bloomberg. And Mr. Bloomberg is aggressively courting moderate Latino and black voters, touting the backing of Mr. Villaraigosa and Aja Brown, the mayor of Compton and one of several African-American leaders to endorse him in recent days.""Central Valley issues are Latino issues, and Latino issues are American issues,"" Mr. Bloomberg told voters in Fresno.Mr. Bloomberg, who is known for his earnest but halting attempts to speak Spanish, shied away from speaking the language on the stump through his tour of the state. Then, in Compton, he riffed on the Super Bowl halftime show.""I think we know which team put on the most impressive performance,"" he said. ""Shar-eek-ah and JLo."" The crowd laughed politely, seemingly forgiving the mangled pronunciation of the Colombian superstar Shakira's name.In some ways, the campaigns' California plans seem to echo the ""fishhook strategy"" Republicans tried to use in the state decades ago, targeting the central region of the state and inland Southern California, said Karthick Ramakrishnan, a professor of public policy and politics at the University of California, Riverside.""I think this region is getting to a stage where people here expect to be treated better, in terms of having candidates actually visit and paying attention to them,"" Mr. Ramakrishnan said.Rusty Bailey, the mayor of Riverside, describes himself as a moderate and is registered as ""no party preference"" but plans to vote in the Democratic primary. He was leaning toward Mr. Buttigieg until Mr. Bloomberg came to stump in Riverside in January.The top issue in the region is homelessness, Mr. Bailey said, and he believes that Mr. Bloomberg understands the concerns.Mr. Gomez Daly, the policy director of the Inland Empire advocacy group, said that the infusion of attention was a ""dream for the local political infrastructure.""And, he said, he sees other benefits too.""Everybody I know seems to have been hired by the Sanders and Bloomberg campaigns.""PhotographA rally for Bernie Sanders in Moreno Valley, Calif.

| Jump to first hitBernie Sanders is looking more and more like the clear front-runner, as he steadily adds to his support while the rest of the field remains divided.Mr. Sanders has the support of nearly three in 10 Democratic voters nationwide -- a strong faction, though not an overwhelming plurality. It has become a more convincing advantage, however, in a race in which no other candidate has emerged as a focal point for opposition to Mr. Sanders. Between the rise of Michael R. Bloomberg and the recent plunge of Joseph R. Biden Jr., there are now four candidates polling in the low- to mid-teens, and no one besides Mr. Sanders with support above 20 percent.So far, there is little evidence of a national surge for either Pete Buttigieg, who essentially tied with Mr. Sanders in Iowa and nearly matched him in New Hampshire, or Amy Klobuchar, who became a surprise third-place finisher in New Hampshire. Both have ticked up slightly, but they are still running behind all the other major candidates.That picture may or may not hold for long: Our national polling average does not reflect any impact from the most recent debate in Nevada, where Mr. Bloomberg struggled badly and Elizabeth Warren delivered what was seen as her strongest performance of the campaign. And the Nevada caucuses this weekend have the potential to boost Mr. Sanders further.Mr. Sanders's rivals may be running out of time to catch up.Still, there are reasons to believe the race may not be over anytime soon. Scattered polling in the Super Tuesday states has found Mr. Biden fairly resilient in places with large African-American populations, leaving him a plausible path to a comeback. Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Warren have both reported a huge influx of money after their recent debate victories, suggesting there is still a sizable well of online fund-raising available to candidates besides Mr. Sanders. And of course, money is no object for Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire who is financing his own campaign.But Mr. Bloomberg's campaign is also facing an awkward reality: His candidacy was supposed to be a bulwark against Mr. Sanders, but so far its main effect has been to fragment the moderate wing of the party. To overtake Mr. Sanders, he will need to close hard in the Super Tuesday states, and that almost certainly means performing far better in next week's South Carolina debate. ALEXANDER BURNSWe are still not done counting votes in Iowa, but on we go anyway. Here's what happened this week in Nevada and elsewhere on the campaign trail.What Will Happen Tonight in Nevada?If you're reading this Saturday morning, today is the day! Nevadans will be headed to their caucus locations in a matter of hours, and if all goes according to plan -- and yes, we know that's a big if -- we will soon get some results.Nevada Democratic officials are not taking anything for granted, but the candidates face their own challenges.■Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s campaign is banking on second place or better.■ The largest labor union in Nevada opposes ""Medicare for all,"" Senator Bernie Sanders's signature policy.■ Senator Elizabeth Warren needs to translate her strong debate performance into a strong finish.■ Senator Amy Klobuchar and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., need to show they can be viable in states that are more racially diverse than Iowa and New Hampshire.Gloves Come Off At the DebateAs our colleagues Alexander Burns and Jonathan Martin put it in their recap: ""The Democratic presidential candidates turned on one another in scorching and personal terms in a debate on Wednesday night.""Former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York took repeated fire from pretty much everyone, but especially Ms. Warren, who went after him on nondisclosure agreements, his support for stop-and-frisk and his past sexist comments.Ms. Warren, looking to revitalize her campaign, was more forceful than we have typically seen her and got good reviews for her performance. It seems she also got results: Mr. Bloomberg announced on Friday that his company had identified three nondisclosure agreements involving allegations of inappropriate comments by Mr. Bloomberg, and that the women involved could contact the company to be released from those agreements.Mr. Sanders faced questions about his medical history and the behavior of his supporters, and Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg clashed several times in exchanges both withering and personal.""I wish everyone was as perfect as you, Pete,"" Ms. Klobuchar said at one point.""I'm used to senators telling mayors that senators are more important than mayors,"" he responded. ""You don't have to be in Washington to matter.""It's Everyone Against BloombergMr. Bloomberg is not competing in Nevada, but he has gotten considerable attention as he has continued to spend copious amounts of money and rise in national polls. His gains put a huge target on his back this week in Nevada, where candidate after candidate took aim at himMr. Sanders has been particularly direct with his criticism, and he and Ms. Warren have accused Mr. Bloomberg of trying to buy the election. This week, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign punched back, comparing Mr. Sanders's campaign tactics unfavorably to those used by President Trump.■ New campaign finance reports show that as of the end of January, Mr. Bloomberg had spent $409 million on his presidential campaign.And Bloomberg Vs. Wall StreetMr. Bloomberg, seeking to catch up to candidates who have been releasing plans for months, announced five this week, including one to restore Obama-era financial regulations and rein in the same industry where he made his tens of billions.His Wall Street plan would impose a 0.1 percent tax on stock sales and other financial transactions -- a proposal also supported by Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on the left, in a very rare alignment for Mr. Bloomberg. (Mr. Buttigieg also supports such a tax.)It would also reverse much of the Trump administration's deregulation and establish a team within the Justice Department to push prosecutors ""to pursue individuals, not only corporations, for infractions.""Policy News From the Trail■ Mr. Buttigieg released a plan to protect public lands, proposing to ban new fossil fuel leases, increase funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and set a target of ""protecting and restoring at least 30 percent of U.S. lands and oceans by 2030.""■ Ms. Warren announced an agenda for small businesses. Among many other things, it would create a $7 billion equity fund for people of color to start businesses, support small businesses and entrepreneurs with federal contracts, and establish a grant program to encourage states and cities ""to cut unnecessary regulatory requirements and to help small business owners navigate necessary ones.""■ In addition to his Wall Street proposal, Mr. Bloomberg released a criminal justice reform plan. That's a big one for his campaign given how much of a liability his record on stop-andfrisk and other policing issues are. The plan -- parts of which he announced in December -- calls for a higher standard for using force, an end to cash bail and mandatory minimums, and $100 million a year in funding for the Obama-era My Brother's Keeper program.■ Mr. Bloomberg also released plans on labor rights, retirement and higher education. In them, he endorsed a number of proposals that he opposed as mayor but that have now become standard among Democrats, such as raising the minimum wage to $15.Who Is Leading the Polls?National polls are a flawed tool for predicting elections. That's even truer in a primary that will unfold in stages, with one or several states voting at a time. But the broad national picture is still important, offering a sense of which candidates are gaining support over all. We are keeping an eye on state-level polling, too, especially in the early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.PhotographA Bernie Sanders hoodie at a rally Monday in Tacoma, Wash. National polls show that nearly three in 10 Democrats support Mr. Sanders, a modest edge that looks stronger in a race that lacks an obvious No. 2.

| Jump to first hitWith an increasingly narrow path to the nomination, Mr. Sanders and his advisers were weighing his options amid a national health crisis.Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was reassessing the future of his presidential bid on Wednesday after a crushing round of primary losses left him with no realistic path to the Democratic nomination and the 2020 race itself was on hold because of the coronavirus outbreak.Mr. Sanders's campaign has stopped actively advertising on Facebook, and his campaign manager sent an email to supporters without asking for donations -- the kind of steps that sometimes precede the end of campaigns. His aides say Mr. Sanders is not suspending his bid, even as some Democrats have become increasingly vocal that he should consider leaving the race.The party's front-runner, Joseph R. Biden Jr., has now amassed a nearly insurmountable lead in delegates needed to clinch the nomination after winning the Arizona, Florida and Illinois primaries on Tuesday. Mr. Biden has swept so many states and attracted so many demographic groups that Mr. Sanders has little left to go on besides his political message and his passionate base of liberal supporters.Some Democrats said that with the delegate outlook so bleak, and with a deadly pandemic gripping an anxious nation, Mr. Sanders risks appearing self-centered and out of step if he insists on pressing ahead.""Bernie is getting beat by 30 and 40 points -- it's over,"" said Representative Don Beyer of Virginia, who has endorsed Mr. Biden. ""This is the adult thing to do -- knowing when it is time to disappear.""Mr. Sanders, who has not said when he will make an announcement about his future, was testy on Wednesday when asked by a CNN reporter about his plans, suggesting his sole focus should be on the virus.""I'm dealing with a fucking global crisis,"" he said at the Capitol. ""You know, we're dealing with it, and you're asking me these questions.""""Right now, I'm trying to do my best to make sure that we don't have an economic meltdown and that people don't die,"" he added. ""Is that enough for you to keep me busy for today?""Some Democrats said Mr. Sanders had already accomplished a great deal by promoting his liberal policy agenda. Yet they warned that staying in the race could damage the coalition he has built since 2015.""It's time to throw in the towel knowing that he has won the battle of issues,"" said Wilbur Colom, a Democratic National Committee member from Mississippi who formerly supported Michael R. Bloomberg. ""The Democratic Party has moved within inches of his revolution on all major issues.""Yet 26 states, territories and the District of Columbia have yet to hold primaries and caucuses, and there are still 1,399 delegates left to be awarded. With the primary season essentially on hold because of public health concerns, it could be at least two months before Mr. Biden accumulates enough to secure the nomination. D.N.C. rules require a presidential nominee to accrue 1,991 delegates, and Mr. Biden cannot win those delegates if states don't hold their primaries.But if Mr. Sanders does quit, Mr. Biden would be free to move on to focus on the general election, President Trump and the national challenges posed by the virus.Even among those who view Mr. Biden's eventual triumph as inevitable, there is a belief that contested primaries are good for the party, generating enthusiasm and spurring turnout. In Wisconsin, Democratic officials worry that if Mr. Sanders drops out before the state's planned April 7 primary, it could depress turnout and hurt liberal candidates for state and local offices.""There's thousands of people on the ballot right now,"" said Andrew Werthmann, a D.N.C. member from Eau Claire, Wis. ""People should recognize that having contested primaries does help drive turnout and that helps all elections down the ballot.""Others in the party say that prodding Mr. Sanders to drop out now would deprive his loyalists of the right to show their support for him at the ballot box. And for the party's left wing, having Mr. Sanders continue to run would enable them to win delegate slots at the national convention, which would provide leverage when it comes to shaping the party's platform and writing rules for the next presidential nominating contest.""Bernie is not running a campaign so much as leading a movement,"" said Winston Apple, a D.N.C. member from Missouri who supports Mr. Sanders. ""He will be a more effective leader for our movement if he remains in contention throughout the process.""Former President Barack Obama, who is close to Mr. Biden, has grown increasingly anxious over the difficulties of incorporating the Sanders wing of the party into the Biden coalition, according to former aides and associates. But he has made it clear he will wait for the Vermont senator to approach him before playing a larger role, one former aide said.One of the most conspicuous Sanders boosters on Wednesday was Mr. Trump himself, who has regularly claimed that the Democratic establishment was trying to rig the system against Mr. Sanders -- and whose campaign viewed Mr. Sanders as its preferred opponent.""The DNC will have gotten their fondest wish and defeated Bernie Sanders, far ahead of schedule,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Now they are doing everything possible to be nice to him in order to keep his supporters.""Officials close to Mr. Biden say they are sensitive to being perceived as pushing Mr. Sanders too hard. In a series of staff and surrogate calls over the past week, Biden aides have increasingly pressed for an approach in which Mr. Biden begins to ignore Mr. Sanders altogether and instead tries to turn the race into a two-man contest with Mr. Trump, according to people familiar with the campaign's strategy.Mr. Biden's campaign also understands it is operating from a position of strength. On Wednesday it sent a memo to reporters that declared he had an ""increasingly clear"" path to the nomination and saying the 2020 primary race ""is nowhere near as close as the 2008 and 2016 Democratic primaries.""The two campaigns have been communicating, however. Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden, said in a statement on Wednesday that ""since last week, the Biden and Sanders campaigns have been in regular contact at a senior level to discuss how the coronavirus is affecting the campaigns, how to adjust schedules and activities in light of that -- as well as to discuss both Vice President Biden's and Senator Sanders's ideas on policy responses to the virus.""""While the two campaigns obviously have their differences,"" she added, ""they are working together to try to promote the health and safety of their teams, those who interact with the campaigns, and the American people.""Advisers to Mr. Sanders have begun to make peace with the fact that he will in all likelihood lose the nomination to Mr. Biden. But they also see no real downside in sticking it out, pointing to the uncertainty surrounding the primaries because of the coronavirus.Mr. Sanders also views the crisis as a moment when the progressive agenda he has championed for years is especially vital, and he is eager to leverage his influence at a time when issues like health care and economic inequity are so resonant, some allies say.On Tuesday night before most polls closed, he released a list of proposals to deal with the crisis, including that Medicare cover all medical bills and that $2,000 cash payments be provided to every American each month. He has indicated he plans to speak with Democratic leadership about the plans he has proposed.And one aide said there had been regular discussions in the last several days about ways the campaign can help working families who may be stuck at home, including putting together programming for children to occupy them during the day.After years of being excluded from what he sees as the party's establishment clique, Mr. Sanders is also still determined to show that he is a superior candidate to Mr. Biden, whom he views as the establishment's choice, some close to him say.On the debate stage on Sunday, he delivered pointed attacks on Mr. Biden's record in a way that vexed Biden supporters and left some Democrats wondering aloud if he might weaken the presumptive nominee in the general election against Mr. Trump.Mr. Sanders, however, has insisted he thinks Mr. Biden can beat Mr. Trump, and none of his aides have indicated they are worried that staying in the race will divide the party in a way that benefits Mr. Trump.Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, suggested Wednesday that a decision on how the senator would proceed was not imminent.""The next primary contest is at least three weeks away,"" Mr. Shakir said in a statement. ""Senator Sanders is going to be having conversations with supporters to assess his campaign. In the immediate term, however, he is focused on the government response to the coronavirus outbreak and ensuring that we take care of working people and the most vulnerable.""The ultimate decision on how to proceed, aides said, rests with Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane, who were expected to return to Vermont on Wednesday night; his top campaign advisers were not scheduled to travel with him.But discussions in recent days with more than 40 Democratic National Committee members and members of Congress found a clear majority believed he should get out of the presidential race now -- with some warning that staying in could damage the progressive coalition he has built since 2015. It is possible Mr. Sanders could stay in the race and run what effectively amounts to an inactive campaign as he focuses on his legislative agenda around the coronavirus.Larry Cohen, a longtime Sanders confidant who is chairman of Our Revolution, the political organization that spun out of the 2016 Sanders campaign, said it was not in Mr. Sanders's nature to drop out before all the primaries are over, ""but the pandemic and the current delegate count could lead to a different outcome.""""The delegate count,"" he said, ""speaks for itself."" PhotographAt Sunday's debate, Bernie Sanders delivered pointed attacks on Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s record in a way that galled Biden supporters.

| Jump to first hitThe battle for momentum in the two states could prove pivotal. Here's how the candidates are making their pitches.In South Carolina, four presidential candidates are running ads featuring praise from former President Barack Obama.In Nevada, Senator Bernie Sanders, Tom Steyer and Pete Buttigieg are pitching their candidacies in Spanish.And Mr. Steyer has gone negative, attacking Mr. Sanders of Vermont for failing to provide a price tag for his ""Medicare for All"" plan, calling former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ""another insider"" and Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., an ""untested newcomer.""After the Iowa caucuses devolved into a chaotic mess and the New Hampshire primary did little to offer clarity, the battle for momentum in Nevada and South Carolina -- two states with meaningfully diverse populations that more closely resemble the Democratic base -- could prove pivotal.After the New Hampshire primary, multiple candidates began running their first significant ad campaigns in Nevada, which caucuses on Feb. 22, and South Carolina, which votes on Feb. 29. Total spending in both states jumped to $4.5 million from $2.5 million the week before.And with many campaigns now strapped for cash as they head toward Super Tuesday on March 3, their messaging and the money they can put behind it may foreshadow who will be a force in a national campaign and who will run into a wall.""While there has been some campaigning in Nevada, the voters aren't nearly as tuned in as Iowa and New Hampshire, so it is very important to get campaign messages in front of voters,"" said Kelly Gibson, a Democratic media strategist who advised the campaigns of Andrew Yang and Julián Castro.""The flip side of that,"" she said, is ""many voters are still making up their minds, so the ads can have more immediate effectiveness.""Obama, Clyburn and appeals to black voters in South CarolinaA majority of South Carolina's Democratic voters are black, and campaigns have been tailoring their pitches to appeal to them.Both Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts are running 30 seconds of uninterrupted praise from Mr. Obama.The plaudits for Ms. Warren are for spearheading the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Her campaign has recently cut its ad reservations in South Carolina, and the ad will be on air for only a few more days.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]Mr. Biden's campaign, which has more than $735,000 on air over the next two weeks in a state it has staked its future on, cribbed its ad from the ceremony where he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom.""Joe's candid, honest counsel made me a better president and a better commander in chief,"" Mr. Obama says. ""The best part is he's nowhere close to finished.""Mr. Biden enjoys strong support in South Carolina largely because of his association with Mr. Obama, and by highlighting it he is seeking to boost his struggling campaign.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]But Mr. Biden, who was supported on television in Iowa and New Hampshire by the super PAC Unite the Country, is on his own so far in Nevada and South Carolina; the group has made no additional ad buys, according to Advertising Analytics.Mr. Steyer had to reach a bit further for a connection to Mr. Obama. His ad features Edith Childs, a local politician who in 2008 shouted at Mr. Obama, ""Fired up, ready to go!"" The line became a tagline for him. Ms. Childs, who has now endorsed Mr. Steyer, says in the ad, ""My God, Tom's fired up, and Trump's got to go.""Mr. Steyer has mounted an exorbitantly expensive effort in South Carolina, spending nearly $17 million on television and radio ads in the state since July. For 15 weeks this summer and fall, he was the only candidate on air in the state, running ads largely targeted at black voters, including endorsements from local members of the state's legislative black caucus.By the numbersBIDEN $751,580 total, $404,909 over the last two weeksBUTTIGIEG $1,783,650 total, $428,128 over the last two weeksKLOBUCHAR $56,490 total, all over the last two weeksSANDERS $253,196 total, $162,886 over the last two weeksSTEYER $17,775,264 total, $1,870,852 over the last two weeksWARREN $651,351 total, $276,285 over the last two weeksMr. Buttigieg, who performed strongly in the first two voting states, has been struggling to connect with black voters in South Carolina.On Tuesday, his campaign booked $350,000 worth of ads over one week and put a new ad on air featuring two black staff members -- Walter A. Clyburn Reed and Abe Jenkins. In the ad, they explain why they decided to work for Mr. Buttigieg and reference their prominent grandfathers, the civil rights activist Esau Jenkins and Representative James E. Clyburn.Attack ads, super PACs and speaking in Spanish in NevadaIn Nevada, the ads are getting a little punchier. Mr. Steyer became the first candidate to target a Democratic rival, airing two negative ads, one taking aim at Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, and another at Mr. Sanders.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]""There's a reason people are nervous about Bernie Sanders scrapping Obamacare,"" the narrator says in the anti-Sanders ad, as the screen shows Mr. Sanders appearing on Fox News. ""Unions don't like it.""Mr. Steyer has flooded the airwaves in Nevada, spending $13.8 million of the $18.8 million spent by candidates and super PACs there so far. He's seen his stock rise in both Nevada and South Carolina, climbing in statewide polling likely as a result of having the airwaves mostly to himself.The decision to go negative, which could backfire among Democratic voters who are concerned about divisions before a contentious general election, is a sign of his financial might.""Steyer has nothing to lose,"" said Ms. Gibson, the strategist. ""He has the money to stay in, and has already invested so much. Right now, he doesn't have to go up against Bloomberg on the ballot, which I think he is really taking advantage of.""(Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, is not competing in either Nevada or South Carolina, but his nationwide ad buys mean his ads are seen in both states.)By the numbersBIDEN $902,477 total, $430,751 over the last two weeksBUTTIGIEG $1,024,155 total, $923,190 over the last two weeksKLOBUCHAR $365,233, all over the last two weeksSANDERS $1,811,125 total, $949,232 over the last two weeksSTEYER $13,845,560 total, $1,695,095 over the last two weeksWARREN $1,060,284 total, $507,177 over the last two weeksVOTEVETS $589,100, all over the last two weeksDEMOCRATIC MAJORITY FOR ISRAEL $461,397, all over the last two weeksA super PAC called Democratic Majority for Israel, which spent nearly $1 million on a negative ad attacking Mr. Sanders in Iowa, has made a $460,000 buy in Nevada. The group's founder said last month that Mr. Sanders was in a ""uniquely bad position"" to win a general election.And a super PAC supporting Mr. Buttigieg, VoteVets, just began a $590,000 ad campaign in Nevada.Earlier this month, a top adviser to Mr. Buttigieg tweeted that his military experience would resonate in the state. Per federal election law, campaigns are barred from directly coordinating with super PACs. But by making the statement publicly, the campaign is exonerated.VoteVets clearly got the message, turning out an ad eight days later that featured a Vietnam veteran extolling Mr. Buttigieg's background and message.The current polling leader in Nevada, Mr. Sanders, is doing little message tailoring in the state. His Spanish-language ad is largely biographical, telling the immigration story of his father.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]Mr. Sanders's other ads in Nevada closely mirror his stump speech, though they are delivered by Mr. Sanders, clad in a blue sweater, in a living room. ""I'm Bernie Sanders and I approve this message because we need an economy that works for all of us,"" he says at the end of one of them, ""not just wealthy campaign contributors.""Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, whose campaign recently announced a ""seven-figure"" ad buy in Nevada and South Carolina, is recycling two ads from New Hampshire, including a rapid flip through her plan for her first 100 days as president.Ms. Klobuchar's campaign prefers basing ads on excerpts from her speeches, and after her surprise third-place showing in New Hampshire, she kicked off her primary-night speech with an ad-ready introduction.""Hello America, I'm Amy Klobuchar, and I will beat Donald Trump,"" she said.The candidate later told reporters that she started with that line because she thought it was the first time many in the country would see and hear her. It's likely voters in South Carolina and Nevada will soon hear that line, too.PhotographBarack Obama cameos from, clockwise from top left, Joseph R. Biden Jr., Elizabeth Warren, Michael R.

| Jump to first hitSunday's debate will be the first one-on-one matchup between Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Bernie Sanders. So, how do they actually compare on policy?Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont will debate one on one for the first time on Sunday, and Mr. Sanders, who is staying in the Democratic primary race despite a series of defeats, has already telegraphed his strategy.""Joe, what are you going to do?"" Mr. Sanders repeatedly asked at a news conference last week, ticking off a laundry list of issues he plans to press Mr. Biden on, including health care, student debt, climate change, mass incarceration, immigration and wealth inequality.Mr. Biden, for his part, has criticized Mr. Sanders on gun control and on his signature policy proposal, ""Medicare for all.""Here is where the two candidates stand on some of the issues each may raise.Heath careBidenOne of the biggest distinctions between the candidates is that Mr. Biden does not support a universal government-run health insurance program like ""Medicare for all."" Instead, he supports maintaining the private insurance system but adding a Medicare-like public option that anyone could sign up for -- a proposal that still goes well beyond the Affordable Care Act. He estimates his plan would cost $750 billion over a decade.Mr. Biden would also increase tax credits for people to buy insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. His plan doesn't specifically address medical debt.SandersOne of the bedrock principles of Mr. Sanders's campaign is that health care is a human right, and he is the torchbearer for Medicare for all. He estimates his plan would cost about $30 trillion over 10 years and would be paid for by new revenue of about $17.5 trillion, along with ""current federal, state and local government spending.""He also wants to eliminate $81 billion in medical debt.CoronavirusBidenThe new coronavirus has quickly become the most urgent problem facing the country, and Mr. Biden released a plan on Thursday calling for free testing, ""the elimination of all cost barriers to preventive care and treatment for Covid-19,"" and emergency paid leave for affected workers.He also wants to restore a White House office that oversaw responses to global health crises -- an office that the Obama administration created and the Trump administration eliminated -- and direct the Justice Department to combat price gouging for medical supplies.SandersMr. Sanders outlined his plan to address the coronavirus in a speech on Thursday. He called for a national state of emergency (which President Trump subsequently declared), emergency funding for paid sick leave, an expansion of community health centers and a mandate that all medications related to coronavirus be sold at cost.Student debtBidenMr. Biden wants to make two-year community colleges and ""other high-quality training programs"" debt-free, but would not cancel existing student debt the way Mr. Sanders is proposing. His plan would, however, forgive the remaining balance for people who paid 5 percent of their discretionary income (with the first $25,000 exempt) toward their loans for 20 years.SandersMr. Sanders wants to make all public colleges and universities free, cancel all student loan debt -- about $1.6 trillion owed by about 45 million Americans -- and cap student loan interest rates at 1.88 percent. He says he would pay for the debt cancellation with a tax on financial transactions like stock trades.Climate changeBidenMr. Biden's $1.7 trillion climate plan calls for 100 percent carbon-free energy and net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. It would end fossil fuel subsidies and subsidize clean energy, but envisions a continued role for fossil fuels for some time: It would not ban fracking, for instance. Mr. Biden also supports federal funding for carbon capture and sequestration programs that could, in theory, eventually offset some emissions.SandersMr. Sanders is a proponent of the Green New Deal, a sweeping resolution that calls for aggressive action to combat climate change, and has modeled his $16.3 trillion proposal on that plan. He calls for an immediate ban on fracking, for the electricity and transportation sectors to be carbon-free by 2030, and for the United States to end the use of fossil fuels no later than 2050.ImmigrationBidenMr. Biden wants to undo the Trump administration's hard-line immigration policies, reinstate the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.In contrast to Mr. Sanders, he would not decriminalize unauthorized border crossings, but he is calling for a 100-day moratorium on deportations and says he would deport only people who have committed a serious crime.SandersMr. Sanders has called for a moratorium on deportations pending a review of the current immigration system. He also supports the reinstatement and expansion of the DACA program, which protected from deportation people who were brought into the United States as children.In addition, he has backed the movement to abolish federal agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection.Mass incarcerationBidenCriminal justice is a fraught issue for Mr. Biden, who helped pass laws, like the 1994 crime bill, that produced mass incarceration to begin with. He has made a stark reversal on the issue during this campaign, calling for incentives for states to shift from incarceration to crime prevention, an end to mandatory minimum sentences and the death penalty, and decriminalizing marijuana.In contrast to Mr. Sanders, however, he does not want to legalize marijuana.SandersMr. Sanders has promised to cut the national prison population in half and end mass incarceration. To do that, he wants to abolish the death penalty, three-strikes laws and mandatory minimum sentences, among other measures.Gun controlBidenMr. Biden supports an assault weapons ban, a voluntary buyback program and a ban on online gun sales, as well as a slew of proposals that are nearly universal among Democratic candidates now, like background checks and red-flag laws. He is also calling for incentives for states to enact gun licensing programs.SandersMr. Sanders, like Mr. Biden, supports an assault weapons ban, a voluntary buyback program and many other gun restrictions. But much like criminal justice for Mr. Biden, gun control is a difficult area for Mr. Sanders, politically speaking: Earlier in his career, he voted against federal background checks and legal liability for gun manufacturers.AbortionBidenMr. Biden has a long and complicated record on abortion. In the 1980s, he supported an attempt to let states overturn Roe v. Wade, and he supported the Hyde Amendment -- which prevents Medicaid from covering abortion in most circumstances -- until just last year.Today, however, he supports the same basic set of policies every major Democrat in the race did, including legislation to codify Roe v. Wade, repeals of the Hyde Amendment and the global and domestic ""gag rules,"" and a pledge to nominate only Supreme Court justices who support abortion rights.SandersMr. Sanders also supports legislation to codify Roe v. Wade, opposes the Hyde Amendment and the global and domestic gag rules, and has promised to nominate only Supreme Court justices who would uphold Roe v. Wade.HomelessnessBidenMr. Biden is proposing $640 billion over 10 years for affordable housing, as well as a ""bill of rights"" that would provide protections against eviction, foreclosure and predatory mortgages. He also wants to create tax credits for renters and first-time homeowners and expand the Section 8 housing voucher program.SandersMr. Sanders proposes spending $2.5 trillion to build about 10 million permanently affordable housing units. He also wants to implement a national rent control standard and spend $70 billion to repair public housing.Money in politicsBidenMr. Biden is calling for a constitutional amendment to make elections completely publicly funded, eliminating all private contributions -- a significant step beyond what Mr. Sanders has proposed. In the shorter term, he wants to put new restrictions on super PACs and publicly finance major parties' national conventions.SandersLike most Democrats, Mr. Sanders wants to overturn Citizens United -- the Supreme Court decision that prevents the government from banning political spending by corporations in elections -- and then pass a constitutional amendment that makes clear that money is not speech. He also wants to abolish super PACs and has called for a ban on corporate contributions to the Democratic National Convention.He has criticized Mr. Biden for accepting campaign contributions from billionaires.Wealth inequalityBidenMr. Biden wants to strengthen collective bargaining, hold corporate executives personally liable for anti-union efforts and enforce labor laws more strongly. He is also calling, like many Democrats, for a $15 minimum wage, and for higher taxes on corporations and wealthy investors.SandersMr. Sanders has suggested taxing the rich with a wealth tax and progressive estate tax while also enacting a federal jobs guarantee, doubling union membership and taking other steps to bolster the working and middle class. He also wants to break up big banks.PhotographClimate change, the cost of health care and gun control are just a few of the issues on which Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. have had significant differences.

| Jump to first hitUnless a moderate favorite soon emerges, party leaders may increasingly look to Michael R. Bloomberg as a potential savior.
MANCHESTER, N.H. — The Democratic presidential primary is entering an intensely tumultuous phase, after two early contests that have left former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. reeling and elevated Senator Bernie Sanders but failed to make any candidate a dominant force in the battle for the party’s nomination.
Within the Democratic establishment, the results have deepened a mood of anxiety and frustration: The collapse of Mr. Biden’s support in the first two states, and the fragmentation of moderate voters among several other candidates, allowed Mr. Sanders, a Vermont progressive, to claim a victory in New Hampshire and a split decision in Iowa with former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.
In both states, a majority of voters supported candidates closer to the political center and named defeating President Trump as their top priority, but there was no overwhelming favorite among those voters as to which moderate was the best alternative to Mr. Sanders. Unless such a favorite soon emerges, party leaders may increasingly look to Michael R. Bloomberg as a potential savior.
In an unmistakable sign of Mr. Bloomberg’s growing strength and Mr. Biden’s decline, three black members of Congress endorsed the former mayor of New York City on Wednesday, including Representative Lucy McBath of Georgia, a high-profile lawmaker and gun-control champion in her first term — and a senior adviser to Mr. Bloomberg told campaign staff that internal polling showed the former mayor now tied with Mr. Biden among African-Americans in March primary states.
The turmoil in the party has the potential to extend the primary season, exacerbating internal divisions and putting off the headache of uniting for the general election for months.
The Democrats’ proportional system of allocating delegates could make it all but impossible to avert such an outcome. With no winner-take-all contests, and no indication yet that Mr. Sanders can broaden his appeal or that a moderate can coalesce support, the candidates are poised to keep splitting delegates three or four ways, as they did in Iowa and New Hampshire.
“We are obviously going to have a longer battle here,” said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who directed an anti-Sanders ad campaign in Iowa.
The leading candidates are plainly worried about the party’s divisions, and signaled as much in their speeches in New Hampshire on primary night: Mr. Sanders, blamed by much of the party for his slashing approach to the 2016 primaries, stressed in his victory speech that the most important task was defeating Mr. Trump, while Mr. Buttigieg urged his supporters to “vote blue, no matter who” in November.
In a particularly urgent plea, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who slumped to a fourth-place finish on Tuesday, warned that no candidate should be “willing to burn down the rest of the party in order to be the last man standing.”
At the moment, no one is close to being the last candidate standing. But unless another Democrat rapidly consolidates support, Mr. Sanders could continue to win primaries and caucuses without broadening his political appeal, purely on the strength of his rock-solid base on the left — a prospect that alarms Democratic Party leaders who view Mr. Sanders and his slogan of democratic socialism as wildly risky bets in a general election.
The Biden team stoked that sense of alarm on Wednesday: Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a co-chairman of Mr. Biden’s national campaign and a former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, warned on a conference call with reporters that Democrats would risk “down-ballot carnage” if they selected Mr. Sanders.
“If Bernie Sanders was at the top of the ticket, we would be in jeopardy of losing the House,” Mr. Richmond said. “We would not get the Senate back.”
Yet in a reflection of the multidimensional melee that allowed Mr. Sanders to claim victory in New Hampshire with the smallest plurality of any winner in decades, Mr. Richmond also criticized two other candidates, Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Buttigieg, lumping them into the same risky group and arguing that Democrats should not “take a chance with a self-defined socialist, a mayor of a very small city, a billionaire who all of a sudden is a Democrat.”
Mr. Mellman said Mr. Sanders would continue to benefit as long as there was a relative abundance of moderate candidates in the race. “The longer more of those people stay in,” he said, “the easier it is for Sanders to skate through.”
There is no sign that any of the half-dozen major candidates left in the race are headed for the exits: Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Biden will have to contend in the Nevada caucuses against Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who finished a strong third in New Hampshire, while on the left Mr. Sanders still faces a dogged competitor in Ms. Warren. Unless one candidate comes out of Nevada and South Carolina with a powerful upper hand, it is quite likely that the same atomized delegate count could continue into Super Tuesday, when 15 states and territories, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all delegates in the Democratic race, cast ballots on March 3.
Indeed, with early voting already taking place in California and other Super Tuesday states, and no dominant front-runner, the fragmentation may already be well underway.
In Arkansas, a Super Tuesday state where early voting starts next week, a poll taken after Iowa illustrated the Democrats’ dilemma: Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg were each winning 16 to 20 percent of the vote.
All of those candidates are increasingly confronting Mr. Bloomberg’s presence as a rival in the March primaries. Mr. Bloomberg skipped all four February contests but has climbed into double digits in national polls on the strength of an enormous and sustained advertising campaign, funded from his personal fortune.
On a conference call with campaign staff members on Wednesday afternoon, Howard Wolfson, Mr. Bloomberg’s senior adviser, said that internal tracking data showed that the former mayor had pulled “very narrowly” into first place across the March primary states, inching ahead of Mr. Sanders over all and tying Mr. Biden among African-American voters.
Though Mr. Wolfson did not provide specific numbers, he said Mr. Biden had “rather precipitously fallen” in the larger array of states voting next month, according to Bloomberg polling.
But Mr. Bloomberg is facing new tests as a candidate: For the first time, he may qualify for a televised debate, next week in Las Vegas, and he has come under newly direct criticism from other Democrats for his record on policing and much else.
Mr. Wolfson acknowledged as much on the conference call, telling staff members that Mr. Bloomberg would have a “bigger target on his back” as his numbers rose. He said Mr. Bloomberg would address scrutiny of his support for stop-and-frisk policing by calling it “the biggest regret of his 12 years as mayor,” and saying that the language he had used in the past to defend it did not “reflect who he is or what is in his heart.”
But the recently circulated audio recording of Mr. Bloomberg in 2015 matter-of-factly stating that “the real crime is” almost always committed by young “male minorities” quickly ricocheted across the tight-knit community of black political leaders.
J. Todd Rutherford, the minority leader of the South Carolina House, said many African-Americans had increasingly recognized that Mr. Biden did not have “what it takes” and had been ready to bolt to the former New York mayor.
“A lot of people would’ve said Bloomberg last week, but now I don’t know,” said Mr. Rutherford, alluding to the recording and declaring that the gnawing uncertainty hanging over the Democratic race was “really scary.”
Mr. Biden and other candidates have indicated that they intend to challenge Mr. Bloomberg on race in the coming days, and his resiliency, or lack thereof, on the subject could shape the primary campaign.
Yet even supporters of Mr. Biden acknowledge that if one of the moderates doesn’t take a clear lead with that faction of the party after Nevada, the eyes of many establishment-aligned Democrats will turn to Manhattan.
“The longer the waters are muddy, the better off Bloomberg is,” said former Gov. Jim Hodges of South Carolina, who recently backed Mr. Biden.
The campaign in Nevada is as disordered as anything else in the Democratic race, according to people closely watching the contest there. But as in New Hampshire, Mr. Biden long held a considerable advantage as the candidate perceived as the safe and electable choice, while Mr. Sanders entered the race with a strong bloc carried over from his last run for the presidency. It remains to be seen whether Mr. Biden will bleed support there as rapidly as he did in New Hampshire, or whether any other candidate will be able to take advantage of his fall.
Tick Segerblom, a prominent Sanders backer in the state who is a member of the Clark County Commission, said Mr. Biden’s national plunge would upend the campaign in Nevada. He said that Mr. Sanders could count his “25 percent,” but that his ability to expand his coalition was an open question.
“Bernie is still alive and Biden is definitely a disaster,” Mr. Segerblom said. “I think Pete is going to do very well — he’ll be able to pick up the Biden people.”
Representative Dina Titus, perhaps the most prominent Biden supporter in the state, said the campaign needed to send in the political cavalry to stave off defeat.
“He could certainly use more hands — and they’re supposedly coming now,” she said.
She added that she would spend her time helping Mr. Biden with senior groups and labor unions. But the former vice president’s hope that the most influential union in the state, the Culinary Workers, would endorse him in an effort to halt Mr. Sanders has been dimmed after his poor performance in the first two states.
In South Carolina, even moderate Democrats who are sympathetic to Mr. Biden believe he’s in grave danger of losing the state.
“He’s wounded,” Tyler Jones, a Charleston-based Democratic strategist, said of the former vice president. Like other political professionals in the state, Mr. Jones is increasingly less concerned about Mr. Biden’s weakness than about the billionaire Tom Steyer’s strength — and what it means for the nominating process.
Mr. Steyer has been pouring money into South Carolina, cutting into Mr. Biden’s lead with black voters and raising the specter of Mr. Sanders’s winning another state with a plurality thanks to a divided electorate.
“A vote for Steyer is a vote for Bernie, which is a vote for Trump,” said Mr. Jones, who believes Mr. Sanders cannot win the general election and wants to stop his campaign “dead in its tracks.” But he acknowledged that urging voters to act strategically and reject Mr. Steyer was easier in theory than in execution.
Other Democrats are turning to what they believe is a more simple solution.
In early January, Representative Gregory Meeks of New York offered an off-the-cuff assessment of the Democratic race: Should Mr. Biden wheeze in the early states, many in the party would turn to Mr. Bloomberg as a Plan B.
“If Mr. Biden can’t get out of New Hampshire and Iowa, then Bloomberg has Super Tuesday,” Mr. Meeks said at the time.
On Wednesday, he was one of the three black lawmakers who endorsed Mr. Bloomberg.
Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.

| Jump to first hitJoe Biden swept Arizona, Florida and Illinois and Bernie Sanders continued to lose ground in the Democratic primary's delegate count.Joseph R. Biden Jr. swept the three states that voted Tuesday: Florida, Illinois and Arizona. Bernie Sanders lost ground badly in the delegate count. And the coronavirus pandemic continued to wreak havoc on the most basic facets of American life, threatening to disrupt if not derail the remaining primary calendar.With nearly 60 percent of the delegates allocated in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, Mr. Biden holds a commanding lead of nearly 300 delegates over Mr. Sanders -- a sum that makes it statistically improbable that Mr. Sanders could ever catch up.""Is this race over?"" Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, the House Democratic caucus chairman, asked on Twitter Tuesday night.In a sign of his diminished standing, Mr. Sanders did not even try to spin the results for the second straight week, choosing to make no public remarks after the states were called.Yet it's not clear what comes next -- for Mr. Sanders or the primary itself.Georgia was supposed to vote next week, but that primary has been delayed. And given his string of poor performances, the pressure on Mr. Sanders to exit the race is likely only to grow, even as the pandemic has frozen traditional campaigning and pushed multiple states to delay their planned elections.Here are four takeaways from a primary night in three key states for both parties:Biden is winning almost everywhere -- by a lotIt has been only 35 days since Mr. Biden's low point in the 2020 primaries: a fifth-place finish in New Hampshire so embarrassing that he bolted the state before the polls closed and decamped to South Carolina for what looked like a potential last stand.Now Mr. Biden is routing Mr. Sanders in every region of the country. In Florida, a voter survey showed Mr. Biden winning men and women, white voters and nonwhite voters, those with college degrees and those without -- all with more than 60 percent of the vote. The victory was so thorough that Mr. Biden was even leading in Florida among ""very liberal"" Democrats, a typical Sanders base. He was similarly dominant in Illinois.In fact, Mr. Biden was leading in every county in Florida -- sometimes tripling and quadrupling the vote total of Mr. Sanders, just as the former vice president had swept every county in Michigan, Mississippi and Missouri a week ago.On Mr. Sanders's website, just below where he asks visitors to enter their email address, there is a giant banner that reads, ""Bernie beats Trump."" But his lopsided losses in Florida and Arizona, a week after Mr. Biden crushed him in the key Midwestern swing state of Michigan, has severely undercut any electability case that Mr. Sanders hoped to make.The lone remaining source of electoral strength for Mr. Sanders has proved to be younger voters, whom he continued to win over but who comprise only a small share of the electorate.""The results tonight only confirmed what we knew a week ago -- that Joe Biden is the prohibitive favorite to be the nominee of the Democratic Party,"" said Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, a leading Democratic super PAC devoted to the 2020 race. ""It's critical that Democratic organizations and allies need to be focused on taking on Donald Trump and on not allowing any of the lies he is telling about the likely nominee to take hold.""Sanders still relishes his megaphoneMr. Sanders may have skipped the traditional election night speech, but he did hold a live-streamed event on Tuesday evening and rolled out a proposal for counteracting the potential looming recession from the coronavirus: $2,000 monthly cash payments to Americans for the duration of the crisis.The live-stream was, almost unintentionally, an encapsulation of where Mr. Sanders is in the race: a candidate pressing more for his ideas than himself -- and wedded deeply to the platform that running for president provides his agenda. Mr. Sanders urged that any fiscal countermeasures from Washington to the pandemic would not amount to ""another money making opportunity for corporate America and for Wall Street.""Still, some members of the Sanders team seem to be itching for a prolonged primary fight, even as few know what exactly Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane, plan to do next.Mr. Sanders made one other announcement on Tuesday: that he had processed more than 10 million contributions in his 2020 campaign, adding up to more than $191 million.That includes $2 million on Sunday, even as the nation was facing a financial standstill from the mass closures of businesses and ""stay home"" edicts from health officials.In other words, Mr. Sanders is likely to have the money to keep running if he wants to.But as traditional organizing and campaigning come to a halt -- and with the media glare almost entirely on the virus -- the path forward now seems narrower than ever.Biden is pivoting to the general (while trying to bring in Sanders fans)Addressing the country on Tuesday night from his home in Wilmington, Del., Mr. Biden spoke first and foremost about the virus upending people's lives, looking far more toward the general election in the fall than the evening's primary election results.""This is a moment where we need our leaders to lead,"" Mr. Biden said.He invoked empathy for the suffering, offered prayers for the sick, expressed concerns over hospitals being overloaded and cited the hardships being endured by average Americans.Mr. Biden also explicitly, again, tried to reach out to supporters of Mr. Sanders, citing the ""remarkable passion and tenacity"" of his rival and those supporters. ""We share a common vision,"" he said, referring specifically to providing ""affordable health care to all Americans"" and tackling climate change.He addressed young voters directly.""I hear you. I know what's at stake,"" Mr. Biden said, ""I know what we have to do. Our goal as a campaign, and my goal as a candidate, is to unify this party and unify this nation.""Coronavirus clouds the future of the primaryWhat comes next is one giant question mark.Georgia postponed its primary, originally scheduled for next week. Ohio was supposed to have voted on Tuesday but the governor pushed back its primary. Kentucky, Maryland and Louisiana have delayed theirs as well. And most future contests are in limbo given the restrictions on group gatherings being pressed by state and federal officials.""As our country deals with the uncertainty of Covid-19, it is critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters,"" Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said on Tuesday, as he urged the remaining states to allow vote-by-mail balloting.Mr. Perez worried about ""moving primaries to later in the cycle when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.""In New York, for instance, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said Tuesday the peak of the virus could come in 45 days -- right around the current April 28 primary date.Overall, turnout on Tuesday represented a mixed bag.In Arizona, the mayor of Phoenix, the largest city in the state, ordered the shut down of bars and restaurants as of 8 p.m. local time on Tuesday -- not long after the polls closed. Yet turnout among voters who physically went to the polls in Maricopa County (home to Phoenix) was actually higher in the 2020 primary than in 2016.In Florida, total turnout ended up topping the 2016 Democratic primary but that appeared largely because of heavy early voting. In Illinois, the total vote was far below the 2 million who turned out for the 2016 primary.For now, Mr. Biden can hope that the next time voters go to the polls, he will be the only candidate still running.PhotographAfter a three-state sweep, Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitWith the odds of winning long, some Democrats wonder why Bernie Sanders is still in the presidential race. He's still pushing his agenda, though it's not clear who's listening.Both hands were waving -- over here, over there, a full wingspan on display -- as Bernie Sanders directed his most biting sarcasm at his ""Republican friends.""Excuse him, forgive him, for wanting working people to get a few more bucks for a few more months as part of the sweeping stimulus bill that was being debated on the Senate floor. Excuse him, forgive him, for not wanting ""to punish the poor and working people"" struggling to weather the economic meltdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic.""My Republican colleagues are very distressed,"" he said late Wednesday.""Oh my God, the universe is collapsing!"" he said so passionately that he nearly spat. ""Oh my word, will the universe survive?!""With the virus bringing the nation to a virtual stop, there is no real presidential campaign for Mr. Sanders to engage in, and even if there were, he is almost hopelessly behind Joseph R. Biden Jr. in the delegate count. Many Democrats and even some allies have said it is time for him to bow out -- or at minimum articulate publicly why he wants to remain in the race.But Mr. Sanders is still running, in large part, allies and aides say, because he believes he can meld this moment of national crisis with the progressive policy agenda that has been his life's work.""For someone who has built a career out of campaigning against the inequality of our health care system, this is prime time,"" said Nick Carter, who served as political outreach director for the 2016 Sanders campaign.So Mr. Sanders will take the stage when he can get it -- including on the Senate floor Wednesday night, but also in news releases, radio and television interviews and live streams where he studiously repeats his mantra to loyalists who once crowded Iowa auditoriums to cheer him but now must settle for sometimes technologically challenged digital presentations.It is unclear who exactly is listening or whether he can make a difference. Even Mr. Biden, as the likely Democratic nominee to face President Trump, has struggled to get visibility. Both candidates are being overshadowed by daily briefings from Mr. Trump and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York.In an interview on Thursday with the radio program ""1A,"" Mr. Sanders did not say how long he intended to stay in the race but suggested he was not going anywhere soon. And he rebuffed a comparison to his 2016 campaign, when he fought Hillary Clinton to the bitter end, arguing that the coronavirus made the two situations different because many states this year had postponed their primaries.""You're talking about an election without elections,"" he said. ""What does that mean? It's kind of unprecedented.""His campaign says he is still actively running for president, and there is other concrete evidence he is. On Tuesday, his team confirmed that he planned to participate in an April debate with Mr. Biden if there is one. The Bern app, a proprietary smartphone app that the campaign uses to organize volunteers, still includes an option for supporters to send their networks a text message encouraging them to mail in ballots, according to an aide. Under phone bank event listings on his campaign website, volunteers are urged to ""join campaign staff as we outreach our communities.""But his campaign is not actively advertising on Facebook and has not made any significant television ad buys since March 12. He has not actively fund-raised for his campaign in over a week, though his campaign has used its extensive email list to raise money for charities to help people during the virus crisis. On Wednesday, his campaign sent an email to supporters asking them to sign a petition to help Amazon workers.Some Democratic supporters of his have said it's time to end his campaign, including Robert Reich, the former labor secretary. Other Democrats say that if he stays in, he should make clear his motivation and his goal.""I've never seen Bernie as someone who is selfish, I've always thought of him as being an advocate for his cause,"" Jay Jacobs, the chairman of the New York State Democratic Party, said in an interview. ""If he stays in the race for no reason, that would be selfish.""In conversations with aides and allies since March 17 -- when stinging losses in three states left him with no realistic chance at winning the Democratic nomination -- many said he viewed this as an extraordinary moment that not only demands the kind of political revolution he has championed since he was the mayor of Burlington, Vt., but also underscores why the country would have been better off if his liberal policy agenda was already in place.Mr. Sanders has appeared eager to put himself front and center for his supporters, holding live stream events on the virus nearly every night and pushing out a long list of policy proposals to handle the outbreak that included providing every American with a check for $2,000 a month.In a sign of his political influence, he threatened on Wednesday afternoon to hold up the economic stimulus bill if Republicans continued to fight unemployment benefits that they feared would be larger than some people's wages -- the reason for his sarcastic denunciations in the Senate chamber.""While we do our best to address these crises, it is extremely important that we try to understand how we got to where we are today, and the need to bring about fundamental reform of American society,"" Mr. Sanders said during a live stream event on Wednesday night, after running viewers through major elements of the stimulus bill.Many of his supporters are still holding out faint hope that he can win the nomination, arguing that the coronavirus outbreak has made even unlikely scenarios possible. Already, many states have pushed their primaries back to June 2, making it impossible for Mr. Biden to clinch the nomination before then. There are murmurs among some allies that Mr. Sanders intends to stay in at least until the primary in New York, which is scheduled for April 28 but could be pushed back to June 23.Some want him to stay in the race indefinitely because his candidacy provides him the megaphone to shape the narrative of the progressive agenda, and will give him leverage as he seeks policy concessions from Mr. Biden and influence over the party's platform.Some close to him suggested that his coronavirus outreach was a way to keep his supporters motivated and engaged during this strange time of suspended animation, so that the campaign can jump-start them into action if he decides to rev his candidacy back up.His detractors, however, point out that he has chosen to hold his own events and speak to his own supporters but until Wednesday had largely left the congressional proceedings to others -- including his former rival Senator Elizabeth Warren, who was active in helping to shape the rescue bill. On Sunday, when fellow Senate Democrats blocked an action on the bill that delayed progress, he skipped the vote, instead remaining in Burlington to air a live stream with Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib.Some aides said he chose not to fly to Washington for the vote because its outcome was never in doubt. But others close to him professed confusion that he had passed up even a symbolic opportunity to offer his voice in the midst of a national emergency.As Mr. Sanders continues to mull his campaign's future, few aides are willing to so much as speculate what he will decide to do. When he returned to Burlington last week, none of his closest advisers went with him. Neither Jeff Weaver, a top adviser, nor his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, has responded to interview requests for days.""I'm officially declining to comment,"" Mr. Shakir said in a text message on Thursday. ""Feel free to use that if you'd like.""Mr. Sanders, in the meantime, has said more than once -- including during Thursday's radio interview -- that he is winning the generational and ideological debate. And he seems ready to carry the debate forward. Only he knows for how long.Stephanie Saul and Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders is staying in the race despite a nearly insurmountable delegate gap partly because, allies say, he senses a chance to further his progressive policies at a critical moment.

| Jump to first hitFour Democratic presidential candidates hoping for success in the state remained in Washington for President Trump's Senate trial.DES MOINES -- Four Democratic presidential candidates hoping for breakout performances in the Iowa caucuses next week spent Thursday in Washington listening to questioning in the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump.But the man on trial appeared in Des Moines for a rally to fire up his supporters before the caucuses on Monday. It was his second rally in three nights.In a state where the Democratic field faces a competitive and critical contest on Monday night, the president told his supporters that they had a ""front-row seat to the lunacy and the madness of a totally sick left."" He called the Democrats the party of ""socialism and blatant corruption,"" even as he sits accused of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.Unlike the Democrats, Mr. Trump does not face a competitive contest in Iowa, where his two Republican challengers -- Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman, and Bill Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts -- have failed to make any dent in Mr. Trump's support.But the Trump campaign views a show of force before the caucuses as an opportunity to try to slow any momentum the winning Democrat hopes to gain from the close race. And Mr. Trump's team is seeking to build excitement ahead of the first chance voters have had to show their support for the president since the 2016 election.Mr. Trump tried to belittle his Democratic opponents on Thursday with his signature nicknames, referring to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as ""Sleepy Joe,"" Senator Bernie Sanders as ""Crazy Bernie"" and Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, as ""Mini Mike."" He poked fun multiple times at the pronunciation of the name of Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and accused the field at large of ""glorifying illegal immigration.""Four years after voters first saw Mr. Trump's name on a ballot, he leaned into some of the original, fear-mongering themes that defined his entry into politics, calling undocumented immigrants ""stone cold rapists."" The line was a callback to his kickoff speech in 2015, when he said of undocumented immigrants: ""They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.""Mr. Trump seemed aware that he was rocketing into a state where Democrats have been camped out for months, noting that ""we're going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats that are right down the street.""But his focus on the Democratic field in front of him appeared to be divided by his political enemies of the past and his foils in Congress.The president reminisced about the 2016 election, expressing a longing for the former Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, and rehashing a four-year-old campaign gaffe where she described some of his supporters as ""deplorables.""""Maybe we take another crack at Crazy Hillary,"" Mr. Trump said. ""She was so easy.""And he broke up his re-election pitch with invective aimed at Representative Adam B. Schiff, the lead House impeachment manager, whom the president referred to as a ""sick puppy,"" and a diatribe against Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whom he accused of letting her district in San Francisco fall into decay.""We're having probably the best years we've ever had, and I just got impeached. Can you believe these people?"" Mr. Trump said. But he claimed it was still a ""happy period because we call it 'impeachment light.""'""This is not easy,"" he said, ""you got maniacs doing a number on you for three years.""Mr. Trump spoke as the Senate waited on Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and a close friend of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to announce his decision on whether to support hearing from witnesses during the impeachment trial. A couple of hours after Mr. Trump left the stage, Mr. Alexander said he was a ""no"" on hearing from more witnesses. His is a critical vote, and his decision will help determine whether Mr. Trump receives a swift acquittal as soon as Friday.Trump officials said the caucus on Monday, even if it was not competitive, would be an important milestone for a campaign that has essentially been going on since Mr. Trump's famous escalator ride in Trump Tower in 2015. ""This will be the first time his supporters are able to take part in the process that begins his re-election,"" said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman.Before the rally on Thursday night at Drake University, Mr. Trump made a brief stop in Warren, Mich., where he spoke to manufacturing workers the day after he signed the revised North American Free Trade Agreement into law.Mr. Trump's trade deals are a key part of his re-election message. But it was clear that the impeachment trial -- which Republican senators are hoping to wrap up quickly without hearing from additional witnesses like John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser -- was on his mind.""I've kept my promise, not only my promise of loving the people of Michigan, but my promise of taking care of it so other countries aren't ripping us off,"" Mr. Trump told the crowd gathered at Dana Inc., a major auto parts manufacturer of axles, transmissions and other key components in Warren, an industrial city north of Detroit. ""You remember the tax cut? It was the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, and what do they do? They impeach you. It's frankly a disgrace to our country.""The Trump campaign plans to follow up on the Des Moines rally with a blitz of appearances at caucus sites on Monday by roughly 80 cabinet secretaries, administration officials and members of Congress to generate enthusiasm among Iowa Republicans.Mr. Biden on Thursday spent significant time during campaign stops in Iowa marveling at the band of Trump surrogates and supporters planning to flood the state, suggesting it was proof Mr. Trump's campaign was running scared. ""I never saw another party have so much interest in, in a Democratic caucus,"" he said. ""I wonder why they're all coming. I wonder why they're here.""Mr. Trump already has deep support in Iowa, a state he won in 2016 by more than nine points. Jeff Kaufmann, the chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, has been a strong Trump supporter who has echoed the president's description of a Democratic Party defined by ""left-wing nuts."" Campaign officials have tried to reward Mr. Kaufmann's loyalty with presidential visits intended to motivate other state chairmen to follow suit.The president last held a campaign rally in Iowa in Council Bluffs in October 2018 as part of his push before the midterm elections. In June, he traveled to the state to speak at the Iowa Republican dinner on the same day that Mr. Biden was crisscrossing the state, giving voters a preview of what a general election matchup between the two would look like.Since then, however, Mr. Biden has slipped from his front-runner status in the state, where Mr. Sanders has emerged on top in a handful of polls. But Mr. Sanders as well Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Michael Bennet of Colorado spent the day in the Senate chamber.Steve Friess contributed reporting from Warren, Mich., and Katie Glueck from Des Moines.PhotographPresident Trump on Thursday at a rally in Des Moines.

| Jump to first hitThe Vermont senator has long brushed off political vulnerabilities and evaded attacks from rivals. But the spotlight on his front-runner status and possible Russian interference could pose challenges.In the early years, there was his commentary on gender relations featuring a rape fantasy, his support for the Sandinistas and his honeymoon in the Soviet Union.Once he entered Congress, there were votes to shield gun manufacturers, a commitment to remaining uncommitted to the Democratic Party, and secret plans to mount a 2012 primary challenge against President Obama.And more recently: the F.B.I. investigation into his family, the heart attack, the resistance to detailing the costs of his signature policy proposal, ""Medicare for all.""Senator Bernie Sanders has the kind of vulnerabilities that make political opponents salivate. Yet throughout his congressional campaigns, the 2016 primaries, and now his second White House bid, one rule has defined the senator's political rise: Nothing sticks.Now that durability is about to be tested in ways that Mr. Sanders has never experienced in his 50-year electoral career. The disclosure on Friday that intelligence officials believe Russia has been interfering in the 2020 race to help his candidacy may distract from his campaign message and force him to contend with questions, worries and disinformation about the Russian efforts.He is also no longer a quixotic junior senator from the idiosyncratic state of Vermont. He is now the Democratic presidential front-runner, and if he captures the nomination, can expect to face a tidal wave of negative advertising. President Trump and the Republican Party would likely spend millions branding him as a socialist.Mr. Sanders has long seen himself as an underestimated figure and a political revolutionary, allies say, and he has confidence in his extraordinary ability to shrug off attacks. His 2020 rivals -- a former vice president, multiple fellow senators, two brainy former mayors, and billionaire businessmen -- have failed to halt his momentum, or never fully tried in the first place, after concluding that attacks only fan the passions of his liberal base.If Mr. Sanders's rivals have been giving him a pass in debates and over policy issues, it is because they see no clear way to dent his Trump-like Teflon image. It is too early to know if the Russia news or any burgeoning anti-Sanders effort among Democrats will change that. And like Mr. Trump, it may soon be too late for opponents to stop Mr. Sanders if he is the big winner in the delegate-rich Super Tuesday primaries on March 3.""Any attempt to derail Bernie that I've ever seen has always blown up in the face of the derailer,"" said Howard Dean, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, who clashed with Mr. Sanders occasionally during Mr. Dean's time as governor of Vermont. ""It's an amazing phenomenon. I do not know what the magic is, but there is some.""With Mr. Sanders favored to claim another victory in the Nevada caucuses on Saturday, some Democrats are frantically searching for a piece of kryptonite.A Democratic group aimed at promoting moderates began airing digital ads this week that attack the costs of Mr. Sanders's proposals. The group's efforts follow a similar advertising campaign, bankrolled by a different Democratic organization, that questions whether Mr. Sanders can beat Mr. Trump in November.In recent days, Michael R. Bloomberg's team has shifted its strategy from largely ignoring Mr. Sanders in favor of focusing on Mr. Trump to targeting their primary rival more aggressively than anyone else in the field. At Wednesday night's debate in Las Vegas, rivals hit him harder than ever before on his policies, the vitriolic tone of some of his supporters, his defense of socialism, and his health. There's also some speculation among Democratic officials about stopping Mr. Sanders at the party convention in July.For a party obsessed with learning from the mistakes of 2016, when the sheer improbability of Mr. Trump's winning the White House dominated the discourse, the disbelief in the potential of Mr. Sanders to win the nomination and the reluctance of candidates to challenge him mystifies some Democrats -- even those working for him. And the revelation that Russia may be trying to help him, four years after it helped Mr. Trump, only confuses matters more, because it is far from clear how that foreign interference will affect the race.For months, top Sanders aides feared that a rival, perhaps Mr. Bloomberg, would start an anti-Sanders super PAC. That kind of broad, well-funded effort has not materialized. And of all the candidates, only Tom Steyer has released an ad attacking Mr. Sanders, targeting his failure to put a price tag on his Medicare for All Plan.""A lot of it is the same thing you saw happening in the Republican establishment four years ago,"" said Matt Bennett, a founder of the moderate think tank Third Way and a vocal critic of Mr. Sanders. ""Suddenly in April they woke up and realized that Donald Trump could actually win.""Throughout the primary race, as soon as someone has risen to the top of the pack, attacks have piled on. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts faced a barrage of questions about her ""Medicare for all"" plan after a summer surge in the polls. Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., was the subject of attacks after his poll numbers rose in Iowa.The same has not happened for Mr. Sanders.It's not as if he has neutralized his vulnerabilities. He has recanted his 1972 article about male and female sexual fantasies, which briefly imagined women fantasizing about rape, but such a piece of writing would still usually damage a candidate. His history of making supportive comments about Communist regimes, and visiting Nicaragua and the Soviet Union in 1980s, could reinforce the socialist labeling. And federal investigators examined a college real estate deal that involved Mr. Sanders's wife, Jane; the couple was not interviewed, indicating a lack of significant evidence of a crime, but some opponents talk it up privately as a possible issue.Yet other candidates have been more likely to face attacks. At Wednesday's debate, Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, faced a tough assault, with the pile-on serving to keep the focus away from the higher-polling Mr. Sanders.Jonathan Kott, head of the Big Tent Project, which began airing the digital ads on Tuesday, said that part of the reason Mr. Sanders had escaped serious attacks from his rivals until the most recent debate was disbelief that Democratic voters would support him. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday found that the most unpopular qualities for a candidate were being a socialist, having a heart attack in the last year and being older than 75.The same poll also showed Mr. Sanders opening up a double-digit national lead in the race.""He has not faced the same vetting and scrutiny that other front-runners have faced,"" Mr. Kott said. ""A lot of that may have to do with the fact that nobody thought a socialist with these radical views would be the front-runner.""Aides to Mr. Sanders say he is able to evade attacks because voters trust him, arguing that his proposals for a single-payer health care system, free public college and a Green New Deal are backed by a wide majority of Democratic voters.""We felt strongly from the beginning that the primary would be decided on two questions: who do voters trust to carry out the change they want and who do they believe can beat Donald Trump?"" said Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager. ""Bernie's consistent record of standing with the working class is the strongest answer.""Analysis of Mr. Sanders's turnout in Iowa and New Hampshire gives scant indication that he has expanded his base, despite his argument that he is building a movement that will motivate working-class voters and young people -- both groups that typically do not vote in large numbers.Yet with the moderate wing of the party unable to coalesce around a single candidate, Mr. Sanders could win a near-majority of delegates with less than a third of the vote. That could give him a delegate lead that would be difficult -- if not impossible -- for his rivals to overcome.Yet some Democratic strategists see real risks in going after Mr. Sanders over policy, personal issues or matters beyond his control, like the Russian interference, fearing it could alienate some of his supporters -- largely younger voters and staunch liberals who will be central to any Democratic nominee's ability to win the White House. Others working on rival campaigns argue that such attacks only backfire, and are quickly weaponized into fund-raising appeals that flood the Sanders campaign with donations.Days before the Iowa caucuses, Democratic Majority for Israel released an ad attacking Mr. Sanders, the first time a Democratic group had run a negative campaign spot targeting Mr. Sanders by name in his two primary bids.In about a day, the Sanders campaign raised $1.3 million off the spot.""He's been like the quarterback in the football scrimmage who wears the jersey and no one is allowed to tackle,"" said David Axelrod, a former top strategist for Mr. Obama. ""There was a reluctance to take on Trump because there was a fear of antagonizing his base, and I think Bernie has benefited from that within the Democratic Party.""Some backers of Ms. Warren argue that Mr. Sanders has also benefited from less media scrutiny, despite his campaign's frequent broadsides against the agenda of ""corporate media.""While Ms. Warren has been pushed, repeatedly, to unveil the costs of her Medicare for all plan, Mr. Sanders has brushed off questions about his own similar proposal, saying the costs are ""impossible to predict.""When Ms. Warren accused Mr. Sanders of lying about whether he had told her a woman could not defeat Mr. Trump, perhaps the toughest moment he's faced in the race so far, his supporters attacked her online and referred to her with snake emojis.""It is hard to say why she's been treated much more harshly,"" said Adam Jentleson, a Democratic strategist who is close to the Warren team. ""At a certain point you're only left with gender as an explanation.""Voters say they appreciate Mr. Sanders's consistent message, arguing that they know who he is and what he represents. Many of those who backed Mr. Sanders in 2016 say the past four years have only strengthened their support.""He has the most progressive agenda,"" said Paul Wetzonis, 29, of Nashua, N.H., who voted for Mr. Sanders in both of his primary bids. ""Everybody else is basically a modern corporatist Democrat.""Unlike Mr. Trump, who took over his party by sheer force, Mr. Sanders has spent the past four years working to make his liberal brand more mainstream, both by changing the Democratic Party and by casting himself as a loyal soldier of it.Less than a year after a primary race in which his team accused the Democratic National Committee of ""rigging"" the election, Mr. Sanders flew around the country with the party's chairman, Tom Perez, for an eight-state ""come together, fight back"" tour in 2017. Through the pro-Sanders political nonprofit Our Revolution, supporters of the senator packed the obscure party meetings that select state leaders, putting loyalists into key party posts.And Mr. Sanders promised, again and again, to be a good Democrat, pushing back on a narrative of the 2016 race that he was not a ""true"" member of the party. In March, Mr. Sanders signed the Democratic National Committee's loyalty pledge. In an ad that ran in Iowa, Mr. Sanders placed himself in a line of Democratic icons, splicing his words with images of Franklin D. Roosevelt, Lyndon B. Johnson and John F. Kennedy.Even some Democrats who don't agree with Mr. Sanders say they appreciate his voice in the race.As she waited to hear former Vice President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., address a crowd in Marshalltown, Iowa, Carrie Barr said she wasn't considering supporting Mr. Sanders but appreciated his policies.""He's too extreme. He's a socialist and he's not been a supporter of Democratic politics,"" said Ms. Barr, 64, a retired teacher. ""But everyone loves his ideas. I love his ideas.""PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders attended a rally at the Cowboys Dancehall in San Antonio after he won the Nevada caucuses on Saturday. His 2020 rivals have failed to halt his momentum.

| Jump to first hitVirginia's shift to the Democrats has been led by suburban moderates, especially college-educated women. Some wonder whether Mr. Sanders is what they signed up for.VIRGINIA BEACH -- In the Trump era, the suburbs have been Democrats' surprising superpower.A revolt by college-educated voters, largely women, in suburbs from Virginia Beach to Oklahoma City, from Houston to Southern California, delivered the House majority to Democrats in 2018. Driven by anxiety over guns, health care and the environment, and recoiling from President Trump's caustic leadership, suburban voters are widely seen as a critical bloc for any Democratic victory in 2020.But there are some early signs that the rise of Senator Bernie Sanders, by far the most liberal Democratic front-runner since George McGovern in 1972, is causing stress with the party's suburban coalition and especially its core of college-educated white women and older voters, many of whom are politically moderate.And after Saturday night's big win by Joseph R. Biden Jr. in South Carolina, Mr. Sanders will face an invigorated former vice president as well as other moderates, like former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, in Tuesday's primaries in Virginia, Texas, and additional states with swaths of suburban voters.Anne Poague, a retired nurse who lives in Virginia Beach, in a House district that a Democrat wrestled from a Republican incumbent in 2018, noted that Mr. Trump's top argument for re-election would be the economy -- with Mr. Sanders as a perfect foil.""People are going to say, do you want him or do you want a socialist?"" she said of the prospect of Mr. Sanders as the nominee. It was ""kind of scary"" to see Mr. Trump congratulating Mr. Sanders on his primary wins, she said. ""What does that tell you?""In Hampton Roads -- which includes Virginia Beach, Norfolk and Newport News -- Democrats also picked up four Statehouse seats in November. One of those 2019 victors, Shelly Simonds, said suburban women ""really generated the enthusiasm that created the blue wave.""While some women, including many teachers, ""are all about Sanders,"" Ms. Simonds said, others recoil from his sweeping proposals such as a government takeover of health care. ""There are a lot of women who are very protective over health care and the current status quo,"" she said.Suburban women are especially important in battleground states like Virginia, which is seen as essential to any Electoral College majority for the party in 2020. Virginia has turned sharply toward moderate Democratic candidates in recent years; the losses of Republican candidates up and down the ballot in suburbia have produced more political change than arguably in any other state.Mr. Biden's victory in South Carolina, and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg's decision to quit the race on Sunday night, may reset the field going into Super Tuesday on March 3, when 16 states and territories vote. Until recently, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have jostled for the polling lead in Virginia, with Mr. Bloomberg also contending. In his victory speech on Saturday night, Mr. Biden took aim at Mr. Sanders as a divisive figure.""If Democrats want a nominee who's a Democrat, a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat, join us,"" Mr. Biden said.No matter who the party's presidential nominee is, Democrats feel confident at this point about winning Virginia in November. Mr. Sanders had a nine-point lead over Mr. Trump in the state in a recent poll by Roanoke College.But in a sign of Mr. Sanders's vulnerability, a plurality of Democrats disagreed with some of his key positions in a Christopher Newport University poll released on Friday. Forty-four percent said the private insurance system should be kept as it is, and only one in five supported canceling all student debt.""It's clear that the path to the majority for us in Virginia in 2017, 2018 and 2019 was Democrats picking candidates in the primary who could talk to independents and bring them to our side in the general election,"" said former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who on Saturday endorsed Mr. Biden after his commanding South Carolina win. ""In order to beat Trump, we need a nominee who is inclusive and can build a broad coalition.""In this month's Nevada caucuses, which Mr. Sanders won easily, white women who were college graduates were his weakest supporters (though he won them narrowly), according to entrance polls.In a head-to-head matchup between Mr. Trump and the top Democrats in a recent Washington Post/ABC News Poll, Mr. Sanders performed the worst with college-educated white women. The Vermont senator, who calls himself a democratic socialist, edged Mr. Trump by just two points, a statistical tie, among white women with a college degree. The more moderate candidates, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bloomberg and Amy Klobuchar, all outstripped Mr. Trump by 10 points or more with the same group of voters.However, a Fox News Poll released on Thursday showed Mr. Sanders leading among suburban Democratic voters nationally, as he was with all Democrats. He was the top choice of 28 percent of Democrats in the suburbs, ahead of Mr. Biden with 20 percent and Mr. Bloomberg at 19 percent.There were potential warning signs for Democrats in the poll should Mr. Sanders become the nominee: Nearly one in five suburban Democrats said they would not support him against Mr. Trump in November.""I don't think Bernie can win,"" said Pat Barner, a retiree here in Virginia Beach, the southern point in a crescent of suburbs running through Richmond to Northern Virginia, which have politically transformed the state. The State Legislature, where Democrats won control in November for the first time in a generation, is swiftly moving to enact Democratic priorities on guns, abortion, minimum wage and L.G.B.T.Q. rights.Ms. Barner was weighing Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg. Though she would vote for Mr. Sanders if he were the nominee, she feared he could not carry the state. ""We're not that liberal in Virginia,"" she said.Mr. Sanders campaigned aggressively in the state on Saturday and earlier on Thursday, when a rally in Richmond drew a large throng of passionate supporters, mainly young people who exemplified the intensity of his support, but also its potentially limited breadth.Glen Besa, a suburbanite from Chesterfield County, who stood out from the many college students because of his age, said his first vote was for George McGovern, the Democratic nominee who lost in a landslide in 1972 -- but he rejected any analogy to Mr. Sanders. ""Times have changed and we have fundamental issues that haven't been addressed since '72,"" he said.A state delegate from the Northern Virginia suburbs who introduced Mr. Sanders, Elizabeth Guzman, hammered an electability argument. ""I was inspired by the senator and his message to run for office,"" said Ms. Guzman, who was born in Peru and flipped a Republican-held seat in Prince William County in 2017. ""When they told me Virginia wasn't ready for a brown person, or an immigrant woman, you came out and proved them wrong,"" she told the crowd of several thousand.But Mark Keam, a Korean-American Democrat in the House of Delegates from Northern Virginia, offered a different perspective of immigrant voters, who have played as crucial a role in Virginia's tilt to Democrats as have white college-educated women. Mr. Keam, who was a supporter of Mr. Buttigieg, said many immigrants recoil from Mr. Sanders's embrace of big-government socialism because it reminds them of homelands they fled.""If you're an immigrant from Asia and you came to this country from a country that was socialist, or you're from Africa that has dictators or South America where you got your arm chopped off if you said anything wrong about the government -- you're thinking, I thought America is not this way,"" Mr. Keam said.A Sanders candidacy might threaten the 2020 prospects of two vulnerable Democratic congresswomen in Virginia who won Republican-held seats in the 2018 midterms: Representative Abigail Spanberger, a former C.I.A. officer who won a suburban district outside Richmond; and Representative Elaine Luria, a retired Navy commander who won in Virginia Beach.Ms. Luria, who has endorsed Mr. Biden, condemned Mr. Sanders recently for saying he would skip the conference of a pro-Israel group, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.Ms. Spanberger is keeping her head down, not wanting to nationalize her tough re-election race this year in a district Mr. Trump comfortably won.""Both Luria and Spanberger would not be eager to have to be running down-ballot with Bernie,"" said Bob Holsworth, a longtime political analyst in the state. ""They're very concerned about the socialist label.""Democrats' historic wave in Virginia, which has surged in three election years starting in 2017, began with grass-roots suburban groups like the Liberal Women of Chesterfield County, which was once a Republican stronghold.Kim Drew Wright, a founder of the group, said in recent days it has been an effort to keep the peace on the private Facebook page for members, where clashing views of Mr. Sanders have broken out.""There are different various opinions all the way from 'there's no way he could win' to 'he's awesome,""' said Ms. Drew Wright, who favors Senator Elizabeth Warren for the nomination. She said Mr. Sanders triggers fierce opinions. ""He's at the top of the page right now,"" she said.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was popular on Saturday at a rally in Virginia Beach. But moderate suburban voters, particularly women, expressed concern about his avowed socialism.

| Jump to first hitIf Super Tuesday boiled down the primary to a two-man contest, then its smaller sequel a week later made it plain that the race is now Joe Biden's to lose.It was a drubbing.Four years ago, the Missouri Democratic primary was one of the closest in the nation in the grinding and protracted campaign between Senator Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton.On Tuesday, the state was called just moments after the polls had closed in favor of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The early call represented the beginning of the second straight week of Biden victories. This week's were so thorough that Mr. Sanders opted against even delivering a televised address to the nation.""There's no sugarcoating it,"" Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, a top Sanders surrogate, said in a livestream on her Instagram page. ""Tonight's a tough night.""If Super Tuesday boiled down the primary to a two-man contest, then its smaller sequel made it plain that the race is now Mr. Biden's to lose.The results demonstrated the breadth of Mr. Biden's sudden and enviable political coalition of black voters, women, older voters and white voters with college degrees. In Michigan, the biggest prize of the night and a state that Mr. Sanders carried four years ago, Mr. Biden was winning in urban areas, suburban areas and rural areas.Mr. Sanders was on pace to win zero counties in Missouri and Mississippi. He lost Idaho, where he won in 2016. And Washington State, seemingly favorable terrain for Mr. Sanders, was too close to call.Here are five takeaways from the results now that about 46 percent of delegates have been allocated:Joe Biden has taken control of the primary.Only three weeks ago, after a landslide loss in Nevada, Mr. Biden was struggling and Mr. Sanders was ascendant.The race has inverted entirely since then.A string of Biden victories across the Midwest and the South showcased the power of Mr. Biden's political coalition, anchored first by black voters but now also winning over white voters in the suburbs and rural areas that four years ago made the primary between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton so competitive.In Michigan, where Mr. Sanders had focused much of his attention in the last week, he was leading in none of the state's 83 counties as of early Wednesday, and trailing Mr. Biden by double digits statewide. In Missouri, Mr. Sanders was also trailing in every single county in a state where he won dozens of counties in 2016. And in Mississippi, Mr. Sanders was getting thrashed, with Mr. Biden topping 80 percent of the vote.The margin of black support for Mr. Biden over Mr. Sanders in Mississippi was breathtaking: 87 percent to 10 percent, according to the exit poll.The calendar does not get significantly easier for Mr. Sanders in the next two weeks. Three of the four states that vote next week have sizable black voting populations: Illinois (a 28 percent black electorate in the 2016 primary, according to the exit poll), Ohio (20 percent) and Florida (27 percent).Given Mr. Sanders's struggles in Michigan on Tuesday, it is not clear why he would do significantly better in nearby Ohio and Illinois. Then the next week comes Georgia, where black voters made up half of the Democratic electorate four years ago.But it was hardly just black voters lifting Mr. Biden. In Missouri, for instance, the story was about white voters who sided with Mr. Sanders in 2016 but backed Mr. Biden in 2020. Exit polls showed that Mr. Sanders led Mrs. Clinton by nine percentage points among white voters there; Mr. Biden was up by 12 points this year.Bernie Sanders's demographic disadvantages are hardening.The wave of new and younger voters that Mr. Sanders has banked much of his candidacy on simply has not shown up.The results were especially stark in Missouri.There, voters under 45 years old were 41 percent of the electorate in 2016; those same voters accounted for only 32 percent of the electorate in 2020. The biggest jump, in terms of share of the electorate, came among Mr. Biden's strongest group: those 65 or older, who were 31 percent of the electorate, up from only 22 percent four years ago.Mr. Biden carried older voters with a colossal 81 percent support, an even bigger share than Mr. Sanders had among those under 30.What had been Mr. Sanders's early strength in a fractured field -- his quick consolidation of younger voters, very liberal voters and Latinos -- has proved far less formidable in a two-man contest as moderate and ""somewhat liberal"" voters have coalesced behind Mr. Biden.And as Democratic strategists have preached for more than a year, the consolidation of black voters behind a single candidate provides an almost overwhelming advantage when trying to accumulate delegates.Mr. Biden's ability to win states in the South by huge margins -- especially Alabama last week and Mississippi on Tuesday -- has generated a delegate windfall.In Alabama alone, the 36 more delegates that Mr. Biden netted were enough to offset the edge over Mr. Biden that Mr. Sanders had built in the first three states combined: Iowa (6), New Hampshire (9) Nevada (15). In Mississippi, Mr. Sanders was at risk of falling below 15 percent statewide.Bernie 2020 is losing to Bernie 2016.For the second straight week, Mr. Sanders underperformed his own bar from 2016 (a race, it should be noted, he eventually lost).He won Michigan then; he lost it now.He nearly won Missouri then; he lost it decisively now.He won Washington, North Dakota and Idaho in landslides then (all were caucuses four years ago); all were too close to immediately call on Tuesday night.Mr. Sanders doing worse in 2020 than 2016 is not new. As the pro-Biden super PAC Unite the Country wrote in a memo this week, ""on Super Tuesday, in every single state, Bernie Sanders earned a smaller share of the vote than he earned in those same states in 2016.""Mr. Sanders had a legitimate excuse a week ago: The other leading progressive vote-getter, Senator Elizabeth Warren, was still in the race. But that argument melted away this week and his standing still did not improve.The Democratic Party has decided.In his speech to a mostly empty National Constitution Center (relocated to avoid a crowd because of fears surrounding the coronavirus), Mr. Biden not only thanked Mr. Sanders and his supporters but also offered an olive branch, saying, ""There's a place in our campaign for each of you.""As the results rolled in, a growing number of Democratic officials began to both declare the primary over and consider the delicate task of uniting a party with deep ideological and generational divisions.The two leading Democratic super PACs, Priorities USA and American Bridge, echoed each other Tuesday night as they announced in short succession that they believed Mr. Biden was now the de facto nominee.""The math is now clear. Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee,"" said Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities. ""The voices of Democratic voters are loud and clear: they want Joe Biden to be our standard-bearer,"" said Bradley Beychok, president of American Bridge.A top Biden backer, Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, went even further in an interview on NPR, saying the Democratic National Committee should ""shut this primary down"" and ""cancel the rest of these debates.""But some of Mr. Sanders's prominent surrogates and advisers were digging in, even as questions about the future of his campaign intensified as the Vermont senator opted against delivering a speech.Briahna Joy Gray, the national press secretary for Mr. Sanders, wrote that moderates were ""panicking"" about a one-on-one debate and that ""America finally gets to see Biden defend his ideas, or lack there of, on Sunday."" David Sirota, a longtime Sanders adviser, praised the benefits of ""tough primaries"" in molding a stronger nominee. ""Don't let anyone tell you otherwise,"" he wrote on Twitter.Michigan's results hint at the depth of anti-Clinton sentiment in 2016.Michigan has played a special place in the Sanders retelling of 2016: It was the state that, despite the polls, gave him a major victory over Mrs. Clinton and foreshadowed her eventual weakness in the general election in the upper Midwest against Donald J. Trump.The results on Tuesday raised fresh questions about just how much of his 2016 primary victory there was about him -- and how much was simply rejection of Mrs. Clinton.Mr. Sanders appeared to lose every one of Michigan's 83 counties on Tuesday night. Four years ago, he carried 73 counties. While Mrs. Clinton carried black voters then, as Mr. Biden did now, the biggest difference was white voters, who swung wildly from backing Mr. Sanders in 2016 to Mr. Biden in 2020.Mr. Sanders won nearly every county outside the Detroit metropolitan area four years ago -- and lost all of them this week. Some small counties swung from a nearly 25-point Sanders win to a nearly 25-point Sanders loss.The role of gender was almost unavoidable. ""Mansplain me on sexism again, dudes,"" Anne Caprara, a top Democratic strategist and the current chief of staff for the governor of Illinois, J.B. Pritzker, said on Twitter. ""Please.""White men supported Mr. Sanders by a 25-point margin over Mrs. Clinton. Yet they favored Mr. Biden over Mr. Sanders on Tuesday. White women flipped a lot, too, delivering a majority for Mr. Biden after they had gone with Mr. Sanders in 2016.Beyond the delegate math, the loss in Michigan undercut a Sanders 2020 story line: that he is the strongest candidate against Mr. Trump in one of the most critical swing states in the most critical swing region.PhotographWith strong support across multiple demographics, Mr. Biden won every county in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi, and emerged as the party's clear choice.

| Jump to first hitMaking his debut onstage, he was greeted by forceful challenges from Elizabeth Warren and the rest of the Democratic field.Michael R. Bloomberg bobbed behind his lectern, as if the motion might deliver him somewhere more comfortable. He blinked, then blinked some more. He appeared unsteady -- for all the preparation his billions might buy him -- on questions of race and gender that could not have come as a surprise.Pressed about allegations of a hostile workplace at his company, Mr. Bloomberg wandered into a legalistic defense of nondisclosure agreements, adding that perhaps women ""didn't like a joke I told."" Questioned on his longstanding support for stop-and-frisk policing, a signature policy of his mayoralty in New York, he professed himself ""embarrassed"" before suggesting others onstage also had plenty to apologize for.""Remember,"" he said in one exchange, explaining why he had not yet released full tax documents. ""I only entered into this race 10 weeks ago.""That much was clear.Until Wednesday, as Mr. Bloomberg spent heavily and campaigned atypically, bypassing the early-voting states to focus on delegate-rich contests in March and beyond, his candidacy had existed almost in parentheses: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was the early front-runner. (But Mr. Bloomberg wanted his voters.) Senator Bernie Sanders won New Hampshire. (But would Mr. Bloomberg's fortune bury him by the spring?)Onstage at last, beside his competitors for the first time, the partition fell away -- unlocking months of pent-up, fieldwide frustration with how the primary has proceeded. Though Mr. Bloomberg took the earliest and perhaps fiercest fire, his meek rebuttals seemed to inspire a wider reckoning among his peers, who slashed and bickered with an eagerness the race had not seen before. It signaled both the urgent electoral hour and, at times, a genuine and visceral distaste for Mr. Bloomberg's attempt in recent weeks to bend the race to his whims.Often, Mr. Bloomberg seemed resigned to standing with a half-smirk, less poker face than momentary capitulation, listening as one rival after another took a turn.""He didn't get a whole lot done,"" Mr. Biden said of Mr. Bloomberg's time as mayor, a statement the billionaire did not bother jumping in to contest.""I don't think you look at Donald Trump and say, 'We need someone richer in the White House,""' Senator Amy Klobuchar reasoned, an argument Mr. Bloomberg chose not to grapple with much.""I'd like to talk about who we're running against,"" Senator Elizabeth Warren teased, ""a billionaire who calls women 'fat broads' and 'horse-faced lesbians.' And no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump.""At one point, a moderator, Lester Holt, had to beckon Mr. Bloomberg to defend himself, observing that there was ""a lot for you to respond to.""""Um,"" Mr. Bloomberg began. He said he was the best candidate to defeat President Trump and the leader with the experience to succeed if he did.""I'm a mayor,"" he said, ""or was a mayor."" It had been a while.Ms. Warren, seeking to boost her chances after setbacks in the first two states, appeared particularly emboldened, tweaking Ms. Klobuchar on health care policy, Mr. Sanders for the vitriol among some of his supporters and, most gleefully, Mr. Bloomberg.After a halting, if careful, answer from Mr. Bloomberg about the nondisclosure agreements -- during which the former mayor recited various feats of gender parity in his business and government life -- Ms. Warren challenged him to release women from the agreements if they wished to speak publicly about how they were treated in his employ.""I hope you heard what his defense was,"" Ms. Warren said, before paraphrasing liberally. ""'I've been nice to some women.' That just doesn't cut it.""For much of the night, Mr. Bloomberg, who had not debated since his third and final mayoral election in 2009, looked both rusty and familiar. He was every bit the political patrician New Yorkers remember, referring to his fellow hopefuls as ""my associates,"" calling the debate a ""panel"" and joking that TurboTax would not suffice for the ""thousands of pages"" of financial documents he has yet to release.He did appear to grow more confident later in the night, speaking forcefully on environmental issues and landing a well-practiced zinger or two.""What a wonderful country we have,"" he said in one answer, needling Mr. Sanders for his considerable (if much smaller) net worth. ""The best known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses. What did I miss here?""Mr. Bloomberg's very presence onstage was a testament to the unsettled primary that coaxed him into running in the first place -- a heady turn in a race that has been defined, in part, by progressive contempt for the billionaire class.The inability of any candidate to unite the party's disparate factions so far has provided Mr. Bloomberg with an opening, albeit a complicated one, particularly after the disappointing early-state returns for Mr. Biden, whose stumbles on the campaign trail last year helped persuade Mr. Bloomberg to reconsider a decision to stay away.The result, with voting already underway, is a field whose front-runner, Mr. Sanders, and his would-be spoiler, Mr. Bloomberg, have both spent much of their adult lives resisting a full embrace of the party they now hope to lead.""We could wake up two weeks from today, the day after Super Tuesday, and the only candidates left standing will be Bernie Sanders and Mike Bloomberg, the two most polarizing figures on this stage,"" Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., warned, adding, ""Let's put forward somebody who's actually a Democrat.""For Mr. Bloomberg, an uninspiring debate debut risked underwhelming Democrats whose chief exposure to him in recent months has been through an inescapable ad campaign.But it is not clear how, or even if, his performance might affect his prospects. Mr. Bloomberg is offering audiences an unsentimental bargain, in some ways, pitched less at the heart than the gut. These are extraordinary times, the argument goes, requiring extraordinary interventions -- up to and including an ultrarich, party-switching Manhattanite hard-wired to replace another.Voters do not need to fall in love, Mr. Bloomberg's allies say. They need only to fall on the right side of the question underpinning his campaign: Can anyone else really be trusted to take down the president? And if not, then why not default to the man with the biggest budget for political weaponry?""Mike Will Get It Done,"" read the signs at his events. The means are generally left unsaid.On Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg moved to project this brand of let's-get-realism after Mr. Sanders spoke about workers feeling like ""cogs in a machine.""""I can't think of a way that would make it easier for Donald Trump to get re-elected than listening to this conversation,"" Mr. Bloomberg said. ""This is ridiculous. We're not going to throw out capitalism. We tried that, other countries tried that. It was called communism and it just didn't work.""Mr. Bloomberg's instincts, if unchecked, do not lend themselves easily to a live television event. He is an undersize septuagenarian with a New England accent and a New Yorker's impatience. He has been known to sigh audibly or look skyward when annoyed by questions. He can cling to statistics as a kind of rhetorical security blanket, firing off numbers where concision would do. If advisers had urged Mr. Bloomberg to curb these tics, it did not show onstage in Las Vegas.For progressives like Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, Mr. Bloomberg is a gift-wrapped contrast, a flesh-and-blood billionaire elbowing into the process on cue. Mr. Biden, straining to revive his campaign after bleak finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, has also highlighted Mr. Bloomberg's trail of troubling comments about redlining and stop-and-frisk, suggesting that black voters putting their trust in the former New York mayor are doomed to be disappointed.""It was a violation of every right people have,"" Mr. Biden said Wednesday night of the aggressive policing tactic.While Mr. Bloomberg has at times proved an irresistible target, Mr. Sanders has appeared to absorb fewer attacks from his rivals than a nominal front-runner might typically expect. More moderate candidates like Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg have pressed Mr. Sanders on the cost of his plans. Ms. Warren has said he has ""a lot of questions to answer"" about the venom among some supporters.But it has often been Mr. Bloomberg coming in for the most persistent flogging of late.Both the Sanders and Bloomberg campaigns see value in framing the primary as a two-man race, and even before Wednesday night, the week had produced several punchy skirmishes.Hours before the debate, a Sanders spokeswoman claimed on CNN without evidence that Mr. Bloomberg had ""suffered heart attacks in the past"" as she tried to deflect questions about Mr. Sanders's medical records after his recent heart attack. (The spokeswoman, Briahna Joy Gray, later said she misspoke.)""Well, we both have two stents,"" Mr. Sanders said Wednesday night, suggesting a kind of camaraderie-in-health.Other subjects encouraged clearer distinction.Mr. Bloomberg declared himself the only candidate there who had started a business. (""Is that fair?"" he asked, hearing no objection. ""OK."")And during closing remarks, after Ms. Klobuchar had pointed viewers to her website, Mr. Bloomberg noted one clear measure on which he stands alone.""You can join me at MikeBloomberg.com, too, if you want,"" he said. ""But I'm not asking for any money.""PhotographMichael R. Bloomberg's wealth embodies the privilege denounced by Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.; Joseph R. Biden Jr. criticized Mr. Bloomberg's record, particularly his use of stop-and-frisk policies.

| Jump to first hitForeign affairs have played a strictly limited role so far in the Democratic primary, but the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani could reshape the contest.The American strike in Baghdad that killed the Iranian general Qassim Suleimani thrust foreign policy to the center of the Democratic presidential race, drawing expressions of grave concern from the leading candidates and stoking a new debate in the party about the American military presence in the Middle East.The party's presidential field reacted to the attack with a measure of unity, at least on the surface level, condemning General Suleimani's role directing violence against Americans but criticizing what they called the Trump administration's penchant for reckless action and the threat of all-out war.But during a series of campaign events on Friday, the top Democrats began to signal their differences on matters of national security, opening the way for what could become the party's most serious conversation of the race about war and peace. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose long diplomatic résumé and global stature have been seen as crucial assets to his campaign, seized the occasion to remind voters of his experience, pressing them to elect a president who could ""command the world stage with no on-the-job training.""Delivering stern remarks in Dubuque, Iowa, Mr. Biden said President Trump was risking nuclear proliferation and ""direct conflict with Iran."" On Twitter, he described the president as ""erratic, unstable and dangerously incompetent.""""The threat to American lives and interests in the region and around the world are enormous,"" Mr. Biden said in Iowa.But elsewhere in the state, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont called not just for the replacement of an impulsive president but for a wholesale overhaul of American foreign policy in the Middle East. Opening a town-hall-style meeting in Anamosa, Iowa, with a somber address, Mr. Sanders urged a total military pullback from the region and noted at length that he had forcefully opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, without explicitly mentioning that Mr. Biden had voted to authorize the war.""We need to firmly commit to ending the U.S. military presence in the Middle East in an orderly manner, not through a tweet,"" Mr. Sanders said, reiterating his past calls for a pullout from Afghanistan and an end to cooperation with Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen. ""Instead of provoking more volatility in the region, the United States must use its power, its wealth and its influence to bring the regional powers to the table to resolve conflicts.""And Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who in the past has urged a pullout of all American combat troops from the Middle East, echoed that sentiment on Twitter, warning that the country was ""on the brink of yet another war"" and urging Americans to mobilize against military escalation. ""No more Middle East Wars,"" she wrote.Both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren used the word ""assassination"" to describe the killing of General Suleimani, a term that has significant legal and diplomatic implications. One of the prominent centrists in the race, Michael R. Bloomberg, rebuked Mr. Sanders for that description, calling it ""outrageous."" He described the felled general as a fair target, questioning instead whether Mr. Trump was prepared for the fallout.Whether military matters come to dominate the primary, in the remaining month before the Iowa caucuses, is likely to depend on events in Iraq and Iran -- and perhaps in neighboring countries -- and how severe and visible any ensuing clash with Iran turns out to be. Foreign affairs have so far played a strictly limited role in the Democratic race.There have been major debate-stage duels over health care, taxation, immigration, criminal justice and gun control, but only glancing disagreements about the role of the United States abroad and the proper way to resolve American military engagements in the Middle East and Central Asia.On Friday, much of the Democratic field proceeded with -- and recommended -- caution. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota called on the Trump administration to consult with Congress about a ""strategy for preventing a wider conflict. ""And in North Conway, N.H., Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., called the Baghdad attack ""an extremely provocative act,"" noting that Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush had both considered but opted against attempting to kill General Suleimani.""If we have learned nothing else from the Middle East in the last 20 years, it's that taking out a bad guy is not a good idea unless you are ready for what's coming next,"" said Mr. Buttigieg, who referred several times to his own service in the military.The possibility of a new and protracted conflict abroad could well reshape the general election, even beyond the Democratic race. Mr. Trump ran for president on a pledge to pull back the United States from foreign wars, drawing support from unconventional quarters for a Republican because of the perception that he would pursue an ""America First"" policy of relative isolationism and national self-interest.But Mr. Trump had already drawn criticism from his Democratic rivals, and even within his own party, for presiding over a chaotic pullback from Syria, and the eruption of large-scale violence in Iran and Iraq could profoundly complicate his aim to seek a second term on a message of peace and prosperity. After Thursday's attack, the Trump administration announced that thousands more troops would deploy to the region in anticipation of Iranian action.At Democratic campaign events on Friday, there was already a strong ripple of anxiety running through the primary electorate, as voters who turned out to see several candidates voiced alarm as they imagined what Mr. Trump might do next.""Nobody wants war, and that's what I am afraid of, is that there is going to be war,"" said Brenda Bachman, a 63-year-old from Marengo, Iowa, who had come to see Mr. Sanders. ""We don't need war.""Ross Mercer, 37, a disabled Navy veteran in New Hampshire who served two tours in Iraq, said at Mr. Buttigieg's event that he was worried about Iranian retaliation.""We attacked their country first and I'm scared that they're going to come back and attack our country,"" Mr. Mercer said.There is some precedent for events overseas reshaping American primary elections, often to the benefit of a candidate regarded as a figure of experience -- in this case, perhaps Mr. Biden. In December 2003, the capture of Saddam Hussein in Iraq formed a backdrop for the final phase of a Democratic presidential primary that yielded the quick nomination of John F. Kerry, a Vietnam veteran who served on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.Four years later, in 2007, the troop surge in Afghanistan and the December assassination of a former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto, in Pakistan pushed national security to the center of an unsettled Republican primary that ended with the nomination of John S. McCain, the war hero whose campaign focused overwhelmingly on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Kevin Madden, a political strategist who advised Mr. Bush and Mitt Romney's presidential campaigns, said national security tended to become an election issue in response to major external developments. He cited the Benghazi attack in the fall of 2012 and the Paris nightclub massacre in 2015 as other recent examples.""Every recent contest has had one of these events,"" Mr. Madden said, ""where everything seems to stop and cause all the participants, from the candidates and campaigns to the voters and the media, to recalibrate the stakes of the election through the lens of national security and foreign policy.""But an intensifying debate over foreign policy could have the effect of both spotlighting Mr. Biden's extensive track record in the Middle East and subjecting it to new scrutiny. There have been signs in recent days that several of the leading Democratic candidates were angling for a foreign policy debate with Mr. Biden, even before the outbreak of violence in Iraq and the Suleimani killing came to consume the news.Mr. Sanders has campaigned consistently on his antiwar record, and he has repeatedly highlighted Mr. Biden's past support for the Iraq war, warning Democrats that Mr. Trump would use that record against the former vice president in a general election. On Friday morning, an aide to Mr. Sanders posted images on Twitter showing the progressive lawmaker speaking out against war in Iraq in 1991, 1998, 2002 and 2014.Mr. Biden told reporters in Iowa on Friday that he would not respond to Mr. Sanders's criticism, calling it ""ridiculous"" and countering that Mr. Sanders had his own ""baggage."" He did not specify what he meant by that.Mr. Buttigieg, meanwhile, has attempted to counter questions about his own relative inexperience by pointing to Mr. Biden's stances on Iraq, as an example of how experience was not always an asset in campaigning or governing.""He supported the worst foreign policy decision made by the United States in my lifetime, which was the decision to invade Iraq,"" Mr. Buttigieg said in an Iowa television interview.Mr. Sanders's speech on Friday also indicated how he might use foreign policy to separate himself from other senators who are running for president: He pointed out that he has voted against all of Mr. Trump's military budgets, a distinction that Ms. Warren and Ms. Klobuchar cannot claim.It is impossible to predict precisely how an extended debate over foreign affairs might alter the dynamics of the Democratic race. On Friday, some voters said they yearned for a candidate with Biden-like credentials, while others said they wanted one with a Sanders-like aversion to war.""I don't think it would have escalated to this point if he was the current president,"" Craig Bruxvoort, a 62-year-old Iowa voter, said of Mr. Sanders.At Mr. Biden's event in Dubuque, Karen Sudmeier, a retired teacher, said she had begun the day considering several options -- including Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg -- but after hearing Mr. Biden speak about the Middle East she had decided to support him.""Joe knew everything about it,"" said Ms. Sudmeier, 72. ""He had a plan. And the consequences he laid out of what could happen, I thought, were frightening.""Reid J. Epstein contributed reporting from North Conway, N.H., Sydney Ember from Anamosa, Iowa, and Katie Glueck from Dubuque, Iowa.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., far left, denounced President Trump's decision to approve a military strike in Iraq on Friday, describing Mr. Trump as ""dangerously incompetent."" Senator Elizabeth Warren, middle, and Senator Bernie Sanders also criticized the move from the campaign trail.

| Jump to first hitThe primary race is entering a critical nine-day stretch that could effectively determine the nomination as candidates face a debate, the South Carolina primary and Super Tuesday contests.HOUSTON -- Energized by his landslide victory in the Nevada caucuses, Senator Bernie Sanders turned his focus to President Trump on Sunday while his campaign made plans to try to win the coming South Carolina primary and amass an insurmountable delegate lead on Super Tuesday next week.Mr. Sanders plans to be up on the air with commercials in every South Carolina media market this week, and his staff is scrambling to add new rallies to his schedule as they take aim at their next big target: overtaking the front-runner in Saturday's primary there, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., to all but extinguish his candidacy.But attacks on Mr. Sanders began mounting on Sunday, with Mr. Biden criticizing him as disloyal to former President Barack Obama -- a charged message with the predominantly black electorate in South Carolina -- and others describing the Vermont senator as a long shot against Mr. Trump. Mr. Sanders, in turn, used a rally in the Super Tuesday state of Texas to highlight some favorable polling numbers against the president -- and attempt to reassure Democrats about his electability if he wins the nomination.With seven other candidates competing against the liberal Mr. Sanders, raising the possibility of a fractured moderate vote in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday, pressure is also starting to grow on some Democrats to drop out -- particularly Senator Amy Klobuchar, the billionaire Tom Steyer and even former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who narrowly won the Iowa caucuses. None has shown an ability to build a diverse coalition of voters, which would be crucial to beating Mr. Sanders, yet none showed signs of quitting anytime soon.The Democratic race is now entering a critical nine-day stretch that could effectively determine the nomination, with the future of multiple candidates riding in part on the next televised debate on Tuesday night, the South Carolina vote and the Super Tuesday contests.There were new twists in the race on Sunday, such as Mr. Steyer qualifying to join in the debate and an announcement by Representative James E. Clyburn, the most influential Democrat in South Carolina, that he will endorse a candidate on Wednesday. Adding to the unpredictability is former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who will try to start recovering from his disastrous debate performance last week by appearing for the first time in a CNN town hall, on Wednesday, as well Tuesday's debate.Aides to Mr. Sanders are racing to consolidate his political advantages to help him withstand any winnowing of the field, given that perhaps the biggest threat he now faces are anti-Sanders voters coalescing around one alternative candidate.He enters this next phase of the race with a pair of enviable assets. After finishing near the top in Iowa, winning New Hampshire and then overwhelming his rivals in Nevada, the first state with a racially diverse electorate, he has the aura of success -- and winning usually begets winning in presidential primaries.At the same time, the anti-Sanders camp remains split: Mr. Biden, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar are all insisting on staying in the race while Mr. Bloomberg is spending heavily on advertising in Super Tuesday states like Texas and California, where Mr. Sanders could build up a delegate lead if the remaining vote is divided.In the aftermath of Mr. Sanders's triumph in Nevada, the question that increasingly looms over the race is whether Super Tuesday, when 16 contests are held on March 3, will be the day he puts himself on a glide path to the nomination.On Sunday, his aides began taking steps toward trying to do just that.After months of downplaying Mr. Sanders's prospects in South Carolina, where he lost badly in the 2016 primary because of his weakness with black voters then, his campaign was blunt about its objective in Saturday's vote.""We're fighting to win in South Carolina,"" said Jeff Weaver, a top Sanders strategist, noting that polls show them ""moving up considerably on the vice president.""Should Mr. Sanders defeat or even finish near Mr. Biden in South Carolina, a state the former vice president has long seen as his firewall, it could vault him into Super Tuesday three days later with such force that it may be difficult for any of his opponents to catch up with him.That's when Mr. Sanders is hoping to pile up delegates while also inflicting symbolic blows on his opponents by winning in some of their home states, including Ms. Warren's Massachusetts and Ms. Klobuchar's Minnesota, both of which Mr. Sanders plans to visit before March 3, according to aides.Yet it is Mr. Sanders's decision to compete aggressively in South Carolina, where he has long lowered expectations by vowing only to ""do well"" there, that illustrates how rapidly this race is moving to him. More than half of the state's Democratic electorate is expected to be African-American, one of Mr. Biden's strongest blocs of support, and the former vice president has led in the polls there since the outset of the race.Yet as Mr. Sanders made clear on Sunday, the primary has taken a turn.Addressing over 6,000 supporters at the University of Houston for an afternoon rally, he largely ignored his Democratic rivals and boasted about his lead over Mr. Trump in some head-to-head polls.""Some of the folks in the corporate media are getting a little bit nervous and they say, 'Bernie can't beat Trump,' so let's look at some of the polls out today,"" said a notably upbeat Mr. Sanders, before rattling off numbers that showed him beating Mr. Trump nationally and in battleground states.Even as Mr. Sanders braced for an onslaught of attacks many in his orbit thought would have come by now -- ""there are a lot of knives out for Bernie Sanders,"" Mr. Weaver said -- the senator appeared to be relishing his back-to-back victories. He and his wife and close political confidante, Jane, had a glass of wine on his charter flight Saturday evening after the Nevada results came in, according to a Sanders aide. By Sunday morning, though, Mr. Sanders's Democratic opponents were ready to try to spoil the moment.Speaking to reporters after attending an African-American church service in North Charleston, S.C., Mr. Biden acknowledged that Mr. Sanders ""does have momentum"" before seeking to deflate his candidacy.The former vice president suggested that Mr. Sanders, an avowed democratic socialist, could hurt Democrats' chances of maintaining control of the House in 2020 and winning back the Senate. And he sought to undermine his opponent's chances to win black voters by boasting that he's had Mr. Obama's ""back the whole time"" while saying Mr. Sanders weighed a primary bid against him in the 2012 election. (The Sanders campaign has denied that he considered challenging Mr. Obama.)In an interview on MSNBC on Sunday night, Mr. Biden pressed the point further, portraying Mr. Sanders as a foe of the Obama administration who could have cost Mr. Obama a second term.""We've just had significant disagreements with Bernie, but the way he talks about it, you'd think he and Barack were close buddies,"" Mr. Biden said. He added, ""I know they were not.""While his supporters sought to put the best face on his apparent, and distant, second-place finish in Nevada, Mr. Biden seemed likely to receive some long-awaited good news in South Carolina: the endorsement of Mr. Clyburn, the longtime lawmaker and highest-ranking African-American in Congress.In an interview, Mr. Clyburn said he would disclose his support on Wednesday, the day after the next debate. He cited his ""longtime friendship with Joe,"" but otherwise declined to reveal his preference. However, a Democratic official close to the Biden campaign, speaking on the condition of anonymity so as not to reveal internal planning, said they expected to receive Mr. Clyburn's support.Mr. Clyburn, appearing on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday, praised Mr. Sanders on their shared policy priorities like community health centers, but also raised doubts about his chances in South Carolina. ""Anybody who refers to themselves as a democratic socialist, that word has always had really dire consequences throughout South Carolina,"" Mr. Clyburn said.For Mr. Biden, a bigger matter than endorsements is the need for some of his rivals to exit the race. Yet each of them believes they have as much of a claim on staying in the primary as Mr. Biden, who finished well behind in the first two states, according to their top advisers.Speaking to reporters Sunday, Ms. Klobuchar dismissed a question about whether she'd quit the race.""Why would I get out, that's not even a close call for me,"" she said. ""And I think, why would you have a call for the two women to get out when you have two billionaires in the race""Appearing at campaign events in North Dakota, Virginia and Colorado on Sunday, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren, like Mr. Biden, warned Democrats about the risk of nominating Mr. Sanders.However, a number of moderate Democrats, some affiliated with Mr. Biden and others uncommitted, said it was Mr. Buttigieg, Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Steyer who were only helping Mr. Sanders by staying in the race as spoilers.
Some of the officials, like Susan Swecker, the chairwoman of the Virginia Democratic Party, were subtle with their pleadings.""It would certainly make voter decisions easier because people are still shopping,"" said Ms. Swecker, who has not taken sides and whose state votes a week from Tuesday. ""If there is less on aisle that makes the choice easier.""But other Democrats uneasy about the prospect of Mr. Sanders being their standard-bearer were more direct.""Some folks need to look hard at whether they are viable and contributing to a positive path forward for our party,"" said Senator Christopher Coons of Delaware, a Biden supporter. He carefully avoided mentioning names, but said those who remained in the race were undermining the party's chance for a ""shorter and less-divisive primary.""Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina legislator who has not endorsed, was happy to name names.""Pete and Amy have no path because they have no coalition built -- they don't do well with Hispanic or Black voters,"" Mr. Sellers said of Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar.And Mr. Sellers said Mr. Steyer's candidacy was a ""vanity project"" that would only siphon away votes from Mr. Biden and thrust Mr. Sanders into contention in South Carolina.Yet even if Mr. Steyer underperforms in South Carolina, as he did in Nevada despite vastly outspending the field, and Mr. Biden emerges with a clear victory, moderate Democrats are still facing a larger dilemma. Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Biden are on a collision course to divide votes, particularly among African-Americans, on Super Tuesday.Sydney Ember reported from Houston and Austin, and Jonathan Martin from Las Vegas.

| Jump to first hitThe Russians don't have to help President Trump or Bernie Sanders. They may already be winning.Hi. Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Lisa Lerer, your host.Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.Have the Russians already won?That's the question my colleague Reid Epstein and I were discussing this morning as we looked at the presidential candidates' responses to a new series of reports over the past few days revealing, yet again, a campaign of Russian meddling in American elections.Most of the specifics remain fairly hazy: A report on Thursday said intelligence officials had warned House lawmakers that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump re-elected. The next day, there was a report in The Washington Post that American officials had briefed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont a month ago that Russia was attempting to help his presidential campaign in the Democratic contest.And then yesterday, intelligence officials disputed the reports about Russia's helping Mr. Trump, saying that House members might have misheard or misinterpreted the briefing, and that Russia was intervening in the election but not necessarily to help the president.We don't know exactly what the Russians are doing or how they are doing it, though we can make some assumptions based on their 2016 effort, which many cybersecurity experts believe never stopped operating after the last election.But we do know how some of the candidates have reacted to this serious threat to democracy: by adding to the confusion and disinformation.Mr. Trump responded to revelations about the briefing with lawmakers by berating Joseph Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence, then replacing him days later with Ambassador Richard Grenell, a Trump loyalist with little experience in intelligence or in running a large bureaucracy. Later, Mr. Trump blamed Democrats for spreading a ""hoax.""Mr. Sanders, for his part, moved quickly to denounce Russia, calling President Vladimir V. Putin an ""autocratic thug"" and warning Moscow to stay out of the election. Yet, he has also alluded to the idea that there is a domestic conspiracy afoot, playing into the kind of theories Moscow is eager to promulgate to undermine the news media and our political system.When asked why the disclosure about Russia's attempted assistance came out on Friday, Mr. Sanders said: ""I'll let you guess about one day before the Nevada caucus. Why do you think it came out? It was The Washington Post? Good friends.""The candidates are doing to one another what the Russians are trying to do to the election: weaponize the information. With Russia seemingly pulling levers from behind a curtain, they're attempting to create a narrative about whom Mr. Putin might support or oppose.Mr. Trump suggested at a rally in Las Vegas that Mr. Putin would prefer Mr. Sanders, claiming that Mr. Sanders and his wife had ""honeymooned in Moscow."" (The couple did travel to the Soviet Union after their wedding, and have jokingly called the trip their honeymoon, but they had a more traditional honeymoon the next year in the Caribbean.)Michael Bloomberg's aides made a similar argument: ""Trump himself and now the Russians are indicating that Senator Sanders is the candidate they want to run against,"" Dan Kanninen, a campaign official, told reporters on Monday.And Joseph R. Biden Jr., who said he had not been informed of any specific intelligence about Russia and his campaign, said he was the candidate Mr. Putin most hated.""The Russians don't want me to be the nominee,"" he said on ""Face the Nation."" ""They spent a lot of money on bots on Facebook, and they've been taken down, saying Biden is a bad guy. They don't want Biden running. They're not -- no one's helping me to try to get the nomination.""Turning disinformation into just another political football is exactly the kind of reaction Russia hopes to foster. The point of Moscow's campaign is not necessarily to help Mr. Trump or Mr. Sanders get to the presidency in 2020; it's to sow discord and undermine the institutions of American democracy, making presidential elections here seem no more credible than the ones keeping Mr. Putin in office.One small solution might be to clarify the threat for voters by creating a protocol to monitor and notify both government agencies and the public about disinformation efforts -- similar to a system set up in Canada last year. Right now, most of the information coming out in public is through leaks to the news media, very likely for political gain. That gives voters little clear information about what to watch out for when they log onto Twitter or Facebook.""What's so worrying to me right now are the unclear reports,"" said Laura Rosenberger, a former Bush and Obama administration official who now leads the Alliance for Securing Democracy, which works to counter foreign interference campaigns. ""It's hard to even know the scale of the issue when we don't know really what the scope of the problem is.""Welcome to 2020, when disinformation is clouded in ... disinformation!Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers.

And, boy, did you have thoughts!For Barbara Sloan of Conway, S.C., the early results changed her view -- and vote.""Living in South Carolina, I had expected Biden to do better and thought his candidacy might be inevitable,"" she said. ""Obviously, Iowa and New Hampshire showed that is not the case. At the same time, I got to see more of Amy Klobuchar and she grew on me,"" Ms. Sloan continued. ""This week, I voted in-person absentee for her in the South Carolina Democratic Primary.""For John Sanderson, the results raised his concerns about Senator Elizabeth Warren.""I live in North Carolina, and I have never given Sanders or Buttigieg any chance whatsoever of winning here, and I still don't,"" he said. ""I have also had serious doubts about Warren's chances all along, and her performances in Iowa and New Hampshire only reinforce my doubts about her electability overall."" He said a Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar ticket might fare best.Lydia Simmons of San Francisco said the early states underscored how quickly the race could change.""New Hampshire could be considered a case study of why one result doesn't guarantee another,"" she said. ""Amy Klobuchar did not stand out in Iowa. She came in fifth. One strong debate later, she came in third,"" she continued, adding that Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden could not be counted out. ""Ultimately momentum needs to be maintained, and that requires strong performance in far more than two small states.""And Joyce Tarantino questioned why Iowa and New Hampshire have so much power, anyhow.""To place such importance on having two small states, with a very small amount of delegates, and unrepresentative of the nation and the Democratic Party as a whole, being the first to vote cannot continue,"" she said. ""We are wasting valuable time and financial resources at the early stage of a very important campaign with no discernible return on investment, except confusion.""... SeriouslyDating in 2020.

| Jump to first hitWith the Iowa caucuses set to kick off the primary season on Monday night, a Democratic race that began as a contest of ideas and ideologies has given way to a fixation on electability.
SIOUX CITY, Iowa — After a long campaign of ideological clashes, policy debates and talk of a grand reckoning on the direction of the Democratic Party, the presidential primaries starting on Monday will be shaped by a less lofty but increasingly urgent matter: determining the best candidate to defeat an incumbent who has already proved to be a political survivor.
With Republicans ready to acquit President Trump of two impeachment charges next week, the nation’s political table has been set for 2020: Congress will not remove him from office, despite the wishes of many liberals, leaving the fate of Mr. Trump to the November general election and the candidate nominated by Democrats in the coming months.
From the liberal left to the moderate middle, the major presidential contenders are now honing or recalibrating their final appeals before Iowa’s caucuses to make the case that they represent the party’s best chance to overcome Mr. Trump’s well-funded re-election operation and win back the White House this fall.
If impeachment rarely comes up on the Democratic campaign trail, the imperative of beating Mr. Trump has come to outweigh all other considerations for many voters — an extraordinary turn of events for a party that spent the last year sparring over plans to implement “Medicare for all” and how far to go in overhauling immigration laws, the financial sector and the criminal justice system.
A 2020 primary season that was initially seen as a contest of ideas, with liberal activists largely setting the agenda, has given way to jockeying over notions about electability and who can assemble the strongest coalition of voters in the fall.
“I think that’s increasingly what’s on voters’ minds,” Pete Buttigieg, one of the leading candidates in Iowa, said in an interview, referring to electability. “If they’re making up their minds now and still thinking through us, it means they appreciate that we’ve got common values and they want the person most likely to beat Donald Trump.”
The five leading Democratic candidates in Iowa descended on the state on Saturday ahead of the caucuses Monday night, with polls showing no clear front-runner and voters still torn about whom to support. Three of these contenders — Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar — returned after being away for most of the last two weeks at the Senate impeachment trial; no one can say with certainty if their absences will affect their chances in the caucuses.
In last-minute rallies, pamphlets and television advertising and even in electric signs placed atop cars that resemble pizza delivery advertisements, the candidates are running more explicitly on their purported viability than in any modern presidential primary.
Mr. Sanders, the leading progressive in the field, is increasingly linking his populist platform to an argument that he can peel away disaffected voters from Mr. Trump while a more moderate candidate like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. could imperil that effort. Mr. Biden is closing his Iowa campaign with a commercial highlighting his advantage over Mr. Trump in some national and swing-state polls while his leading supporters in Iowa are introducing him to voters by arguing that he could win over their Republican friends.
And Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren, who are struggling to match the appeal of their rivals on the party’s ideological poles, are infusing their 11th-hour messaging with barely veiled claims that they are safer choices because they won’t alienate one flank of the party like Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden.
Returning to the Iowa campaign trail on Saturday, Ms. Warren presented herself as the candidate best prepared to rally Democrats for the general election. She addressed a group of volunteers in Urbandale, before a wall of signs reading “Unite the Party.” In a Cedar Rapids gymnasium, Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts praised Ms. Warren as “both empathetic and electable.”
“We will, we must, come together as a party and beat Donald Trump,” Ms. Warren said. “And I’ve got a plan for that.”
This turn toward I-can-win pragmatism reflects a simple fact of political life in a contest in which at least a third of likely caucusgoers remain undecided just days before the vote. The candidates are responding to the marketplace: Their voters, while deeply split across ideological and generational lines in ways that could still force a showdown at this summer’s convention, are united by an all-consuming hunger to unseat Mr. Trump.
“What I’m focused on most is getting that fool out of the White House,” said Debbie McAllister, who attended a Sioux City rally Friday for Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and is leaning toward him over Ms. Klobuchar.
John Norris, who has caucused here every four years since 1976 and is a leading supporter of Ms. Warren, said his fellow Iowa Democrats feel a burden heavier than any he can recall.
“It’s Trump,” said Mr. Norris. “We saw it a little bit in ’04 — it was we got to stop George W., Iraq war — but this is that on steroids.”
Even the most bluntly negative campaign tactics have been framed in terms of general-election odds. An outside-spending group, Democratic Majority for Israel, that has dedicated $700,000 to advertising against Mr. Sanders in the last week of the caucus race, has put that whole sum behind a commercial warning that his far-left platform could throw the election to Mr. Trump.
“Democrats believe there is nothing more important than replacing Donald Trump,” said Mark Mellman, the president of Democratic Majority for Israel and a longtime Democratic pollster. Regarding Mr. Sanders, he added, “A lot of Democrats don’t disagree with him on a lot of positions he has, but we and others are concerned about electability.”
Perhaps most remarkable are the closing appeals of Mr. Sanders of Vermont, whose calls for “a political revolution” vaulted him to contention in the 2016 race but who scarcely mentioned his prospects back then against Mr. Trump or Senator Ted Cruz, the two leading Republicans. Mr. Sanders has not diluted his progressive message, but as he stakes out a lead in some Iowa polls the self-proclaimed democratic socialist is turning to hardheaded pragmatism.
His campaign ads warn against nominating a candidate without his own unblemished record of opposing cuts to Social Security — an unmistakable reference to Mr. Biden and his past support for overhauling the program. And at Mr. Sanders’s Sioux City field office, his campaign was distributing a pamphlet that read, “An effective leader with the toughness to defeat Donald Trump.”
Addressing supporters on Saturday in Indianola, Iowa, some of whom wore “Bernie Beats Trump” buttons, Mr. Sanders argued that his mammoth volunteer effort in Iowa presaged the sort of organization he could build this fall.
“We are going to knock on 500,000 doors in the month of January and the first two days of February,” he said, adding: “That is what we need to do in order to win against Trump.”
Vowing to “bring millions of people into the political process who normally do not vote,” Mr. Sanders warned that Democrats will lose “in a low turnout election.”
Mr. Biden’s single-minded focus on electability also stands out, as he goes further than his rivals in attempting to replace political inspiration with cold calculus about cobbling together the 270 Electoral College votes needed to defeat Mr. Trump.
“He beats Trump by the most nationally, and in the states we have to win,” a narrator says in one of his concluding Iowa television ads.
The appeals are no more subtle at his events in Iowa, which often feature former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa and his wife, Christie. At a rally in suburban Des Moines, Ms. Vilsack talked up Mr. Biden’s potential appeal among her Republican friends, and Mr. Vilsack rattled off the former vice president’s head-to-head advantage in general-election surveys in the traditional swing states.
And in an only-in-2020 moment that underscored how the horse race has overtaken policy as a focus right now, Mr. Vilsack drew some of the loudest applause at the entire event by making this observation about polling: “He’s within the margin of error in Texas!”
Two other candidates, Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, have used the voter fixation on electability to cast themselves as candidates with the broadest appeal within the party.
Mr. Buttigieg organized his campaign schedule in the final weeks of the caucuses around visiting counties that voted for former President Barack Obama before flipping to support Mr. Trump. His aides have circulated statistics about past elections to reporters in each locale, and Mr. Buttigieg has sought to liken himself — in kind if not by name — to past general-election winners, like Bill Clinton and Mr. Obama.
“In the last half-century in this country,” Mr. Buttigieg said at a rally in Marshalltown, Iowa, “every single time my party has won the White House, without exception, we’ve done it with a nominee who is looking to the future, moving past the arguments of the past, not a creature of Washington, and opening the door to a new generation.”
In Ankeny, Mr. Buttigieg invoked the impeachment trial — and Mr. Trump’s likely acquittal — to emphasize the stakes of the election. “This is our only chance, unless the Senate really surprises us,” he said, to laughter from the crowd.
Ms. Warren has also sought to portray herself as a consensus candidate, airing a commercial that features Iowa supporters of Mr. Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump from 2016 who all say they are now supporting the Massachusetts senator.
And in a plain acknowledgment of voters’ concerns about sexism in the general election, Ms. Warren released another spot showing a former supporter of Mr. Trump — an older man from rural Iowa — directly addressing worries among some voters about nominating a woman. “For people that say that a woman can’t win, I say: nonsense,” he says, holding up a photograph showing a Trump sign and declaring: “This is the man to beat, and Elizabeth can do it.”
At a kickoff event for Warren canvassers on Friday morning in Clive, a suburb of Des Moines, Michelle Wu, a Boston city councilor, urged them to reassure anxious voters with a version of that argument, stressing Ms. Warren’s victory in 2012 over a popular Republican senator — the “barn jacket-wearing, pickup truck-driving Scott Brown” — and promising that her economic message would appeal to independents and disaffected Republicans.
Not to be outdone on electability is Ms. Klobuchar, who for months has been blunt about why Iowans should turn to her: because she’s won every race she’s run in an increasingly competitive Midwestern state, Minnesota.
While that pitch has made her competitive in Iowa, she has been outspent and has polled below the four leading Democrats.
In the campaign’s closing days, Ms. Klobuchar, too, is becoming even less subtle: She has printed T-shirts in her signature green reading, “Amy Klobuchar Will Beat Donald Trump.”

| Jump to first hit""You called me a liar,"" Bernie Sanders responded, as the candidates' sudden clash injected new uncertainty into the Democratic presidential race.DES MOINES -- The sudden clash between Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders over gender and honesty injected new uncertainty into the Democratic presidential race, after the broadcast on Wednesday evening of a recording that showed Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders trading accusations that each had called the other a ""liar.""With less than three weeks before the first-in-the-nation caucuses in Iowa, the breakdown of a longstanding nonaggression pact between the two leading liberals in the race cast doubt on whether Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, or Ms. Warren, of Massachusetts, can unite the Democratic Party's liberal wing.Polls in Iowa and New Hampshire have found all of the top candidates -- Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. -- bunched up in the earliest Democratic contests, though Mr. Biden has held a steady national lead, helped to a great degree by divisions on the left.The rupture, which has already angered supporters of both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, could heighten Democratic anxieties and inject negativity into the race in Iowa, where Democrats had a history of rewarding positive behavior from presidential candidates.""I think you called me a liar on national TV,"" Ms. Warren told Mr. Sanders after the presidential debate in Des Moines on Tuesday night, referring to their earlier dispute onstage over whether he told her in a private 2018 meeting that a woman could not be president. The New York Times described details of their exchange on Wednesday afternoon, and CNN broadcast an audio recording that night.According to the audio, Mr. Sanders responded, ""What?""""I think you called me a liar on national TV,"" she said again.""You know, let's not do it right now,"" he said. ""If you want to have that discussion, we'll have that discussion.""Ms. Warren replied, ""Anytime.""""You called me a liar,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""You told me -- all right, let's not do it now.""Tom Steyer, the billionaire businessman, approached Mr. Sanders in the middle of the exchange.""I don't want to get in the middle,"" Mr. Steyer said. ""I just want to say, 'Hi, Bernie.""'Both the Warren and Sanders campaigns declined to comment on Wednesday.The exchange onstage between the two progressives, surrounded by onlookers but wrapped up in their intensely personal rivalry, marked their most direct confrontation in the entire 2020 election. And in some respects, it represented a kind of inevitable concession to reality: If Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders share an ideological cause, up to a point, they cannot ultimately share a presidential nomination. For Ms. Warren, taking on Mr. Sanders face-to-face risked further angering the far left, sections of which have already turned on her for the rivalry with Mr. Sanders. And while Ms. Warren was praised for addressing the subject of gender head-on during the debate, even some of her supporters acknowledge that tackling sexism so prominently could risk leaving primary voters uneasy about the implications of nominating a woman.Progressives fear the public division will benefit the moderates in the race -- and, more broadly, threaten the movement they have tried to build. Leading progressive groups spent hours Wednesday trying to craft joint statements of unity while their leading political figures were in a public fight.""I am hoping that volunteers and grass-roots groups can help bridge the gap that has opened between Warren and Sanders around their 2018 conversation,"" said Larry Cohen, a longtime friend and adviser to Mr. Sanders who serves as chairman of Our Revolution, the organization that spun out of the 2016 Sanders presidential campaign. ""We remain focused on racial and gender justice, health care, climate crisis, good jobs, student debt and free college, the spiraling military budget and more. I don't see a path forward on those issues in the Senate or at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee without cooperation when the time comes.""Many progressive leaders pointed to the 2004 primary as a cautionary tale, when feuding between the more liberal candidacies of Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and former Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont helped the more moderate Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts win the Iowa caucus after a summer slump.""It's absolutely critical that progressives focus their fire on the corporate wing of the party to not allow a repeat of the 2004 election,"" said Neil Sroka, communications director for Democracy for America, a liberal group founded by Mr. Dean after his unsuccessful primary run.For Mr. Sanders, there is little upside to a drawn-out clash with Ms. Warren, particularly over matters of gender and sexism. While Mr. Sanders's hard-core base has rallied to his side, much of the Democratic electorate still harbors feelings of resentment toward Mr. Sanders for his conduct toward Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential primaries.And in a conflict heavily focused on which candidate is telling the truth, Ms. Warren faces a real risk: Several studies have shown that voters punish women more harshly than men for real or perceived dishonesty.Depictions of female candidates as calculating or conniving are political mainstays. As long ago as 1984, opponents launched ""authenticity"" attacks against Geraldine Ferraro, the first woman to appear on a major party's presidential ticket. This pattern endures regardless of who is telling the truth, these studies conclude, and regardless of either candidate's intentions. If voters conclude that Ms. Warren is lying, it is most likely to hurt her more than it will hurt Mr. Sanders if voters conclude that he is lying.It is unclear whether either candidate may be inclined to perpetuate the feud in public. It is telling that Ms. Warren's most pointed comment to Mr. Sanders came after the formal debate concluded, and that Mr. Sanders responded not by escalating the fight but by deferring it to another time.By the time CNN aired the footage on Wednesday night, the two candidates had not spoken about the exchange, people familiar with their whereabouts said, though they were expected to be in close contact when the Senate convenes Friday.CNN executives initially said they did not believe the exchange had been captured by the network's microphones. The network said its journalists located a recording late on Wednesday after reviewing audio from the microphones that Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren had been wearing onstage.Over the weekend, Ms. Warren said she was ""disappointed"" in Mr. Sanders after Politico reported that his campaign had distributed a script to volunteers suggesting she appealed mainly to highly educated voters. On Monday, CNN reported that Mr. Sanders had told Ms. Warren in a private meeting in 2018 that he thought a woman could not win the presidency; Mr. Sanders vehemently denied it.""I thought a woman could win; he disagreed,"" Ms. Warren said in a statement on Monday.On Tuesday, the issue burst forth onto the debate stage in a remarkable moment before a national audience that captured the recent friction between the two senators.""I didn't say it,"" Mr. Sanders insisted, about her characterization of his 2018 remarks. Ms. Warren disputed that, then called him her friend before pivoting to make the case that of the six candidates onstage, only the women had won all of their elections.After the debate, Mr. Steyer repeatedly insisted that he did not hear the back-and-forth between the two liberals.""I was just saying good night to the two of them,"" he told reporters during a brief exchange in the debate spin room at Drake University. ""I didn't hear anything.""Reid J. Epstein and Sydney Ember reported from Des Moines, and Alexander Burns from New York. Reporting was contributed by Michael M. Grynbaum, Maggie Astor and Astead W. Herndon from New York, and Lisa Lerer from Washington.IllustrationSenators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders did not shake hands Tuesday after a tense debate.

| Jump to first hitMr. Sanders is making the case that his urgent message is the best match for a trying political moment, and moderates are scrambling ahead of Super Tuesday to stop his momentum.Late last year a group of first-term House Democrats, anxious over the party's fractious presidential race, convened a series of discussions intended to spur unity. Led by Representatives Colin Allred of Texas and Haley Stevens of Michigan, they considered issuing a collective endorsement of one moderate candidate.The group held phone calls with Joseph R. Biden Jr., Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg. But the lawmakers could not agree: Some were torn between the options, and others worried about alienating voters at home who backed other contenders, like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. A few issued solo endorsements of Mr. Biden, but the grander plan disintegrated.""There was not time to reach consensus over one candidate,"" said Ms. Stevens, who eventually endorsed Michael R. Bloomberg, recalling the ""fast-moving"" blur of the lead-up to Iowa.That effort was just one in a series of abandoned or ineffective plans to rally the moderate wing of the Democratic Party, and the leaders and institutions of the political establishment, behind a single formidable contender who could stop the ascent of Mr. Sanders, a democratic socialist promising a revolution in government.A gambit to have the powerful Democratic machine in Nevada back Mr. Biden, for instance, fizzled when the former vice president finished fifth in New Hampshire. Two outside spending groups formed to target Mr. Sanders were unable to inflict damage.Now, on the eve of Super Tuesday, when Democrats across 15 states and territories will hand out more than a third of the delegates required to claim the nomination, Mr. Sanders is within reach of a clear national lead and Mr. Biden is racing to catch up.In the last few days, moderate Democrats acting with a new sense of urgency have begun a large-scale effort to coalesce around Mr. Biden, with Mr. Buttigieg leaving the race on Sunday and Ms. Klobuchar abandoning her own campaign Monday. In a sign of the new, if frantic, spirit of unity, the two bitter foes both endorsed the former vice president at campaign events on Monday night in Dallas.But Mr. Sanders has become a formidable front-runner. The Vermont senator has put forth a sweeping set of policy prescriptions -- far more ambitious than anything Mr. Biden and other moderates have proposed -- to address defining concerns for many Democrats, like economic inequality and the soaring cost of health care and higher education.His agenda has galvanized liberal voters yearning for change. Mr. Sanders finished atop the first three voting states before trailing Mr. Biden in South Carolina, and polls show him ahead in the delegate-rich state of California on Tuesday.He holds significant financial and organizational advantages that he was able to accumulate over a long season of disarray among traditional Democrats. And he has begun to make an increasingly direct case to the rest of the party that his urgent message is the best match for a trying political moment, and that he is the candidate most prepared to do battle with President Trump.Interviews with more than 100 Democratic elected officials, campaign strategists, union leaders and donors revealed a party establishment that spent many months distressed about the implications of nominating Mr. Sanders but frozen in a state of anxiety over who would be the best alternative.Many of the most influential officials, organizations and donors in the party remain torn between their concern about Mr. Sanders's chances in the general election, their fear of antagonizing his supporters, and their belated and often-rueful recognition that he has assembled a political movement with appeal well beyond the youthful, left-wing base he built in 2016.Top Democrats now believe that there are only two realistic paths forward in the presidential race: a dominant victory on Tuesday by Mr. Sanders that gives him a wide lead in the delegate count, or a battle for delegates over months of primary elections, that might allow Mr. Biden to pull ahead or force the nomination to be decided at the Milwaukee convention in July.The mood of emergency among party leaders has been simmering for months but it only translated into a surge of support for Mr. Biden at the very last minute.""If we go through March 3 and don't show that we have a nominee who can appeal to a broad swath of our party, we're going to be in serious trouble,"" said Terry McAuliffe, the former Virginia governor and Democratic National Committee chairman, who endorsed Mr. Biden over the weekend.Even now, authority figures like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and former President Barack Obama have stayed on the sidelines, convinced their intervention would only fuel Mr. Sanders's claims of an insider plot against him. Influential labor groups and advocacy organizations have either stayed quiet or supported multiple candidates.The candidates themselves have made fitful or flawed efforts to garner mainstream Democratic support: A number of lawmakers open to endorsing Mr. Biden said he did little to reach out to them for most of the campaign, letting weeks or months go by without any contact from him or his aides.A flashy late entrant, Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor, initially impressed elected officials with an energetic charm offensive and a war-machine campaign operation. But many Democrats developed serious reservations about him after a damaging debate-stage clash with Ms. Warren last month.Underdog moderates persisted in pleading with party leaders for help, promising to continue their campaigns even at the risk of playing a spoiler's role for Mr. Biden or Mr. Bloomberg. Last week, only three days before he dropped out of the race, Mr. Buttigieg visited the Capitol to seek endorsements and vowed in a private meeting with centrist Democrats that he would not withdraw. It was only after South Carolina, when internal campaign projections were clear that they faced a rout on Super Tuesday, that Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar dropped out.And while Mr. Sanders has made private overtures toward centrists, his harpoons toward ""corporate Democrats"" and the scorched-earth tactics of his supporters have continued to unnerve Democratic leaders.Christine Pelosi, one of the speaker's daughters, last month contacted Mr. Sanders's advisers to convey her unhappiness that the actress Susan Sarandon, who is backing the Vermont senator, had called for Speaker Pelosi's ouster, according to a Democrat familiar with the conversations.Last Wednesday, the speaker herself seemed to have Mr. Sanders on her mind. That day, she declared in a news conference that Democrats would ""wholeheartedly support"" whomever their voters nominated.But in a closed-door session in the Capitol with her leadership team, Ms. Pelosi's irritation was unmistakable, according to two Democratic officials familiar with the conversation.With Mr. Sanders largely ignoring the roster of bills her majority has passed and boasting that only a true progressive can defeat Mr. Trump, the speaker said House Democrats proved in 2018 how to win elections; she cited their legislative accomplishments and dismissed the ""geniuses"" on television who claim the party is shifting sharply to the left.Ms. Pelosi also invoked her own liberal credentials: In her basement, she noted, she still had old campaign signs supporting progressive causes.Tug of war within the establishmentIt was not only the national Democratic establishment that declined to unite around Mr. Biden or anyone else. Efforts in the states crumbled or proved ineffective: After the muddled results in Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr. Biden's campaign hoped to make a strong stand in Nevada, the first diverse state to weigh in on the nomination.Mr. Biden's advisers privately projected optimism that they could win endorsements from the most important forces in Nevada politics: Gov. Steve Sisolak, a popular moderate; the casino workers union; and Harry Reid, the former Democratic leader in the Senate. But spooked by Mr. Biden's debilitating loss in New Hampshire, none of them backed him before the caucuses. Mr. Sanders won the state by an overwhelming margin.As in other states, Democratic leaders said there had been limited outreach by Mr. Biden. In an interview before the caucuses, Mr. Reid said he had not heard from him or his campaign chairman, Steve Ricchetti, in ""several weeks.""Another candidate was more proactive, pursuing Mr. Reid and many other Democratic leaders with solicitousness: Mr. Bloomberg.Mr. Bloomberg visited Capitol Hill and dispatched aides around the country to seek endorsements and outline his plans for the campaign against Mr. Trump. His advisers have paraded Democrats through their Times Square headquarters. And even though he was not competing in Nevada, Mr. Bloomberg visited Mr. Reid and his wife, Landra, at their home outside Las Vegas.By early February, Mr. Bloomberg had effectively frozen the support of other moderates, overwhelming voters with advertising and tantalizing Democratic power brokers with his vision for the general election. In an illustration of Mr. Bloomberg's allure even to maverick Democrats, his advisers reached out to Andrew Yang after he withdrew from the presidential race to offer counsel about a possible campaign for mayor of New York City next year.Yet Mr. Bloomberg has not always lived up to the image of a can-do executive he presents in his $500 million advertising campaign.At a private meeting with Democratic governors in Washington, right after the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Bloomberg delivered a casual performance that alternately charmed and puzzled several attendees. He spoke vaguely about how he would unite the party and win over progressives, suggesting he could heal wounds by being kind to his critics in public and sending flowers to their wives, according to multiple people present.In an awkward exchange, Mr. Bloomberg said he was uncertain why Ms. Warren, a Massachusetts senator, was faring poorly in the race; when Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon suggested gender could be a factor, Mr. Bloomberg said he disagreed. He emerged with no new supporters.Mr. Bloomberg still secured a stream of endorsements from prominent Democrats. But his campaign lost a number of defectors because of his disastrous first debate, which dented his polling numbers and emboldened his critics.""You can't sell Bloomberg to the country,"" said Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a Biden co-chair. ""How's he going to build a base with the stuff he's said?""Even as the race moved on from their early-state successes, Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg clung to hope in confounding ways.Mr. Buttigieg insisted to donors that if he raised enough money, he could pull off an upset at the convention. Ms. Klobuchar was seen as a potential contender after her third-place finish in New Hampshire but, always attuned to her press coverage, she spent time in recent days sending personal messages to media figures complaining about their reporting and boasting of her energetic campaign schedule.Despite their wariness of Mr. Sanders, party leaders have hesitated to mount an all-out effort against him. A pair of outside-spending efforts targeting him have struggled to get off the ground: Ad campaigns in Iowa and Nevada by a pro-Israel group failed to halt Mr. Sanders's advance, and a second group, known as the Big Tent Project, has managed to cobble together only a few million dollars.At a February luncheon for vulnerable lawmakers, Representative Cheri Bustos of Illinois, the chairwoman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, pressed Democrats not to rule out candidates whom they could feel pressure to support later. Her entreaty came after one vulnerable Democrat, Representative Anthony Brindisi of New York, told his hometown paper he would not support Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren.But Ms. Bustos is said to be worried about Mr. Sanders, and her committee plans to conduct polling in swing districts to see how nominating him might affect House races.At the same time, Mr. Bloomberg has continued stoking that mood of alarm as he bids for, if not the heart, then at least the more calculating head of the Democratic establishment.In a private briefing in Charleston, S.C., last week, one of Mr. Bloomberg's senior advisers, Dan Kanninen, made an extensive presentation detailing the risks of nominating Mr. Sanders. ""Florida is off the map,"" he said, citing Mr. Sanders's past praise of some of Fidel Castro's programs, according to one person who shared a detailed account of the meeting.In the same session, Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington, D.C., warned that Mr. Sanders had a ""cultlike following,"" and claimed Mr. Biden was no longer a viable option: ""This is a choice between Bernie, Mike and Trump,"" she said.Days later, Mr. Biden won South Carolina by nearly 30 points.Sanders's race to loseOn the eve of Super Tuesday, Mr. Sanders still appears to hold an upper hand, with a lead in national polls backed by his muscular fund-raising machine and grass-roots following. On Sunday, he announced that he had raised $46.5 million in February alone.Given Mr. Sanders's history of acrimony with the Democratic establishment, some in the party are skeptical that he can be induced to work cooperatively with party leadership. Some of his advisers are eager to signal that he can, though they calculated they would have a better chance after what they are hoping will be a breakthrough on Super Tuesday.Mr. Sanders has made efforts toward comity in the past: He met several times last year with more moderate Democrats in Washington, pitching himself as a nominee they could at least tolerate. Meeting with the New Democrat Coalition last year, Mr. Sanders conceded that he had no hope of being their first choice, but said that he hoped they could accept him eventually, according to a lawmaker who heard his pitch.Last summer, Mr. Sanders dined with another group of House members to make the case that his economic message and outsider's approach would have wide traction in the general election. ""Bernie's argument is, 'Don't pigeonhole me as just a progressive candidate,""' said Representative Dan Kildee of Michigan, who attended the dinner.But Mr. Sanders has done little over the last month to reassure skeptics within his party, striking a posture of defiance that may have helped accelerate the late movement toward Mr. Biden. Most senior Democrats are hoping that Mr. Sanders's forward march can be slowed, and some have urged Mr. Obama to intervene.Mr. Obama has shown no inclination to do so, reasoning that he must hang back to preserve his ability to help unify the party at the end of a messy nominating process.Mr. Biden's aides see that argument as so much malarkey, and they have conveyed as much to Mr. Obama's inner circle, arguing that the former president's leverage would evaporate once Mr. Sanders accrued millions of votes. They have pleaded with Mr. Obama's camp to distance him from Mr. Bloomberg, who has run saturation-level advertising showing images of himself with the former president. When a poll came out last week showing that many Democratic voters believe Mr. Obama is supporting Mr. Bloomberg, the Biden campaign shared it with Mr. Obama's aides.Party leaders are already preparing for the possibility of a contested convention, and many superdelegates have indicated they are open to selecting a nominee besides Mr. Sanders if he collects the most delegates but falls short of a majority.Tom Perez, the D.N.C. chairman, has been clear in conversations with allies that he will abide by the current rules and would not resist an effort by superdelegates to determine the nomination on a second ballot. Referring to the number of delegates needed for a majority, Mr. Perez told one Democrat, ""1991 delegates are required,"" and noted that Mr. Sanders is familiar with the guidelines.With the identity of the Democratic standard-bearer unknown, Mr. Schumer has begun to ponder ways of uniting the party behind whoever that person might be: The Senate leader is particularly focused on the idea of nominating an African-American woman for vice president, mulling names like Senator Kamala Harris of California, Stacey Abrams of Georgia and Representative Val Demings of Florida, according to people who have spoken with Mr. Schumer.As long as a contested convention remains possible, that could make it even harder for any single candidate to put together a decisive primary coalition.Mr. Reid of Nevada said he was hopeful the race would not last until Milwaukee. But if no candidate achieved a delegate majority by the end of primary voting in June, Mr. Reid said last month that he was prepared to step in to arrange a deal before the convention in mid-July. In the run-up to his own state's caucuses, Mr. Reid reached for a conciliatory role and cautioned Democrats not to put pressure on Mr. Sanders ""to tone down anything.""Mr. Trump, he said then, could be defeated by any of the top Democrats.But nine days after Nevada Democrats voted, and weeks after his intervention could have resurrected Mr. Biden and slowed Mr. Sanders in the state, Mr. Reid had evidently reconsidered: On Monday, he issued a belated endorsement of Mr. Biden, calling him the best candidate ""to defeat Trump and lead our country following the trauma of Trump's presidency.""PhotographSupporters of Michael R.

| Jump to first hitThe president who believes he can control events is confronted by further evidence that he cannot.On Monday, President Trump was already having a bad week.The coronavirus was spreading, the stock market was plummeting and his administration was getting blamed for an inadequate response to a health crisis.Then came Tuesday. Joseph R. Biden Jr., whom Mr. Trump was so eager to paint as corrupt that his attempts to do so led to his impeachment, pulled off one of the most remarkable political comebacks in recent history, winning nine states and joining Senator Bernie Sanders as a front-runner in the Democratic presidential race.U.S. stocks did make a comeback on Wednesday, closing nearly 1,200 points up, which counted as good news for a president betting the farm on a healthy economy. The bad news was the reason many analysts cited for the gains was Mr. Biden's Super Tuesday victories.For Mr. Trump, whose belief in his own ability to shape external events is a source of comfort, it has been a week of confronting the fact that almost nothing is in his control right now.He has dealt with the coronavirus, the first external crisis of his administration, by repeating a string of falsehoods rather than delivering reassurance. He has claimed, falsely, that a vaccine would be ready within months when in reality, it won't be ready for more than a year. And his insistence that his administration deserves an ""A+++"" for its response has done little to calm the rattled markets or an anxious electorate.There has long been a disconnect between the way Mr. Trump sees politics and the way his more seasoned advisers do. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has been focused on Mr. Sanders and his longtime rival Michael R. Bloomberg. But privately, several advisers said on Wednesday that they were not surprised that Democrats rallied around Mr. Biden, even if the president was.And they anticipated an ugly slog of a campaign going forward, with the brutal 2016 general election race against Hillary Clinton serving as a reminder of how Mr. Trump will try to tarnish his rivals, even as voters on Tuesday appeared to favor a candidate who projected calm stability over upheaval and uncertainty.Trump campaign officials said on Wednesday that they viewed Mr. Biden as ""Hillary Clinton Lite,"" a candidate who they will argue generated little enthusiasm of his own while coasting off the opposition to the president and Mr. Sanders among Democrats. They said they planned to undercut his support from black voters by highlighting Mr. Biden's vote for the now-controversial 1994 crime bill, while talking up Mr. Trump's work on criminal justice reform.And they said they would seek to elevate his backing of trade policies like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal that originated under President Barack Obama.But they face a daunting challenge. Mr. Obama remains deeply popular with Democratic voters, and highlighting Mr. Biden's work with him could simply energize his supporters to turn out for him in the fall if he is the nominee. And unlike Mrs. Clinton, who was viewed negatively by a large swath of voters over decades, Mr. Biden may have a stronger bond with some voters in his party.Mr. Trump's frustration over the election results was evident in one of his early-morning Twitter posts on Wednesday -- a screed against Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general who was forced into a runoff for his old Senate seat in Alabama, and whom Mr. Trump still blames for the two-year inquiry into a possible conspiracy between his 2016 campaign and Russian officials.""This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States & then doesn't have the wisdom or courage to stare down & end the phony Russia Witch Hunt. Recuses himself on FIRST DAY in office, and the Mueller Scam begins!"" Mr. Trump tweeted, after Mr. Sessions fell short of securing a majority in the Republican primary.In a moment of uncertainty, Mr. Trump appeared to be grasping at the equivalent of comfort food: attacking Mr. Sessions. It was, people close to the president said, his reward for staying quiet during Mr. Sessions's primary race, and also a way for the president to highlight a race in which his sustained attacks on Mr. Sessions before the campaign ultimately affected his ability to cleanly win.It was also clear that Mr. Trump's attempt to dictate the contours of the Democratic presidential contest has had little comparable effect.For months, Mr. Trump has told aides he believes he can shape the Democratic race to his own advantage by focusing on specific candidates. And he has been more overt than any incumbent in trying to influence the nominating contest of another party, training his Twitter feed on his potential rivals and trying to deepen authentic divisions in the Democratic Party by stoking fears that the establishment was trying to rob Mr. Sanders of the nomination.In January, he floated the idea that the Senate impeachment trial was intended to keep Mr. Sanders grounded in Washington instead of campaigning in Iowa before the caucuses there.""They are rigging the election again against Bernie Sanders, just like last time, only even more obviously,"" Mr. Trump tweeted. That month, Trump aides also began to see Mr. Sanders as their ideal Democratic opponent in November and sought to elevate his profile.The president began singling out Mr. Sanders at his ""Keep America Great"" rallies as well as on Twitter. ""Bernie is going up,"" Mr. Trump said in January at a rally in Toledo, Ohio. ""He's surging. Crazy Bernie, he's surging."" He has also highlighted the senator's surges in the polls.Another target was Mr. Bloomberg, who spent millions of dollars on ads attacking Mr. Trump and had no compunction contrasting his wealth with the president's.On Tuesday, as polls opened in 14 states, the president tried a directive to voters in Texas and Oklahoma. ""Mini Mike Bloomberg will kill your drilling, fracking and pipelines,"" he tweeted. ""Petroleum based 'anything' is dead. Energy jobs gone. Don't vote for Mini Mike!""Mr. Bloomberg's withdrawal from the race on Wednesday may provide Mr. Trump with a small measure of comfort. But it also presents a looming challenge for his campaign, as Mr. Bloomberg has promised to spend $1 billion to help the Democratic nominee and immediately threw his support to Mr. Biden.Also a challenge is the surprise surge of a candidate with a genuine connection with African-American voters, the essential element to Mr. Biden's success on Super Tuesday.The Trump campaign has recently put money and time into trying to expand the president's popularity among black voters, employing tactics like opening storefronts in black neighborhoods and devoting a Super Bowl ad to overhauling the criminal justice system. Mr. Trump won only 8 percent of the black vote in 2016, but his campaign operatives thought that facing a candidate like Mr. Sanders, who had his own challenge winning over African-American voters, created an opportunity for Mr. Trump.But for months, Mr. Biden's son, Hunter Biden, and his work for Burisma, a problem-plagued energy company in Ukraine, have been the main concern of the president and his advisers. That effort was central to the impeachment inquiry into whether Mr. Trump tried to pressure Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens in exchange for releasing military aid.The damage to the president was obvious, but the former vice president's candidacy also suffered. His poll standing fell as he struggled to answer questions from reporters and voters about his son.But the revival of Mr. Biden illustrates the limits of Mr. Trump's influence.""I think Democratic primary voters are numbing to Trump's buffoonery -- black voters in particular,"" said Addisu Demissie, who managed Senator Cory Booker's presidential campaign. ""They are the ones who have breathed life back into Biden's campaign and, if anything, they may relish seeing Biden take him down.""The only real role that Mr. Trump appeared to play on Tuesday was to ensure that electability was a chief concern for Democratic voters and was the basis for Mr. Biden's support.""I would describe him as Sideshow Bob in this process,"" said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. ""There's no evidence that he's commanding a large army of voters who are affecting Democratic primaries.""Despite his lack of influence, Mr. Trump appeared eager on Wednesday to continue his kibbitzing-from-the-sidelines role. ""No question on the election?"" he asked reporters in the Roosevelt Room, where he met with airline executives about the coronavirus.The president smiled as White House aides quickly shuffled reporters out of the room.PhotographPresident Trump outside the White House on Tuesday.

| Jump to first hitHollywood stars are making their way to Iowa and South Carolina. Will they change anyone's mind?SUMTER, S.C. -- Bernice Harris was with her granddaughter Saturday afternoon when they heard a surprising rumor: Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was going to visit their city later that day, holding a rally at an African Methodist Episcopal Church.But when Ms. Harris arrived at the church, Mt. Pisgah A.M.E., it became clear that there had been a mistake. Mr. Sanders was not in Sumter, but in Iowa. The event was a question-and-answer session, attended by only about 50 people. And playing the role of septuagenarian keynote was Danny Glover, the activist and actor perhaps best known, at least by the Sumter crowd, for the ""Lethal Weapon"" films.""I thought Bernie Sanders would be here, and I wanted to hear him one-on-one,"" said a confused Ms. Harris, a 68-year-old caregiver.""But you know what,"" she said, looking on as Mr. Glover conducted a selfie line in front of a large campaign banner, ""he represented Bernie well.""As voting in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary inches closer by the day, candidates are increasingly sharing top billing with a wide array of stars, clearly aware that celebrities can often connect with audiences that the candidates themselves can't reach..In the last week, Judy Sheindlin, the retired family court judge better known as Judge Judy, opened for former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, joining him over the weekend as he stumped in Texas.Martin Sheen, the actor who played a fictional president on the television drama ""The West Wing,"" announced at a recent climate rally that he was supporting Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. On Monday, the singer and actress Mandy Moore campaigned for former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg in the vitally important caucus state of Iowa. And on Tuesday, the comedian and actor Dave Chappelle endorsed the entrepreneur Andrew Yang and announced he would perform two shows in South Carolina later this month to benefit Mr. Yang's campaign.Over the weekend, Mr. Glover toured rural communities in South Carolina on behalf of Mr. Sanders, pitching black voters in Hartsville, Dillon and Mullins on his vision of a political revolution.At times, he related to the audience, often made up of older black voters, in ways Mr. Sanders would find hard to replicate, referencing his upbringing in the A.M.E. church or his family's roots picking cotton in the South. With Mr. Glover speaking, Mr. Sanders's slogan of ""not me, us"" meant something different. It was targeted directly at black people.At the stop in Sumter, Mr. Glover told a crowd that Mr. Sanders was the 2020 embodiment of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s political ideology.""If Dr. King was with us today, at 90 years old last year, he would be voting for Bernie Sanders,"" Mr. Glover said.In a later interview, Mr. Glover questioned whether celebrities have extraordinary persuasive power.""I honestly don't know, but I don't abdicate my responsibility as a citizen because I make movies and people like to go to my movies,"" he said. ""And there are other people supporting him I know -- Mark Ruffalo, Susan Sarandon -- we can't wait to get together and campaign for Bernie.""The 2020 candidates are all seeking political and celebrity endorsements, and proudly announcing them when they land, but the value of big-name fans has not yet seemed to translate into broader support.Senator Kamala Harris of California, who had more endorsements from the Congressional Black Caucus than anyone in the Democratic field, was also a leading candidate on the Hollywood front. Mindy Kaling, the comedian and actress, put out a cooking video with Ms. Harris in November, just weeks before she dropped out of the race. Former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas had stars like Beyoncé and Frank Ocean in his corner during his 2018 challenge to Senator Ted Cruz. His presidential campaign lasted less than eight months.In South Carolina, voters attended Mr. Glover's stops for a variety of reasons. While there were some gawking fans, eager to see an actor whose career stretched back decades, the focus was undoubtedly political. Even in his introduction, Mr. Glover's political activism got more attention than his film work.Jannie Lathan, 69, attended the Hartsville event and said she viewed the event no differently than when any campaign comes to town: It was ""an opportunity to get informed."" Sue Catanch, 74, was direct: She was planning to vote for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and seeing Mr. Glover did nothing to change that.""Bernie Sanders isn't a Democrat. He's too liberal. And Joe Biden will beat Trump,"" Ms. Catanch said flatly. ""And Danny Glover did not really answer those questions.""She decided against a photo with Mr. Glover -- choosing instead to shake his hand -- because the pictures were being taken in front of a ""BERNIE 2020"" banner.Ms. Lathan said she understood the sentiment, and this election was too important to get caught up anything but the issues.""We're not about to fall for the okie-doke,"" she said. ""This is not about a popularity contest.""An endorsement, more than anything, can send a signal. If high-impact ones from elected officials come with the added political benefit of volunteers or increased fund-raising, the best celebrity endorsements pull cultural weight. Campaigns package them for larger resonance, hoping for a viral online moment or an opportunity to drive more grass-roots donations.When Ms. Warren earned the endorsement of the soccer star Megan Rapinoe, it came as the candidate was emerging as the only woman in the race's top tier. In a phone call between the two, a video of which has nearly 2 million views on Ms. Rapinoe's Twitter account, they discuss gender equity and allude to the ongoing fight for increased wages for the national women's soccer team.Critics say that because celebrities in music and film are overwhelmingly liberal, their endorsements create a bubble effect, in which the chattering cultural class is out of step with the electorate at large.President Trump, who spent years as a pop culture icon himself, was mostly shunned by the Hollywood class during his 2016 run. He won anyway.In the Democratic primary, Mr. Biden has opted for political and celebrity surrogates whose names largely reflect an earlier era, including John Kerry, the former Democratic nominee, and the Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan. He remains the primary's front-runner.But Mr. Sanders, in particular, continues to hold a unique cultural footprint, and the celebrity endorsements to match it. He is helped by sky-high name recognition, off the back of his insurgent presidential run in 2016. His support among young voters and progressives also plays out in the Hollywood sphere -- he tweeted photos with the singer Ariana Grande, 26, and released an endorsement video with Emily Ratajkowski, 28, an actress and model.Cardi B, 27, the Bronx-born rapper, interviewed Mr. Sanders in a video released this summer.""Don't you ever feel, like, scared that these people that run drug companies and schools, you know it's all a business, and it's like, are you scared that you will get so many powerful people upset?"" she asked.""Cardi, that's what I've been doing my whole life,"" Mr. Sanders replied.In South Carolina, Mary Williams said she had heard Mr. Sanders was popular with young voters. But she added that celebrities, and even black celebrities, would not be able to convince her to blindly back a particular candidate.""Of course it's nice to see and meet him,"" Ms. Williams, a 75-year-old retired educator from Sumter, said of Mr. Glover. ""But hey -- I'm a star myself.""PhotographFrom top: the actor Danny Glover greeting voters this past weekend at a church in Hartsville, S.C., where he campaigned for Senator Bernie Sanders; Judge Judith Sheindlin, the television star, at an event for Michael R. Bloomberg this past weekend; and the actress and singer Mandy Moore taking the stage in support of Pete Buttigieg at a Monday rally.

| Jump to first hitPrimary season is about to begin -- and there are still so many Democratic candidates in the race. Unsure who matches with some of your views and priorities? To make it a little easier, we stacked up the eight most viable contenders and tried to determine how they would respond to a mix of questions. Take our handy quiz and see which candidate could be your match. For each question, check the box if you agree. SYDNEY EMBER and LAZARO GAMIOSo, Whom Should You Choose?Joseph R. Biden Jr.The last few years may have had you pining for President Obama -- and what better way to restore his agenda and approach to governing to the White House than to elect his vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr.? Mr. Biden, 77, has touted his experience, particularly in the realm of foreign policy, and pledged to try to work with Republicans to pass a bipartisan agenda that is less revolutionary than palatable.Mr. Biden embraces fixes to the health care system and the addition of a public option rather than a full-scale overhaul. He has also proposed tuition-free community college for up to two years, but does not support tuition-free four-year public colleges.Mr. Biden offers a reset of sorts, but some of his detractors fault him for refusing to offer anything bigger. That's O.K. with you, though -- let's all just make an effort to get along again so we can stop worrying that American policy, foreign and domestic, is being conducted by tweet. In a ""battle for the soul of America,"" who wouldn't prefer Middle Class Joe as their commander in chief?Michael R. BloombergYou like big bucks, and you cannot lie! A latecomer to the Democratic primary campaign, Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, offers bottomless resources in his effort to win the Democratic nomination and retake the White House. And who better to go toe to toe with President Trump than a New York billionaire?A Democrat-turned-Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat, Mr. Bloomberg is defined less by ideology than many of his rivals are. He advocates core liberal causes, including gun control and battling climate change, but he is also a businessman who favors pragmatism. At 77, he is one of the oldest candidates in the race.Mr. Bloomberg is self-funding his campaign and is not accepting campaign contributions. His strategy for winning the primary includes bypassing the first four early nominating states and spending tens of millions of dollars on advertising in Super Tuesday states.Pete ButtigiegPete Buttigieg says he wants you to imagine the first day the sun comes up and Mr. Trump is no longer the president of the United States. Can you see it? Do you want change -- but maybe not too much change? Then Mr. Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Ind., is your kind of candidate. With his emphasis on American values, patriotism and unity, Mr. Buttigieg is running a campaign that is more thematic than heavy on policy details.But in this divisive age, his Midwestern centrism, intelligence and plain-spokenness -- not to mention the military experience -- may have convinced you that he just might be able to mend some of the country's ills. He was one of the first candidates to declare himself open to expanding the size of the Supreme Court. If elected, Mr. Buttigieg would be the youngest and first openly gay president.Amy KlobucharAmy Klobuchar has pitched herself as a Midwestern moderate, with the experience and record of electability that give her an advantage against Mr. Trump. For Democrats who worry the party is tacking too far left, Ms. Klobuchar is a viable, plain-spoken alternative to Joseph R. Biden Jr., Pete Buttigieg and Michael R. Bloomberg.A three-term senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar, 59, has built her campaign on the argument that she can win in a battleground region. She often touts her legislative record in the Senate and her ability to reach across the aisle to get things done. She is vocally opposed to some of the most-discussed liberal policy ideas, including tuition-free public colleges and ""Medicare for all."" If you care more about fixing the country's crumbling infrastructure than fighting over liberal purity tests, to say nothing of electing the first female president, then Ms. Klobuchar may be right for you.Bernie SandersWith an anti-establishment message that has remained largely unchanged for five decades, Bernie Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, wants nothing less than a political revolution -- and you probably do, too! A democratic socialist, Mr. Sanders, 78, is the lion of the liberal left and a champion of the working class, pushing for agenda items that have now become standard in the Democratic Party: raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, making public colleges tuition-free and eliminating the influence of big money in politics. His signature issue, ""Medicare for all,"" is a total reimagining of the health care system in America.You probably already know Mr. Sanders, who has inspired an intensely loyal fan base, but he can be a polarizing figure. Some voters still resent his run in 2016 against Hillary Clinton and blame the division his campaign helped sow for the election of Mr. Trump. But for those who support Mr. Sanders, he can do no wrong: He is authentic and honest and the only candidate who can excite enough voters to defeat Mr. Trump in November. If he wins, he would be the oldest president ever elected.Tom SteyerTom Steyer is a billionaire former hedge fund investor and impeachment crusader who casts himself as a populist outsider with pockets deep enough to defeat Mr. Trump. Effectively his own super PAC, he has promised to spend at least $100 million of his personal fortune on his presidential bid and has already spent millions on television advertising -- which may be how you got to know him. Mr. Steyer has called for decriminalizing border crossing and expanding the Supreme Court. He has embraced a wealth tax and has called for emergency action to address climate change.Unlike Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Steyer, 62, is not running as a moderate. So if you are a progressive who is open to nominating a rich businessman who can challenge Mr. Trump on economic matters, you might consider Mr. Steyer.Elizabeth WarrenOne thing is clear: You agree with Elizabeth Warren that it's time for ""big, structural change."" With her plan for (almost) everything, and her goal of maneuvering within the system to tilt power toward working people and away from corporations and the moneyed elite, Ms. Warren, 70, the senator from Massachusetts, wants wholesale change in a way that may be less alienating than the all-out ""political revolution"" of Bernie Sanders. She has embraced ""Medicare for all,"" a wealth tax and tuition-free public colleges.One of Ms. Warren's favorite words is ""fight,"" and she is ready for one. But she has struggled to assure voters that she can and would defeat Mr. Trump, which has given some Democrats pause. That doesn't bother you so much -- you're ready to elect the first female president.Andrew YangAndrew Yang is an entrepreneur and former tech executive with zero political experience, but that may make him perfect for you. An outsider who has taken on unusual political topics such as robots, Mr. Yang, 45, is known for proposing that the federal government give each American adult a monthly check for $1,000, regardless of income or employment status. He calls these payments the Freedom Dividend. A big part of his message is also warning against the perils of automation.Though he began his campaign in relative obscurity, he has taken off -- thanks in part to Twitter -- and is now raising money to rival many of his better-known opponents. Should he be elected, he would be the first Asian-American president.If you like Mr. Yang, there's a chance you liked Bernie Sanders in 2016. Like Mr. Sanders, Mr. Yang is running as an insurgent with a loyal following of supporters who are sick of Washington, and there is overlap between their supporters. Sound like you? Then put on your MATH hat and get ready to join the ""Yang Gang.""PhotographWord count: 1345Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitThe former vice president had the Super Tuesday of his dreams, winning in places he hasn't even set foot in recently.The scene, on its face, might not have been surprising a year ago: Joe Biden -- appraised among Democrats as a decent man and affable sidekick to the party's most popular figure -- racking up primary victories and having fun talking about it.""They don't call it Super Tuesday for nothing!"" he told supporters in Los Angeles, shouting through a list of states he had won amid a medley of fist-pumps and we-did-its.But a week ago, the result would have been something close to unthinkable.Lifted by a hasty unity among center-left Democrats disinclined toward political revolution, Mr. Biden has propelled himself in the span of three days from electoral failure to would-be juggernaut. He has demonstrated durable strength with African-Americans and emerged as the if-everyone-says-so vessel for tactical voters who think little of Senator Bernie Sanders and fear that his nomination would mean four more years of President Trump.Mr. Biden's performance included decisive early wins across the South, victory in delegate-rich Texas and triumphs in some places where he did not even campaign as Super Tuesday approached, like Minnesota and Massachusetts, home to Senator Elizabeth Warren. The dominant showing made clear that the primary has effectively narrowed to a two-man race with Mr. Sanders, as Michael R. Bloomberg's first brush with national voters yielded meager returns on a colossal financial investment.For all Mr. Biden's stumbles -- in Iowa, in New Hampshire, at debates, at his own events -- perhaps all voters needed was to hear him give a victory speech.That happened on Saturday, in South Carolina, where Mr. Biden seemed to temporarily erase every latent concern that had accumulated for nearly a year about his bid.Yet any suggestion that Mr. Biden is now a risk-free option would appear to contradict the available evidence.He is no safer with a microphone, no likelier to complete a thought without exaggeration or bewildering detour.He has not, as a 77-year-old man proudly set in his ways, acquired new powers of persuasion or management in the 72 hours since the first primary state victory of his three presidential campaigns.In fact, Mr. Biden has blundered this chance before -- the establishment front-runner; the last, best hope for moderates -- fumbling his initial 2020 advantages in a hail of disappointing fund-raising, feeble campaign organization and staggering underperformance.When it mattered most, though, the judgment came swiftly from Sanders-averse Democrats.All right, we'll take him.The consequence -- after a yearlong winnowing from a field that once included many women, nonwhite candidates and up-and-coming political talents -- is that Democrats are very likely to nominate one of two septuagenarian white men with conspicuous political baggage. Any safety in that choice is relative.""John Kerry, Al Gore and Hillary Clinton,"" said Rebecca Kirszner Katz, a veteran progressive strategist. ""All safe choices.""Voters wary of Mr. Sanders are probably right that supporting Mr. Biden is the tidiest way to keep the democratic socialist from the top of the ticket. They may yet be right that Mr. Biden would pose the strongest challenge to Mr. Trump. The former vice president is widely admired in the party for moving gracefully through tragedy and serving alongside Barack Obama.Certainly Mr. Trump would appear to have his preferences: Last year, he was impeached after trying to enlist a foreign power's help to damage Mr. Biden. In recent weeks, the president has tweeted mischievous praise of Mr. Sanders, seeming eager to elevate him as a prospective opponent.But what if Mr. Trump is wrong? What if every elected official hustling to endorse Mr. Biden, after long resisting, is wrong, too? Recent election history, especially Mr. Trump's, has been unkind to conventional wisdom.Only a couple of weeks ago, some Biden allies were talking quietly about how he could, at least, end his campaign with dignity: Hang on narrowly in South Carolina, hopefully, and bow out, statesmanlike, if Super Tuesday went sideways as many expected.That Mr. Biden's fortunes have changed says more about the context of this primary than the content of his campaign. Current and former competitors, including Ms. Warren, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar, all strained to connect with black and Latino voters. Mr. Bloomberg flailed on the debate stage as he stepped out from behind the reputational curtain of his ubiquitous advertisements. And many in the party have remained uncomfortable with the kind of unswerving progressivism that Mr. Sanders demands.The depth of this last concern with Mr. Sanders is uncertain. Entering Tuesday, his predictions of runaway progressive turnout to his cause, a central premise of his case for his own electability, had not necessarily come to pass.It is also quite possible, after all the Tuesday states are accounted for, that the delegate picture will look very competitive, particularly as full tallies from California roll in. Mr. Sanders remains popular across much of the party, even among many who did not consider him their first choice.If nothing else, a Biden-Sanders matchup is the logical venue for the party's foremost ideological debate about the proper scope and ambition of government -- about whether Mr. Trump is a symptom of longstanding national ills or an ""anomaly,"" as Mr. Biden has suggested, whose removal should be the party's chief animating priority.""Sanders has more confidence that the voters are ready for big change,"" said Barney Frank, the former Massachusetts congressman. ""Biden, particularly after the eight years with Obama, has more of a sense that more government can be a hard sell.""Mr. Frank said the race boiled down to this question: ""Is the electorate more afraid of government than they are of inequality?""The two contenders were products of the same era, shaped by very different forces within it. Mr. Sanders became a mission-driven lefty, enthralled by socialist and communist governments abroad and the fight for working people at home. Mr. Biden preferred a within-the-system approach, winning a Senate election at 29 and acknowledging some distance from the activist instincts of many contemporaries.""I wore sport coats,"" Mr. Biden told reporters once, explaining his limited involvement in antiwar zeal. ""I was not part of that.""That comment came as Mr. Biden sought the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Sanders ran for Congress that year. They both fell short. They both tried again.For more than two decades, they served in the same Washington, amassing voting records that have often dogged them since. Mr. Sanders has said he regrets his voting history on some gun legislation; Mr. Biden has faced consistent criticism, including from Mr. Sanders, for his vote authorizing the use of military force in Iraq, among other decisions.This paper trail convinced some 2020 strategists that both candidates would be vulnerable. Their own campaigns did not necessarily see it that way.""I always thought that this race would be between the clash of two titans, of Bernie and Biden,"" said Ro Khanna, a California congressman and Sanders campaign co-chair. ""It's odd that it wasn't the conventional wisdom.""Over the past year, alternative outcomes were easy to imagine. There were candidates of virtually every profile, including a half-dozen alone from Super Tuesday states, and a procession of fresh faces like Senator Kamala Harris and former Representative Beto O'Rourke who seemed primed to capitalize on voters' curiosity.Mr. Sanders was often dismissed as a factional candidate and 2016 retread even before he had a heart attack last fall.Mr. Biden was depicted as a lackluster contender out of step with the times.""You cannot go back to the end of the Obama administration and think that that's good enough,"" Mr. O'Rourke said last June, calling Mr. Biden a return to the past.""I just think Biden is declining,"" Tim Ryan, an Ohio congressman who was then running for president, said last September. ""I don't think he has the energy. You see it almost daily.""Both men have now endorsed Mr. Biden's campaign. Other fallen rivals, like Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, have done the same.Mr. Sanders has a theory about all that. ""There is a massive effort trying to stop Bernie Sanders. That's not a secret to anybody in this room,"" he told reporters on Monday. ""So why would I be surprised that establishment politicians are coming together?""Of course, politics is about options, and Democrats suddenly have very few, even as some remaining candidates suggest they are being overlooked.Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Bloomberg have effectively admitted that their only path to the nomination is a contested convention this summer. This has not stopped either from pressing on so far.In California on Monday, Ms. Warren said that ""no matter how many Washington insiders tell you"" to support Mr. Biden, ""nominating their fellow Washington insider will not meet this moment.""Mr. Bloomberg, growing weary on Tuesday of questions about whether his run was aiding Mr. Sanders, framed the issue in reverse: ""Why don't they coalesce around me?"" he asked of moderates during a stop in Florida.By evening's end, he seemed to have his answer. They had settled on someone else.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. lost three of four contests last month, but his fortunes were changed on Tuesday.

| Jump to first hitHe's been on the road in 2020 with a serious message about inequality in this country. That doesn't mean he hasn't found time to make fun of his age.The question was about age.It came at a January event in Dubuque, Iowa, when a woman asked Senator Bernie Sanders how she should respond if someone said he was too old to be in office.""Is experience important in a crazy world like today? Yeah, I think it's of some importance,"" he said flatly. He waited a beat for the crowd to get it. ""That's a joke!"" he exclaimed, when it was apparent few did. ""I think it's very important!""This happens a lot.Mr. Sanders has learned a few things on the campaign trail. He has learned how to attack President Trump by rattling off a series of unflattering descriptions. He has learned how to get people to talk about themselves by asking them to share their struggles with health care. He has also learned how to deliver a punchline.And as he has campaigned in the 2020 race, briefly as a front-runner, then as the only thing standing in the way of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s primary coronation, he has emerged as something very different from the publicly gruff, politically unchanging character he has always played: He has actually become a bit playful.""Welcome back to our show -- both Brooklyn kids -- I appreciate you coming back on the show,"" Jimmy Fallon told Mr. Sanders on his late-night show on Wednesday, a day after Mr. Sanders was dealt his latest series of Democratic primary losses. ""How are you feeling?""""Feeling good,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""Could feel better."" The audience loved it.With his candidacy now in jeopardy and the debate against Mr. Biden on Sunday something of his last stand, his comedic tendencies could be an asset as he considers his post-primary future. Mr. Biden will almost certainly need Mr. Sanders's assistance to build as formidable a coalition as possible for the general election. As other candidates have discovered, levity can be an extremely effective way to coalesce voters around a nominee, especially the young people who are a key part of Mr. Sanders's constituency.Mr. Sanders is still prone to impromptu jeremiads about the health care industry, and nothing makes him happier than discussing signature policy proposals like ""Medicare for All."" He spent much of his interview with Mr. Fallon on Wednesday night solemnly repeating points from his familiar stump speech, and he is not exactly lauded for his laugh lines.""Bernie has no social skills, no sense of humor, and he's quick to boil over,"" Chris Graff, a former Vermont journalist who covered Mr. Sanders for decades, said in 2015.Mr. Sanders has displayed some flashes of humor throughout his political career, including his 2020 campaign. But for many years, he has largely inspired jokes, not delivered them. Sometimes, he was in on them. In 2016, he joined Larry David, who played the Vermont senator on ""Saturday Night Live"" in a live sketch.Keen Sanders watchers point to his heart attack in early October as a pivot point for his comedic inclinations.He deadpanned in Iowa that politics was not a beauty contest, ""which obviously I would win.""He joked on Showtime's ""Desus & Mero"" that he needed to improve his vertical jump -- I can barely get off the ground now! -- and expressed exaggerated dismay at the price of a $1,500 sneaker.He quipped in Ohio about certain medicinal herbs.""Senator Sanders is in favor of medical marijuana,"" Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said at the Democratic debate in October.""I do,"" Mr. Sanders responded. ""I'm not on it tonight.""In fact, it was part of his and his campaign's communications strategy at the time to put him in situations that would showcase the more amusing side of Mr. Sanders, according to his top spokesman, Mike Casca. It produced a video, ""Bernie Uncensored,"" that featured lighter clips of him from over the years. It allowed Mr. Fallon to do a sketch with him in November where they both slow jammed the news. During the walk-through before the show, Mr. Sanders wondered aloud why he couldn't just be interviewed.The strategy coincided with his rise in the polls, and it tapered off only because of the time constraints imposed by the impeachment trial, Mr. Casca said.Aides say Mr. Sanders's witticisms are usually off-the-cuff. But he also sometimes workshops his one-liners on the trail. Many are about his age, which seem to land particularly well with his young fans.""I've been criticized for being old,"" he said several times at events post-heart attack. ""I plead guilty. I am old.""Some, however, do not land.During the Democratic debate in December, a moderator noted recent remarks by former President Barack Obama, who said that the world's problems were usually because of ""old people, usually old men, not getting out of the way.""""Senator Sanders, you are the oldest candidate onstage this evening,"" the moderator began.""And I'm white, as well!"" Mr. Sanders broke in. Silence.Indeed, his is a comedic style that is dry and quick, a product of Brooklyn in the 1940s that often requires his Brooklyn baritone and his waving armsfor intended effect. He frequently deploys his one-liners with such a straight face, with such characteristic crustiness, that it takes a while for his audience to catch on. He rarely chuckles at his own attempts, though he sometimes can't resist a grin.At the debate last month in Nevada, for instance, a moderator asked him the results of a poll that said voters were uncomfortable with a socialist president.""What was the result of that poll? Who was winning?"" Mr. Sanders said, wooden-faced. (He was.)He recently prodded a reluctant audience in Iowa to participate in an informal question-and-answer session.""I know it's not easy for people to stand up in front of the TV cameras,"" he said, motioning to reporters in the back. ""Just ignore them. I ignore them all the time!""""I love Bernie's smile, but honestly the best is when he says something with his dry delivery and a straight face, which leaves the rest of us laughing,"" said Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager. ""Because, the truth is, the jokes are for us -- not him.""But what is for Mr. Sanders and what is for everyone else? That question has been a central theme of the campaign and Mr. Shakir's statement was itself a bit of a jest befitting the candidate: Mr. Sanders insists his campaign slogan is ""Us. Not me."" In fact, the slogan -- as it is written on signs and blared in lights around arenas at his rallies -- is ""Not me. Us.""His humor has also not gone unnoticed by his press corps. Ryan Nobles, a correspondent at CNN, has referred to Mr. Sanders's post-heart attack looseness as his ""stents of humor."" (He'd spent a lot of long days on the road with Mr. Sanders and probably had time to workshop his own jokes.)Reviews of his humor vary.""It shouldn't be a surprise that such an enraged, indignant, grouchy old man is hilarious,"" said the comedian Helen Hong. ""Most professional comics are pretty dark and surly in real life.""Ms. Hong, who has supported Mr. Sanders since 2015, also compared him favorably to Mr. David, describing their similarities as ""uncanny.""""If he wasn't so enraged about the state of the country and chose to make jokes more often, I think he would be unstoppably funny,"" she said.Others note he is funny, but only for a politician. One comedian was reluctant to give him even that.""Admittedly, I have a high bar for comedy, but he hasn't made me laugh once. Am I missing something?"" said Orny Adams, a stand-up comic who appeared with Jerry Seinfeld in the documentary ""Comedian.""In November, as part of his team's funny-Bernie strategy, Mr. Sanders sat down with the comedian James Adomian, one of his imitators. They discussed his message but also his propensity to wave his hands around when he speaks -- ""It's part of my exercise regimen,"" Mr. Sanders said, wryly -- and his fondness for rumpled suits.""If people started laughing more, we could probably address the climate change crisis, low wages, criminal justices -- I like that,"" Mr. Sanders said.It was hard at times to tell who the real comedian was.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders appearing on ""The Tonight Show"" with Jimmy Fallon last week.

| Jump to first hitWhen it comes to the Democratic presidential primary candidates, President Trump is worried about Mike Bloomberg while his campaign sees an opportunity in Bernie Sanders.
President Trump’s advisers see Senator Bernie Sanders as their ideal Democratic opponent in November and have been doing what they can to elevate his profile and bolster his chances of winning the Iowa caucuses, according to Republicans familiar with the plans.
But their new focus on Mr. Sanders, independent of Vermont, comes at a time the president himself has been closely watching Michael R. Bloomberg, a late arrival to the Democratic primary race, unnerved by his campaign spending and his suggestion he might spend $1 billion of his own fortune on opposing Mr. Trump, even if he does not emerge as the nominee.
It has left the president and his campaign focused on two different candidates in the weeks before Democrats cast their first votes in Iowa — one, a populist running with a grass-roots movement behind him, and the other, a liberal billionaire who could refashion the general election because of his bottomless bank account.
Neither is the national front-runner, but Mr. Sanders is believed to have gained significant ground in Iowa, and both are on the minds of the president and his team.
Most of Mr. Trump’s advisers see his biggest looming threat as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has maintained a steady level of support despite an onslaught of attacks from the president and his team. But there is often a divide between how Mr. Trump and his aides view opponents.
Over the past few weeks, aides to the president in a series of conversations have discussed how to keep the focus on Mr. Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist who favors a significant expansion of government health programs and who is currently at the top of some Iowa polls. They see attacking him as a way to excite his base and draw attention away from other Democrats.
Such efforts tend to be haphazard and revolve around Mr. Trump’s comments at rallies and on his Twitter feed, as does much of the messaging of his campaign. The president, his advisers say, has been in need of a clear target for months, and he believes he is actually hurting Mr. Sanders.
Mr. Trump’s advisers do not necessarily share that view. But they find utility in trying to elevate Mr. Sanders, and aides are discussing ways to keep attention on Mr. Sanders in the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3.
“Wow! Crazy Bernie Sanders is surging in the polls, looking very good against his opponents in the Do Nothing Party,” Mr. Trump posted Sunday on Twitter, after a Des Moines Register poll showed Mr. Sanders leading in the state. “So what does this all mean? Stay tuned!”
“It means you’re going to lose,” Mr. Sanders tweeted in response.
At a rally last week in Toledo, Ohio, the president singled out Mr. Sanders for his criticism of Mr. Trump’s Jan. 3 drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani at Baghdad International Airport.
“Bernie is going up,” Mr. Trump said. “He’s surging. Crazy Bernie is surging.”
Most of the president’s advisers see Mr. Sanders, if he were to become the nominee, as helping to solve Mr. Trump’s problem with suburban voters in states like Virginia, where the 2018 midterm elections showed that moderate and independent voters have recoiled from the president’s behavior, controversies or policy positions.
But some have concerns that Mr. Sanders might be more durable in the Rust Belt states, like Michigan and Wisconsin, with high concentrations of white working-class voters that emerged as trouble spots for the president in the 2018 elections.
The advisers say that in their voter research Mr. Sanders registers with his own supporters as authentic — the same quality that Mr. Trump’s base ascribed to the president in 2016. They view Mr. Sanders as a more difficult opponent than Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, but less of a challenge than Mr. Biden.
And Mr. Trump’s advisers are discussing rolling out policies to counter Mr. Sanders’s populist appeal.
In recent days, Mr. Trump’s team has been interested in focusing attention on Mr. Sanders’s comments after the strike that killed General Suleimani, arguing that he will appear too dovish for the general electorate.
“We have no preference in potential opponents because President Trump will beat any one of them handily,” Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, said in a statement. “However, over the last two weeks Bernie Sanders has proved himself to be dangerous — not as an opponent but as a potential president — by excusing and appeasing Iran’s aggression and belligerence.”
“Bernie Sanders would not protect American interests as president and his weakness is something that begs to be highlighted,” he added.
Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, pointed out that Mr. Trump ran as the candidate who “would stop the endless wars” and is now attacking the senator as weak. He added of Mr. Trump’s efforts to tar Mr. Sanders: “There’s no ‘there’ there.”
As for Mr. Bloomberg, the president has made clear he is aware of the money Mr. Bloomberg, a former New York mayor, is pouring into the race — especially into the attack ads hitting him in 118 media markets across the country. And this week he responded on Twitter to a TV spot focused on the top issue for Democrats in the 2018 midterms: health care.
“Mini Mike Bloomberg is spending a lot of money on False Advertising,” Mr. Trump tweeted, going on to misrepresent his role in the health care debate. “I was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your Healthcare, you have it now, while at the same time winning the fight to rid you of the expensive, unfair and very unpopular Individual Mandate.”
Bloomberg aides noted that the ads highlight a core weakness for Mr. Trump, one that he seemed cognizant of defending himself over.
“My view from watching the president’s tweets is that he is clearly seeing our ads, he’s clearly concerned about their impact,” said Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Mr. Bloomberg. “It’s a massive television buy that is nationwide, attacking his biggest vulnerability and contrasting his failed record on health care.”
Mr. Bloomberg spent over $100 million in 2018 through his super PAC, involving himself in two dozen races across the country, and that has made him and his team confident they have identified his weaknesses.
“We amassed an enormous amount of data about what works in terms of identifying targeting the president’s vulnerabilities,” Mr. Wolfson said.
But the Trump campaign has waved away concerns about Mr. Bloomberg’s spending, arguing that it will only encourage Republican megadonors like Sheldon G. Adelson to spend more money for Mr. Trump.
Despite Mr. Trump’s own history of upending expectations of which candidates succeed, his aides insist they do not view Mr. Bloomberg as a serious contender for his party’s nomination, and they believe that the power of his money is limited, noting that Mr. Bloomberg’s aides would be legally prohibited from direct coordination with the Democratic nominee’s campaign, unlike the national party committees.
“Hillary Clinton said she ‘inherited nothing’ from the D.N.C., which is as broke today as it was when she lost,” said Mike Reed, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. “Growing a $300 million data-driven field operation like we have at the R.N.C. takes years. Liberal billionaires can spend as much outside money as they want, but the eventual nominee cannot coordinate with anything they build.”
Campaign finance experts, however, said the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee were underestimating the effect of Mr. Bloomberg’s cash infusion into the race and that Mr. Trump was right to be concerned.
“If Bloomberg does this, it will be unprecedented in American history,” said Fred Wertheimer, the founder and president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit watchdog group. “They will probably have more organizers than the R.N.C. will have. They will have loads of people in the battleground states, they’ll have TV ads, they’ll have digital ads.”
“It will neutralize any financial advantages he thought he had,” Mr. Wertheimer said, referring to the president, “and if they’re not worried, they’re kidding themselves.”
Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, agreed that Mr. Bloomberg should not be dismissed.
“By any traditional measure, it’s a pipe dream, but if we learned anything in 2016 it’s that just because something has never happened before doesn’t mean it can’t happen now,” he said. “No one has ever talked about spending remotely as much money as he’s talking about spending on this race.”

| Jump to first hitThe former vice president had the Super Tuesday of his dreams, winning in places he hasn’t even set foot in recently.
The scene, on its face, might not have been surprising a year ago: Joe Biden — appraised among Democrats as a decent man and affable sidekick to the party’s most popular figure — racking up primary victories and having fun talking about it.
“They don’t call it Super Tuesday for nothing!” he told supporters in Los Angeles, shouting through a list of states he had won amid a medley of fist-pumps and we-did-its.
But a week ago, the result would have been something close to unthinkable.
Lifted by a hasty unity among center-left Democrats disinclined toward political revolution, Mr. Biden has propelled himself in the span of three days from electoral failure to would-be juggernaut. He has demonstrated durable strength with African-Americans and emerged as the if-everyone-says-so vessel for tactical voters who think little of Senator Bernie Sanders and fear that his nomination would mean four more years of President Trump.
Mr. Biden’s performance included decisive early wins across the South, victory in delegate-rich Texas and triumphs in some places where he did not even campaign as Super Tuesday approached, like Minnesota and Massachusetts, home to Senator Elizabeth Warren. The dominant showing made clear that the primary has effectively narrowed to a two-man race with Mr. Sanders, as Michael R. Bloomberg’s first brush with national voters yielded meager returns on a colossal financial investment.
For all Mr. Biden’s stumbles — in Iowa, in New Hampshire, at debates, at his own events — perhaps all voters needed was to hear him give a victory speech.
That happened on Saturday, in South Carolina, where Mr. Biden seemed to temporarily erase every latent concern that had accumulated for nearly a year about his bid.
Yet any suggestion that Mr. Biden is now a risk-free option would appear to contradict the available evidence.
He is no safer with a microphone, no likelier to complete a thought without exaggeration or bewildering detour.
He has not, as a 77-year-old man proudly set in his ways, acquired new powers of persuasion or management in the 72 hours since the first primary state victory of his three presidential campaigns.
In fact, Mr. Biden has blundered this chance before — the establishment front-runner; the last, best hope for moderates — fumbling his initial 2020 advantages in a hail of disappointing fund-raising, feeble campaign organization and staggering underperformance.
When it mattered most, though, the judgment came swiftly from Sanders-averse Democrats.
All right, we’ll take him.
The consequence — after a yearlong winnowing from a field that once included many women, nonwhite candidates and up-and-coming political talents — is that Democrats are very likely to nominate one of two septuagenarian white men with conspicuous political baggage. Any safety in that choice is relative.
“John Kerry, Al Gore and Hillary Clinton,” said Rebecca Kirszner Katz, a veteran progressive strategist. “All safe choices.”
Voters wary of Mr. Sanders are probably right that supporting Mr. Biden is the tidiest way to keep the democratic socialist from the top of the ticket. They may yet be right that Mr. Biden would pose the strongest challenge to Mr. Trump. The former vice president is widely admired in the party for moving gracefully through tragedy and serving alongside Barack Obama.
Certainly Mr. Trump would appear to have his preferences: Last year, he was impeached after trying to enlist a foreign power’s help to damage Mr. Biden. In recent weeks, the president has tweeted mischievous praise of Mr. Sanders, seeming eager to elevate him as a prospective opponent.
But what if Mr. Trump is wrong? What if every elected official hustling to endorse Mr. Biden, after long resisting, is wrong, too? Recent election history, especially Mr. Trump’s, has been unkind to conventional wisdom.
Only a couple of weeks ago, some Biden allies were talking quietly about how he could, at least, end his campaign with dignity: Hang on narrowly in South Carolina, hopefully, and bow out, statesmanlike, if Super Tuesday went sideways as many expected.
That Mr. Biden’s fortunes have changed says more about the context of this primary than the content of his campaign. Current and former competitors, including Ms. Warren, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar, all strained to connect with black and Latino voters. Mr. Bloomberg flailed on the debate stage as he stepped out from behind the reputational curtain of his ubiquitous advertisements. And many in the party have remained uncomfortable with the kind of unswerving progressivism that Mr. Sanders demands.
The depth of this last concern with Mr. Sanders is uncertain. Entering Tuesday, his predictions of runaway progressive turnout to his cause, a central premise of his case for his own electability, had not necessarily come to pass.
It is also quite possible, after all the Tuesday states are accounted for, that the delegate picture will look very competitive, particularly as full tallies from California roll in. Mr. Sanders remains popular across much of the party, even among many who did not consider him their first choice.
If nothing else, a Biden-Sanders matchup is the logical venue for the party’s foremost ideological debate about the proper scope and ambition of government — about whether Mr. Trump is a symptom of longstanding national ills or an “anomaly,” as Mr. Biden has suggested, whose removal should be the party’s chief animating priority.
“Sanders has more confidence that the voters are ready for big change,” said Barney Frank, the former Massachusetts congressman. “Biden, particularly after the eight years with Obama, has more of a sense that more government can be a hard sell.”
Mr. Frank said the race boiled down to this question: “Is the electorate more afraid of government than they are of inequality?”
The two contenders were products of the same era, shaped by very different forces within it. Mr. Sanders became a mission-driven lefty, enthralled by socialist and communist governments abroad and the fight for working people at home. Mr. Biden preferred a within-the-system approach, winning a Senate election at 29 and acknowledging some distance from the activist instincts of many contemporaries.
“I wore sport coats,” Mr. Biden told reporters once, explaining his limited involvement in antiwar zeal. “I was not part of that.”
That comment came as Mr. Biden sought the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination. Mr. Sanders ran for Congress that year. They both fell short. They both tried again.
For more than two decades, they served in the same Washington, amassing voting records that have often dogged them since. Mr. Sanders has said he regrets his voting history on some gun legislation; Mr. Biden has faced consistent criticism, including from Mr. Sanders, for his vote authorizing the use of military force in Iraq, among other decisions.
This paper trail convinced some 2020 strategists that both candidates would be vulnerable. Their own campaigns did not necessarily see it that way.
“I always thought that this race would be between the clash of two titans, of Bernie and Biden,” said Ro Khanna, a California congressman and Sanders campaign co-chair. “It’s odd that it wasn’t the conventional wisdom.”
Over the past year, alternative outcomes were easy to imagine. There were candidates of virtually every profile, including a half-dozen alone from Super Tuesday states, and a procession of fresh faces like Senator Kamala Harris and former Representative Beto O’Rourke who seemed primed to capitalize on voters’ curiosity.
Mr. Sanders was often dismissed as a factional candidate and 2016 retread even before he had a heart attack last fall.
Mr. Biden was depicted as a lackluster contender out of step with the times.
“You cannot go back to the end of the Obama administration and think that that’s good enough,” Mr. O’Rourke said last June, calling Mr. Biden a return to the past.
“I just think Biden is declining,” Tim Ryan, an Ohio congressman who was then running for president, said last September. “I don’t think he has the energy. You see it almost daily.”
Both men have now endorsed Mr. Biden’s campaign. Other fallen rivals, like Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, have done the same.
Mr. Sanders has a theory about all that. “There is a massive effort trying to stop Bernie Sanders. That’s not a secret to anybody in this room,” he told reporters on Monday. “So why would I be surprised that establishment politicians are coming together?”
Of course, politics is about options, and Democrats suddenly have very few, even as some remaining candidates suggest they are being overlooked.
Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Bloomberg have effectively admitted that their only path to the nomination is a contested convention this summer. This has not stopped either from pressing on so far.
In California on Monday, Ms. Warren said that “no matter how many Washington insiders tell you” to support Mr. Biden, “nominating their fellow Washington insider will not meet this moment.”
Mr. Bloomberg, growing weary on Tuesday of questions about whether his run was aiding Mr. Sanders, framed the issue in reverse: “Why don’t they coalesce around me?” he asked of moderates during a stop in Florida.
By evening’s end, he seemed to have his answer. They had settled on someone else.

| Jump to first hitAs Bernie Sanders has seen his fortunes slide, he has cited a number of factors that portray him as an aggrieved outsider.ST. LOUIS -- To Senator Bernie Sanders, there is plenty of blame to go around when it comes to his recent reversal of fortune. For everyone but him and his campaign.The ""corporate media"" didn't pay attention to his agenda.The Democratic Party establishment aligned to block him from winning its presidential nomination.And the young voters he counted on to power his campaign didn't come through for him.""Let me tell you the bad news, to be honest with you, young people vote at much lower rates than older people,"" the Vermont senator told a St. Louis crowd of mostly young people Monday morning. ""All right? That is the facts. I hope all of the old people vote, that's great, but I want young people to vote at the same rates.""Political candidates are not generally given to self-criticism. And as Mr. Sanders has seen his fortunes slide after a 30-point South Carolina loss to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., followed by Mr. Biden's unexpected strength across Super Tuesday and victories in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi on Tuesday night, he has cited a number of factors that portray him as an aggrieved outsider.It comes at a time of particular weakness for Mr. Sanders. Through Tuesday's voting, his theory of the election has not proven true. The surge of new voters in the Democratic primaries has featured mostly older people, moderate suburbanites and African-Americans disinclined to support his campaign.As Democrats in six states voted Tuesday, Mr. Sanders, his team and his supporters have come up with explanations for his loss of momentum that deflect the responsibility onto others.So when Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar dropped out of the race and endorsed Mr. Biden, to the Sanders camp it wasn't because they'd won next to no support from black voters and run out of money, it was part of an establishment plot. And Senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris were simply joining the effort to block Mr. Sanders when they backed Mr. Biden this week.""If they thought that Joe Biden was the best choice, maybe they shouldn't have run,"" Rasheen Aldridge, a Missouri state representative who was a warm-up speaker for Mr. Sanders in St. Louis, said in an interview. ""Some of these candidates -- Kamala has been out for a long time, Booker has been out for a while. It's all very kind of fishy how things are working out.""The 2016 campaign established Mr. Sanders as the Democratic Party's foremost practitioner of grievance politics. Like Donald Trump in that year's Republican primary, Mr. Sanders tapped into populist anger to upend a major political party.Then, Mr. Sanders denounced Democratic National Committee debate rules he said favored Hillary Clinton's campaign and a superdelegate system he argued empowered party insiders over grass-roots voters. His vociferous, public complaints led the D.N.C. to enact substantive changes to the rules for caucus states and to strip first-ballot voting power from superdelegates at the party's convention.Now the Sanders campaign says the policies he's pitching as a democratic socialist -- ""Medicare for all,"" free public college tuition and other proposals -- represent an existential threat to powerful operators that have prompted an unusually coordinated effort to block his rise.""We face a unique uphill battle that other candidates don't because of the agenda that he stands for,"" a campaign spokesman, Mike Casca, said. ""Because of the agenda that he's putting forward, a lot of super wealthy forces are aligned against him.""Yet others close to the Sanders campaign say he didn't expect to find himself trailing Mr. Biden at this point in the race and is trying to save face with his most ardent supporters by blaming others. It's also not bad for fund-raising -- perhaps uniquely among the 2020 candidates, Mr. Sanders does just as well with online contributions after he loses states than when he wins.The ability to keep raising tons of money can allow Mr. Sanders to prolong his candidacy even if voters keep delivering a verdict more favorable to Mr. Biden.Mr. Sanders blamed his Super Tuesday performance in part on the ""venom"" of the ""corporate media."" Last month, his campaign manager said the liberal cable network MSNBC had been unfair to Mr. Sanders, while Mr. Sanders said supporters in California ""may find it impossible"" to vote for him because of the state's mail ballot rules.When he went on MSNBC to discuss the Super Tuesday results with Rachel Maddow, Mr. Sanders said that some polling shows he's beating Mr. Biden among African-Americans but attributed his weak showing among black voters to the fact that ""we're running against somebody who has touted his relationship with Barack Obama for eight years.""Even among those ideologically inclined to back Mr. Sanders, he has engendered little sympathy in recent days. Adam Jentleson, a close ally of Senator Elizabeth Warren's campaign -- who has not been shy about expressing his own grievances about perceived outside forces that limited her campaign -- said Mr. Sanders does himself little good in arguing others are responsible for his shortcomings.""Blame-shifting is pointless because nobody swoops in and hands you the nomination; you have to win it,"" Mr. Jentleson said. ""The nominee needs to be the leader of the whole party and Bernie's job was to convince people he could be that.""Though Mr. Sanders's campaign would love to get Ms. Warren's endorsement, he has not publicly made an issue of it, saying she deserves the time to make her own determination. Privately, aides have expressed irritation that she withheld her backing while Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar quickly rallied to Mr. Biden, and many of Mr. Sanders's supporters have publicly denounced her online.""Imagine if the progressives consolidated last night like the moderates consolidated, who would have won?"" Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota wrote on Twitter after Mr. Biden swept 10 of 14 Super Tuesday states. ""That's what we should be analyzing. I feel confident a united progressive front would have allowed for us to #BuildTogether and win MN and other states we narrowly lost.""Mr. Sanders on Monday declined to answer a question about when he had last spoken to Ms. Warren.Mr. Sanders also scoffed at the endorsement of Mr. Biden by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan -- whom Mr. Sanders backed in the 2018 general election after campaigning for her opponent in the primary.When Ms. Whitmer said Mr. Biden would be the party's best nominee, Mr. Sanders said: ""Well, that wasn't her thoughts when I came here to help her get elected, as a matter of fact.""Then on Sunday, Mr. Sanders said on ABC's ""This Week"" that Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar were forced out of the race by party leaders intent on blocking his rise.""One of the things I was kind of not surprised by was the power of the establishment to force Amy Klobuchar, who had worked so hard, Pete Buttigieg, who had really worked extremely hard as well, out of the race,"" he said, in a remark that managed to unite aides to Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, who spent months in deep political conflict with each other.""What was very clear from the media narrative and what the establishment wanted was to make sure that people coalesced around Biden and tried to defeat me,"" he added. ""So that's not surprising.""By Monday in St. Louis, that sentiment was evident among Sanders supporters in the audience.""I'm frustrated that a lot of the candidates in the field endorsed Biden,"" said Jen McCabe, an information technology saleswoman from Kirkwood, Mo. ""I think they gave into D.N.C. and super PAC pressure. We need to get that money out of the primary.""Mr. Sanders made his final pitch to Michigan voters on Fox News Monday night, hardly the go-to news source for Democratic primary voters. During a town hall event in Dearborn, Mich., he blamed the news media in general for negative coverage and cited a New York Times article he didn't like about a trip he made to the Soviet Union to launch a sister city program when he was mayor of Burlington, Vt. ""What we need from the media is honesty and respect,"" he said.Asked by a voter how he'd get a resistant Congress to enact his slate of progressive proposals, Mr. Sanders said people who believe he can't work with lawmakers to get things done are wrong.""There's a mythology going out around me that everybody hates me; we heard that from Secretary Clinton that I can't work with anybody,"" he said. ""It's just not accurate.""PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders during a rally in Ann Arbor, Mich., on Sunday. (PHOTOGRAPH BY Chang W.

| Jump to first hitWe have less than a month to go until the Iowa caucuses, and in the early states, the race is looking more like a traffic jam. The top four candidates -- Joseph R. Biden Jr., Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg -- are all closely matched in both Iowa and New Hampshire, according to the most recent polls. And all of them appear to have ample resources to wage a fierce campaign at least through the month of February.Looked at from one angle, that's encouraging news for Mr. Biden, who spent much of the summer and fall watching his numbers deteriorate in the early nominating states. Now, he has a realistic chance of a strong finish -- perhaps even victory -- in both Iowa and New Hampshire. In the next two states, Nevada and South Carolina, a pair of polls found him a clear leader. If he builds momentum throughout February, he could be a dominant front-runner by the time Super Tuesday rolls around in early March.But if that is a plausible outcome for Mr. Biden, so is the opposite: a disappointing slump in Iowa and New Hampshire, even a fourth-place finish in one or both, followed by a nomination fight against candidates like Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren or perhaps Michael R. Bloomberg, all of whom have spent more time building up their campaign machinery outside the early states. If the race turns into a state-by-state battle for delegates, Mr. Biden could end up at a financial and organizational disadvantage.Mr. Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar may also be at a disadvantage if the primary becomes a monthslong battle, because so far, they have focused their attention almost exclusively on the earliest states.But there is a cloud of uncertainty over the state of the race: We have still not seen new, high-quality national polling since before the holidays. The early-state polls have been sparse, too. It is also not too late for a plot twist: In Nevada and South Carolina, for instance, Fox News polls this week found Tom Steyer leaping suddenly into the double digits.Most of all, the race is unfolding under extraordinarily tumultuous circumstances, involving military conflict with Iran and the impeachment of President Trump. It is impossible to predict with real confidence how these events might shape the campaign.At the moment, however, those external forces seem to be consuming the political energy and media attention that a number of underdog candidates were hoping to use for their own purposes in these final weeks before voting begins. Candidates like Andrew Yang, Cory Booker and Tulsi Gabbard are now unlikely to qualify for next week's debate, depriving them of the last really good chance to earn a late surge of support. ALEXANDER BURNSBig Endorsements For Top CandidatesOn Monday morning, Julián Castro, the former housing secretary who recently ended his campaign, endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren and hit the trail with her shortly thereafter, joining her Tuesday night at a rally at Kings Theatre in Brooklyn. Mr. Castro ran a campaign centered on progressive ideas and cast Ms. Warren as the logical extension of his social-justice-driven message.Sunrise Movement, the politically influential collection of young climate activists, announced on Thursday that it was endorsing Senator Bernie Sanders. And Pete Buttigieg received an endorsement from Representative Anthony G. Brown of Maryland, the first black member of Congress to formally back him.And Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles, who himself mulled a presidential run, endorsed Mr. Biden. The endorsement may help boost Mr. Biden in delegaterich California, a state that Mr. Sanders is counting on and where former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York is spending significant resources.Focus on People With DisabilitiesOn Friday, Senator Amy Klobuchar became the latest candidate to release a plan for people with disabilities, an area that is getting more attention than usual. Her plan would, among other things, eliminate the subminimum wage, which lets companies pay some people with disabilities just cents an hour; increase Social Security disability payments; and expand home- and community-based services.For months, Democratic presidential candidates have been building on one another in this arena. Last week, Senator Elizabeth Warren released a sprawling plan that touched on health care, education, employment and more, earning widespread praise from disability rights advocates.People with disabilities make up a quarter of the country's adult population. And increasingly, they say, candidates have been listening to their concerns and asking for their help crafting policyWilliamson Ends Her CampaignMarianne Williamson, the selfhelp author and spiritual adviser who started a thousand memes, announced on Friday that she would drop out of the race, saying she did not want to ""get in the way"" of progressive candidates competing in close contests.""I stayed in the race to take advantage of every possible opportunity to share our message,"" Ms. Williamson said. ""With caucuses and primaries now about to begin, however, we will not be able to garner enough votes in the election to elevate our conversation any more than it is now.""Ms. Williamson built her campaign around an eclectic mix of progressive policies and lofty pronouncements, calling for reparations and a Department of Peace. She also drew substantial criticism for calling vaccine mandates ""Orwellian"" and for suggesting that antidepressants are dangerous.Democrats React to the Iran ConflictThe candidates presented unified opposition to war with Iran, laying the blame for the Middle East crisis at the feet of President Trump.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. faulted the president for bringing the nation ""dangerously close"" to war after an American drone strike that killed one of Iran's top military commanders, Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. Senator Elizabeth Warren said Mr. Trump had undertaken ""reckless actions"" that ""have made us far less safe."" Senator Bernie Sanders repeatedly warned that ""war should be avoided in every way that we can."" And former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., a military veteran, emphasized his personal experience in a war zone.Polls Show Gains by SteyerFriday was the deadline to qualify for next week's debate, and two polls released the day before helped the billionaire former hedge fund executive Tom Steyer slide in at the last minute.Mr. Steyer had never before exceeded 5 percent in a debatequalifying poll, but on Thursday, Fox News released polls of voters in Nevada and South Carolina, both states where he has advertised heavily, that found him at 12 percent and 15 percent.That means the debate stage in Iowa will include six candidates: Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, and Pete Buttigieg and Mr. SteyerThe entrepreneur Andrew Yang is the only candidate who qualified for last month's debate but not this month's.Policy News From the TrailSenator Elizabeth Warren announced a plan to make it easier for families to file for bankruptcy and increase accountability for creditors. The plan would roll back provisions in a 2005 bankruptcy law -- a law supported by Mr. Biden.Pete Buttigieg released an infrastructure plan in which he called for the creation of six million jobs with strong labor protections and said he would commit $10 billion to attract and train an infrastructure work force.Michael R. Bloomberg outlined how he would support small businesses and entrepreneurs and released a plan on job creation. The latter plan suggests many of the remedies proposed by his rivals: increasing the minimum wage to $15, guaranteeing workers' right to unionize and expanding rural broadband access.Tom Steyer unveiled an immigration plan that would create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, reinstate the DACA program by executive action, end Mr. Trump's family separation policy and end the use of private detention centers.PhotographElizabeth Warren embracing Julián Castro during her rally Tuesday at Kings Theatre in Brooklyn.

| Jump to first hitThe group, the Democratic Majority for Israel, will begin airing a negative campaign spot on Wednesday, as worries mount among moderate Democrats that Mr. Sanders could win the Iowa caucuses.DES MOINES -- A Democratic super PAC will begin airing attack ads in Iowa against Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Wednesday, marking the first time a Democratic organization has run a negative campaign spot targeting Mr. Sanders by name in either of his two primary campaigns.The ad, backed by Democratic Majority for Israel's political action arm, comes as concerns among moderate Democrats mount that Mr. Sanders could win Iowa, setting the avowed democratic socialist on a possible path to the nomination. With Mr. Sanders leading in some polls ahead of the Feb. 3 caucuses, the spot is the first sign of a still-disjointed effort to stop his rise by the moderate wing of the party.It also signals a new line of attack against Mr. Sanders. For much of the Democratic nomination race, his rivals have focused on his policy positions, arguing that his proposals for ""Medicare for all"" and free public college are too expensive and unfeasible.While Democratic Majority for Israel is focused on raising support for Israel within the party, its spot targets the dominant concern among many Democrats in Iowa and elsewhere: beating President Trump.Featuring six Iowa voters, the ad argues that Mr. Sanders would be unable to defeat Mr. Trump in the November general election, citing the senator's heart attack last year and his left-wing ideology as evidence that he would be too risky a choice for primary caucusgoers focused on winning back the White House.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]""I like Bernie, I think he has great ideas, but in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Iowa, they're just not going to vote for a socialist,"" a male voter says. ""I just don't think Bernie can beat Trump.""Another voter adds: ""I do have some concerns about Bernie Sanders's health considering the fact that he did have a heart attack.""In recent weeks, some Democratic Party elected officials and strategists have grown increasingly anxious about the prospect that Mr. Sanders could capture the nomination. Many believe that they have a limited window to thwart any possible rise or streak of victories in the primaries, and that a wait-and-see approach -- such as taking action after the Super Tuesday contests in early March -- could end up being too late and too divisive for the party.While there are informal discussions in Democratic circles about starting an organized effort to stop Mr. Sanders, so far no group of donors or organizations has stepped up to helm a broader campaign. On Tuesday, Third Way, a centrist think tank, sent an email to several hundred of its supporters in Iowa, encouraging them to highlight positions taken by Mr. Sanders that the group argues ""will repel swing voters in battleground states.""Mark Mellman, the president of Democratic Majority for Israel and a longtime Democratic pollster, said his group began developing an ad several weeks ago, as Mr. Sanders rebounded from a slide in the polls last fall. The group did not work in conjunction with any other organization.The concerns about Mr. Sanders are two-pronged. The group and its allies worry that his questioning of the Democratic Party's longstanding support for Israel could damage the United States' historically strong relationship with the country.If elected, Mr. Sanders would be the first Jewish president. Mr. Sanders, who doesn't often speak about his Jewish upbringing, has called for an American policy toward Israel that addresses both Israeli security and a ""pro-Palestinian"" perspective. He spent time working on a kibbutz in Israel as a young man and opposes the movement, supported by some liberals, to boycott, divest from and sanction the country.Mr. Mellman said his organization was equally concerned about the ability of the liberal septuagenarian to beat Mr. Trump, saying Mr. Sanders was in a ""uniquely bad position"" to win a general election.""For many months people were saying he really didn't have much of a chance, but you have to look at the data now and say he does have a realistic chance of winning Iowa and potentially the nomination,"" he said. ""This is the point at which there could be room for someone else to make their case and have a better candidate emerge.""On Tuesday evening, Mr. Sanders tweeted out a video in which he addressed the ads. ""It is no secret that our campaign is taking on the political establishment and the big-money interests, who are now running negative ads against us in Iowa,"" he says. ""The billionaire class is getting nervous, and they should.""Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, sent an email to supporters on Tuesday warning them that Mr. Sanders was being targeted with the ads.The email alluded to an ""outside spending group"" but did not name Democratic Majority for Israel by name. It also said the campaign was aware that a super PAC for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had placed $1 million worth of ads in Iowa this week as well.""We have a small lead in Iowa heading into Monday's caucus,"" Mr. Shakir wrote. ""But outside groups are on the attack and hoping to stop us. Bernie needs us all if we're going to fight back and win.""Past attacks have boomeranged to Mr. Sanders's advantage. When Hillary Clinton ripped into Mr. Sanders in an interview published last week, her comments led to a rallying of support for his candidacy online.The group made its ad reservations on Monday, booking more than $680,000 to air only in Iowa starting on Wednesday morning and running just through the caucuses, a significant level of saturation over a short span just before the nominating contest. The buy is heavily weighted toward Cedar Rapids and Des Moines markets, and the group is also airing the ad on cable, including on CNN, MSNBC and ESPN.News that the group had made reservations was swirling around Democratic circles on Tuesday morning, and the Sanders campaign sent a fund-raising text message to supporters warning that ""an outside group is starting a $700,000 NEGATIVE AD CAMPAIGN against Bernie."" The text asked for $2.70 to help push back.The ads follow a weekend in which Mr. Sanders faced an onslaught of attacks from Democratic rivals. Pete Buttigieg sent a fund-raising email warning his supporters that ""Bernie Sanders could be the nominee of our party,"" followed by another email casting doubt on his ability to defeat Mr. Trump. Michael R. Bloomberg, who is skipping the early states to focus on Super Tuesday and beyond, also took a jab at Mr. Sanders's political beliefs, saying that Mr. Bloomberg was the only Jewish candidate in the race who ""doesn't want to turn America into a kibbutz.""One reason for Mr. Sanders's surge in Iowa is the inability of moderates to coalesce behind one candidate. It is unlikely that the negative attacks on Mr. Sanders will unite moderates at this point. But it could spur them to caucus out of fear that not doing so could lead to a victory for Mr. Sanders, who benefits from a loyal and unwavering bloc of supporters.Any anti-Sanders effort, however, is also likely to galvanize his supporters, who often rush to his side at any sign of adversity.Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting from Des Moines.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders at a campaign rally in in Sioux City, Iowa, on Sunday.

| Jump to first hitMr. Sanders's enduring base shows the fissures along class lines in the Democratic Party, with those struggling most eager for his promises of change.PHOENIX -- ""This is a campaign of the working class, by the working class and for the working class!""Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont nearly shouted those words to a raucously supportive crowd here last week. The line received thunderous applause, as it always does.At campaign events over the past year, Mr. Sanders has spoken to tens of thousands of people who come to hear his message of political revolution -- who come to imagine a country with universal health care, no student debt and a $15 minimum wage. Almost every line he says onstage rises to a crescendo, inviting cheers of appreciation. With every promise and policy proposal, the crowd becomes a sea of waving blue and white signs with the ""Bernie"" logo.The Sanders campaign has exposed a class divide within the Democratic Party: His promises of a leg up are most alluring to those who need it, and most confounding to those who do not.Six more states go to the polls on Tuesday in what is now a head-to-head matchup in the Democratic presidential race between Mr. Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. The path for Mr. Sanders to retake a delegate lead is much narrower than it was a week ago, but no matter how the primaries turn out for Mr. Sanders, he has built a fierce following of voters who want and expect more from their party, from their government, from their country.That's how Audrey Yanos views Mr. Sanders and this political moment. Ms. Yanos, a 39-year-old medical administrator, has voted for the Democratic candidate in every presidential election in her adult life. But Ms. Yanos has misgivings: Those Democrats, she believes, have never done all that much to deliver the promise of the American dream. She has begun to feel that the country has betrayed people like her.Mr. Sanders, she says, is different. Ms. Yanos voted for him in 2016, and did so again last Tuesday in the Colorado primary, which he won easily over Mr. Biden.""We are struggling all the time, and what we have is not working,"" she said one evening last week during a brief break between dinner and her son's basketball practice. ""We're all scraping by, one disaster away from real catastrophe, and we need someone who understands that.""That sentiment -- that Mr. Sanders understands the catastrophe looming for so many people, and that so many other politicians do not -- is central to Sanders supporters, and crucial to understanding where these voters might turn if Mr. Sanders is not the nominee. If the Democratic Party wants to keep such voters engaged and committed to showing up in the fall, leaders will have to speak more directly to them and better address their needs.Many of his supporters know what it's like to struggle in one way or another. They need prescription drugs but can't afford them. They are buried under relentless student debt. They juggle jobs with caring for ailing parents or young children, or both. They want better lives, more stable lives, and need some help.When Mr. Sanders has asked people at his town halls to tell their stories -- often by prodding them to share their insurance premiums or deductibles -- their voices have sometimes shaken. Sometimes there are tears.Ms. Yanos was the first person in her family to attend college. She considers herself lucky because a scholarship paid for tuition and books, so she graduated with about $25,000 in debt, which she paid off last year. Financially, she is far better off than her parents were when she was a child. And yet she sees no evidence of a booming economy in her own life.""I look around and see so many other people barely holding on,"" Ms. Yanos said, choking back tears as her kids did their homework at the kitchen table. ""It's not that I think it will be all rainbows and sunshine if he's elected, things won't change overnight. But people younger than me, they are going to demand change in their lifetime.""Everything seemed to be clicking for Mr. Sanders before last week. He had finished at the top of the nominating contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, then dominated in Nevada. But on Super Tuesday, a surging Mr. Biden all but extinguished that momentum, winning 10 of 14 states with the support of many black working-class voters. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders are now heading into primaries in Michigan and other major Midwestern states that are favorable in many ways to the former vice president. But Mr. Sanders also enjoys plenty of support in these states, particularly from white working-class voters.In both of his bids for the White House, Mr. Sanders has shown that his populist message resonates in some corners, even as it repels much of the Democratic establishment, which has steadily lined up behind Mr. Biden. Rallies for Mr. Sanders often resemble rock concerts, drawing tens of thousands of people who come decked out in campaign gear, with T-shirts that proclaim ""Unidos con Bernie"" and signs that say ""Not me, Us.""Polling throughout the campaign has shown Mr. Sanders drawing some of his strongest support from voters with household incomes under $50,000; his numbers taper off as incomes rise. A month ago, when he was leading in the polls, people with household incomes of $50,000 and under supported Mr. Sanders twice as much as any other candidate. At that time, he commanded the support of most Democratic voters making $100,000 and under.Exit polls on Super Tuesday did not ask respondents directly about their income. But in the three states where he won and exit polls were conducted -- Colorado, Vermont and California -- Mr. Sanders performed five to eight percentage points better among those without a college degree than those with one. In Massachusetts and Minnesota, both states he had hoped to win but ended up losing decisively to Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders's numbers among college graduates lagged his showing among those without degrees by double digits.""Bernie is the only candidate I've ever felt a connection to, in a sense that he genuinely cares about the working class in a way that no other candidate has ever shown support to us,"" said Andrew Hilbert, 26, who came to see Mr. Sanders in Phoenix.Mr. Sanders's support this year has proved particularly enduring in the West, where many communities remain visibly scarred by the Great Recession. And his focus on the working class helps explain part of his appeal to Latino voters, who are disproportionately young and are more likely to come from a working-class background. Many such voters point to the illusion of an ""up by your bootstraps"" mentality and strongly believe that the only way to create a fair economy is to drastically change the way the current one works.""We've had decades of policies fail to meet our needs, and we've got to break that cycle,"" said Antonio Arellano, the executive director of Jolt, a group in Texas that focuses on turning out young Latino voters and that endorsed Mr. Sanders. ""What we're seeing for the first time ever is the courage to break from the past and radically build the future. Not taking us as a given entity, but as a constituency that is demanding something more.""Having spent her life in Orange County, California, Rita Xochitl Estrada, a 39-year-old fitness instructor and student at California State University, Fullerton, has seen countless examples of extreme wealth and extreme poverty. Ms. Estrada calls herself a ""romantic but pragmatic"" socialist, and said she was not all that optimistic that Mr. Sanders would win the primary, let alone the presidency. Her biggest hope, she said, is that he is ushering in a new era of politics with more of a focus on the poor.""If nobody pushes it, we will never get there, which is why we are still stuck the way we are,"" said Ms. Estrada, who came to the polls with her 21-year-old son, who also voted for Mr. Sanders. Like other Latino supporters of the Vermont senator, Ms. Estrada views herself as part of a movement that will live on regardless of his political fate, and that harks back to the Chicano movement of the 1960s and '70s. ""This is a country that wants the current class structure to stay in place, and it's really hard to fight against that.""Many working-class supporters point to Mr. Sanders's opposition to the Iraq war as the initial issue that drew them into his orbit. Having watched many friends sign up for the military as a path to the middle class only to come back with traumatic mental and physical injuries, they are deeply skeptical of American intervention overseas, as Mr. Sanders has been for his entire career.There are also voters who are drawn to Mr. Sanders's consistency in a chaotic, punishing world.Originally from El Salvador, Ruth Trujillo-Acosta, 59, and her husband, Gustavo Acosta, 61, are just trying to make things work. They worry about retiring, afraid that they have no savings. They worry that their children are not even thinking about college because it's too expensive. They both went to college as adults, but still have student loans to pay off.The two now live in Holyoke in western Massachusetts. She is a mental health clinician. He is an academic adviser at a community college. They consider themselves independents, but are unequivocal about supporting Mr. Sanders.""We really are paycheck to paycheck and this is the guy -- he really is going to be able to change that,"" she said as the couple waited for Mr. Sanders to begin a rally last month in Springfield, Mass.She was cleareyed that Mr. Sanders might not be able to carry out all of his policy proposals -- ""I don't think that he's going to create a complete revolution right away,"" she said -- but she said he at least provided hope, and it was worth giving him a shot.Their support of Mr. Sanders, she said, comes down to this: ""Our values are with this guy.""Sydney Ember reported from Phoenix, and Jennifer Medina reported from Denver. Giovanni Russonello contributed reporting from New York.PhotographAudrey Yanos, left, voted for Bernie Sanders in Colorado's primary.

| Jump to first hitEarlier on Monday, Bernie Sanders had denied making the remark in a private 2018 meeting with Elizabeth Warren, accusing her campaign staff of ""lying about what happened.""Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Monday night that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont told her in 2018 he did not think a woman could win the presidency. Ms. Warren's description of the comment, from a private one-on-one meeting, represents a remarkable salvo at her leading liberal rival in the 2020 race just three weeks before the Iowa caucuses.Mr. Sanders vehemently denied making the remark earlier on Monday and accused the Warren campaign staff of ""lying"" about it, in a statement intended to refute a news report by CNN that relied on anonymous sources. The New York Times and other outlets confirmed the CNN report on Monday afternoon, while the Warren campaign initially declined to comment.With the two Democrats set to face off Tuesday night in their next televised debate, they now find themselves in the most tense standoff of the Democratic nomination fight: Mr. Sanders insisting he did not make the explosive remark, which risks alienating many Democrats, and Ms. Warren saying on the record that he did make the comment.Ms. Warren, in a statement on Monday night, said that Mr. Sanders made the remark at a two-hour meeting in December 2018 where they discussed the 2020 election and ""our past work together and our shared goals,"" in particular defeating President Trump.""Among the topics that came up was what would happen if Democrats nominated a female candidate. I thought a woman could win; he disagreed,"" she said. ""I have no interest in discussing this private meeting any further because Bernie and I have far more in common than our differences on punditry."" She added that she and Mr. Sanders were ""friends and allies"" and said she believed they would continue to work together to beat Mr. Trump.Internally, the Sanders campaign was roiled by Ms. Warren's statement, which seemed to catch several staff members off guard.Her statement represents a startling break in the Warren-Sanders relationship, which has largely been cordial and mutually beneficial. The two are both leading candidates in Iowa, where they are fighting for a similar voter slice, and the back-and-forth will most likely animate not only Tuesday night's debate but the jockeying among the liberal groups and activists who are aligned behind either candidate.Ms. Warren's advisers insisted that she had no intention of making this private meeting a public spectacle. However, after Mr. Sanders's team forcefully denied the reports, some advisers said they believed she had no choice but to offer her account firsthand.Mr. Sanders, in his statement earlier on Monday, said it was ""ludicrous"" to think he would have made such a comment.""It's sad that, three weeks before the Iowa caucus and a year after that private conversation, staff who weren't in the room are lying about what happened,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""Do I believe a woman can win in 2020? Of course! After all, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by three million votes in 2016.""Mr. Sanders added that he had told Ms. Warren ""that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could.""The people familiar with the 2018 meeting, who were briefed on it shortly after it took place but were not authorized to speak publicly, said Mr. Sanders offered the comment while giving his assessment of the coming race. In relaying to Ms. Warren the challenges he thought her campaign would face, he said not only that President Trump would weaponize sexism, but also that such attacks would preclude a woman from being elected, according to the private accounts.Larry Cohen, a longtime friend and adviser to Mr. Sanders, had said earlier Monday that Mr. Sanders told him about the meeting after it happened and that he did not believe the report.""Everything I know about Bernie Sanders for 30 years tells me he would never speak like that, let alone to a woman he admires tremendously,"" Mr. Cohen said.Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, had called on Ms. Warren Monday afternoon to refute the accusation.""We need to hear from her directly,"" Mr. Shakir said, ""but I know what she would say -- that it is not true, that it is a lie.""The existence of the meeting has been public since shortly after it happened in December 2018. The New York Times reported shortly after the meeting took place that Ms. Warren had sought it ""as a courtesy,"" and that neither party had tried to gain the other's support or discourage the other from running. But the two senators were the only people in the room, and all reports of what was said had been secondhand.Asked last March whether Mr. Sanders had urged her not to run, Ms. Warren said, ""Bernie and I had a private dinner, and my view is that dinner stays private.""The full political impact of the controversy could hinge on what happens during Tuesday's debate in Des Moines. Up to this point, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have focused their attacks on more moderate rivals, a consequence of their friendship and a desire to not damage the party's left wing.However, tensions between the two campaigns -- and among their most fervent supporters -- have increased in recent days. One well-respected poll from The Des Moines Register and CNN placed Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren as the top two candidates in Iowa, with Mr. Sanders leading the pack.Beyond how the candidates grapple with the issue is the matter of how exactly it's perceived -- as a sexist gibe by a candidate whose 2016 campaign faced complaints from female staff members, an 11th-hour smear by a candidate who has lost ground or some combination of both.Over the weekend, Politico reported on a script distributed to volunteers for the Sanders campaign that suggested telling backers of Ms. Warren to support Mr. Sanders instead. ""The people who support her are highly educated, more affluent people who are going to show up and vote Democratic no matter what,"" the script said. ""She's bringing no new bases into the Democratic Party.""Responding to the leaked script, Ms. Warren said that Mr. Sanders had been ""sending his volunteers out to trash me.""She urged against repeating the ""factionalism"" seen among Democrats during the 2016 primary, in which Mr. Sanders faced off against Mrs. Clinton. ""We can't have a repeat of that,"" she said. ""Democrats need to unite our party and that means pulling in all parts of the Democratic coalition.""Mr. Sanders said that he had never personally attacked Ms. Warren, and that both campaigns had hundreds of employees, who ""sometimes say things that they shouldn't.""Late Monday, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, another Democratic presidential candidate, wrote on Twitter that she had also met with Mr. Sanders before announcing her bid.""We had a nice one-on-one conversation and I informed him that I would be running for president,"" she said. ""In that meeting, he showed me the greatest respect and encouragement, just as he always has.""Democracy for America, a prominent progressive group, expressed alarm on Monday at the growing tensions.""You both are progressive champs & our movement needs to see you working together to defeat your corporate Dem opponents -- not attack each other,"" the group tweeted. ""Progressives will win in 2020, but only if we don't let the corporate wing or Trump divide us.""Sydney Ember and Maggie Astor contributed reporting.PhotographSenators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, pictured during a Democratic debate, spoke privately in December 2018 before they each announced their campaigns for president.

| Jump to first hitBernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg are trying to woo older black voters with policy. Those policies may be why they're struggling to win their support.DANVILLE, Va. -- Ten minutes into a small community meeting between black farmers from Southern Virginia and regional campaign staff for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, an aide took the floor.He was the only white person to speak in a room of older black voters seated in an old beauty salon. He stood, delivering an off-the-cuff pitch for Ms. Warren's plan to help rural black America: proposals for new access to funding for black farmers, and to address discrimination in the United States Department of Agriculture. She understood the challenges black farmers faced, he said.But he was cut off midsentence, before he could finish his appeal for their support. Instead, the black farmers had a message for him, and for Ms. Warren's campaign. Plans and rhetoric are one thing, but to trust a candidate to deliver -- or the government at all -- is entirely another.In a community all too familiar with legal discrimination and unequal access to public services, believing in ""big, structural change,"" as Ms. Warren likes to call it, is a gamble.""No disrespect,"" called out Lauren Hudson, a 62-year-old hemp farmer, ""but there's a whole different avenue when we go for funding versus when a white family goes for funding.""Democratic candidates have come to understand that they need policies that target racial inequities, especially to win over black voters -- a vital force in the Democratic primary. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont says single-payer health insurance will close disparities like the higher infant mortality rate in black families. Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., released his Frederick Douglass Plan, which calls for overhauling the criminal justice system, health care equity, and education funding.In addition to her proposals for black farmers, Ms. Warren has aimed to design her health care and education plans so that they take corrective steps to address historical inequality.Still, even as the plans add up, black voters have largely not shown enthusiasm about these candidates, and the polling numbers have barely budged. According to a recent nationwide poll of black voters from The Washington Post and Ipsos, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. holds a significant edge, with the support of nearly 50 percent of respondents. Among black voters 65 and older, poll showed Mr. Biden ahead by 60 percentage points.Mr. Sanders had 20 percent support, driven largely by his popularity with black voters under 35 years old. Ms. Warren was third in The Post's poll, with 9 percent.Over the course of her campaign, at events geared toward black voters, Ms. Warren often cites policy proposals such as investment in historically black colleges and new housing in formerly redlined communities. Crowds generally respond positively.""I want a world where the color of your skin doesn't matter, you get the same opportunities,"" Ms. Warren said at an event over the weekend hosted with groups including the Iowa chapter of the N.A.A.C.P. ""We do not fix a system like this by pretending that race doesn't matter.""Mr. Sanders's progress with black voters has been a mixed bag; he is beloved among younger voters and viewed with some suspicion by older ones, who largely supported Hillary Clinton in 2016 and found his insurgent campaign to be harmful to her in the general election. Late last year, Mr. Sanders replaced his South Carolina state director, a sign of the campaign's desire to shift his strategy for winning over black voters.Mr. Biden's candidacy is helped by several factors, including his widespread name recognition, public proximity to former President Barack Obama, and close relationship with black community leaders dating to his years in the Senate.But in interviews with dozens of black voters in Virginia and South Carolina, another theme emerges: Mr. Biden is also ahead because his leading rivals have yet to wrestle with how their promises of structural change must overcome historical distrust of the government in black communities.Theodore Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who studies race and electoral politics, said black skepticism in government stretches back decades, citing Booker T. Washington and his late 19th century and early 20th century argument for black self-help, rather than a focus on systemic discrimination. Black voters are often described as ""moderates,"" but Mr. Johnson said the voting choices are more nuanced than straightforward ideological choices.Racism ""contributes to black people's lack of support for mass federal programs,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""There's a sense that, if you prefer federal programs, that can be an admission that you can't make it without white people or government.""In ""Medicare for all,"" free college and other signature progressive proposals, like the cancellation of student loan debt or housing equality, candidates are asking black voters to trust that government can correct the same systemic inequalities that government helped create. But there is often no plan to undo the cynicism that decades of governmental failure have created among older black voters in particular.""No matter who is in office, the government has not been our best friend,"" said Samuel Crisp, 73. He is part of the Piedmont Progressive Farmers Group, which focuses on egg production, and attended the Warren campaign event in Virginia.""They all have programs that work against us,"" he added. ""And they don't seem to understand that.""There is some precedent for selling older black voters on the promise for structural change. In 2004, the populist campaign of Senator John Edwards of North Carolina won the South Carolina Democratic primary contest. The Rev. Jesse Jackson's presidential campaigns in 1984 and 1988 succeeded in bringing a message of systemic upheaval to black voters -- winning 11 contests in 1988, including in Virginia and South Carolina. In an interview, Mr. Jackson urged the current crop of left-wing candidates like Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren to get better at working to relate to and understand black communities.""I earned the trust of the people. I worked with them on the ground. I wasn't just an election candidate. I served with them,"" Mr. Jackson said. ""I was at their restaurants. I played football. I stayed in their homes.""Mr. Jackson acknowledged that forming those connections is a different challenge for white candidates, who could risk appearing ""pretentious and not genuine,"" but he said he believed there were authentic and effective approaches.He said that his personal politics precluded him from voting for Mr. Biden in the Democratic primary, but that Mr. Biden was boxing out the progressive candidates among some vital black communities.""Bernie and Warren are on the right side of history -- Biden is a moderate and our needs are not moderate,"" Mr. Jackson added. ""You must build a coalition and you do it through new relationships.""In the farming meeting, the difficulty of the task was evident.Attendees mostly said they agreed with the substance of Ms. Warren's farming proposal, which had been updated after dozens of black farmers said her initial policy did not adequately address racial bias. They said that they personally liked Ms. Warren. But they did not support her.The reluctance to back her candidacy stemmed from forces that predate 2020 or modern politics itself: a general belief that big change promised by elected officials, and white candidates in particular, never reaches black communities.""They make promises that are not going to be kept,"" said Selena Thornton, 45, who works in nearby Caswell County in North Carolina. ""Discrimination has been around how long? Since the beginning of time. And just inviting black people to events is not the answer to that.""Bryant Hood, a 46-year-old resident who helped organize the event with Ms. Warren's team, said he thought the candidates who are pitching enormous change and government involvement in people's lives had not adequately wrestled with what they're asking black votes to believe in.Presidential candidates ""hit the church, they hit the community's leaders, and they think that's all they need to do,"" said Mr. Hood, who sat out the last election after voting twice for Mr. Obama.""I don't think it's that they don't want to do more,"" he added, ""they don't know.""Earning the support of black voters with policies that require real faith in what the government can fairly provide amounts to what may be the most significant challenge for the candidates seeking to beat Mr. Biden after Iowa and New Hampshire. That's when the contest moves to states where the Democratic electorate is less dominated by white voters.Mr. Crisp, of the progressive farmers group in Piedmont, is undecided in the Democratic primary. He said Mr. Biden was among his top choices, though he acknowledged that on the issues he prioritizes most, Ms. Warren's plans better target racial inequality.Mr. Biden ""has a history, and a lot of them don't have a history,"" Mr. Crisp said.Ms. Hudson, the hemp farmer, said that as a black voter, placing her trust in an unknown quantity was a risk. Referring to Mr. Obama, she said: ""I didn't vote for him because he was black. I voted for him because of what he said and I believe what he said.""She has not found a comparable candidate in 2020.""It's hard to trust white politicians,"" she said.PhotographSupporters listened to Senator Elizabeth Warren give a speech honoring black women at Clark Atlanta University in November.

| Jump to first hitIn a battleground state just before the start of a Democratic debate, the president sided with Bernie Sanders in his clash with Elizabeth Warren.MILWAUKEE -- Returning to the critical battleground state of Wisconsin on the same night as the final Democratic debate before the Iowa caucuses, President Trump offered support on Tuesday to Senator Bernie Sanders in his continuing dispute with Senator Elizabeth Warren, and he mocked the idea that an ""imminent"" threat from Iran was necessary to justify the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani.Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have been involved in a he-said, she-said clash about whether he said during a private meeting in 2018 that a woman could not win the presidency. Ms. Warren said he did, while Mr. Sanders has denied ever making such a statement.Mr. Trump, who in recent weeks has been seeking to elevate Mr. Sanders's Democratic presidential primary campaign, believing that he could beat him in November, weighed in on the side of the man over the woman.""A woman can win for president,"" Mr. Trump said. ""That could happen, who knows.""""I don't believe Bernie said that, I really don't,"" he said. ""It's not the kind of a thing he'd say.""It was not clear that validation from the president would help Mr. Sanders in an intraparty feud. But it was a classic Trump offer of an unsolicited two cents from the sidelines in the hopes of somehow influencing the debate.At Mr. Trump's rally, in a state he won in 2016 by fewer than 23,000 votes, he also mocked Democrats for questioning whether there was any imminent threat from Iran, hoping to capitalize politically on the killing of General Suleimani, which campaign aides said had delivered him a small bump in their polling.""Great percentages of people don't have legs or arms because of this son of a bitch,"" Mr. Trump told a raucous crowd of supporters, who had lined up on the gray, snow-covered streets of Milwaukee for hours to see him speak.He said that it ""doesn't matter"" to Democrats that General Suleimani had killed ""hundreds of thousands of people,"" and that ""they'll start a new investigation"" over whether there was really any imminent threat.Mr. Trump, who had previously claimed that four American embassies were under threat -- a charge his own administration could not back -- also appeared on Tuesday evening to imply that the number could have been higher, but that the threat was vaguer.""If I didn't kill him, and let's say we lost three, four, five embassies or bases,"" he said, trailing off.His breezy dismissal of the entire discussion of an imminent threat came after the administration had insisted for more than 10 days that General Suleimani, Iran's most important military official, was planning myriad ""imminent"" attacks.The president said that ""Democrats are outraged that we killed this terrorist monster,"" calling General Suleimani the ""king of roadside bombs"" and blaming President Barack Obama for not taking him out. ""He should have been killed 20 years ago,"" Mr. Trump said.It was the president's first campaign rally in Wisconsin since April, and its early billing on his 2020 rally calendar signaled the importance that both parties plan to place on a state where Mr. Trump's victory four years ago blindsided Hillary Clinton's campaign.""I shouldn't even be here tonight,"" Mr. Trump said, ""but I love the people of Wisconsin.""Eager to overcome the narrative that Mrs. Clinton lost the 2016 election, in part, because of her infamous decision to not visit the state even once, Democrats have selected Milwaukee as the city to host their nominating convention in July. And Priorities USA, one of the leading Democratic super PACs, has been outspending the Trump campaign on digital ads in the state since last July.Mr. Trump came to Wisconsin to promote his campaign theme of ""Promises made, Promises kept."" But in reality, dairy farmers in the state have been struggling since he took office, with some farms even shutting down. Democrats attribute the loss of dairy farms and related jobs to Mr. Trump threatening a trade war with China.The president, however, put forth his trade policies as reasons to support him.""What we've done with China, what we've done with the U.S.M.C.A., what we've done with Japan,"" he said. ""You've got to love Trump. You've got to love Trump.""Meantime, Democrats signaled that they would invest heavily to win back the state.""Wisconsin is going to be one of the states that decides this election, and we're investing in the state accordingly,"" said Cassidy Geoghegan, the Wisconsin outreach director for Priorities USA. She said that health care costs in the state were on the rise and that ""farmers are having to sell their cows and close down their operations,"" while wages were not keeping up.During the rally -- which started before the Democrats took the stage for their debate in Des Moines -- Mr. Trump also singled out Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., mocking him for not knowing what state he was campaigning in. ""When you do that, you can't really recover,"" the president. ""You can be Winston Churchill. But you get killed. He does that every time.""In reality, Mr. Trump has also suffered his share of confusion about his speaking locations or where tragedies have occurred under his watch. In a somber, televised speech in August after two mass shootings, for instance, Mr. Trump blessed ""the memory of those who perished in Toledo,"" referring to a city more than 100 miles away from Dayton, the scene of an Ohio massacre.Mr. Trump's rally was the centerpiece of a two-day push in Wisconsin, with top Trump aides and family members making stops at smaller venues around the state.Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and a senior adviser, flew commercial with Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, to Milwaukee from Washington on Tuesday morning to lead a discussion about prisoner re-entry programs.Lara Trump, who is married to Eric Trump, the president's second eldest son, visited Rib Mountain on Monday to speak to voters. And Vice President Mike Pence made an unannounced visit to a Culver's restaurant in Milwaukee to talk to voters in the kind of small, intimate venue that Mr. Trump does not often frequent himself.For his part, Mr. Trump delivered what has become his standard, rambling stump speech, which combines inflated boasts about his record, rosy memories about his 2016 victory and grievances about the way he has been treated by Democrats. His remarks, delivered in an uncharacteristically hoarse voice, were punctuated by individual protesters in a sea of enthusiastic supporters clad in red Trump campaign T-shirts and hats.On the eve of the official beginning to the formal start of the Senate impeachment trial against him, Mr. Trump claimed, once again, that Democrats were trying to impeach him because of his success with the economy and rebuilding the military.He targeted Speaker Nancy Pelosi, noting that ""her district is filthy dirty,"" filled with syringes and cautioned her to spend more time at home.But he said he was confident about his chances. Calling the 2016 election the most important election in history, he noted that 2020 ""maybe, in its own way, will be just as important.""PhotographPresident Trump's rally on Tuesday was part of a campaign push this week in Wisconsin, a state that helped deliver his 2016 victory.

| Jump to first hitBernie Sanders has so far prevailed by expanding his appeal among traditional Democratic voters, not by driving record turnout.CHARLESTON, S.C. -- It is the most politically provocative part of Senator Bernie Sanders's campaign pitch: that his progressive movement will bring millions of nonvoters into the November election, driving record turnout especially among disaffected working-class Americans and young people.And yet despite a virtual tie in Iowa, a narrow victory in New Hampshire and a big triumph in Nevada, the first three nominating contests reveal a fundamental challenge for Mr. Sanders's political revolution: He may be winning, but not because of his longstanding pledge to expand the Democratic base.The results so far show that Mr. Sanders has prevailed by broadening his appeal among traditional Democratic voters, not by fundamentally transforming the electorate.In Iowa, for instance, turnout for the caucuses was lower than expected, up 3 percent compared with 2016, and the increase was concentrated in more well-educated areas where Mr. Sanders struggled, according to a New York Times analysis; in the Iowa precincts where Mr. Sanders won, turnout increased by only 1 percentage point.There was no sign of a Sanders voter surge in New Hampshire either, nor on Saturday in Nevada, where the nearly final results indicated that turnout would finish above 2016 but well short of 2008 levels, despite a decade of population growth and a new early voting option that attracted some 75,000 voters. The low numbers are all the more striking given the huge turnout in the 2018 midterm elections, which was the highest in a century.There was also no clear evidence across the early states of much greater participation by young people, a typically low-turnout group that makes up a core part of Mr. Sanders's base and that he has long said he can motivate to get out to the polls. And Mr. Sanders has struggled to overcome his longstanding weakness in affluent, well-educated suburbs, where Democrats excelled in the midterm elections and where many traditionally Republican voters are skeptical about President Trump's performance, meaning they could be up for grabs in November.Because the moderate wing opposing Mr. Sanders, a Vermont liberal, is so fragmented, the lower-than-hoped-for turnout has not slowed his ascent. Sanders aides point to the simple fact that he has won, finishing atop all three states with a coalition of young people, working-class voters and people of color -- which was crucial to his victory in Nevada. And they say it is still early.But many Democrats believe that for a general election, their nominee will need to pull in new voters, including those who sat out 2016 and moderate Republicans repelled by Mr. Trump. Even some inside the Sanders campaign expressed concern about the race's initial turnout.""I grant that the turnouts aren't at the level that we would hope,"" Representative Ro Khanna of California, one of the campaign's national co-chairs, said before the Nevada caucuses.""Do I think that there is room for growth,"" he said, ""and do I think that Senator Sanders would have liked the numbers to have been even further up among voters of color, among young voters, among working-class voters? Absolutely.""Mr. Khanna expressed confidence that the numbers would increase in a general election contest against Mr. Trump, but said that the campaign had to ""keep pushing harder.""On the campaign trail, Mr. Sanders, 78, has proclaimed that his ""is the campaign of energy, is the campaign of excitement, is the campaign that can bring millions of people into the political process who normally do not vote."" In rallies in Texas over the weekend, as his resounding victory in Nevada was becoming clear, he conveyed an air of triumph, drawing enormous crowds as his campaign made plans to solidify his front-runner status by Super Tuesday on March 3.""If the cameras turn on this crowd, and our friends in Wall Street and the drug companies see this kind of crowd, you're going to really get them nervous,"" Mr. Sanders declared to thousands at a rally in Austin on Sunday.Mr. Sanders's rivals have rejected the premise that he will expand the Democratic Party's base, saying he is too rigid in his worldview. ""Senator Sanders believes in an inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans,"" Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., said in his concession speech in Nevada on Saturday.As Mr. Sanders and his opponents prepare for the South Carolina primary on Saturday, The Times's analysis of the first three states show some challenging signs for his goal of producing a surge in turnout. In New Hampshire, for instance, turnout increased far less in townships he won than it did in townships won by Mr. Buttigieg and by Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.The share of the electorate made up of first-time Democratic voters also decreased in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada compared with 2016. And unlike four years ago, when Mr. Sanders mobilized far more first-time voters than Hillary Clinton did (averaging a 30-point lead over Mrs. Clinton across the three states), he had only a modest 10-point edge over his closest rival, Mr. Buttigieg, in that metric this time around.Among young people, entrance poll data showed that the share of those voters remained essentially unchanged across the three early states. Participation was basically flat in precincts and townships in New Hampshire and Iowa where 18- to 24-year-olds made up more than 50 percent of the population.For months, Mr. Sanders has consolidated support on the left and successfully parried challenges from moderates in the race. He has amassed the largest war chest of any Democratic candidate and has an army of loyal supporters. His aides and advisers are optimistic about his path to the nomination as the most crucial delegate-rich phase of the race approaches.Jeff Weaver, a top strategist to Mr. Sanders, pointed to strong performances with working-class voters in places like Manchester, N.H., and Latino voters in Nashua, N.H., and categorically rebuffed questions about the Sanders turnout machine.""His movement is working, which is evidenced by the fact that he is winning,"" Mr. Weaver said.Although Mr. Sanders has not yet realized his goal of spurring greater voter turnout, there are signs his campaign strategy is flourishing in other respects. One of the biggest changes between his previous presidential bid and the one this year is that he now seems to fare as well among nonwhite voters as his nearest rivals.In Nevada, Mr. Sanders won nonwhite voters by a 19-point margin, according to an entrance poll, far greater than his 10-point margin among white voters. The result is consistent with recent national surveys, such as ones this month by Monmouth University and NBC/Marist, which show Mr. Sanders winning a higher vote share among nonwhite than white voters.His campaign aggressively courted Latinos in the state for months, sending out mailers, knocking on doors and making calls urging them to caucus. In the end, Mr. Sanders won Latino voters by an overwhelming 51 to 17 percent margin, according to the entrance polls, a feat that would leave him well positioned in Texas and California on Super Tuesday.Yet Latino voters, surprisingly, appeared to represent an even smaller share of the Nevada caucus electorate than they did four years ago, according to entrance poll results, even as the same polls showed Mr. Sanders riding their overwhelming support to victory statewide.Larry Cohen, a longtime adviser to Mr. Sanders who serves as chairman of Our Revolution, the organization that spun out of the senator's 2016 presidential campaign, said it was incumbent upon grass-roots groups and the 2020 campaign ""to demonstrate that we can significantly boost turnout,"" especially in swing states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.During a rally at the University of Houston on Sunday after his commanding victory in Nevada, Mr. Sanders -- as he had in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada -- aspired to a ""large voter turnout"" on Super Tuesday, when voting takes place in Texas and 13 other states.Saying he wanted to motivate ""working people and young people, people who have given up on the political process, people of all shades who believe in economic justice, social justice, racial justice, environmental justice,"" he forecast a victory in Texas both in the primary and against Mr. Trump in November.Sydney Ember reported from Charleston, and Nate Cohn from New York.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders won nonwhite voters by a 19-point margin in Nevada, according to an entrance poll, far greater than his 10-point margin among white voters.

| Jump to first hitThe three major presidential candidates have quickly pivoted to try to shape a new political discourse, as they face a real-time test of leadership in a national crisis.WASHINGTON -- For the past year, the Democratic presidential candidates debated the merits of sweeping liberal ideas, fretted over notions of electability and bias, and rose and fell in the polls as voters struggled to choose a front-runner. And through it all, President Trump sniped from the sidelines, demonizing the party and its 2020 contenders as socialists.Almost overnight, everything has changed. Amid deepening uncertainty over a spreading virus and growing anxiety about an economic meltdown, that kind of classic presidential campaign ended and something extraordinary has begun: a real-time, life-or-death test of competency and leadership for those seeking the White House this November.Over 18 hours from Wednesday night through Thursday afternoon, the three major candidates for the presidency, including the incumbent, made quick pivots to shape and guide the country's new political discourse. It was an attempt to demonstrate how they would lead Americans across a muddled terrain of social disruption and stock market collapse, of worry about testing kits and concern about travel bans and crowd sizes.Just hours after Mr. Trump delivered a wooden address from the Oval Office, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. sought to position himself as a sober steward of the national interest, delivering a speech echoing the language and tone of addresses given by presidents in moments of crisis. Mr. Biden also went much further than Mr. Trump in proposing a detailed plan and a set of goals on testing, increasing hospital capacity and supporting an accelerated push for a vaccine.""This virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,"" Mr. Biden said, standing in front of a backdrop of American flags. ""Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president, fueled by adversarial relationships with the truth that he continues to have.""With his sharp criticisms of Mr. Trump's shifting statements about the crisis, and the administration's inability to stem the falling stock market, Mr. Biden was also taking direct aim at Mr. Trump's oft-heard arguments for re-election in November.The spread of the virus is rapidly becoming a test of Mr. Trump's core message: that despite the controversy the president creates, Americans are better off economically than before he took office and should stick with him, rather than siding with Democrats whom Mr. Trump portrays as feckless half-wits who botched the Iowa caucuses and much more.Now it is Mr. Trump who risks looking out of his depth to many Americans, not only in protecting their health but also in guarding their 401(k)s.Two hours after Mr. Biden spoke, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- the other leading candidate for the Democratic nomination -- warned that the death toll of Americans from the coronavirus could exceed the number of U.S. soldiers killed during World War II.""We have an administration that is largely incompetent and whose incompetence and recklessness have threatened the lives of many, many people in this country,"" Mr. Sanders said.The setting of the speeches underscored the unusual situation the campaigns now face. Normally at this time candidates would be traveling the country, rallying supporters at town hall meetings, fund-raisers and mass rallies. But both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have curtailed their travel and canceled big gatherings because of the virus, and on Thursday they found themselves addressing small groups of reporters in sparse hotel ballrooms in their hometowns, Wilmington, Del., and Burlington, Vt.Political strategists compared the virus to a hurricane, a deeply disruptive event likely to affect broad swaths of the country in unpredictable and devastating ways. The response to those moments can make or break a political career, they say.""You don't blame the elected officials for causing the damage that the hurricane ravages across the state,"" said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster with experience on presidential and Senate campaigns. ""You evaluate elected officials on how they handle the situation.""Even as the fate of the country's health remains uncertain, the dynamics of the primary race are clarifying. After a series of primary wins, Mr. Biden now has a delegate lead that would require a nearly impossible turnaround from Mr. Sanders to overcome.That leaves Mr. Trump likely to face an opponent whom he spent much of 2019 trying to destroy. Yet, in a moment of crisis, some Democrats argue that the country may turn to a creature of the Washington establishment, seeing Mr. Biden as an experienced hand.""A lot of people, not just Democrats, are going to start looking to Mr. Biden and sizing him up. It's a real-time test at some level,"" said Addisu Demissie, who managed the presidential campaign of Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey. ""Even though he doesn't have authority, he can show and not tell what four years of a Biden presidency would feel like.""In particular, Democrats believe the virus will help them hold more moderate, independent suburban voters who don't like the president's tone but have stayed with him because of the strong economy. The party won control of the House in 2018 largely on the strength of their support among those voters, flipping a number of seats in battleground districts. Exit polling from Tuesday's primaries showed that a majority of voters saw Mr. Biden as the candidate they trusted most to handle a major crisis.For rural voters, who are more likely to vote for Republicans, the economic ramifications could affect their bottom lines, particularly farmers and oil workers who are already hurting from trade policies.Yet, the fiercely partisan moment in Washington has scrambled the politics of unity that traditionally kick into place during times of national crisis. The partisan divide is so pervasive that it has affected not only people's feelings about the president's response, but also their fears about the virus itself.Roughly six in 10 Republican voters nationwide said they were not particularly concerned that the coronavirus would disrupt their lives, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released this week. Democratic voters were twice as likely as Republicans to say they are concerned.While privately concerned about the impact on the president's re-election prospects, Republicans are largely following Mr. Trump's lead in minimizing the worries over the coronavirus and blaming Democrats and the media for focusing on the deaths it has caused.""One thing the press has not covered at all is the people who have really recovered,"" said Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, a Republican ally of Mr. Trump's. ""Right now all people are hearing about are the deaths. I'm sure the deaths are horrific, but the flip side of this is the vast majority of people who get coronavirus do survive.""In recent days, Mr. Trump and his administration have taken a more active hand in the public messaging around the response. But senior public health officials have frequently contradicted or corrected statements made by the president; in the late hours of Wednesday evening various administration officials corrected four separate policies that Mr. Trump had announced during his nationally televised address.On Thursday morning, after news broke that an aide to the Brazilian president had tested positive for the coronavirus days after being in proximity to Mr. Trump at his South Florida hotel, Mr. Trump said he was not worried. The White House later said he had not been tested for the virus himself.""Let's put it this way,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I'm not concerned.""As the election year progresses into unknown territory, the candidates must now find ways to motivate voters from a distance. A number of Mr. Biden's donors and supporters were quietly nervous about the effect that the coronavirus could have on events large and small in coming weeks, saying it had injected a fresh measure of uncertainty into the race.Scheduled Biden campaign events in Chicago and Miami are being transformed into ""virtual events"" ahead of next Tuesday's primaries in Arizona, Illinois, Florida and Ohio. On Thursday, both the Biden and Sanders campaigns instructed staff members to begin working from home.Mr. Trump appears to be stopping all campaign-related events indefinitely, which would remove a major political weapon from his arsenal as he moves into the general election campaign.Beyond the rallies, the virus throws into question nearly every mechanism of modern campaigning. Already, officials in Arizona, Ohio and Illinois are scrambling to move polling places out of nursing homes -- with early voting already well underway.On Thursday, the Democratic National Committee announced it would move Sunday's presidential debate to Washington from Phoenix to minimize travel. At least nine members of Congress have self-quarantined after exposure to the virus, including several who had interactions with the president. Across the country, political events are being canceled, including some state party conventions where the delegates who vote on the nominee are elected.Democratic activists are exploring ways to expand their virtual organizing efforts through Facebook and text. Abortion rights activists are planning a ""virtual call center"" on Sunday to support a Democrat challenging an incumbent in the Chicago suburbs. The Democratic Party of Wisconsin on Thursday canceled all in-person voter canvassing ahead of the state's April 7 elections.""As a campaign, it is completely against every instinct you have: no fund-raising and no big events,"" said David Pepper, the chairman of the Ohio Democratic Party. ""In the final week of a primary that's the opposite of everything you'd want to do.""Yet the questions go well beyond mass events and voting and will only get more challenging the longer the virus continues to disrupt social contact. What's a baby-kissing politician supposed to do when he cannot kiss a baby? How do you gather staff members in a war room, if they can't be in the same room? Can volunteers go knocking on doors in affected areas? If the campaign moves even more online, can officials protect against a heightened threat of election interference and disinformation?It's not known how long the coronavirus and its aftereffects will affect the election or be paramount on voters' minds.""There's a long time until the election,"" said Corry Bliss, who ran the House Republicans' super PAC in 2018. ""Last month, the world was convinced the only thing that would matter in 2020 was impeachment.""Giovanni Russonello contributed reporting from New York.PhotographJoseph R.

| Jump to first hitMr. Sanders has now won the most votes in each of the first three states and has more momentum than all his rivals and more money than everyone besides two self-funding billionaires.LAS VEGAS -- Senator Bernie Sanders won big on Saturday and is now the clear front-runner. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. saved enough face to march on to his must-win in South Carolina a week from now. Pete Buttigieg finished in the top tier again and embraced the urgency of knocking down a rising Mr. Sanders, though it is not clear where he wins next. And Senator Elizabeth Warren is awash in cash after her debate dismantling of Michael R. Bloomberg -- $9 million in three days -- but the performance did not nudge her up in the standings in Nevada.Here are five takeaways from Saturday's results and what they'll mean for the rest of the Democratic primary:Bernie Sanders has taken command of the raceMr. Sanders did not just win Nevada. Entrance polls show that he dominated.Those polls showed Mr. Sanders winning men and women; whites and Latinos; voters in all but the oldest age group (17-29, 30-44 and 45-64); those with college degrees and those without. He was carrying union households and nonunion households, self-identified liberal Democrats (by a wide margin) and moderate and conservative ones (narrowly).""Welcome to the revolution,"" said Waleed Shahid, a spokesman for Justice Democrats, a progressive group.The Sanders victory was built upon three distinct and yet overlapping bases of support: young people (56 percent support among those 44 and under), very liberal voters (49 percent) and a majority of Hispanic voters. The latter was a new factor in Nevada after two heavily white opening states, Iowa and New Hampshire, and particularly important as the race expands to big and diverse states on Super Tuesday with large Latino populations, none more significant than California and Texas.Mr. Sanders has now won the most votes in each of the first three states (Mr. Buttigieg appears to have edged him in delegates in the still-disputed Iowa results) and has more momentum than all his rivals and more money than everyone besides the two self-funding billionaires, Tom Steyer and Mr. Bloomberg.It was no accident that Mr. Sanders spent much of the day before the Nevada caucuses in California and had two rallies in Texas on Saturday: His campaign is looking ahead to Super Tuesday, March 3, as the day he breaks away from the rest of the Democratic field.Speaking of which ...The rest of the field isn't shrinkingNot long after the first results began rolling in, a super PAC supporting Mr. Buttigieg announced it was buying TV ads in Super Tuesday states. Mr. Biden's campaign manager declared that ""the Biden comeback"" had just begun. Senator Amy Klobuchar dropped from her New Hampshire showing yet claimed to have ""exceeded expectations."" And Ms. Warren's campaign manager said her performance at last week's debate would prove more important than the actual election.Translation: No one is about to quit this race.And the longer all the alternative candidates remain, the longer Mr. Sanders can keep carrying states and consolidating his own coalition without a singular rival.""The Nevada results reinforce the reality that this fragmented field is putting Bernie Sanders on pace to amass an insurmountable delegate lead,"" said Kevin Sheekey, the campaign manager for Mr. Bloomberg.Each has their own arguments for staying.Mr. Biden, who carried black voters in Nevada, is the best positioned to beat Mr. Sanders in an upcoming state (South Carolina). Mr. Buttigieg has had the strongest showings overall besides Mr. Sanders. Ms. Warren, whose campaign announced a $21 million haul for February, argues she has the money and organization to compete. Mr. Bloomberg has his billions. Ms. Klobuchar's path -- which is taking her to Fargo, N.D., on Sunday -- seems less clear and may be more about grabbing spare delegates than the nomination.The collective impact is clear. A remarkable six candidates all had at least 12 percent of the vote among voters over 45 in Nevada, an almost impossibly even level of fracture.Joe Biden's best finish yet is still second placeThe Biden case for the nomination has been straightforward: He's the guy to beat President Trump. Yet for the third time in three races, Mr. Biden did not win. He did improve from his bad fourth-place finish in Iowa and his disastrous fifth place in New Hampshire (as of late Saturday both Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Biden were claiming second as Nevada sloooowly processed results).But throughout February, Mr. Biden had said that his fortunes would be reversed now that more diverse states were voting. Except it was Mr. Sanders who soundly defeated Mr. Biden among Latino voters, according to entrance polls, while Mr. Biden's lead among African Americans -- his strongest base -- continued to shrink to 12 percentage points.""Y'all did it for me. Y'all did it,"" Mr. Biden nonetheless told his supporters in Las Vegas.He notably sharpened his contrast with Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bloomberg, who has vied to take over the moderate lane the former vice president occupied for virtually all of 2019.""I ain't a socialist. I ain't a plutocrat. I'm a Democrat,"" he said. ""And proud of it!""Mr. Biden could well still win in South Carolina, where he has consistently led in the polls, and that could be a springboard to Super Tuesday. But his schedule has him locked down in the must-win state for much of the week as rivals cross the nation.And don't forget: Mr. Biden led in the Nevada polling averages for much of the last year.Until he didn't.Buttigieg wants to be the anti-BernieOf all the victory and concession speeches on Saturday, Mr. Buttigieg's was the most revealing. He used the big platform not just to make the case for himself but to slash at Mr. Sanders, whom he accused of pushing an ""inflexible, ideological revolution that leaves out most Democrats, not to mention most Americans.""He talked about the urgency of beating Mr. Trump and the importance of nominating a Democrat who ""actually gives a damn"" about down-ballot races. Speaking on MSNBC, one of the campaign's national chairs, Representative Anthony Brown, called Mr. Buttigieg the leader in the ""non-revolutionary lane"" of the primary, though if such a lane exists, it is more a tangled mess.Going forward, the problem is that Mr. Buttigieg's early successes in Iowa, New Hampshire and, to a lesser extent, Nevada, have not yet lifted him nationally.The Nevada entrance polls had him carrying a meager 2 percent of black voters. Advisers to his rivals and Democratic strategists who want to see Mr. Sanders stopped have been frustrated with Mr. Buttigieg's campaign, arguing that while he has been relatively successful so far, he is now in a demographic cul-de-sac.But Mr. Buttigieg has a compelling counterpoint, as he said pointedly in his speech: ""Ours is the only campaign that has beaten Senator Sanders anywhere in the country this whole campaign cycle.""After sizzling debate, Warren doesn't get Nevada bumpIf Wednesday's debate performance was going to turn Ms. Warren's political fortunes, it did not do so fast enough for the Nevada caucuses.The results trickling in delivered another round of frustration for a candidate who fell below expectations in both Iowa and New Hampshire and had her campaign manager, Roger Lau, arguing on Saturday that the days-old debate would prove more significant than the actual election.""We believe the Nevada debate will have more impact on the structure of the race,"" Mr. Lau wrote on Twitter. He called the actual results a ""lagging indicator"" because so many votes -- true -- were cast before the debate.The problem is that election results create their own new gravitational reality in politics and the race itself will be reset with the next debate on Tuesday. Then comes South Carolina, which was long seen as her weakest of the four early states. Then, suddenly, Super Tuesday, where Mr. Sanders seems to be making a play for Ms. Warren's home state, Massachusetts.Ms. Warren still has fans. Before one of the largest crowds of her campaign in Seattle on Saturday, she told supporters that she had raised $9 million in the last three days, a huge sum. That gives a financial cushion to a campaign that was so close to running out of money in January it took out a $3 million line of credit.But on a day that Mr. Sanders won and was building momentum, Ms. Warren was still focused on her preferred target: Mr. Bloomberg, reliving some of the greatest hits from the debate.And she added some new, off-brand material for a candidate who rose in the polls last year on the strength of her myriad plans and reputation as a wonkish fighter.She cracked a height joke.Mr. Bloomberg, she said, posed ""a big threat, not a tall threat, but a big one.""Her rivals had not even mentioned her in their assessments.PhotographSenator Elizabeth Warren told supporters in Seattle on Saturday that she had raised $9 million after her strong debate performance.

| Jump to first hitThe defense from Bernie Sanders was straightforward: It wasn’t me.
He had been milling about on the Senate floor one day in the summer of 2017 when a colleague, Kamala Harris, stepped toward him. “Do we have a problem?” Ms. Harris asked, according to Democrats familiar with the exchange.
Some prominent Sanders supporters had been flaming Ms. Harris publicly as the preferred choice of the corporate Democratic establishment against which Mr. Sanders had long railed, a view amplified among Sanders-boosting accounts across social media. “Pre-emptive strike,” one person wrote on the popular SandersForPresident Reddit group, where Sanders fans were sharing details of Ms. Harris’s recent fund-raising swing in the Hamptons with former Hillary Clinton donors. “Start the conversation now, end it before 2020.”
Mr. Sanders assured Ms. Harris that there was no issue, the Democrats familiar with their conversation said. He insisted that he could not control how his followers communicated.
But two years later, as both senators pursued the party’s 2020 presidential nomination and Ms. Harris returned to the Hamptons to collect campaign checks, Mr. Sanders broadcast an observation of his own after Ms. Harris raised doubts about his “Medicare for all” plan. “I don’t go to the Hamptons to raise money from billionaires,” he tweeted last August, elevating a message that supporters had already been pushing. Thousands of retweets followed.
Since the start of Mr. Sanders’s first presidential campaign in 2016, his colossal online support base has been by turns a source of peerless strength and perpetual aggravation — envied and caricatured by rivals who covet such loyalty, feared by Democrats who have faced harassment from his followers, and alternately cherished and gently scolded by the candidate himself.
The zeal of Mr. Sanders’s fans has helped establish him as one of the 2020 front-runners a week before the Iowa caucuses. No other Democrat attracts supporters more dedicated to forcefully defending their candidate and lashing his foes, more willing to repeatedly donate their time and money to sustain his bid. Through the end of 2019, Mr. Sanders had raised nearly $100 million from over five million individual donations, without ever holding traditional fund-raisers, leading the primary field.
Yet as Mr. Sanders moves to position himself as a standard-bearer for a party he has criticized from the left for decades, the power of his internet army has also alarmed Democrats who are familiar with its underside, experienced in ways large and small.
Some progressive activists who declined to back Mr. Sanders have begun traveling with private security after incurring online harassment. Several well-known feminist writers said they had received death threats. A state party chairwoman changed her phone number. A Portland lawyer saw her business rating tumble on an online review site after tussling with Sanders supporters on Twitter.
Other notable targets have included Ady Barkan, a prominent liberal activist with A.L.S. — whom some Sanders-cheering accounts accused of lacking decision-making faculties due to his illness as he prepared to endorse Senator Elizabeth Warren — and Fred Guttenberg, the father of a shooting victim from the 2018 Parkland massacre, who had criticized Mr. Sanders’s statements about gun violence.
“Politics is a contact sport,” said Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina State legislator who supported Ms. Harris in the Democratic primary. “But you have to be very cognizant when you say anything critical of Bernie online. You might have to put your phone down. There’s going to be a blowback, and it could be sexist, racist and vile.”
In recent days, he said, one man sent a profanity-filled private message on Instagram, calling Mr. Sellers, who is black, an “Uncle Tom” and wishing him brain cancer.
When Mr. Sanders’s supporters swarm someone online, they often find multiple access points to that person’s life, compiling what can amount to investigative dossiers. They will attack all public social media accounts, posting personal insults that might flow in by the hundreds. Some of the missives are direct threats of violence, which can be reported to Twitter or Facebook and taken down.
More commonly, there is a barrage of jabs and threats sometimes framed as jokes. If the target is a woman, and it often is, these insults can veer toward her physical appearance.
For some perceived Sanders critics, there has been mail sent to home addresses — or the home addresses of relatives. The contents were unremarkable: news articles about the political perils of centrism. The message seemed clear: We know where you live.
‘I condemn bullying and harassment of any kind and in any space.’
— Bernie Sanders, in a 2019 letter to supporters
Interviews with current and former staff members and major online supporters make clear that top advisers — and often, Mr. Sanders himself — are acutely aware of the bile spread in his name.
In February 2019, shortly after announcing his second presidential run, Mr. Sanders emailed a letter to surrogates. “I want to be clear,” he said, “that I condemn bullying and harassment of any kind and in any space.”
That he felt compelled to append this note to his national reintroduction was perhaps as telling as its contents.
The Sanders campaign declined to discuss its 2020 digital operation and the extent to which it monitored social media discussions.
A spokesman, Mike Casca, flagged Mr. Sanders’s call for civility from last February. The campaign also released a statement from a spokeswoman, Sarah Ford, emphasizing the candidate’s previous remarks. “As the senator has said loudly and clearly,” she said, “there is no room in the political revolution for abuse and harassment online.”
Sanders aides routinely decide against commenting publicly about an online spat, reasoning that to do so would only elevate the conflict. The candidate’s defenders are quick to reject any suggestion that Mr. Sanders is responsible for the most egregious conduct of his followers, who are disproportionately young and overrepresented online, when the vast majority proceed with greater care.
His allies also argue that online combat is not unique to the Sanders side, with some high-profile women who support the senator saying they have been attacked, too.
“The same folks who want to complain that Sanders supporters are more vicious than anybody else never come out to chastise the supporters of other candidates,” said Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator and Mr. Sanders’s national campaign co-chair.
But many political veterans outside the Sanders operation fault the campaign’s handling of the vitriol.
Jess Morales Rocketto, a progressive strategist who worked on campaigns for Barack Obama and Mrs. Clinton, said Mr. Sanders had empowered aides and surrogates who “have a tendency to aggressively amplify things that a campaign would normally shut down amongst supporters.”
“There are always people who say things that are problematic. It’s not that that is unique to Bernie’s campaign,” she said. “What’s unique is it is a consistent problem in the universe of Bernie Sanders.”
‘You can’t control these folks.’
— RoseAnn DeMoro, a Sanders supporter and former leader of National Nurses United
With more than 10 million followers on Twitter, Mr. Sanders has a larger audience on the platform than Ms. Warren, Pete Buttigieg, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Amy Klobuchar combined. A sizable number could be automated bots or fictitious accounts. Federal prosecutors have detailed coordinated efforts by Russian nationals to interfere in the 2016 election, with an emphasis on two candidates — Donald J. Trump and Mr. Sanders — whom the Russians hoped to bolster while denigrating their opponents.
In a party gripped with anxiety about unifying to defeat Mr. Trump, the venom among Sanders backers and their counterparts supporting other candidates is of serious concern to Democrats.
Peggy Huppert, an Iowa activist who consulted for the 2016 Sanders campaign, said she had decided to support Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., in 2020 “in large part because of the way he conducts himself.” She praised Mr. Sanders’s letter to supporters after his announcement but said that this message had plainly failed to resonate.
“Obama set the tone for his campaign: ‘You are positive, you are respectful, you are civil,’” Ms. Huppert said. “I guess Bernie hasn’t.”
In recent days, Sanders supporters have filled the social media feeds of Ms. Warren and her allies with snakes — emojis, GIFs, doctored photographs — following the candidates’ quarrel over whether Mr. Sanders had told Ms. Warren privately in 2018 that a woman could not win the presidency. And last week, Mrs. Clinton resurfaced to revisit old wounds, telling The Hollywood Reporter that Mr. Sanders was to blame for permitting and “very much supporting” a toxic campaign culture.
For many of Mr. Sanders’s admirers, the interview only reinforced a conviction that traditional Democratic forces wish him political harm.
So why, they ask, should he be expected to stifle his most potent megaphone?
“You can’t control these folks,” RoseAnn DeMoro, a vocal Sanders supporter and former leader of National Nurses United, said of his online base. “I should say, ‘us folks.’”
The 2016 roots of the Bernie Sanders internet
There was a running joke inside the Clinton campaign’s 2016 Brooklyn headquarters: The cruelest surprise her digital team could pull on staff members was to retweet their personal account from the candidate’s handle, putting them on the radar of Mr. Sanders’s followers.
Mrs. Clinton’s aides mostly marveled at the scope and intensity of an ostensible long shot’s online base.
Mr. Sanders’s supporters, now often identified on Twitter by the rose emoji of the Democratic Socialists of America, loosely coordinated in private channels on Slack, a messaging service designed for the workplace, and congregated on Reddit, posting memes, news and jokes. (Today, there are 384,000 members in the SandersForPresident group on Reddit. The central group for Mr. Biden has about 3,100.)
‘It would stun me that he wouldn’t know what was going on.’
— Michael Ceraso, a 2016 Sanders aide
Top Sanders aides initially worked to assemble traditional campaign infrastructure with staff on the ground in early nominating states like Iowa and New Hampshire. But much of the rest of the map was effectively the province of volunteers, who were responsible for helping to translate online enthusiasm into in-person support.
To Mr. Sanders, who had long bet his career on the power of mass movements, the online momentum did not necessarily register as unusual, even if he did not understand all the nuts and bolts.
Zack Exley, a senior adviser in 2016, said someone once asked Mr. Sanders how he had managed to draw so many people to his events.
“What do you mean?” the candidate replied, according to Mr. Exley. That was just how movements worked.
“If you’re in that position,” Mr. Exley said, “I don’t think you’re actually curious about how they got there.”
Others suggested that Mr. Sanders was highly attuned to what was happening online. His campaign aides tracked popular hashtags and, at times, encountered caustic posts. The candidate was particularly cognizant of, and grateful for, his online supporters’ capacity for small-dollar fund-raising.
“It would stun me that he wouldn’t know what was going on, positive or negative, online,” said Michael Ceraso, a Sanders aide in 2016 who worked for Mr. Buttigieg’s presidential campaign for part of last year.
While Mr. Sanders has said he does not have Twitter or any other apps on his phone, he is aware of the power of his online platform. “Given the fact that I have more social media followers than maybe all of my opponents combined, I guess we’re doing something right on that,” he told The New York Times editorial board. “What I have recognized is the importance of it.”
Ro Khanna, a California congressman who is now Mr. Sanders’s national campaign co-chair, said that the same internet that helped usher in the presidencies of Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama had made Mr. Sanders an unlikely juggernaut.
“If it weren’t for social media, if it weren’t for the use of email, Bernie Sanders would never have been a major contender,” he said. “It’s a glimpse, I think, into what the future of what campaigns may be.”
‘You better watch where you’re going or something’s going to happen to you.’
— a message received by Maya Contreras, co-founder of a feminist think tank who has been critical of Mr. Sanders
That is precisely what some Democrats fear. As the 2016 primary grew increasingly fractious, Mr. Sanders’s campaign found a drawback to such fervor: the online bullying among some supporters.
Sady Doyle, a progressive feminist author and Sanders critic who has been the subject of his followers’ ire, recalled one message she received from a stranger: “If you ever have a child, I’m going to dash it on the walls of Troy.” She said her husband asked her not to attend protests alone while pregnant.
Maya Contreras, a graduate student and co-founder of a feminist think tank who has criticized Mr. Sanders on Twitter, recalled a deluge in the lead-up to the 2016 election. “I got messages saying ‘go back to where you came from’ — which is Denver, Colorado, where I was born,” she said.
“Someone tweeted and said ‘You better watch where you’re going or something’s going to happen to you,’” Ms. Contreras added. “I also got ‘die bitch.’”
In person, serious violence has been avoided, it seems, though there have been occasional low-grade clashes. A May 2016 fight over delegates in Nevada included reports of thrown chairs, which some Sanders supporters dispute, and threats against the state party chairwoman, Roberta Lange, who changed her phone number after receiving a torrent of menacing messages about her, her grandchild and other relatives.
Former Senator Barbara Boxer of California, a Clinton supporter who had been at the Nevada convention, said she worried for her safety after being booed offstage.
“After the incident, Bernie and I talked on the phone, and he said, ‘I can’t believe that, my supporters would never do that,’” Ms. Boxer recalled. “I said, ‘Well, you ought to get to the bottom of it, Bernie.’”
She said Mr. Sanders responded, “Those cannot be my people.”
By early 2016, the behavior of Mr. Sanders’s online supporters, short-handed in the media as “Bernie Bros,” had become a stubborn trope, diagnosed as a political problem at the highest levels of the senator’s campaign, even as aides largely blamed Mrs. Clinton’s operation for overblowing it.
At times in public, Mr. Sanders tried to disclaim unseemly conduct. “We don’t want that crap,” he said in February 2016.
But he and his senior team also nursed a sharp sense of grievance. Jeff Weaver, a top Sanders strategist, played down the gravity of the Nevada unrest, telling CNN afterward that “no one had a right to feel threatened.”
“What happens,” he said, “is that when you rig the process and you get an angry crowd, you know, they’re not used to that.”
How 2020 built on what 2016 created
When the story broke this month detailing the private conversation between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren about female electability, Sanders surrogates received a message from the campaign, advising them against going out of their way to engage with it publicly.
But later that day, Mr. Sanders’s campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, told CNN that whoever had pushed the Warren story was lying. Shaun King, a civil rights activist and prominent Sanders supporter with more than one million Twitter followers, said he saw an opportunity.
Among other widely circulated tweets, Mr. King wrote that he had spoken to Warren campaign staff members who reported that she “routinely embellishes stories.” He alleged that the Warren campaign and its allies “leaked this attack against Bernie to the press for political gain.”
Eventually, Ms. Turner, the campaign co-chair, got in touch. “She called me and said, ‘Shaun, just let up on it,’” he said. He did, to an extent. But by then, much of the Sanders-aligned internet was about to begin tweeting snakes at Ms. Warren and her supporters en masse.
In that instance and more than a handful of others over the past year, the campaign has publicly distanced itself from the rancor. Mr. Sanders’s wife, Jane, called for unity as the Warren squabble persisted. Mr. Sanders weighed in when some followers scorched Mr. Barkan, the activist with A.L.S., after his endorsement of Ms. Warren. “Bernie and all of his staff and surrogates were incredibly gracious and kind when I made the difficult decision to endorse one of my heroes over the other,” Mr. Barkan said in a statement.
The campaign recognizes the possible political downsides in any extreme behavior, but aides are perhaps most wary of the “bro” portion of the “Bernie Bro” descriptor, as Mr. Sanders prepares to make his case to a diverse Democratic electorate later in the primary calendar. Ms. Ford, the Sanders spokeswoman, said opponents were perpetuating “a false myth to discount the diversity of our supporters.”
While Mr. Sanders’s poll numbers with nonwhite voters are stronger than many rivals’, female and nonwhite Sanders critics say they continue to face disproportionate harassment from ostensibly progressive forces. “People talk about white dudes getting radicalized on the right,” said Imani Gandy, a senior legal analyst for Rewire.News behind a popular Twitter account, @AngryBlackLady. “I feel like white dudes in Brooklyn are being radicalized too.”
Candice Aiston, a lawyer who supported Ms. Harris before she left the primary, sparred with Sanders supporters last year and found herself targeted beyond Twitter: Some condemned her in Google reviews of her law practice and reported her to the Oregon state bar association, which dismissed the complaints.
(“She’s O.K. at her job, but her right wing ideology screams too loud,” one online review read. “Would not recommend.”)
For the campaign, the balance is delicate — tut-tutting at times without diluting the force of online support. Mr. Khanna, the congressman and campaign co-chair, called Mr. Sanders “the one person on our side who can counter what Trump’s formidable presence is going to be online.”
This view is shared among some online supporters who have turned Sanders fandom into something approaching a full-time job. Rodney Latstetter, a 62-year-old retiree in Illinois who posted repeatedly in 2017 about Ms. Harris’s Hamptons fund-raising, said he and a partner spent about seven hours a day running dozens of pro-Sanders social media groups. His Twitter page boosts Mr. Sanders and raises doubts about his rivals to more than 17,000 followers.
“Some of my followers — there are a few of them that have a little bit of an issue with their mouth or something like that,” Mr. Latstetter said, adding that he was unsure if he would support any of the other Democratic candidates if they won the nomination. “I also have my moments, too, where I have my limits, and I come out fighting.”
Such digital combat has seeped perceptibly into popular culture. The singer John Legend, endorsing Ms. Warren in a tweet this month, added a note of caution for Sanders supporters: “Try not to drive people away with your nastiness. I will happily vote for him if he wins the primary. Chill.”
This did not necessarily land with its intended audience.
“Some of you millionaires need to realize that many of us actually *need* Bernie Sanders to win the Presidency,” one account replied. “We can’t just ‘chill.’”

| Jump to first hitThe Sanders campaign appeared on the brink of a commanding lead in the Democratic race. But a series of fateful decisions and internal divisions have left him all but vanquished.In mid-January, a few weeks before the Iowa caucuses, Senator Bernie Sanders's pollster offered a stark prognosis for the campaign: Mr. Sanders was on track to finish strong in the first three nominating states, but Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s powerful support from older African-Americans could make him a resilient foe in South Carolina and beyond.The pollster, Ben Tulchin, in a meeting with campaign aides, recommended a new offensive to influence older black voters, according to three people briefed on his presentation. The data showed two clear vulnerabilities for Mr. Biden: his past support for overhauling Social Security, and his authorship of a punitive criminal justice law in the 1990s.But the suggestion met with resistance. Some senior advisers argued that it wasn't worth diverting resources from Iowa and New Hampshire, people familiar with the campaign's deliberations said. Others pressed Mr. Tulchin on what kind of message, exactly, would make voters rethink their support for the most loyal ally of the first black president.Crucially, both Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane, consistently expressed reservations about going negative on Mr. Biden, preferring to stick with the left-wing policy message they have been pressing for 40 years.The warnings about Mr. Biden proved prescient: Two months later, Mr. Sanders is now all but vanquished in the Democratic presidential race, after Mr. Biden resurrected his campaign in South Carolina and built an overwhelming coalition of black voters and white moderates on Super Tuesday.While Mr. Sanders has not ended his bid, he has fallen far behind Mr. Biden in the delegate count and has taken to trumpeting his success in the battle of ideas rather than arguing that he still has a path to the nomination. His efforts to regain traction have faltered in recent weeks as the coronavirus pandemic has frozen the campaign, and perhaps heightened the appeal of Mr. Biden's safe-and-steady image.In the view of some Sanders advisers, the candidate's abrupt decline was a result of unforeseeable and highly unlikely events -- most of all, the sudden withdrawal of two major candidates, Senator Amy Klobuchar and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, who instantly threw their support to Mr. Biden and helped spur a rapid coalescing of moderate support behind his campaign.Mr. Sanders had been ""on the brink of winning,"" Mr. Tulchin argued, ""until the most unprecedented event in the history of presidential primaries occurred.""But interviews with more than three dozen Sanders aides, elected officials, activists and other people who worked with his campaign revealed a more extensive picture of his reversal of political fortune. Though Mr. Sanders climbed to a position of seeming dominance by mid-February, he and his inner circle also made a series of fateful decisions that left him ill positioned to win over skeptical Democrats -- and sorely vulnerable to an opponent with Mr. Biden's strengths.Mr. Sanders proved unable to expand his base well beyond the left or to win over African-Americans in meaningful numbers. He failed to heed warnings from traditional party leaders, and even from within his campaign, about the need to modulate his message and unify Democrats. He allowed internal arguments to fester within his campaign, an ungainly operation that fragmented into factions beneath the only two real decision makers -- Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane.Though outwardly amiable, Mr. Sanders's inner circle fractured between some long-serving counselors and relative newcomers, like Faiz Shakir, his campaign manager. Mr. Shakir and others regarded pleas from Mr. Tulchin and another pugilistic aide, David Sirota, to go on the attack against Mr. Biden as both futile and annoyingly predictable, while Mr. Shakir's internal critics saw him as exceedingly territorial.There were also serious operational mistakes: In South Carolina, the campaign effectively deputized a former Ohio state senator and loyal surrogate, Nina Turner, to direct strategy, rather than empowering a political strategist to run the pivotal early state. In private conversations, Mr. Sanders often touted his support from some younger African-Americans, seemingly missing the bigger picture.And for all of Mr. Tulchin's alarm in January about South Carolina, on the eve of the primary he was reassuring Mr. Sanders that a public poll showing him down over 20 percentage points in the state was ""an outlier for good reason.""In an email sent to Mr. Sanders and a group of senior aides, Mr. Tulchin reminded the senator that their internal polling had him trailing Mr. Biden by only four points. Two days later, the former vice president would win South Carolina by nearly 30 points.Perhaps the most significant factor, as with every presidential campaign, was the candidate himself, and the stubborn ideological and stylistic consistency that both endeared Mr. Sanders to his supporters and limited his ability to build a majority coalition larger than his own progressive movement.Mr. Sanders's campaign declined to comment for this article.It was Mr. Sanders's persistent lashing of the ""political establishment"" that concerned Representative Peter Welch, a liberal Democrat and fellow Vermonter who was one of just a few members of Congress to endorse Mr. Sanders's campaign.Mr. Welch said he had reached out to the campaign last month to implore Mr. Sanders to ease up on that rhetoric, which Mr. Welch believed sounded exclusionary to ordinary people backing other candidates. After all, Mr. Welch said, there were ""a lot of voters who are just everyday voters, who decided to vote for other Democrats.""An Inner Circle DividedIt was late January when Zephyr Teachout, a liberal law professor allied with Mr. Sanders, wrote a column in The Guardian alleging that Mr. Biden had ""a big corruption problem."" Mr. Sirota, the Sanders aide, who is known for his voluble and combative online persona, quickly blasted out her column to his large email list. A new phase of conflict between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden seemed to be underway.But Mr. Sanders put a stop to it. ""It is absolutely not my view that Joe is corrupt in any way,"" Mr. Sanders told CBS News.In private, Mr. Sanders's campaign went further, according to two people familiar with the internal turmoil. As punishment for stirring the controversy, Mr. Sirota, who is based in Colorado, was barred from traveling for the campaign outside of visits to its Washington headquarters.The conflict over Ms. Teachout's column was part of a long-running debate within the Sanders campaign about what approach to take with Mr. Biden. A small group of advisers -- including Mr. Tulchin, Ms. Turner and Mr. Sirota -- regularly pleaded with Mr. Sanders to attack the former vice president.But Mr. Sanders resisted, giving speech after speech scorching unnamed establishment Democrats but declining to pursue Mr. Biden directly. He ruled out several lines of attack against the former vice president because they touched on Mr. Biden's role in the Obama administration, which Democratic primary voters revere.Mr. Shakir and a second senior aide, Ari Rabin-Havt, took Mr. Sanders's side and repeatedly reminded other campaign officials that Mr. Sanders was the ultimate decision maker on the campaign. In conversations with associates, both men agreed that it might make sense to criticize Mr. Biden in a sharper way. But they said Mr. Sanders could not be persuaded to do so: He and Jane liked the Bidens personally, and their word was final.The fissures within the campaign leadership extended beyond how to deal with Mr. Biden.In January, efforts by Ms. Turner and others to direct some campaign resources into Super Tuesday states fizzled against opposition from Mr. Shakir and others. Mr. Shakir was adamant that Mr. Sanders's path to the nomination ran principally through Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, and the California primary on Super Tuesday.There was also a running argument within the campaign about how to handle Senator Elizabeth Warren, with some advisers viewing her as a serious threat that needed to be quashed and others, including Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Mr. Sanders's most important endorser, urging the campaign to seek conciliation.The dispute erupted publicly in January, when CNN reported that Mr. Sanders had told Ms. Warren in 2018 that he did not believe a woman could defeat President Trump, an assertion Mr. Sanders denied.Mr. Shakir escalated the conflict, daring Ms. Warren on TV to call the report a ""lie."" Jeff Weaver, a top Sanders adviser, took a different approach in his own TV appearance, suggesting there had been a misunderstanding -- a step he told associates was aimed at calming things down.But Ms. Warren stood by the account, and a clash between her and Mr. Sanders consumed the Democratic debate in Iowa. It would linger over both of them for the remainder of the race.Revolutionary to a FaultDespite the divisions within his campaign, Mr. Sanders cut a winning path through the first few states to vote, culminating with a landslide victory in Nevada on Feb. 22. In his speech that night, Mr. Sanders sounded a unifying note, focusing on his ""multigenerational, multiracial coalition.""Encountering a pair of reporters in a Las Vegas hotel that evening, Mr. Tulchin -- strolling to dinner with Mr. Weaver -- crowed that Mr. Sanders had delivered a speech worthy of the general election. Mr. Weaver was more subdued, noting that the primary fight was not over.The speech turned out to be a blip between Mr. Sanders's anti-establishment diatribes. And there was little aides could do to steer him in a different direction: The chief speechwriter on the Sanders campaign was Mr. Sanders.For months, his political advisers and outside allies had quietly mulled a shift in tone -- the possibility that Mr. Sanders might take even modest steps to show skeptical Democrats that he could unify the party.But he has always been disdainful of the art of politics and had to be nudged into wooing even friendly Democratic leaders. As Ms. Warren relentlessly courted Ms. Ocasio-Cortez last fall, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's advisers had to prod Mr. Sanders's aides into having him call her -- a conversation that eventually led to her endorsing him.Pushing Mr. Sanders to reach out to ""establishment Democrats"" whom he regularly taunted was even tougher -- despite the best efforts of even some of his staunchest supporters on the left. Ms. Ocasio-Cortez repeatedly urged the campaign to broaden Mr. Sanders's message and seek out new allies, outside his familiar base. (In a statement, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez denied any ""tension or major disagreements"" with Mr. Sanders.)RoseAnn DeMoro, the former leader of the nurses union who was one of Mr. Sanders's most ferocious surrogates in 2016, and the actor John Cusack, another ally, both pressed the campaign to refocus Mr. Sanders's pitch on a general-election audience, people familiar with their entreaties said.Mr. Cusack urged the Sanders campaign to address voters beyond its progressive base, proposing that the senator give a speech at St. Francis College in Brooklyn and citing its namesake's connection to environmentalism and fighting poverty. ""His campaign needs to create a unit that is charged with outreach to groups who do NOT identify as progressive, but have strong views that are aligned with his. EXPAND EXPAND EXPAND"" Mr. Cusack wrote to top Sanders allies and advisers, in an email obtained by The New York Times.Mr. Sanders was not interested in moving in that direction. Some advisers, who endured the divisive 2016 campaign, believed that it was only after seizing a dominant advantage that Mr. Sanders could attempt to make peace with a Democratic establishment that remained intensely wary of him.Arriving in Charleston, S.C., ahead of the Feb. 29 state primary, Mr. Weaver said the campaign had not yet sought a working relationship with figures like the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi because they wanted first to demonstrate the full sweep of their coalition on Super Tuesday three days later. He reached for a Civil War analogy to explain the muscle-flexing strategy. Abraham Lincoln did not issue the Emancipation Proclamation, Mr. Weaver said, until after Union troops turned back the Confederacy at the bloody battle of Antietam.In the weeks before Super Tuesday, Mr. Sanders had indeed refused to yield to critics who were searching for gestures of accommodation. In Nevada, leaders of the powerful Culinary Workers Union Local 226 were frustrated that Mr. Sanders did not speak out more forcefully when his supporters heaped abuse on predominantly female union leaders over their opposition to ""Medicare for all.""As Culinary officials were deluged with vitriol, including graphic and misogynistic messages, Mr. Sanders placed a phone call to the union's secretary-treasurer, Geoconda Argüello-Kline, but they never connected.""Our feeling was that Senator Sanders should have said something earlier and should have been stronger about it,"" said Bethany Khan, a political strategist for the union.And then there was Cuba: In February, Democratic officials in Florida reached out to propose convening some conversations between Mr. Sanders and Latino leaders in South Florida, many of whom were nervous about his rhetoric on socialism and revolution. The Sanders campaign showed tentative interest, people familiar with the conversations said.Then, the day after the Nevada caucuses, CBS aired a ""60 Minutes"" interview in which Mr. Sanders stood by his past praise for certain policies of Fidel Castro's government. Democrats across Florida, including prominent members of Congress, erupted in dismay.Mr. Sanders stood his ground, including in a televised debate. And he made no attempt at private damage control: None of the lawmakers who rebuked him in public heard from Mr. Sanders or his senior aides.His campaign eventually dispatched emissaries, including the actress and activist Cynthia Nixon, to meet quietly with Latino groups in Orlando after Super Tuesday, but they could not assure local Democrats that Mr. Sanders would change course before Florida's March 17 primary.""It may be authentic to Bernie, but it does not work in Florida,"" said Alex Barrio, a Democratic activist in Florida who attended the meeting. ""It's conceding Florida in a monumental way.""By the time Florida voted, however, the race was all but over.Mr. Sanders's campaign, like much of the political world, had not anticipated Mr. Biden's roaring comeback after South Carolina's Feb. 29 primary. Indeed, until then, Mr. Sanders's campaign was expecting to win seven or eight of the 14 states voting on Super Tuesday and seize a solid delegate lead over the rest of the Democratic field.So confident was Mr. Sanders that he would vanquish Mr. Biden that he spent valuable days trying to force two other candidates out of the race by campaigning in Minnesota and Massachusetts, the home states of Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Warren. He won neither.Mr. Sanders had suddenly become a spectator in the campaign, powerless to stop a tectonic shift against him by the party's moderate wing. Ms. Klobuchar called Mr. Sanders before announcing her endorsement of Mr. Biden, while Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg did not speak.After being routed across the country, Mr. Sanders knew who to blame in an appearance on ABC's ""This Week.""""What the establishment wanted was to make sure that people coalesced around Biden and try to defeat me,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""So that's not surprising.""PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders is far behind in the delegate count.

| Jump to first hitWhite working-class voters lifted Bernie Sanders to victory over Hillary Clinton in Michigan four years ago, but Joe Biden won that demographic on Super Tuesday, as well as African-Americans.GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- Dave Burdick has supported Vermont's democratic socialist in Congress since 2005, a full decade before Bernie Sanders's first presidential race.""I've been very fortunate, I've been the beneficiary of white male privilege my whole life,"" said Mr. Burdick, 65, who owns a small business in Western Michigan. ""It's not fair. We've got to change the dynamics.""He and his wife, Mary Lukens, are anxious about putting a daughter through college, saving for retirement and shouldering up to $30,000 a year in health costs. ""All these economic issues that Sanders brings up are something that we experience daily,"" Ms. Lukens said.At a Sanders rally here on Sunday, the couple skewed older than most others by about a generation, though they shared the disdain of the Sanders youth brigade for moderate Democrats like Joseph R. Biden Jr. ""Growing up during Nam, you look around and just want a choice for a change,"" Mr. Burdick said. ""You know what -- we were right back then and we're right now.""With Mr. Biden the beneficiary of a surge after carrying 10 states on Super Tuesday last week, Sanders supporters in Michigan, which votes Tuesday, know they are his firewall in the first of several Midwest states going to the polls in the next two weeks, likely writing his fate.Even as Mr. Biden is heading a bandwagon with former 2020 rivals and moderate Democratic voters clambering aboard, Mr. Sanders has a loyal base that is emotionally bound to him, an attachment rooted in their own economic struggles and lived experiences, rather than triangulating the most electable candidate.Tuesday's primary contests, in six states including Missouri and Washington, are unfolding against a backdrop of high anxiety over the economic and health consequences of the coronavirus outbreak. For most Sanders voters, plummeting stock prices matter less than the broader injustices he champions around wage inequality, health care and student loan debt.If Mr. Sanders defies expectations in Michigan, a state he won in the 2016 primary, it will be because his all-out efforts here over the last four days succeeded in broadening his support, reversing the demographic trends that broke against him on Super Tuesday.While doubling his organizing staff in the state to 25, he is running TV ads that attack Mr. Biden on trade and Social Security, expanding his outreach to voters and holding a multitude of events.Meanwhile, a confident Mr. Biden scheduled only one visit to the state in recent days, on Monday, when he planned a rally in Detroit with Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. Mr. Booker endorsed the former vice president on Monday. Earlier he sent Senator Amy Klobuchar for a couple of low-key events.""If you look at what Joe's running here versus what we're running here,"" Bill Neidhardt, a Sanders spokesman, said over the weekend, ""they'll send a surrogate or two out here, but we're going to have Bernie talk to as many people as possible, and then we're going to have door knockers talk to as many people as possible.""On Sunday, according to campaign counts, Mr. Sanders drew crowds of more than 7,000 in Grand Rapids, where the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the two-time presidential candidate, endorsed him, and over 10,000 in Ann Arbor, where he was introduced by America's second most popular democratic socialist, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York.""In order for us to win we have to grow, we must be inclusive, we must bring more people into this movement,"" Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said.One possible sign of progress in widening his coalition is that former supporters of Senator Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out of the Democratic presidential race last week but has yet to make an endorsement, were not hard to find in the Sanders multitudes. One of them, Tom Sapkowski, said, ""I don't think Biden's a hard enough left turn.""Mr. Sapkowski, who worked 35 years ""turning wrenches"" as an auto mechanic, has lived the contradictions of the American economy, where unemployment is low but incomes for those who aren't rich feel like they've flatlined. ""Things have not changed for the middle class for the past 50 years,"" he said. He remembered ""during the Clinton administration where I made like 80, 90 grand, but apparently that was too much.""His wife, Kim, who lost her job as an education administrator in January, said: ""I was just thinking this morning, my dad, he was 58 when he retired from the telephone company. He had a very nice retirement. Belonged to the union. And here I am 55 and nowhere near to retiring.""Younger voters often brought up the huge burden of college debt for their generation, which Mr. Sanders proposes to cancel.At a rally on Saturday in Flint, as well as one on Friday in Detroit -- both cities with majority black populations -- the Sanders supporters were largely a sea of white faces. They revealed that Mr. Sanders has not overcome his weakness with black voters. Despite years of outreach to African-Americans since his loss to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 Democratic race, Mr. Sanders saw black voters choosing his rival in Southern states on Super Tuesday.He won Michigan that year -- the high-water mark of his campaign -- by carrying white voters, especially whites without a college degree, who represented more than one in three voters. Winning those voters again not just in Michigan but in Ohio and Illinois, which vote on March 17, undergirds Mr. Sanders's hope for a comeback.His TV ads and his speeches hammer Mr. Biden for supporting trade deals including the North American Free Trade Agreement, reviled by many factory workers, and for past statements suggesting an openness to cutting Social Security.""This city got destroyed by NAFTA,"" said Glenn Chatters, a Sanders supporter in Flint, who works as a heating and air conditioning installer. In 1992, he voted for the third-party candidate Ross Perot because of his warnings about trade deals.He is hopeful, if not entirely optimistic, that Mr. Sanders can again win working-class white voters in Michigan, many of whom in 2016 may have been voting against Mrs. Clinton and have since been lost to President Trump.""I hope that people actually stop and listen to what he actually has to say, instead of the party lines,"" Mr. Chatters said. ""Sometimes people are so swayed by the term 'socialism' when they're driving on their free roads, they're taking their kids to the free school.""In the Super Tuesday primaries, it was Mr. Biden who won working-class white voters, helping him to carry Northern states including Maine and Minnesota, an ominous sign for Mr. Sanders. Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said he was skeptical of Mr. Sanders's ability to repeat his 2016 Michigan win, or his chances elsewhere in the Midwest, because Democrats this year, who singularly want to beat Mr. Trump, are less open to revisiting arguments over trade or Social Security.""Voters, astonishingly, have taken over the nominating process,"" he said. ""Biden did well among blacks, suburban whites and white working-class voters because they want him to take on Trump. That was so powerful on Super Tuesday.""Most Sanders supporters said they would grieve his failure to win the nomination if it comes to that, but they would vote for Mr. Biden in November. But not all.In Flint, the fiery Harvard professor Cornel West, a Sanders surrogate, wound up the crowd by accusing Mr. Biden of being ""a neoliberal,"" eliciting hearty boos. Afterward, an audience member, Bob Granville, echoed the critique. Neoliberalism, he said, ""means socialism for the rich and a rugged capitalism for everyone else.""If Mr. Biden is the nominee, said Mr. Granville, a retired work-force trainer, he plans to vote for a third-party candidate in protest. ""People say, oh, you're going to be part of letting Trump in there. I say, if you're going to run Biden, we deserve Trump.""Despite the avowed desire of the Sanders campaign to broaden his appeal, Mr. Sanders himself has a penchant for pushing away moderate voters he needs by frequently attacking the Democratic ""establishment."" On Sunday, he accused party leaders of forcing Ms. Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., out of the race to help Mr. Biden ""and try to defeat me.""David Betras, a former Democratic chairman of Mahoning County, Ohio, in an industrial region where Mr. Trump did well in 2016, said he feared that the more Mr. Sanders attacks ""the establishment,"" the more enraged his supporters will become, with many likely to sit out the general election. ""His supporters are fervent and will feel betrayed by Democrats.""That is not an inevitability. Mr. Sanders explicitly tells supporters in nearly every speech that he will back Mr. Biden as the nominee.And there are anecdotal signs that Mr. Sanders may be growing support.Eric Mays, a city councilman in Flint, arrived as an undecided voter to his rally there on Saturday, which was billed as ""a town hall on racial and economic justice.""""Bernie has got me fired up,"" he said. ""I might very well be voting Bernie on Tuesday.""Mr. Mays said that despite the overwhelming support of black voters in Southern states for Mr. Biden, Michigan could break differently. ""We know Bernie Sanders will get black voters out of Flint,"" he said.""I hope that we see him all the way through this year.""PhotographWhite working-class voters lifted Bernie Sanders past Hillary Clinton in Michigan four years ago, but Joe Biden won that demographic on Super Tuesday.; Mr. Sanders at a rally Saturday in Grand Rapids, Mich.

| Jump to first hitThe president who believes he can control events is confronted by further evidence that he cannot.
On Monday, President Trump was already having a bad week.
The coronavirus was spreading, the stock market was plummeting and his administration was getting blamed for an inadequate response to a health crisis.
Then came Tuesday. Joseph R. Biden Jr., whom Mr. Trump was so eager to paint as corrupt that his attempts to do so led to his impeachment, pulled off one of the most remarkable political comebacks in recent history, winning nine states and joining Senator Bernie Sanders as a front-runner in the Democratic presidential race.
U.S. stocks did make a comeback on Wednesday, closing nearly 1,200 points up, which counted as good news for a president betting the farm on a healthy economy. The bad news was the reason many analysts cited for the gains was Mr. Biden’s Super Tuesday victories.
For Mr. Trump, whose belief in his own ability to shape external events is a source of comfort, it has been a week of confronting the fact that almost nothing is in his control right now.
He has dealt with the coronavirus, the first external crisis of his administration, by repeating a string of falsehoods rather than delivering reassurance. He has claimed, falsely, that a vaccine would be ready within months when in reality, it won’t be ready for more than a year. And his insistence that his administration deserves an “A+++” for its response has done little to calm the rattled markets or an anxious electorate.
There has long been a disconnect between the way Mr. Trump sees politics and the way his more seasoned advisers do. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has been focused on Mr. Sanders and his longtime rival Michael R. Bloomberg. But privately, several advisers said on Wednesday that they were not surprised that Democrats rallied around Mr. Biden, even if the president was.
And they anticipated an ugly slog of a campaign going forward, with the brutal 2016 general election race against Hillary Clinton serving as a reminder of how Mr. Trump will try to tarnish his rivals, even as voters on Tuesday appeared to favor a candidate who projected calm stability over upheaval and uncertainty.
Trump campaign officials said on Wednesday that they viewed Mr. Biden as “Hillary Clinton Lite,” a candidate who they will argue generated little enthusiasm of his own while coasting off the opposition to the president and Mr. Sanders among Democrats. They said they planned to undercut his support from black voters by highlighting Mr. Biden’s vote for the now-controversial 1994 crime bill, while talking up Mr. Trump’s work on criminal justice reform.
And they said they would seek to elevate his backing of trade policies like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal that originated under President Barack Obama.
But they face a daunting challenge. Mr. Obama remains deeply popular with Democratic voters, and highlighting Mr. Biden’s work with him could simply energize his supporters to turn out for him in the fall if he is the nominee. And unlike Mrs. Clinton, who was viewed negatively by a large swath of voters over decades, Mr. Biden may have a stronger bond with some voters in his party.
Mr. Trump’s frustration over the election results was evident in one of his early-morning Twitter posts on Wednesday — a screed against Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general who was forced into a runoff for his old Senate seat in Alabama, and whom Mr. Trump still blames for the two-year inquiry into a possible conspiracy between his 2016 campaign and Russian officials.
“This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States & then doesn’t have the wisdom or courage to stare down & end the phony Russia Witch Hunt. Recuses himself on FIRST DAY in office, and the Mueller Scam begins!” Mr. Trump tweeted, after Mr. Sessions fell short of securing a majority in the Republican primary.
In a moment of uncertainty, Mr. Trump appeared to be grasping at the equivalent of comfort food: attacking Mr. Sessions. It was, people close to the president said, his reward for staying quiet during Mr. Sessions’s primary race, and also a way for the president to highlight a race in which his sustained attacks on Mr. Sessions before the campaign ultimately affected his ability to cleanly win.
It was also clear that Mr. Trump’s attempt to dictate the contours of the Democratic presidential contest has had little comparable effect.
For months, Mr. Trump has told aides he believes he can shape the Democratic race to his own advantage by focusing on specific candidates. And he has been more overt than any incumbent in trying to influence the nominating contest of another party, training his Twitter feed on his potential rivals and trying to deepen authentic divisions in the Democratic Party by stoking fears that the establishment was trying to rob Mr. Sanders of the nomination.
In January, he floated the idea that the Senate impeachment trial was intended to keep Mr. Sanders grounded in Washington instead of campaigning in Iowa before the caucuses there.
“They are rigging the election again against Bernie Sanders, just like last time, only even more obviously,” Mr. Trump tweeted. That month, Trump aides also began to see Mr. Sanders as their ideal Democratic opponent in November and sought to elevate his profile.
The president began singling out Mr. Sanders at his “Keep America Great” rallies as well as on Twitter. “Bernie is going up,” Mr. Trump said in January at a rally in Toledo, Ohio. “He’s surging. Crazy Bernie, he’s surging.” He has also highlighted the senator’s surges in the polls.
Another target was Mr. Bloomberg, who spent millions of dollars on ads attacking Mr. Trump and had no compunction contrasting his wealth with the president’s.
On Tuesday, as polls opened in 14 states, the president tried a directive to voters in Texas and Oklahoma. “Mini Mike Bloomberg will kill your drilling, fracking and pipelines,” he tweeted. “Petroleum based ‘anything’ is dead. Energy jobs gone. Don’t vote for Mini Mike!”
Mr. Bloomberg’s withdrawal from the race on Wednesday may provide Mr. Trump with a small measure of comfort. But it also presents a looming challenge for his campaign, as Mr. Bloomberg has promised to spend $1 billion to help the Democratic nominee and immediately threw his support to Mr. Biden.
Also a challenge is the surprise surge of a candidate with a genuine connection with African-American voters, the essential element to Mr. Biden’s success on Super Tuesday.
The Trump campaign has recently put money and time into trying to expand the president’s popularity among black voters, employing tactics like opening storefronts in black neighborhoods and devoting a Super Bowl ad to overhauling the criminal justice system. Mr. Trump won only 8 percent of the black vote in 2016, but his campaign operatives thought that facing a candidate like Mr. Sanders, who had his own challenge winning over African-American voters, created an opportunity for Mr. Trump.
But for months, Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, and his work for Burisma, a problem-plagued energy company in Ukraine, have been the main concern of the president and his advisers. That effort was central to the impeachment inquiry into whether Mr. Trump tried to pressure Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens in exchange for releasing military aid.
The damage to the president was obvious, but the former vice president’s candidacy also suffered. His poll standing fell as he struggled to answer questions from reporters and voters about his son.
But the revival of Mr. Biden illustrates the limits of Mr. Trump’s influence.
“I think Democratic primary voters are numbing to Trump’s buffoonery — black voters in particular,” said Addisu Demissie, who managed Senator Cory Booker’s presidential campaign. “They are the ones who have breathed life back into Biden’s campaign and, if anything, they may relish seeing Biden take him down.”
The only real role that Mr. Trump appeared to play on Tuesday was to ensure that electability was a chief concern for Democratic voters and was the basis for Mr. Biden’s support.
“I would describe him as Sideshow Bob in this process,” said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. “There’s no evidence that he’s commanding a large army of voters who are affecting Democratic primaries.”
Despite his lack of influence, Mr. Trump appeared eager on Wednesday to continue his kibbitzing-from-the-sidelines role. “No question on the election?” he asked reporters in the Roosevelt Room, where he met with airline executives about the coronavirus.
The president smiled as White House aides quickly shuffled reporters out of the room.

| Jump to first hitUnless a moderate favorite soon emerges, party leaders may increasingly look to Michael R. Bloomberg as a potential savior.MANCHESTER, N.H. -- The Democratic presidential primary is entering an intensely tumultuous phase, after two early contests that have left former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. reeling and elevated Senator Bernie Sanders but failed to make any candidate a dominant force in the battle for the party's nomination.Within the Democratic establishment, the results have deepened a mood of anxiety and frustration: The collapse of Mr. Biden's support in the first two states, and the fragmentation of moderate voters among several other candidates, allowed Mr. Sanders, a Vermont progressive, to claim a victory in New Hampshire and a split decision in Iowa with former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.In both states, a majority of voters supported candidates closer to the political center and named defeating President Trump as their top priority, but there was no overwhelming favorite among those voters as to which moderate was the best alternative to Mr. Sanders. Unless such a favorite soon emerges, party leaders may increasingly look to Michael R. Bloomberg as a potential savior.In an unmistakable sign of Mr. Bloomberg's growing strength and Mr. Biden's decline, three black members of Congress endorsed the former mayor of New York City on Wednesday, including Representative Lucy McBath of Georgia, a high-profile lawmaker and gun-control champion in her first term -- and a senior adviser to Mr. Bloomberg told campaign staff that internal polling showed the former mayor now tied with Mr. Biden among African-Americans in March primary states.The turmoil in the party has the potential to extend the primary season, exacerbating internal divisions and putting off the headache of uniting for the general election for months.The Democrats' proportional system of allocating delegates could make it all but impossible to avert such an outcome. With no winner-take-all contests, and no indication yet that Mr. Sanders can broaden his appeal or that a moderate can coalesce support, the candidates are poised to keep splitting delegates three or four ways, as they did in Iowa and New Hampshire.""We are obviously going to have a longer battle here,"" said Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster who directed an anti-Sanders ad campaign in Iowa.The leading candidates are plainly worried about the party's divisions, and signaled as much in their speeches in New Hampshire on primary night: Mr. Sanders, blamed by much of the party for his slashing approach to the 2016 primaries, stressed in his victory speech that the most important task was defeating Mr. Trump, while Mr. Buttigieg urged his supporters to ""vote blue, no matter who"" in November.In a particularly urgent plea, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who slumped to a fourth-place finish on Tuesday, warned that no candidate should be ""willing to burn down the rest of the party in order to be the last man standing.""At the moment, no one is close to being the last candidate standing. But unless another Democrat rapidly consolidates support, Mr. Sanders could continue to win primaries and caucuses without broadening his political appeal, purely on the strength of his rock-solid base on the left -- a prospect that alarms Democratic Party leaders who view Mr. Sanders and his slogan of democratic socialism as wildly risky bets in a general election.The Biden team stoked that sense of alarm on Wednesday: Representative Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a co-chairman of Mr. Biden's national campaign and a former chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, warned on a conference call with reporters that Democrats would risk ""down-ballot carnage"" if they selected Mr. Sanders.""If Bernie Sanders was at the top of the ticket, we would be in jeopardy of losing the House,"" Mr. Richmond said. ""We would not get the Senate back.""Yet in a reflection of the multidimensional melee that allowed Mr. Sanders to claim victory in New Hampshire with the smallest plurality of any winner in decades, Mr. Richmond also criticized two other candidates, Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Buttigieg, lumping them into the same risky group and arguing that Democrats should not ""take a chance with a self-defined socialist, a mayor of a very small city, a billionaire who all of a sudden is a Democrat.""Mr. Mellman said Mr. Sanders would continue to benefit as long as there was a relative abundance of moderate candidates in the race. ""The longer more of those people stay in,"" he said, ""the easier it is for Sanders to skate through.""There is no sign that any of the half-dozen major candidates left in the race are headed for the exits: Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Biden will have to contend in the Nevada caucuses against Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who finished a strong third in New Hampshire, while on the left Mr. Sanders still faces a dogged competitor in Ms. Warren. Unless one candidate comes out of Nevada and South Carolina with a powerful upper hand, it is quite likely that the same atomized delegate count could continue into Super Tuesday, when 15 states and territories, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all delegates in the Democratic race, cast ballots on March 3.Indeed, with early voting already taking place in California and other Super Tuesday states, and no dominant front-runner, the fragmentation may already be well underway.In Arkansas, a Super Tuesday state where early voting starts next week, a poll taken after Iowa illustrated the Democrats' dilemma: Mr. Bloomberg, Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg were each winning 16 to 20 percent of the vote.All of those candidates are increasingly confronting Mr. Bloomberg's presence as a rival in the March primaries. Mr. Bloomberg skipped all four February contests but has climbed into double digits in national polls on the strength of an enormous and sustained advertising campaign, funded from his personal fortune.On a conference call with campaign staff members on Wednesday afternoon, Howard Wolfson, Mr. Bloomberg's senior adviser, said that internal tracking data showed that the former mayor had pulled ""very narrowly"" into first place across the March primary states, inching ahead of Mr. Sanders over all and tying Mr. Biden among African-American voters.Though Mr. Wolfson did not provide specific numbers, he said Mr. Biden had ""rather precipitously fallen"" in the larger array of states voting next month, according to Bloomberg polling.But Mr. Bloomberg is facing new tests as a candidate: For the first time, he may qualify for a televised debate, next week in Las Vegas, and he has come under newly direct criticism from other Democrats for his record on policing and much else.Mr. Wolfson acknowledged as much on the conference call, telling staff members that Mr. Bloomberg would have a ""bigger target on his back"" as his numbers rose. He said Mr. Bloomberg would address scrutiny of his support for stop-and-frisk policing by calling it ""the biggest regret of his 12 years as mayor,"" and saying that the language he had used in the past to defend it did not ""reflect who he is or what is in his heart.""But the recently circulated audio recording of Mr. Bloomberg in 2015 matter-of-factly stating that ""the real crime is"" almost always committed by young ""male minorities"" quickly ricocheted across the tight-knit community of black political leaders.J. Todd Rutherford, the minority leader of the South Carolina House, said many African-Americans had increasingly recognized that Mr. Biden did not have ""what it takes"" and had been ready to bolt to the former New York mayor.""A lot of people would've said Bloomberg last week, but now I don't know,"" said Mr. Rutherford, alluding to the recording and declaring that the gnawing uncertainty hanging over the Democratic race was ""really scary.""Mr. Biden and other candidates have indicated that they intend to challenge Mr. Bloomberg on race in the coming days, and his resiliency, or lack thereof, on the subject could shape the primary campaign.Yet even supporters of Mr. Biden acknowledge that if one of the moderates doesn't take a clear lead with that faction of the party after Nevada, the eyes of many establishment-aligned Democrats will turn to Manhattan.""The longer the waters are muddy, the better off Bloomberg is,"" said former Gov. Jim Hodges of South Carolina, who recently backed Mr. Biden.The campaign in Nevada is as disordered as anything else in the Democratic race, according to people closely watching the contest there. But as in New Hampshire, Mr. Biden long held a considerable advantage as the candidate perceived as the safe and electable choice, while Mr. Sanders entered the race with a strong bloc carried over from his last run for the presidency. It remains to be seen whether Mr. Biden will bleed support there as rapidly as he did in New Hampshire, or whether any other candidate will be able to take advantage of his fall.Tick Segerblom, a prominent Sanders backer in the state who is a member of the Clark County Commission, said Mr. Biden's national plunge would upend the campaign in Nevada. He said that Mr. Sanders could count his ""25 percent,"" but that his ability to expand his coalition was an open question.""Bernie is still alive and Biden is definitely a disaster,"" Mr. Segerblom said. ""I think Pete is going to do very well -- he'll be able to pick up the Biden people.""Representative Dina Titus, perhaps the most prominent Biden supporter in the state, said the campaign needed to send in the political cavalry to stave off defeat.""He could certainly use more hands -- and they're supposedly coming now,"" she said.She added that she would spend her time helping Mr. Biden with senior groups and labor unions. But the former vice president's hope that the most influential union in the state, the Culinary Workers, would endorse him in an effort to halt Mr. Sanders has been dimmed after his poor performance in the first two states.In South Carolina, even moderate Democrats who are sympathetic to Mr. Biden believe he's in grave danger of losing the state.""He's wounded,"" Tyler Jones, a Charleston-based Democratic strategist, said of the former vice president. Like other political professionals in the state, Mr. Jones is increasingly less concerned about Mr. Biden's weakness than about the billionaire Tom Steyer's strength -- and what it means for the nominating process.Mr. Steyer has been pouring money into South Carolina, cutting into Mr. Biden's lead with black voters and raising the specter of Mr. Sanders's winning another state with a plurality thanks to a divided electorate.""A vote for Steyer is a vote for Bernie, which is a vote for Trump,"" said Mr. Jones, who believes Mr. Sanders cannot win the general election and wants to stop his campaign ""dead in its tracks."" But he acknowledged that urging voters to act strategically and reject Mr. Steyer was easier in theory than in execution.Other Democrats are turning to what they believe is a more simple solution.In early January, Representative Gregory Meeks of New York offered an off-the-cuff assessment of the Democratic race: Should Mr. Biden wheeze in the early states, many in the party would turn to Mr. Bloomberg as a Plan B.""If Mr. Biden can't get out of New Hampshire and Iowa, then Bloomberg has Super Tuesday,"" Mr. Meeks said at the time.On Wednesday, he was one of the three black lawmakers who endorsed Mr. Bloomberg.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.PhotographMichael R. Bloomberg at a rally on Wednesday in Chattanooga, Tenn., one of the Super Tuesday states that he is betting on to propel his campaign.

| Jump to first hitWeeks ago, his advisers were counting on a strong economy and a Democratic opponent easily portrayed as too far left. But the political landscape has sharply shifted.President Trump faces the biggest challenge yet to his prospects of being re-elected, with his advisers' two major assumptions for the campaign -- a booming economy and an opponent easily vilified as too far left -- quickly evaporating.After a year in which Mr. Trump has told voters that they must support his re-election or risk watching the economy decline, the stock market is reeling and economists are warning that a recession could be on the horizon because of the worsening spread of the coronavirus.And instead of elevating Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, as Mr. Trump made clear was his hope, Democrats have suddenly and decisively swung from a flirtation with socialism to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has run a primary campaign centered on a return to political normalcy.""Biden's success in the suburbs makes him an acceptable alternative to Trump,"" said Scott Reed, the top political adviser for the United States Chamber of Commerce. ""His turnout in the suburbs threatens the Republican Senate.""That presents Mr. Trump with a confounding new political landscape, one that close advisers concede he had seemed unwilling or unable to accept until Wednesday, when he addressed the nation about the pandemic.""If it was Warren or Bernie and you don't have coronavirus, I think Trump might sneak by,"" said Kevin DeWine, the former chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. ""But if it's Biden, 'My I.R.A. has tanked,' and we're going to have complete disruption because of coronavirus, I think it's a totally different story.""Ohio, a traditional presidential battleground that has been trending Republican, would be in play again, Mr. DeWine said. Such Midwestern states were central to Mr. Trump's election in 2016, and are likely to be similarly crucial this year.Of course, what happens in March may ultimately have little bearing in November. Mr. Trump maintains the bully pulpit of the presidency, and Mr. Biden largely avoided intense scrutiny from rivals in a crowded, up-and-down primary campaign.And if there's any constant in the Trump era, it is that what's in the news at a given moment will change in a matter of hours, days or at most weeks. The virus may be mitigated, the economy could rebound, and Mr. Biden's decades of life in Washington and propensity for gaffes may render him as weak a candidate as some of his rivals in the primary had long predicted.Yet if Mr. Trump does lose re-election, the seeds of demise may prove to have been planted in early spring.One challenge for the president is that the type of management response required of chief executives during crises like a pandemic has never been his strength. Empathy and public displays of emotion do not come easily to him. On Twitter, his favorite medium, he has been consumed by how people are perceiving his handling of the crisis and has focused on criticizing Democrats.And so far, he has resisted entreaties from advisers to cancel events, or to send a strong signal that he's willing to put the political season on hold as the full effects of the coronavirus are assessed.""A leader needs to be transparent, clear, empathetic, serious, and all-in,"" said Jeb Bush, a former governor of Florida who ran against Mr. Trump in the 2016 Republican primary and received bipartisan praise for how he handled hurricanes during his tenure. ""A leader needs to communicate consistently and regularly. A leader needs to show his or her heart, which has to be done outside the governor's mansion or the White House.""Mr. Bush added that a leader needs ""to shut down partisan politics and campaigning"" and ""to trust the experts and allow the strategy to be developed with them,"" as well as think about how to deal with the recovery.Mr. Biden, by contrast, has had his entire political life defined by his personal tragedies -- including the death of his wife and daughter decades ago, and then his eldest son, Beau, more recently -- and his efforts to rise from them and encourage others to do the same.On Wednesday afternoon, shortly before he was scheduled to speak to reporters, Mr. Trump rebuked congressional Democrats, who have indicated they aren't waiting for the president's guidance on an economic package to help the economy. ""Someone needs to tell the Democrats in Congress that CoronaVirus doesn't care what party you are in. We need to protect ALL Americans!"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.In interviews, a half-dozen Republicans close to the president's campaign said that his re-election effort had become a political battleship, slow and creaky to turn, unlike the nimble race Mr. Trump ran in 2016. Several advisers worked on Tuesday to persuade Mr. Trump not to let the campaign announce a rally tentatively scheduled for the end of the month in Florida; those advisers ultimately won.Aides have sent mixed signals about how they plan to approach Mr. Biden, with some wanting to portray him as a 2020 version of Hillary Clinton, and others wanting to try to define him as interchangeable with Mr. Sanders because of some of the progressive stances Mr. Biden has adopted.Primary results cannot easily be projected onto general elections, but the surge in Democratic turnout so far has not only helped Mr. Biden, it has also illustrated what may be Mr. Trump's most glaring vulnerability. The former vice president has established a commanding delegate lead in part because of a surge of suburban voters including many from affluent jurisdictions.In Virginia, North Carolina and Michigan -- each a general election battleground -- Mr. Biden benefited from a large increase in turnout among moderate voters in the Washington, Charlotte and Detroit suburbs.In Michigan, for example, over a million and a half voters participated in the Democratic primary Tuesday -- up from just over 1.2 million in 2016 there. But it was where the turnout jumped so much that was revealing and, for Mr. Trump, ominous. In affluent Oakland County, Mitt Romney's boyhood home and an epicenter of the Democrats' 2018 midterm election gains, turnout went from approximately 180,000 in 2016 to about 260,000 on Tuesday.Mr. Trump's team of actual political strategists is small, despite the large staff employed by his campaign, and his campaign manager only recently relocated to Washington, where the headquarters is based. After data leaked early on, information is closely guarded and formal polling is ordered only every few months. On Tuesday, as Mr. Trump sat with advisers in the late morning going over the results of the latest campaign surveys, some of the data was already out of date.Representative Francis Rooney, a Florida Republican who is not seeking re-election, said the likelihood that Mr. Biden would be the nominee alone ""makes this a race.""Mr. Rooney said Mr. Biden was ""moderate, well-reasoned and genuinely likable -- none of those things are what Sanders are.""And echoing a number of leading officials in both parties, Mr. Rooney said that if Mr. Biden wins the nomination, it would illustrate the degree to which 2016 was a referendum on the Democratic nominee rather than on Mr. Trump.""The question is how many people voted for him because they didn't want Hillary Clinton,"" he said, arguing that Mr. Biden's center-left politics effectively made him ""Hillary without the other negatives.""Mr. Trump's advisers argue otherwise -- and indeed it was their enthusiasm for digging into the record of Mr. Biden's son Hunter that led to the president's impeachment.But what alarms many Republicans about the political impact of the virus is that it will so overwhelm the news that it will be difficult to highlight their opposition research about Mr. Biden or draw attention to his gaffes.One prominent party strategist working on a number of congressional races this year said a series of polls taken in the last two weeks showed the president's approval ratings receding to where they were before the 2018 midterms, giving back the gains he made in the aftermath of his impeachment acquittal.This strategist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about Mr. Trump, said he worried the virus and its effects on the economy would make this campaign entirely about the president, much like the 2018 midterms.And no modern president may perform better with a foil or worse when measured in his own right than Mr. Trump.Nonetheless, there have been some constants in terms of how Mr. Trump is perceived by voters.""The president's job approval has bounced around between 42 percent and 46 percent ever since the spring of 2018, so variation within that range should not be interpreted as anything particularly significant,"" said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. ""If he should break above 46 percent or below 42 percent in the polling averages, then I'll start to take that seriously.""Representative Chip Roy, a Texas Republican facing a potentially competitive re-election, said it was premature to make sweeping assessments about an election so far off. ""That's a lifetime in politics, especially today,"" he said.But he did offer Mr. Trump a dose of tough-love advice and, in doing so, he suggested that the president's prospects might hinge in part on how he handles the current health crisis.""Don't talk about politics, just march forward and do your job,"" Mr. Roy said, adding that voters would ask, ""'Did we react properly?' That's how the judgment will fall.""Mr. Rooney was even more pointed, urging Mr. Trump to show leadership and take drastic steps to curb the spread of the virus. ""He ought to be doing what other countries are doing,"" he said, such as urging people to stay home, closing schools and demanding public events be rescheduled. ""It's a serious health risk here and you've got to ask: Where is the United States?""But former Representative Kevin Yoder, a Kansas Republican swept out in the 2018 suburban backlash to Mr. Trump, said that Mr. Biden's ascent had greatly complicated Mr. Trump's prospects.""Joe Biden will be very palatable to some of the same moderates who voted against Republicans in the midterms,"" said Mr. Yoder, predicting that Republicans would need embittered Sanders supporters to stay home because ""we're not going to see a flip back of suburban independents.""Mr. DeWine put it more bluntly: ""If it's Biden, you'll have disaffected Republicans run to the polls to vote for Biden because they're just looking for normal and sane,"" he said.PhotographPresident Trump, who was counting on a racing economy and a strong showing by Senator Bernie Sanders, now faces the prospect of a moderate opponent in former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., left, and a possible recession.

| Jump to first hitSome executives at small companies have reservations about President Trump, but also concerns about Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren.When it comes to President Trump's economic policies, there is not much that appeals to Grady Cope, the founder of a machining and assembly company in Englewood, Colo.He doesn't approve of tariffs, which have disrupted his supply chains and raised costs. He is turned off by the president's disparagement of immigrants. And while small businesses routinely thank the administration for hacking through a regulatory thicket, he said of the pre-Trump rule book, ""I can't think of one time that it affected me or slowed growth.""""I lean more to the liberal side of things,"" said Mr. Cope, who employs 47 people at his firm, Reata Engineering and Machine Works. Yet even though he supports a higher minimum wage and is open to the idea of ""Medicare for all,"" he is leery of two of the leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination.""I probably won't go as far left on issues as Sanders and Warren,"" he said.Wall Street's disdain for the bottom-up populist campaigns of Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont has gotten a lot of attention. The candidates' full-throated attacks on corporate greed, extreme wealth and banking excesses are backed up by ambitious plans to upend the industry's everyday operations.Wariness extends far beyond an elite financial fellowship, though, to many small and medium-size businesses whose executives are not reflexively Republican but worry that the ascendancy of a left-wing Democrat would create an anti-business climate. In their view, sweeping plans to remake the health care system or slash the cost of higher education will mean higher taxes for businesses and the middle class, no matter what candidates promise.But if policy is an issue, so is tone. In campaign speeches and debates, some said, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren portray businesses as exploiting the American economic system instead of building it, and as contributing to income inequality instead of creating wealth.Michael Brady, the owner of two employment franchises in Jacksonville, Fla., is one of the independent business executives interviewed who feel unappreciated. ""I get up before 6 o'clock every morning and work hard,"" he said. ""I put 200 people to work every week.""Mr. Brady, 53, said he voted for Barack Obama in 2012 and Mr. Trump in 2016. Since then, he said, some of the president's actions and ""some of his tweets"" have made him cringe.He said he could vote for a Democrat this year. But he finds several of the economic proposals from the party's left wing off-putting, mentioning free college tuition and a nationwide $15-an-hour minimum wage.What particularly irks Mr. Brady, though, are some of Ms. Warren's statements about successful entrepreneurs' not having built their businesses entirely on their own. Attacks on the country's wealthy elite have also grated.""When did the word millionaire or billionaire become a bad word?"" he asked. ""I cheer those people on because they've lived the American dream.""Ms. Warren has explained for years that she, too, cheers hard-driven capitalists, but adds that as important as private enterprise is, its successes are built on governmental investments like roads, education, police officers and firefighters. And so the winners, she argues, need to share more of their haul.To Mr. Brady, though, the comments sound like an insult. ""It's strictly the pro-business mentality that drives me to vote,"" he said.In the meantime, Mr. Trump has fueled such feelings by referring to the Democrats as ""radical socialists.""Democratic moderates warn that a leftward tilt in the party's presidential nomination could alienate potential swing voters like Mr. Brady. Some point to Mr. Obama's recent warning that ""the average American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system.""""Even as we push the envelope and we are bold in our vision, we also have to be rooted in reality,"" Mr. Obama told a group of donors in November.Candidates like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have sought to dominate the political center lane. But none has matched the degree of enthusiasm and devotion that Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have generated among supporters inspired by prospects of visionary change.The belief that voters are yearning for another moderate alternative recently helped motivate former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts to reverse their decisions to forgo the 2020 election.The billionaire Mr. Bloomberg, who announced his candidacy in November, has emphasized his background as a self-made business executive. In an early advertisement, he described himself as ""a middle-class kid who made good."" Mr. Patrick, a friend of Mr. Obama's, has positioned himself as someone who wants to bring people together and looks for middle ground.But even with the first Democratic contests weeks away, the November presidential election can seem far off.Beri Fox, president and chief executive of Marble King in Paden City, W.Va., possibly the last American manufacturer of toy marbles, said she had not yet focused on the candidates' overall plans, just ""bits and pieces.""Making sure American companies can compete with China is a priority for her, said Ms. Fox, who employs 28 people. She hopes that Mr. Trump's confrontational approach on trade will work in the long run, but also feels that Mr. Biden cares deeply about domestic manufacturers. She has not decided whom to support for president.For some, the battle for the Democratic nomination is still mostly background noise.With so many candidates still in contention, ""it just doesn't seem worth my time to pick a heartthrob at this time,"" said Rick Woldenberg, chief executive of Learning Resources in Vernon Hills, Ill., a family-owned manufacturer of educational materials and toys.Mr. Woldenberg's primary concern is the future of his business, which employs more than 200 people. The 2017 tax cuts engineered by Mr. Trump and his party helped generate more cash for investment, he said, but tariffs on imports have been punishing, raising the cost of materials and straining relations with customers and international vendors.He also finds the president's routine combativeness unsettling, not to mention his impeachment.""I tend to favor politicians who are more moderate in their views,"" Mr. Woldenberg said. ""And I would not consider Trump to be especially moderate.""Yet neither are Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, he said. Labeling them ""very extreme,"" he said that expensive plans like Medicare for all would depress the economy and that a wealth tax would be ""catastrophic.""The generally positive economic outlook, of course, could shift significantly in the coming year. The recent flare-up in tensions between the United States and Iran was a reminder that by the time of the election, international events could eclipse domestic ones.At the moment, though, executives are focused on their businesses.Tom Gimbel, the founder and chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago-based employment agency, is looking for a candidate who will promote economic growth.""Trump may be a loose cannon on international stuff, but domestically Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are loose cannons on restricting business,"" Mr. Gimbel said. ""Giving things away for free is a slap in the face for people who played by the rules. Where does it stop? Are we going to start paying off mortgage debt?""He mentioned several other concerns about Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, including a wealth tax, broader eligibility for overtime pay, and pro-worker rulings that could come from a liberal National Labor Relations Board.""We don't need the opposite of Trump,"" Mr. Gimbel said. ""We don't need an opposite of crazy. We need a moderate.""PhotographAn employee at Reata Engineering and Machine Works in Englewood, Colo.

| Jump to first hitA ""quality control"" issue with a new system of reporting results led to confusion and few solid numbers as Iowans turned out to select the candidate they thought could defeat President Trump.DES MOINES -- A night that was supposed to bring clarity to the Democratic presidential contest turned into a long ordeal of confusion and delays on Monday, as the Iowa Democratic Party failed to report results from more than a handful of precincts for hours after the state's famed caucuses began.Struggling to adopt a new byzantine process of tabulating results, Iowa Democrats offered little explanation for the problem for hours after the caucuses began. Eventually, not long before midnight on the East Coast, a spokeswoman for the state party said there was no issue with the integrity of the vote but it was taking longer than anticipated to collect and check the reported data for irregularities.""This is simply a reporting issue, the app did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion,"" said Mandy McClure, a spokeswoman for the Iowa Democratic Party. ""The underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.""

In the absence of hard results, election watchers in Iowa and across the country, who had eagerly been awaiting the start of the Democratic nominating process, had to make do with televised snippets of scenes from caucus sites, many of them playing out in messy fashion on college campuses and in local meeting halls and gymnasiums.And after anxiously awaiting results for much of the evening, the candidates grew impatient and, one after another, raced to their election night parties to address their supporters and get a few minutes of live television coverage. Without final results, none of them immediately emerged as a loser, allowing the candidates to project optimism and conceal their frustrations.Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., was the most upbeat, crowing that ""we are going on to New Hampshire victorious,"" though there were no results to back up his boast.

Senator Bernie Sanders's campaign, watching Mr. Buttigieg declare victory and barraged with questions about what their own results indicated, responded after Midnight Central time by releasing their internal tally. They claimed to be winning based on an assessment of what they said were the returns from 40 percent of the state's precincts, a mix of rural and urban communities.The chaos, and the resulting scramble among candidates to gain an upper hand, was a deflating moment at the outset of an election Democrats have been eagerly awaiting since President Trump's victory four years ago. Mr. Trump's campaign was quick to express glee about the confusion and issued a statement taunting Democrats about their ""caucus mess"" and ""train wreck.""The Iowa Democratic Party acknowledged in an emergency conference call with representatives for the candidates that there had been difficulties with the tabulation, according to a senior official with one of the campaigns. The delay, officials said, arose from the new rules requiring caucus leaders to report three sets of numbers to party headquarters, rather than just the delegate totals emerging from the complex caucus process. A new app that was introduced this year for compiling and reporting results also caused confusion across the more than 1,600 caucus sites. 

But when the campaign officials grew impatient and asked when the results would be disclosed, the state party leaders quickly ended the discussion, according to two Democrats who were on the call.Hours later, on another conference call, the state party officials said they would release the results Tuesday but it was not clear exactly when they would come.While precinct captains across the state struggled to report the results, first with the app and then after calling and waiting on hold, the campaigns vented quiet fury at the lack of clarity about the outcome in a contest most of them had spent hundreds of days and millions of dollars to win. 

Mr. Biden's campaign hastily dashed off a letter to the Iowa Democratic Party's leaders requesting ""full explanations"" for the failures ""before any official results are released.""As the throng of candidates waited for the results, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, an underdog in the caucuses, finally broke the silence before a crowd of supporters in downtown Des Moines.Briefly noting the delays, Ms. Klobuchar declared, ""We do know one thing: We are punching above our weight."" With her actual standing in the caucuses unknown, she said she would be headed to New Hampshire soon to continue campaigning there.Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts addressed their supporters soon afterward, with Mr. Biden noting that the state party was laboring to determine the results and that he was turning toward New Hampshire's primary. Ms. Warren, branding the contest ""too close to call,"" pointed to the next round of contests and said her campaign was prepared for ""a long haul.""Following them was Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- perceived as the candidate gathering momentum in the days before the caucuses -- who promised his crowd that ""at some point the results will be announced.""When that happens, Mr. Sanders said, ""we're going to be doing very, very well here in Iowa.""But nobody tried to seize the moment more aggressively, or perhaps brazenly, than Mr. Buttigieg, who said Iowa had ""shocked the nation.""

His attempt to claim a victory without any corresponding evidence recalled Bill Clinton's memorable declaration before the 1992 New Hampshire primary results were fully known that the state's voters had made him ""the comeback kid.""This was not the first caucus that did not produce clear results on the night of the vote.Four years ago, Hillary Clinton's narrow victory over Mr. Sanders was not clear until early the next morning after delays in reporting results. And in 2012, Republican state party officials declared a split decision only to reveal more than two weeks later that former Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania had narrowly won, a delay that robbed him of momentum he could have taken into New Hampshire.Since the caucuses began 50 years ago, Iowa Democrats reported only one number: the delegate count from each of the state's precincts.But after the razor-close finish in 2016, Mr. Sanders's allies pushed the Democratic National Committee to require caucus states to track and report the raw numbers of how many people supported each candidate.For Iowa, the new reporting standards meant counting how many people backed each candidate on the first and second balloting. That change, requiring reporting of three separate numbers from each of the state's precincts, slowed reporting the results.Iowa remained a prize well worth winning for the leading Democratic campaigns: After a year of trying to differentiate themselves in what began as a sprawling field, each candidate hoped that finishing well here would encourage Democratic voters to see him or her as a strong general-election challenger for President Trump.The candidates made their final pitches throughout the day on Monday, with an undercurrent of urgency that Iowa would be a critical test of their viability going forward. ""Everything comes down to today,"" said Mr. Buttigieg, 38, as he spoke to a crowd in West Des Moines. ""All of the dates, all of the appearances, all of the conversations with friends and neighbors.""Yet even as Democratic voters were united chiefly by a ravenous hunger to oust Mr. Trump, many Iowans went to register the first verdict of 2020 still undecided or convinced more of the risk of the candidate they opposed than of the promise of the one they ultimately backed.Democrats here and beyond are deeply divided along generational lines, with Mr. Sanders building deep support among millennials, Mr. Biden appealing to those over 65 and each drawing sharp opposition from those voters in the opposite demographic.As revealing was the chasm between Iowa progressives, who sided with Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, and more moderate voters who backed Mr. Biden, Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg.A pre-caucus survey conducted for The Associated Press found that a majority of voters participating in the Iowa contest were female, a slight majority had graduated from college and about two-thirds were over age 45. Notably, in a contest in which voters have been divided by age, 34 percent of caucusgoers were over 55.And in a reflection of how little Iowa's demographics resemble those of the nation, nine in 10 respondents in the survey were white.The survey found the caucus-going electorate ideologically divided, with somewhat more moderates than liberals. But there was near unanimity that it was important to nominate someone who could defeat Mr. Trump.This state helped catapult Barack Obama to the Democratic nomination in 2008, but it has not always been so prescient. Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri triumphed in the Democratic caucuses in 1988 but did not capture the nomination, and the last three Republican standard-bearers failed to win here but went on to win the nomination.Still, the caucuses offered a first indication of Democratic voters' preferences after an unusually unsettled primary season, defined mainly by voters' angst and indecision about finding a strong challenger for Mr. Trump. The diffuse nature of the Democratic field has already given rise to temporary surges by several candidates -- including Ms. Warren, Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Kamala Harris of California, who dropped out of the race in December -- and drew two late entrants from the party's moderate wing, Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, and Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts.At the heart of the party's schism is a debate over whether Democrats are more likely to defeat Mr. Trump by appealing to the electoral middle, nominating a pragmatist of the sort who helped them prevail in the 2018 elections, or by elevating a progressive who can galvanize some of the young and nonwhite voters who sat out the 2016 general election.Even before the caucuses got underway on Monday evening, Mr. Buttigieg offered a warning about deviating from the party's midterm formula.Pointing to the largely moderate class of freshman Democrats in Congress, Mr. Buttigieg said there was ""a lot of concern"" in their ranks about running with Mr. Sanders. ""Look at how we actually took the House,"" he said of 2018.Yet Mr. Sanders, in his final appeals to Iowa Democrats, said that the party would tempt another presidential defeat if it did not nominate a candidate who could excite the party's base. ""If it is a low turnout election, Trump will win,"" he warned over the weekend.

While all of the leading candidates had their ardent supporters, many Iowa voters seemed even more passionate when discussing those contenders they were most opposed to the party putting forward this fall.As he has since he was sworn in three years ago, Mr. Trump could ultimately prove to be the most powerful force for Democratic unity.But that prospect seems elusive now and may grow only more difficult over a long primary race. After New Hampshire, a larger and more diverse array of states will cast ballots that may further highlight the party's generational, ideological and racial divisions.Reid J. Epstein, Astead W. Herndon and Sydney Ember contributed reporting from Des Moines.PhotographScenes from a day of caucuses and rallies in Iowa.

| Jump to first hitHe has such a thorough hold on the party now that any collapse would probably require a political U-turn as sharp as the one that precipitated his rise.The state of our union is unsettled, chaotic, impossible to pin down. The state of the Democratic primary, improbably, is not.With a string of commanding victories on Tuesday -- Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi, probably any other ""M"" state that might have bothered with a primary this week -- Joe Biden appears poised to complete one of the most striking turnarounds in recent campaign memory, finding himself in a dominant position only 10 days after the first state victory of his three presidential runs. His remarkable reversal has banished Senator Bernie Sanders to a familiar electoral perch: an insurgent progressive long shot straining to catch an establishment favorite.The former vice president has won in the South, in the Northeast, in the Midwest. He has won large states and small ones. He has won in places where his strength with African-Americans could carry him and in others where such residents are fewer and far between.So thorough is Mr. Biden's hold on the party now that any collapse would probably require a political U-turn as sharp as the one that precipitated his rise. And as 2020 lurches into a logistically uncertain phase, with rallies canceled over coronavirus fears and voters more likely to privilege steady leadership, Mr. Biden is consistently and significantly outpacing Mr. Sanders on the crucial measure of whom to trust in a crisis, according to exit polls.Next week's contests include states where Mr. Biden is expected to perform well again. In Florida, the largest prize on the map until late April, his appeal to older voters and moderates, coupled with Mr. Sanders's struggles with Cuban-Americans, has Mr. Biden primed for the kind of delegate haul that can only come with a true blowout. A week later, on March 24, the race moves to Georgia, where a large black population is expected to help deliver Mr. Biden another rout.Unlike 2016, when Mr. Sanders extended his race against Hillary Clinton with a series of victories in caucuses, a format in which he has excelled, this year's calendar has many more traditional primaries, supplying fewer chances for Mr. Sanders to drive up margins and keep the delegate tally close.The result -- implausible as it seemed last month, when Mr. Biden faltered so badly in Iowa and New Hampshire that establishment Democrats indulged fantasies about a contested convention to stop Mr. Sanders -- is a race that could be nearing its functional end.It is difficult to overstate the whiplash. The last time Mr. Biden ditched one of his own election night parties, he was careening toward a fifth-place finish in New Hampshire in mid-February, skipping out on a Nashua gathering to seek refuge in South Carolina and accept his election-night fate from a safe distance.On Tuesday, he again pulled out of an event -- but this time, out of concerns that his crowd in Cleveland could be exposed to health risks amid the coronavirus scare. Mr. Biden headed instead to Philadelphia, the site of his campaign headquarters, where at the National Constitution Center he sought to project resolve in a time of national anxiety.With his wife, Jill Biden, by his side, Mr. Biden appeared to describe the race as he sees it now: effectively over on the Democratic side -- he thanked Mr. Sanders and his supporters for their ""passion"" -- leaving voters with a choice between himself and President Trump.And that, he suggested, was not a close call.""At this moment, when there's so much fear in the country, and there's so much fear across the world, we need American leadership,"" Mr. Biden said. ""We need presidential leadership that's honest, trusted, truthful and steady. Reassuring leadership.""Mr. Sanders and his team have not ceded the election publicly, though as the latest election returns came in, his campaign said he would not be speaking Tuesday night. His supporters say that there are many states yet to weigh in, many issues yet to litigate, many chances left for Mr. Biden to squander his advantages -- as he has, on and off, for much of the past year as a would-be front-runner who surrendered the label. The Sanders campaign has been eager for the scheduled debate this Sunday, the first one-on-one session with Mr. Biden, a lengthy unscripted setting that could showcase his propensity for missteps.But if Mr. Sanders could not hold his own on Tuesday -- especially in a state like Michigan, the site of his most memorable primary victory of 2016 -- it is becoming hard to imagine where he might.In a sense, Mr. Biden is offering something of a 2016 do-over, coated in patriotism and wishful thinking: Remove Mr. Trump. Prove that the country does not represent his values. And let the work of repair begin, dooming the 45th president to history's amnesia, eventually.Mr. Biden decided against a run four years ago as he mourned his son Beau, who died in May 2015. Now, he is running the kind of campaign that voters might expect from a vice president seeking a promotion immediately after his time as second in command, as if the last four years could be effectively elided. He is promising continuity with his party's prior administration, pledging to build on successes without wide-scale overhaul and even presenting himself as more of a transitional figure than a long-term standard-bearer.""I view myself as a bridge, not as anything else,"" Mr. Biden said in Detroit on Monday night, campaigning with new endorsers like Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker. ""There's an entire generation of leaders you saw stand behind me. They are the future of this country.""Throughout the campaign, he has declined to meet the demands of the loudest voices on the left -- he has super PAC support, attends high-dollar fund-raisers and remains unapologetic about overtures to Republicans -- and none of it hurt him much. Instead, Mr. Biden is enticing Democrats with a bloodless bargain: a return to normal -- or whatever this nation was on Nov. 7, 2016 -- and a vow to make Mr. Trump go away, even if Mr. Biden rarely emphasizes a bold new policy vision.It is a pitch that shares some elements with Mrs. Clinton's in 2016, centered often on Mr. Trump's character and behavior. Mr. Biden and his team seem convinced that the reality of Mr. Trump's tenure will yield a different outcome this time, with the daily tumult more visceral to voters now than it was in Mrs. Clinton's prescient-but-hypothetical predictions of executive disorder and excessive tweeting.There is also the messenger to consider. Mr. Biden recently remarked on an ""unfair"" sexism in the campaign four years ago. Then came an aside, blunt but true: ""That's not going to happen with me.""Mr. Sanders is summoning 2016 memories of another sort. After his setbacks this month, he finds himself in much the same bind he faced against Mrs. Clinton, seeking ways to prolong the primary but finding few opportunities for true breakthroughs.In recent days, Mr. Sanders and his allies have made the case that Democrats would be foolish to nominate the more moderate candidate once again, reminding audiences of Mr. Biden's potential vulnerabilities on matters of trade and the Iraq war.""Lots of flashbacks,"" said Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator and Mr. Sanders's national campaign co-chair. ""2016 has never ended.""Mr. Trump, she added, was sure to reprise a formula that worked for him the last time, if Democrats let him. ""You best believe Donald J. Trump is going to make this a repeat of 2016,"" Ms. Turner said, comparing Mr. Biden's record to Mrs. Clinton's. ""There are so many similarities for him to hit.""The president, still known to recount the details of his election victory years after the fact, is not the only veteran of that campaign inclined to linger over it. Mrs. Clinton is starring in a new documentary series in which her loss is featured prominently.And Mr. Sanders, pressed repeatedly of late about whether his attacks on Mr. Biden might damage the former vice president in November, appeared to grow frustrated last week with a trope he recognized well.""I heard that back in 2016,"" he told reporters in Phoenix. ""2016, the feeling was, 'We should anoint the candidate, and get everybody else -- get out of the race.' Is that really what democracy is about?""Mr. Biden has not generally felt like a candidate on a glide path to an anointing, though he has appeared exceedingly happy on the campaign trail in recent days, wearing his signature aviator sunglasses indoors at an ice cream shop in California last week and telling reporters about his cash windfall between spoonfuls.But winning has not changed the underlying weaknesses that defined him through the early states. Despite the growing presence of teleprompters, he still sometimes sets off on long tangents and makes verbal blunders.He continues to struggle to excite some young people and progressives. He can lose his temper in heated and colorful ways, a trait that delights some voters who take it as a sign of vigor but strikes others as unseemly for a man pursuing the statesman's mantle. (Mr. Biden swore at a man in Michigan who had suggested Mr. Biden wanted to confiscate guns. ""Don't be such a horse's ass,"" he said at another point in the exchange.)After Iowa, Mr. Biden's team underwent a shake-up, and people inside and outside the campaign have since reported more signs of a righted ship. Just last week, three former rivals -- Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar and Beto O'Rourke -- announced their endorsements in the span of a few hours, in an extraordinary show of force that sent Mr. Biden into Super Tuesday with a burst of momentum and free media.It was the kind of dramatic turn that felt essential to boosting a campaign eager for any jolt it could find as it sought to catch up to Mr. Sanders, the early delegate leader.A week later, Mr. Biden's success registered as something even more stunning, in its way: a little boring.PhotographSupporters of former Vice President Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump's national security adviser intimated that the Russians were backing Bernie Sanders, as Joe Biden blamed Mr. Trump and other Republicans for the continued interference.As accusations swirled Sunday about Russia's efforts to interfere with the 2020 election, President Trump's national security adviser and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. could not agree on what Moscow is, or is not, doing.Their disagreement came as intelligence officials disputed reports that emerged last week about a briefing of the House Intelligence Committee. The officials now maintain that the House members either misheard or misinterpreted a key part of the briefing, and that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not mean to say that it believes the Russians are currently intervening in the election explicitly to help President Trump.They do believe that Russia is intervening in the election, and that Moscow prefers Mr. Trump, a deal maker it knows well. But at least for now, those two objectives may not be linked.The differing interpretations only made it easier for the Trump administration and Democrats to put forward their own version of what the Russians are doing. As the national security adviser, Robert C. O'Brien, defended Mr. Trump and intimated that the Russians favored the Democratic presidential front-runner, Senator Bernie Sanders, Mr. Biden blamed the president and other Republicans for allowing Russia to continue to interfere in the election.Mr. O'Brien, who took office at the end of last summer, insisted on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" that he had never seen any intelligence suggesting that the Russians were interfering on behalf of Mr. Trump.""There's no briefing that I've received, that the president has received, that says that President Putin is doing anything to try and influence the election in favor of President Trump,"" Mr. O'Brien said, referring to the Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin. ""We just haven't seen that intelligence. If it's out there, I haven't seen it.""He was referring to an assessment provided to the House Intelligence Committee on Feb. 13. That briefing outlined the breadth of Russian efforts to get involved in the November election -- from hacking into voting systems to disinformation.At the root of the confusion is what Shelby Pierson, a senior intelligence official responsible for overseeing the issues of election interference, said in that briefing.Ms. Pierson, a longtime intelligence official, said there was no doubt the Russians were continuing to insert themselves in the election process. That would be consistent with past intelligence reports, and the effort by the United States Cyber Command in 2018 to block Russian intelligence from manipulating social media before the midterm congressional elections.But some intelligence officials said Ms. Pierson did not say that the current interference was explicitly on Mr. Trump's behalf. Others in the briefing said that in response to lawmakers' follow-up questions, officials made the connection between the Russian preference for Mr. Trump and Moscow's efforts to interfere in the election.The difference between actively backing Mr. Trump and preferring his re-election is a subtle nuance, officials say, but an important one: It is probably too early for the Russians to begin any significant move to bolster a specific candidate. In 2016, they at first sought to cause chaos and hurt Hillary Clinton, intelligence reports released later that year said, but only in the last few months before the election did they actively work to elect Mr. Trump.If they go the same route now, it would not be inconsistent with backing Mr. Sanders for the Democratic nomination, in part because Mr. Sanders has voted against new sanctions on Russia and because he is considered a noninterventionist. And they may conclude, rightly or wrongly, that Mr. Trump could beat Mr. Sanders.Mr. O'Brien seemed to have little doubt that the Russians preferred Mr. Sanders. ""What I've heard from the F.B.I.,"" he said, ""is that Russia would like Bernie Sanders to win the Democrat nomination. They'd probably like him to be president, understandably, because he wants to spend money on social programs and probably would have to take it out of the military.""He did not give the source of that intelligence.Mr. Sanders has denounced Russia and warned it not to interfere in the election.Mr. Trump also leapt into the fray on Sunday, accusing Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, of leaking information from the briefing.He demanded in on Twitter that someone tell ""Adam 'Shifty' Schiff to stop leaking Classified information or, even worse, made up information, to the Fake News Media.""""Someday he will be caught, & that will be a very unpleasant experience!"" Mr. Trump added.When Mr. Trump made similar comments earlier on Sunday, Mr. Schiff accused the president of deflection.""Your false claims fool no one,"" he said in a tweet. ""You welcomed Russian help in 2016, tried to coerce Ukraine's help in 2019, and won't protect our elections in 2020. Now you fired your intel chief for briefing Congress about it. You've betrayed America. Again.""Mr. Biden, who was in office as the Obama White House struggled over how to respond to Russian interference in 2016, saw some advantage in claiming he was the candidate Mr. Putin hated.""The Russians don't want me to be the nominee,"" he said on ""Face the Nation."" ""They spent a lot of money on bots on Facebook, and they've been taken down, saying Biden is a bad guy. They don't want Biden running. They're not -- no one's helping me to try to get the nomination. They have good reason.""Mr. Biden said he had not been informed of any specific intelligence. But intelligence officials say the reports they have generated have been consistent: Russian activity did not end with the 2016 election.Mr. Biden suggested that Mr. Trump was still denying Russia's involvement in 2016, even though American intelligence officials have testified on the issue every year of his presidency.""The president denies they're involved,"" Mr. Biden said. ""They've been involved. I was deeply involved in the intelligence apparatus and how it functioned before we left the vice presidency. It was clear they were involved. The president continues to deny their involvement. It's overwhelming. And the fact is that everybody knows.""He accused the Republican leadership in the Senate of failing to act to secure electoral systems.While Congress allocated several hundred million dollars for election security immediately after the 2016 election, gaping holes in the system remain, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has repeatedly blocked additional legislation from coming to the floor for a vote.PhotographRobert O'Brien said that Russia favors Senator Bernie Sanders as the Democratic nominee.

| Jump to first hitA victory in Massachusetts would not just give Mr. Sanders a significant share of the state's 91 delegates but also inflict a symbolic blow to his closest ideological rival.SPRINGFIELD, Mass. -- Bernie Sanders landed in Elizabeth Warren's home state on Friday night, stood before thousands of screaming fans and asked them to help him win it.As Ms. Warren was campaigning hundreds of miles away in South Carolina, where voting in the state's primary began Saturday morning, Mr. Sanders had departed for parts north, hoping to extinguish her candidacy -- or at least deliver a stinging embarrassment.With the race entering a critical phase, Mr. Sanders is looking ahead to big states like California and Texas to amass an insurmountable delegate lead next Tuesday, while also setting his sights on less glossy, but still delegate-rich states including Virginia and North Carolina.Yet a victory in Massachusetts, where Ms. Warren was first elected to the Senate in 2012 and re-elected in 2018, would not only give Mr. Sanders, the senator from neighboring Vermont, a significant share of the state's 91 delegates but also inflict a symbolic blow to his closest ideological rival, as he pushes to categorically establish himself as the standard-bearer of the liberal left.His rally in Springfield, and one in Boston on Saturday, are clear signs of his take-no-prisoners approach to his 2020 campaign. If that means beating Ms. Warren in Massachusetts, so be it.""People don't get their own states walled off for them,"" said Jeff Weaver, a top strategist to Mr. Sanders.Mr. Sanders has similarly added an event in Minnesota, the home state of Senator Amy Klobuchar, though her continued presence in the race is largely viewed as bleeding votes from other Sanders rivals rather than hurting him.In a show of force Mr. Sanders rallied more than 13,000 people at the Boston Common on Saturday, according to his campaign. Referring to himself as ""a U.S. Senator from your neighbor up north,"" he expressed confidence in his ability to win Massachusetts.""If we have the largest voter turnout in the history of Massachusetts primary -- we can win here in Massachusetts, we can win the Democratic nomination,"" he said. He did not mention the South Carolina primary.So far, Mr. Sanders has advertised more heavily than Ms. Warren in her home state, deployed about a dozen staff members, set up four field offices, had 1,500 volunteer events and organized canvassers to knock on 50,000 doors just last weekend, according to his campaign. Mr. Sanders even used his Twitter platform to amplify a local zoning and redevelopment fight in East Boston this week.In an apparent nod to the urgency of the situation, a super PAC supporting Ms. Warren announced late Thursday that it was buying up television time in Boston to give her a last-minute boost.Ms. Warren has declined several times to call Massachusetts a must-win state -- twice in a CNN town hall on Wednesday and again Saturday morning while campaigning in Columbia, S.C. Asked about Mr. Sanders's presence in the state, she told reporters: ""I know that Massachusetts is a very progressive state and progressive ideas are very popular. And so I'm sure that's why Bernie is campaigning there.""In Springfield, Mr. Sanders's supporters were relishing the possibility of a win. Lindsay Sabadosa, a state representative in Massachusetts and co-chairwoman of the Sanders campaign in the state, almost mockingly appropriated some of Ms. Warren's own rhetoric as she introduced him, saying she was ""counting down the days until election night.""""Not only because I am ready for a new president -- and let me tell you, I am ready for a new president -- but because I am ready for a new president who believes in big, bold structural change and who has the courage, the passion and the plans to make it happen,"" she said.There has been limited polling in Massachusetts. One survey, from the University of Massachusetts Lowell, taken after the New Hampshire primary but before Mr. Sanders won Nevada, showed a statistical dead heat, with Mr. Sanders at 21 percent and Ms. Warren at 20 percent. Another, from the radio station WBUR, showed Mr. Sanders opening a lead, with 25 percent to Ms. Warren's 17 percent.Advisers to Ms. Warren, who has no plans to appear in Massachusetts until voting on Super Tuesday, said that her time and money is best spent elsewhere, especially as she sits close to the crucial 15 percent threshold to qualify for delegates in big states like California and Texas. She is scheduled to make appearances in those states in the coming days.If Mr. Sanders is looking for knockout blows heading into Super Tuesday, Ms. Warren is more focused on accumulating delegates wherever she can. The delegate margins in Massachusetts are likely to be insignificant enough that her campaign is willing to risk a symbolic defeat here if it means winning delegates elsewhere.As she chases delegates elsewhere, she is firing up a surrogate and volunteer operation at home. Late Friday, Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts endorsed her.""This is her home turf,"" said Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III, who endorsed Ms. Warren a year ago. ""I think Senator Warren has been underestimated plenty of times in the past and I think she does best in the most critical moments.""Still, there are causes for concern and even Mr. Kennedy was cautious about forecasting an outright victory. ""No doubt she'll put forth a strong showing,"" he said.For much of 2019, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders, the two leading liberals in the race, worked almost in tandem at the debates, batting away more moderate rivals and rarely disagreeing with each other.But then in January, in their most significant breach of the primary, Ms. Warren confirmed a news media report that Mr. Sanders had told her in a private meeting that a woman would not be able to win the White House -- he denied saying such a thing -- and she confronted him after a debate that month and accused him of calling her a liar.Mr. Sanders went on to finish in a virtual tie for first in Iowa, then carried the next two states, and he has been building momentum in the polls across the country.In the New Hampshire primary, on Feb. 11, Ms. Warren did not finish higher than fourth in any of the precincts that border Massachusetts. And in population-dense Nashua, she finished in fifth.In 2016, Mr. Sanders won 48.7 percent of the vote in the Massachusetts primary, losing narrowly to Hillary Clinton. He was strongest in the more working-class areas of western Massachusetts, carrying more than 70 percent in some precincts that bordered his home state of Vermont.Mrs. Clinton's entire margin of victory -- which was a little more than 17,000 votes -- was from Boston, where she outpaced Mr. Sanders by nearly 20,000 votes.Mr. Sanders has another advantage: He has run more than $3.4 million in television ads in the Massachusetts markets, mostly in Boston; much of it came in advance of the New Hampshire primary in an attempt to reach voters in the southern part of that state. Ms. Warren has run about one-fifth as many ads: $700,000 worth and none since the New Hampshire primary.In recent weeks, Mr. Sanders has spent about $400,000 on television ads in Boston, Springfield and Providence, R.I.On Thursday, Sanders volunteers began organizing a four-day ""Berniepalooza"" in Worcester, Mass., complete with musical acts and door-knocking across the state. ""Canvass all day, party all night, and repeat,"" says the event invitation on Facebook.What the Sanders campaign does not have in Massachusetts is a formal state director, after Joe Caiazzo, who was moved to Massachusetts from New Hampshire, left at the end of last year. Shannon Jackson, who oversaw the Sanders victory in New Hampshire, is now in charge of the northeastern region of the country. The campaign moved New Hampshire staffers over to Massachusetts after that primary.Perhaps the biggest challenge for Ms. Warren is that the race features such a fractured field. The UMass Lowell poll showed five candidates with double-digit support, including Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Michael R. Bloomberg, the self-funding former mayor of New York City. Ms. Klobuchar was at 9 percent, as well.""One-on-one -- if it was Elizabeth Warren vs. Bernie Sanders in the primary -- she'd win comfortably,"" said Barney Frank, the former Massachusetts representative. ""But with the way it's worked out, it's not going to be that easy for her. Again, because she has all this competition for votes.""Mr. Frank added that the idea of a homegrown presidential candidate is not as exciting in Massachusetts as in some other states.""Having a presidential candidate from your state is not a novelty if you live in Massachusetts,"" he said. ""You're talking John Kerry, Michael Dukakis, Ted Kennedy, Mitt Romney. The thrill is gone with that.""Astead W. Herndon contributed reporting from Columbia, S.C.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders deployed about a dozen staff members, set up four field offices and had 1,500 volunteer events in Massachusetts.

| Jump to first hitMichael R. Bloomberg's campaign mounted a direct offensive against a Democratic opponent for the first time, as Bernie Sanders shot back by accusing the billionaire of trying to buy the presidency.RENO, Nev. -- Former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's presidential campaign, which has largely focused its attacks on President Trump, on Monday mounted a frontal offensive against one of his Democratic rivals for the first time, comparing Senator Bernie Sanders's campaign tactics with those employed by the president.Mr. Sanders struck back at a campaign rally later in the afternoon, drawing comparisons between Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Trump. But Mr. Bloomberg was not alone in targeting the Vermont liberal: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., in a television interview, called on Mr. Sanders to disavow attacks by some of his supporters on officials at a Nevada labor union, behavior that Mr. Biden said was ""Trump-like.""The broadsides between the three Democratic candidates came as the field looked toward the caucuses on Saturday in Nevada, where early voting has already begun. Mr. Bloomberg, however, is skipping that contest, and Mr. Sanders's rally was in California, which votes on Super Tuesday, March 3.Mr. Biden, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Elizabeth Warren held campaign events on Monday in Nevada, where they are trying to stop the political momentum of Mr. Sanders, who led a recent poll of likely caucusgoers.Mr. Bloomberg's campaign began the day by posting a video cataloging instances of online aggression and threats from Sanders supporters toward rival Democrats, then followed with a statement offering an unflattering comparison of Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump.""It's a shameful turn of events to see Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump deploy the very same attacks and tactics against Mike, but the reason is clear,"" said Kevin Sheekey, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager. ""At this point, the primary is Bernie's to lose, and ours to win. Bernie knows this. Trump knows this. That's why they are united in the campaign against Mike.""The Bloomberg campaign statement detailed a half-dozen anti-Bloomberg statements from Sanders surrogates and staff, calling them ""unacceptable."" One, a tweet from the Sanders campaign's national press secretary, Briahna Joy Gray, called Mr. Bloomberg a ""racist authoritarian.""But many of the candidates, including Mr. Sanders himself, while stopping short of calling Mr. Bloomberg himself a racist, have criticized his support as mayor of New York for stop-and-frisk policing -- a tactic that disproportionately targeted black and Latino young men.Mr. Sanders himself has been at the forefront of Democratic angst about Mr. Bloomberg's candidacy. Campaigning in Richmond, Calif., on Monday, Mr. Sanders said both Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Trump relied on their personal wealth to prop up their campaigns.""It is not only a rigged economy, it is a corrupt political system,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""It is a system that allows billionaires like Trump to get massive amounts of campaign contributions from his millionaire friends. Mr. Bloomberg, like anybody else, has a right to run for president. He does not have a right to buy the presidency. Especially after being mayor of New York and having a racist stop-and-frisk policy, especially after opposing a raise in the minimum wage.""Mr. Sanders's Twitter account directly responded to the Bloomberg campaign statement, posting a photograph of Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Trump at a golf outing in 2007.Mr. Biden took aim at both Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Sanders in an interview on MSNBC, suggesting that both candidates were just beginning to get the kind of scrutiny that Mr. Biden has received since entering the race.Mr. Biden said that Mr. Bloomberg ""can buy every ad he wants, but he can't, in fact, wipe away his record,"" citing the stop-and-frisk policing tactics as one example.Mr. Biden jabbed Mr. Sanders over a number of subjects, including his votes in the 1990s against the Brady Bill, which required background checks for gun purchases, and his support of a 2005 bill that shielded gun manufacturers from liability lawsuits.He argued that Mr. Sanders's signature proposal, ""Medicare for all,"" was costly and lacked support in Congress, and questioned Mr. Sanders's ability to defeat Mr. Trump, asking, ""Is Bernie, a democratic socialist, a good guy, is he most likely to defeat Donald Trump?""Mr. Biden also said that attacks by some of Mr. Sanders's supporters on officials at the powerful Culinary Workers Union Local 226 were ""Trump-like."" That union has declined to endorse a candidate in the race, but it opposes Mr. Sanders's ""Medicare for all"" proposal.One union official said she had received hundreds of messages from Sanders supporters with insults and threats; Mr. Sanders responded with a statement urging ""supporters of all campaigns not to engage in bullying or ugly personal attacks.""In the interview, Mr. Biden was pressed on whether Mr. Sanders was being Trump-like in his response to his supporters' attacks. Mr. Biden did not directly answer, but said, ""It's something that worries me about being able to unify this country.""Mr. Biden campaigned in Reno on Monday, and was scheduled to fly to Colorado to hold a fund-raiser in Denver on Monday night.Ms. Warren has also criticized Mr. Bloomberg, telling supporters last week that he should not be the Democratic Party's nominee because of remarks he made 12 years ago in which he said the end of a discriminatory housing practice had contributed to the 2008 financial crisis.But while she has shown more willingness to chide her opponents more directly since her fourth-place finish in last week's New Hampshire primary, her message is still largely free of the direct attacks that her rivals have embraced.Her campaign has put a particular emphasis on courting Latino voters in Nevada, with whom aides believe she can outperform the candidates who leapfrogged her in Iowa and New Hampshire, including Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar. Her campaign on Monday also announced a ""Latino Community Engagement Tour"" in California.Mr. Buttigieg campaigned in northern Nevada on Monday. At two events he was asked what he would do if he won the presidency but Mr. Trump refused to leave the White House.""I guess if he's willing to do chores, we could work something out,"" Mr. Buttigieg said.He followed up with a serious answer: The way to deprive Mr. Trump of the ability to claim electoral fraud, he said, is to win by a margin ""beyond cheating distance."" He said he was ""determined to build the broadest coalition,"" a goal that has so far escaped him as he struggles, despite top finishes in the first two contests, to demonstrate support from nonwhite voters in polling of more diverse states like Nevada.Mr. Buttigieg also released a new ad in Nevada that implicitly criticized Mr. Sanders, without naming him, as too far left to beat Mr. Trump. ""We're not going to do it by overreaching,"" Mr. Buttigieg said in the ad. ""We're not going to do it by division.""Mr. Sanders went up with two ads reinforcing a message he has driven throughout the 2020 campaign, that he stands for working people and against corruption in politics. In one, he promised to expand Social Security and guarantee health care for all while making ""billionaires pay their fair share."" The second ad called Mr. Sanders's climate change plan the only one bold enough to avert crisis.Ms. Klobuchar, who stumbled in an interview with Telemundo last week when she could not name the president of Mexico, released a Spanish-language ad touting her ability to defeat Mr. Trump and her endorsement by The Las Vegas Sun (one shared with Mr. Biden).Ms. Klobuchar, who campaigned at several stops in Nevada over the weekend, was holding a campaign fund-raiser Monday night in Los Angeles.At his California rally, Mr. Sanders also took on his other critics in the party. ""The Democratic establishment is getting nervous,"" he said. ""They say, 'Oh, Bernie can't win the election.' Take a look at this crowd today.""""What the establishment is trembling about right now -- they are crying on television -- what they are trembling in fear for is that working people are standing up demanding decent wages,"" he added.Mr. Sanders made his remarks at the former Ford Assembly Plant in Richmond, an automotive factory that was shuttered in 1955, to a crowd of more than 6,000 attendees. Thousands more crowded outside and watched through the building's glass walls.Mr. Sanders addressed the region's housing crisis and high rates of homelessness. ""It is a moral obscenity that in our country tonight, 500,000 people will sleep out on the streets,"" he said. ""Together we end that obscenity.""As early voting sites opened in Las Vegas on Monday, Senator Jacky Rosen, Democrat of Nevada, joined a line of more than 50 people and waited to cast her vote. Ms. Rosen -- who defeated a Republican incumbent in 2018 with the help of endorsements from Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren -- declined to indicate whom she favored.""Every Democrat who's running, they're going to return decency, dignity, respect and civility to the White House,"" Ms. Rosen said in an interview outside the culinary union, which is hosting an early voting site. ""They're going to have compassion with whatever health care plan they put forward, they're going to worry about our environment and our future.""""Any Democrat on that ticket, I'm going to get behind that nominee,"" she added. ""I'm voting uncommitted.""Thomas Kaplan reported from Reno; Kate Conger from Richmond, Calif.; and Reid J. Epstein from Washington. Trip Gabriel contributed reporting from Elko, Nev., and Astead W.

| Jump to first hitBernie Sanders told ""60 Minutes"" that it would be ""unfair"" to say ""everything is bad"" about Cuba's Communist revolution.MIAMI -- Comments from Senator Bernie Sanders praising aspects of the Communist Cuban revolution drew a forceful rebuke on Monday from Cuban-Americans, Florida Democrats and several of Mr. Sanders's opponents, who cast him as too extreme in his views to represent the party as its presidential nominee.Mr. Sanders's remarks threatened to undercut his candidacy in the nation's largest presidential battleground state as he seeks to build momentum on a broader scale after a series of early primary victories. In Florida, Mr. Sanders stands to alienate not just Cubans but also a far more diverse group of Latinos, including Colombians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, than the ones he won overwhelmingly in Saturday's Nevada caucuses.""I'm totally disgusted and insulted,"" said Lourdes Diaz, the president of the Democratic Hispanic Caucus in Broward County, who is Cuban-American. ""Maybe this will open people's eyes to how super, super liberal and radical Bernie is. I'm not going to defend him anymore. I'm over it.""In a ""60 Minutes"" interview that aired Sunday night on CBS, Mr. Sanders said he opposed ""the authoritarian nature"" of the Cuban regime.""But you know, it's unfair to simply say everything is bad,"" Mr. Sanders told the host, Anderson Cooper. ""When Fidel Castro came to office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?""Mr. Cooper noted that many political dissidents remained imprisoned in Cuba.""That's right,"" Mr. Sanders acknowledged. ""And we condemn that.""""Unlike Donald Trump, let's be clear, I do not think that Kim Jong-un is a good friend,"" Mr. Sanders added, emphasizing a contrast with President Trump that Democrats have tried to sharpen. ""I don't trade love letters with a murdering dictator. Vladimir Putin, not a great friend of mine.""The comments ricocheted across Miami, a bastion of Cuban exiles where any defense of Mr. Castro is considered a disqualification for those seeking public office. Many Cuban-Americans are Republicans, but those who are Democrats have been increasingly worried that Mr. Sanders's views on authoritarian leaders in Latin America could cost the party support among Hispanic voters -- whom Republicans have been courting for the past year.Mr. Sanders, a Vermont senator, has cast himself as a democratic socialist in the vein of social democrats in Europe. But though as a candidate he likes to compare his policies to those of Denmark, in the past he has expressed praise not only for Mr. Castro in Cuba but also support for the Sandinistas in Nicaragua -- troubling stances in Florida, a magnet for Latin Americans fleeing political unrest in Managua, Havana and Caracas.Mr. Sanders doubled down on his comments in a CNN town hall on Monday night, arguing that many people in Cuba were ""illiterate"" when Mr. Castro came to power.""I think teaching people to read and write is a good thing,"" he said, adding that he has been ""critical of all authoritarian regimes all over the world,"" including Cuba, Nicaragua, Saudi Arabia, China and Russia.Sensing an opening to remind voters about Mr. Sanders's more left-wing views, three of his opponents pounced on the Castro clip from ""60 Minutes.""""Fidel Castro left a dark legacy of forced labor camps, religious repression, widespread poverty, firing squads, and the murder of thousands of his own people,"" Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor whose campaign ads have flooded the Florida television airwaves, wrote on Twitter. ""But sure, Bernie, let's talk about his literacy program.""Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., tweeted: ""After four years of looking on in horror as Trump cozied up to dictators, we need a president who will be extremely clear in standing against regimes that violate human rights abroad. We can't risk nominating someone who doesn't recognize this.""Cristóbal Alex, a senior adviser to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., called Mr. Sanders's comments ""dangerous"" and ""deeply offensive to the many people in Florida, New Jersey and across the country that have fled political persecution and sought refuge in the United States.""Mr. Sanders might have little to worry about in the Democratic race: Florida does not hold its primary until March 17, after bigger states such as California and Texas.But Florida Democrats fear what a Sanders nomination could mean for the general election in November. Local political operatives said they were inundated with phone calls and text messages from elected officials, candidates and activists worried that down-ballot candidates could suffer. Some wondered privately if they should disavow Mr. Sanders now.Mr. Sanders's campaign said his views have remained the same and argued that President Barack Obama made a similar allusion to Cuba's educational gains in a 2016 speech in Havana.""Senator Sanders has clearly and consistently criticized Fidel Castro's authoritarianism and condemned his human rights abuses, and he's simply echoing President Obama's acknowledgment that Cuba made progress, especially in education,"" Mike Casca, the campaign's communications director, said in a statement.But Mr. Obama, who praised Cuba's ""enormous achievements in education and in health care,"" had made a historic policy overture and was not in the middle of a primary campaign.As condemnation of Mr. Sanders's remarks grew, Terrie Rizzo, the chairwoman of the Florida Democratic Party, issued a statement that did not mention him but clearly distanced the party from the presidential front-runner.""Candidates need to understand our immigrant communities' shared stories, as well as provide solutions to issues that matter to all Floridians including access to affordable health care and rejecting a Trump economy that works only for the very rich,"" she said.Representatives Debbie Mucarsel-Powell and Donna Shalala, Miami Democrats who flipped their competitive congressional districts in 2018 and face challengers this fall, quickly denounced Mr. Sanders's comments.""He's way off,"" Ms. Shalala told reporters in Miami Beach. She urged Mr. Sanders to meet with her constituents and hear about their experiences firsthand.Hector Caraballo, a former political prisoner in Cuba who founded the Miami-Dade Cuban American Democratic Club, said no one familiar with Mr. Sanders's political career could be surprised by his views.Miami Democrats expected grainy video clips of Mr. Sanders's most objectionable commentary to resurface during the campaign. What galled Mr. Caraballo and others was that Mr. Sanders made new remarks showing no evolution on his opinions, in spite of decades of hardship in Cuba.""This just confirmed what I think of him as a leader,"" Mr. Caraballo said. ""We have very little time left to avoid a political disaster.""Evelyn Pérez-Verdía, a Latino issues strategist who is Colombian-American and routinely advises her clients about the nuances among Hispanic voters from different countries, said the danger of Mr. Sanders's views on Cuba was that voters who fled other regimes were also likely to feel insulted.She said Mr. Sanders and his advisers ""don't understand the tentacles of what they're doing.""""He's basically saying to Cuban-Americans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans, 'Your pain is not a big deal,""' said Mike Hernández, a Democratic political consultant and Cuban-American. ""And that's not a strategy to win the state of Florida.""Mr. Hernández said he would not vote for Mr. Sanders if he were the nominee against Mr. Trump: ""I'll write someone in,"" he said.PhotographAfter Senator Bernie Sanders highlighted a literacy program in Cuba that existed under the leadership of Fidel Castro, several of his Democratic presidential rivals pounced.

| Jump to first hitJoe Biden and other Democrats were already talking about health care before the coronavirus, but the outbreak gives new urgency to a central issue for the party.WASHINGTON -- One of the thorniest debates in American politics is over health care. Now add a pandemic.The future of America's health insurance system has already been a huge part of the 2020 presidential race. At campaign events over the past year, voters have shared stories of cancer diagnoses, costly medications and crushing medical debt.That was before more than 68,000 people in the United States tested positive for the coronavirus, grinding the country to a halt, upending lives from coast to coast, and postponing primary elections in many states. The virus has made the stakes, and the differing visions the two parties have for health care in America, that much clearer.""Health care was always going to be a big issue in the general election, and the coronavirus epidemic will put health care even more top of mind for voters,"" said Larry Levitt, the executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan research organization. ""Sometimes these health care debates can get a bit abstract, but when it's an immediate threat to the health of you and your family, it becomes a lot more real.""On Monday, Joseph R. Biden Jr. sent a letter to President Trump and Republican state officials that emphasized the sorts of immediate threats Americans are feeling, and criticized those Republicans for supporting litigation that targets the Affordable Care Act. The letter called it ""unconscionable that you are continuing to pursue a lawsuit designed to strip millions"" of coverage in the midst of a pandemic.Mr. Biden sent his missive on a health care milestone: the 10th anniversary of when President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law -- with Mr. Biden, then the vice president and now the likely Democratic presidential nominee, standing by his side.While the Democrats spent much of their primary fighting about whether to push for ""Medicare for all"" or build on the Affordable Care Act, the coronavirus crisis may streamline the debate to their advantage: At a time when the issue of health care is as pressing as ever, they can present themselves as the party that wants people to have sufficient coverage while arguing that the Republicans do not.""A crisis like the coronavirus epidemic highlights the stake that everyone has in the care of the sick,"" said Paul Starr, a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton who served as a health policy adviser in the Clinton White House. ""It really strengthens the Democratic case for expanded health coverage, and that should work, I should think, to Biden's advantage in a campaign against Trump.""The virus is also having dire economic consequences, depriving Mr. Trump of a potent re-election argument rooted in stock market gains and low unemployment numbers. It is testing Mr. Trump's leadership in the face of a national emergency like nothing he has encountered, and if voters give him poor marks, that could inflict lasting damage on his chances in November's general election.""It's a leadership argument,"" said Representative Donna E. Shalala, Democrat of Florida, who served as secretary of health and human services for President Bill Clinton. ""Who do you want to be president of the United States when there's a big health crisis?""In addition, the virus is a providing an unmistakable reminder that Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden have starkly different views about the future of American health care -- and starkly different records on the issue.Four years ago, Mr. Trump ran for president promising to repeal the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. But his campaign pledge quickly turned into a debacle in the first year of his presidency when Republicans struggled and ultimately failed to repeal and replace the health law. In the midterm elections the next year, Democrats emphasized health care, highlighting issues like preserving protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and they won control of the House.That line of argument has already surfaced in the 2020 election cycle. ""Too many Montana families go to sleep at night worried about health care -- coverage, costs, now the fear of coronavirus,"" the narrator said in a recent ad targeting Senator Steve Daines, Republican of Montana, who is up for re-election. The ad was run by Protect Our Care, a liberal advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act and has set up a coronavirus ""war room"" aimed at holding Mr. Trump accountable over his handling of the crisis.Mr. Trump is particularly vulnerable on the issue of health care. Over the course of his presidency, his administration has repeatedly taken steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act, including by arguing in court that the entire law should be invalidated. The Supreme Court agreed this month to hear an appeal in that case, which is the latest major challenge to the law. The court is not expected to rule until next year, but Democrats point to the Trump administration's legal position as yet another example of the president's desire to shred the Affordable Care Act.All together, those steps by Mr. Trump and his administration amounted to something of a policy piñata for Mr. Biden and other Democrats to swing at in the general election, even before the coronavirus threat emerged.""Trump wants to take health care away,"" said Representative Ami Bera of California, a physician. ""Democrats and Vice President Biden want to extend health care and make it affordable.""In his campaign, Mr. Biden has already put a focus on health care, promising to build on the Affordable Care Act and create a so-called public option, an optional government plan that consumers could purchase. On the campaign trail, he has talked about his own exposure to the health care system, including when his late son, Beau Biden, had brain cancer. He has also regularly heard from people about their own struggles. ""They walk up and grab me and say, 'I just lost my daughter, cancer,' or, 'My son's dying,' or, 'I have Stage 4,""' he recalled this year.Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said Mr. Trump had ""spent almost his entire presidency attempting to cost millions of Americans their health coverage,"" adding: ""The coronavirus outbreak, which Trump has egregiously mishandled, would be even more catastrophic if he had his way on health care.""At a Fox News town hall event this month, Mr. Trump said he had not ""been able to sell what a great job we've done"" on health care. While the president and congressional Republicans failed at repealing the Affordable Care Act, they succeeded at undoing a key part of the law when, as part of their 2017 tax overhaul, they eliminated the tax penalty for people who go without insurance.The Trump campaign has already attacked Mr. Biden over health care, including by arguing that he poses a threat to private health insurance with his proposal to create an optional government plan.""As President Trump is leading our country and taking unprecedented action to stop the coronavirus, Joe Biden is campaigning on his Bernie Sanders-inspired, socialist health care agenda, which would take away Americans' access to quality health care,"" said Sarah Matthews, a Trump campaign spokeswoman. ""Make no mistake about it, Biden's government-run 'public option' is just another name for a government takeover of the entire health care system.""And although the Affordable Care Act has gained in popularity during Mr. Trump's presidency, Republicans can still point to rising health care costs as a problem that voters want to see addressed. In that vein, Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana and a physician, cited the substantial premiums and high deductibles that many consumers have.""Democrats have to have a credible plan to control health care costs,"" Mr. Cassidy said. ""If you look at what the No. 1 concern is, it is the cost of health care.""In the Democratic primary race, the health care debate has largely focused on the divide between moderate-leaning Democrats looking to build on the Affordable Care Act and progressives calling for Medicare for all, a government-run health insurance program. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders represent the two sides of that argument.Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator, faces long odds at catching up to Mr. Biden in the delegate race, but he has remained in the primary and continues to push progressive policy ideas, including on health care. In response to the virus, he has pointed once again to the need for Medicare for all.""It is nearly impossible to believe that anyone can still think it's acceptable to continue with a health care system that leaves tens of millions of people uninsured,"" Mr. Sanders said this month. ""The cruelty and absurdity of that view is more obvious in the midst of this crisis than it has ever been.""In a poll this month by Morning Consult, four in 10 Americans said the coronavirus outbreak had made them more likely to support universal health care proposals in which everyone would receive their health insurance from the government.Under the single-payer system that Mr. Sanders is proposing, private health insurance would be eliminated -- a potential political vulnerability that Republicans would most likely exploit in the general election if the Democratic nominee supported Medicare for all. Mr. Biden, who has repeatedly criticized Mr. Sanders's health care proposal during the primary, does not share that vulnerability.At one of his final campaign stops before the virus shut down in-person campaigning, Mr. Biden visited a community health center in Grand Rapids, Mich., where he spoke of his pride in having worked with Mr. Obama to pass the Affordable Care Act.""I'm running to protect the progress we fought for,"" Mr. Biden said. He cast doubt on Mr. Sanders's plans for a single-payer system and spoke about the urgent need to improve health care -- now more evident than even two weeks ago.Talking about the patients at that clinic, he said, ""They can't afford to wait for a revolution.""PhotographA nurse worked at a drive-up coronavirus testing site in Yuba City, Calif., on Monday. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, below left, has responded to the co- ronavirus by continuing his argument for a single-payer health care system, while Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitFour years ago, Mr. Sanders drew support from some voters who didn’t like Hillary Clinton. Joe Biden is poised to do well with black Democrats and college-educated white voters.
DETROIT — Four years ago, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont scored an upset win over Hillary Clinton in the Michigan Democratic primary, reviving his insurgent candidacy one week after his political prospects dimmed because of Super Tuesday losses.
Now Mr. Sanders finds himself once again urgently in need of a bounce-back victory in Michigan’s presidential primary after another disappointing Super Tuesday, this time against former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Mr. Sanders has shaken up his schedule to hold three days of events and rallies in Michigan. He has intensified his attacks on Mr. Biden over trade, a major issue in the state; in remarks in Dearborn on Saturday, he recalled joining picket lines to protest “disastrous” trade deals. And his campaign arranged an event in Flint on Saturday night for the explicit purpose of Mr. Sanders making his case to black voters, who have largely favored Mr. Biden so far. The Flint event mostly drew white voters, though, and Mr. Sanders mostly reiterated his stump speech.
As Mr. Biden now attempts to leverage his Super Tuesday success and build momentum, Mr. Sanders may face even longer odds in Michigan than he did in 2016. The state that Mr. Sanders last week called “very, very important” suddenly looks forbidding for him.
Mr. Biden, despite having a thin operation in Michigan, appears likely to do well with black Democrats and college-educated white voters, two groups that handed him decisive margins in Virginia, North Carolina and several other states on Super Tuesday. And the exit polling and voting trends in some of those states indicate that Mr. Sanders has declined in strength with working-class white voters, who, uneasy with Mrs. Clinton in 2016, delivered him landslide wins across much of central and northern Michigan that year.
Michigan, with its 125 delegates, is the most populous state to vote on Tuesday, and it is the first of the big Midwestern battlegrounds to cast ballots — a general election trophy that President Trump painfully pulled from the Democratic column in 2016 with a narrow win. But Michigan also could amount to a bellwether for the rest of the Democratic primary race this spring.
With Mr. Biden appearing strong in the South and Mr. Sanders winning in the West, the industrial Midwest could effectively determine the nomination. And if Mr. Sanders can’t win in Michigan, he may struggle when Ohio and Illinois vote on March 17 and Wisconsin on April 7, while also undercutting his claims about expanding the electorate in some of the most pivotal general election swing states.
“Michigan is an important state to do well in because the issues facing residents here are issues we see across the country, so a strong message and showing here will be extremely helpful for the nomination,” said Representative Rashida Tlaib, one of Mr. Sanders’s most prominent supporters in the state.
Recognizing the stakes here, Mr. Sanders is assailing Mr. Biden for his support of what he called “disastrous trade agreements like Nafta.” And his campaign is airing a commercial in the manufacturing-heavy state that features a former autoworker highlighting the former vice president’s lack of regret for supporting the pact while pointing out that Mr. Sanders has opposed free trade deals.
As he addressed supporters in Dearborn, Mr. Sanders devoted about a third of his stump speech to attacking Mr. Biden, lashing him not only on trade but also over entitlement programs, support for the war in Iraq and a willingness to take donations from wealthy donors.
“Our campaign and our administration is about representing the working families in the country,” Mr. Sanders said.
Abdul El-Sayed, a Sanders supporter who ran for governor in 2018, said he believed that Michigan Democrats would see clear distinctions between the two candidates.
“Free trade helped decimate those manufacturing jobs — Bernie has always been against it, Biden has been for it,” he said.
But recent election trends in Michigan are not encouraging for Mr. Sanders. In 2018, Michigan Democrats rallied behind a number of moderates — most notably Gretchen Whitmer in the governor’s race, and Haley Stevens and Elissa Slotkin in congressional races — and ended up winning Republican-held seats and loosening the G.O.P.’s grip on the state.
Mr. El-Sayed, who ran against Ms. Whitmer for governor on progressive issues like “Medicare for all,” enjoyed Mr. Sanders’s support and a flood of news media attention in 2018, but did not capture a single county in that primary. Ms. Whitmer, a former Democratic leader of the State Senate whose most memorable vow was to “fix the damn roads,” beat him by nearly 22 points.
While the race was somewhat competitive in Detroit and around Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, Ms. Whitmer ran up enormous margins across much of rural Michigan.
“The Whitmer primary victory over El-Sayed paints a clear road map for Biden over Bernie,” said Eric Goldman, who ran Ms. Whitmer’s campaign. “Biden will excel where Whitmer won big plus he’ll run up the score with black voters.”
Mr. Sanders’s candidacy may in fact hinge on whether he’s able to perform better with African-Americans in the Midwest than he has in the South — and if he can replicate his strength with working-class white voters who abandoned Mrs. Clinton in the primary and general election. Mr. Biden’s supporters, in turn, believe that he is better positioned than Mrs. Clinton was, including with union members who like the former vice president and don’t want their health insurance to change under a Medicare for all system.
“The connection with the workers here is at a completely different level,” said Mayor Mike Duggan of Detroit, a Biden supporter, noting the former vice president’s support for the auto industry during the Great Recession. “We have a candidate who I think will bring the traditional Democratic coalition back together.”
Also lifting Mr. Biden in Michigan is some of what helped him going into the primary last Tuesday in Virginia, where many of the state’s leading Democrats endorsed him in the run-up to the balloting. Ms. Whitmer, Ms. Slotkin and Ms. Stevens all threw their support behind Mr. Biden this past week.
In an acknowledgment that his campaign would be grievously wounded if he did not rebound in Michigan, Mr. Sanders canceled an event scheduled for Mississippi, which also votes Tuesday, to spend more time here. And he has abruptly started to attack Mr. Biden on abortion rights, not an issue the democratic socialist typically uses against his intraparty rivals.
It is clear why Mr. Sanders is scrambling — the Super Tuesday results carried ominous signs for his candidacy. In next-door Minnesota, for example, Mr. Biden did not visit once but still defeated Mr. Sanders 44-32 among white voters without a college degree, according to exit polls.
Representative Dan Kildee, a longtime Michigan Democrat who has not endorsed a candidate in the presidential race, said Mr. Sanders was in a far weaker position going into Tuesday than he was four years ago. Voters then wanted to slow Mrs. Clinton’s front-running campaign and did not feel the level of Trump-inspired alarm that they do now.
“Those factors conspired against Hillary much to the benefit of Bernie,” Mr. Kildee said. “The feeling that she was inevitable, and his supporters were much more animated. And there was just, among some, a lack of enthusiasm for her campaign.”
Now, Mr. Kildee said, Mr. Biden is experiencing a surge of enthusiasm because of “the absolute commitment to beat Donald Trump.”
Brandon Dillon, a former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said, “I know people personally who voted for Bernie because they wanted to send a message to Hillary.”
Now, Mr. Dillon said, Mr. Sanders isn’t “a novelty anymore.”
“People just want to want to win because we know who our opponent is and what he can do if he gets another four years,” he continued.
Some of the more Clinton-friendly precincts from 2016 may be even more hospitable to Mr. Biden now that Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, is out of the presidential race. Polls taken while Mr. Bloomberg was still running showed Mr. Biden leading but with the former mayor of New York, who poured tens of millions of dollars into the state, also receiving some votes.
Yet now that Mr. Bloomberg has withdrawn and endorsed Mr. Biden, some of his supporters appear poised to migrate to the former vice president; a Detroit News survey taken before Super Tuesday found 49 percent of Mr. Bloomberg’s supporters indicating that Mr. Biden was their second choice, while just 18 percent said Mr. Sanders was their second choice.
These Bloomberg-to-Biden voters could prove especially crucial in the Detroit area, which was where Mrs. Clinton ran the strongest. In suburban Oakland County, for example, Mrs. Clinton won by about five points in 2016. But after Mr. Biden’s commanding margins in similar upscale communities on Super Tuesday, many Michigan Democrats expect him to win by far more there.
“Those women are voting for Joe Biden against Bernie Sanders and they’ll vote for him again against Donald Trump,” State Senator Adam Hollier said of the suburban women who helped power the Democrats in the midterms, and who surged to the polls last Tuesday.
Just as worrisome for Mr. Sanders, the same Detroit News poll had Mr. Biden winning 40 percent of black voters while Mr. Sanders was taking just 16 percent.
Mr. Hollier, who initially supported former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., represents a legislative district in and around Detroit that includes a number of working-class black neighborhoods as well as some of the most affluent enclaves in the state. He said, “everybody in my circle is coalescing around Joe Biden.”
At first, he said, black and white voters alike were “looking for President Obama — but instead we went with the one we’ve always felt comfortable with.”

| Jump to first hitBernie Sanders and Joseph R. Biden Jr. have been seeking to take control of the race in its early stages, trying to deny momentum to their top two rivals, Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg.Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., two front-runners in the Democratic presidential race, are mounting a late push to gain a decisive advantage in the early primary and caucus states, aiming to avert a monthslong delegate battle against two insurgent rivals -- and each other.Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden appear nearly deadlocked in the early states with Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. Mr. Sanders held a slim lead in Iowa in a poll published Friday by The Des Moines Register and CNN, while recent polls in New Hampshire have found the leading candidates closely bunched. Mr. Biden has held a more consistent advantage in Nevada and South Carolina, the other states to vote in February.In a sign of how extraordinarily fluid the race remains less than a month before voting, all four of the top candidates are in a position to win both Iowa and New Hampshire, an outcome that could transform the race for any of them.Mr. Biden, the leading candidate in national polls, is especially determined to deny his challengers a chance to seize sudden momentum in the first few primary and caucus states. Hopeful of an early victory, Mr. Biden quietly dispatched his deputy campaign manager, Pete Kavanaugh, to move to Des Moines late last year to oversee his Iowa campaign. And in recent weeks Mr. Biden has made Iowa the most urgent priority on his travel schedule.His support in the state has remained flat, however, and he will need a late surge to win the Feb. 3 caucuses. In the Register poll on Friday, Mr. Sanders held the lead there with 20 percent, followed by Ms. Warren at 17 percent, Mr. Buttigieg at 16 percent and Mr. Biden at 15 percent. The poll, which had a margin of error of 3.7 percentage points, is likely to both embolden supporters of Mr. Sanders and galvanize moderate Democrats who are fiercely opposed to his nomination.This is the first time that Mr. Sanders, 78, has finished atop the Register poll, another sign that he has reinvigorated his campaign just three months after having a heart attack. Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said on Friday night that the campaign was ""extremely encouraged"" by the poll and that Mr. Sanders was focused on driving up turnout in the caucuses.""Clearly the trajectory is in the right direction,"" Mr. Weaver said, adding, ""If we have a big caucus turnout, Bernie Sanders will win the Iowa caucuses.""Both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden have been seeking to take control of a race that has been shaken and shaped for much of the year by candidates with fresher faces and new ideas. Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg are chief among them, having built strong campaigns in Iowa and New Hampshire and each seizing the lead there for a time. Now, both are girding for a monthslong quest for delegates across 50 states.Against a backdrop of impeachment in Washington and violence in the Middle East, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden are trying to turn President Trump's clash with Iran to their own advantage in Iowa, a Midwestern state with strong strains of antiwar sentiment and ideological moderation. Mr. Sanders has used his powerful financial position to mount the largest advertising campaign of any candidate in the state, and he has been emphasizing his long antiwar record while delivering increasingly pointed criticism of Mr. Biden's past support for foreign trade deals and the 2003 invasion of Iraq.Mr. Biden has begun airing ads in Iowa calling this ""the most dangerous moment in a generation,"" and at a speech in New York this week he sought to re-engage in a direct debate not with his primary rivals but with Mr. Trump. At a meeting of political donors in New York on Wednesday, close advisers to Mr. Biden argued that the atmosphere of crisis would work to his advantage, people who attended the meeting said.Both men brought valuable advantages into the race from the start, including sharply defined public images, Mr. Biden's popularity among black voters and Mr. Sanders's immense donor base. Mr. Biden has consistently led the field in national polls, while Mr. Sanders has been by far the most successful fund-raiser, collecting nearly $35 million in the last quarter of 2019.""The story of the race is the resilience of those two guys,"" said Paul Begala, a longtime Democratic strategist.It is by no means certain that either Mr. Biden or Mr. Sanders can secure a tight grip on the nomination without a long fight, and that possibility could evaporate if Ms. Warren or Mr. Buttigieg were to score an upset victory or two at the start. Ms. Warren was set to campaign in Iowa this weekend beside Julián Castro, while Mr. Buttigieg announced plans for a town hall with the singer and actress Mandy Moore.Right now, veteran Democrats in the early states say voters remain overwhelmed by all the options in a field that still features 13 candidates. In the Register poll, only two-fifths of respondents said they had made up their minds, far fewer than at this point in 2016.""It's almost like with a little kid -- if you offer them too many choices, they're frozen,"" said Representative Annie Kuster of New Hampshire, who is still determining whom she'll support. ""Because the stakes are so high, they don't want to get it wrong.""It's not just voters who are reluctant to pick a candidate. Traditional party allies like labor organizations are also taking their time.""I just don't see any of us doing anything before Iowa,"" Randi Weingarten, the president of American Federation of Teachers, said about her fellow unions.The Democratic Party's delegate allocation rules virtually ensure a drawn-out primary season if there are still three or four competitive candidates after the so-called Super Tuesday primaries on March 3, when about 40 percent of all the delegates are at stake. Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, will also become a factor then, since he has opted to skip the first four states to concentrate on later contests.Mr. Bloomberg's advisers, however, have indicated to Democratic officials that he would not be inclined to keep pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into a prolonged contest with Mr. Biden for the nomination. If the former vice president emerged as an overwhelming favorite after Super Tuesday, Mr. Bloomberg would reorient his campaign into an organization dedicated to battering Mr. Trump, the advisers said.Mr. Biden and his allies hope the race will not last long enough for Mr. Bloomberg to become a troublesome factor, and there have been new signs over the last week that the Democratic Party establishment is eager to help. Mr. Biden has unveiled a series of endorsements from Democratic leaders from battleground districts, including Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles on Friday.And after months of internal pessimism and external expectation-setting about his prospects in Iowa, Steve Ricchetti, a top adviser to the former vice president, has told other Democrats he thinks they can win the state outright.But Mr. Biden's advisers privately concede that a fourth-place finish could be damaging, and the Register poll indicated that he could capture political gold or be out of the medal hunt there altogether.""If Biden were to finish first in Iowa and then first or second in New Hampshire, it's very hard to see him being stopped,"" said David Plouffe, who ran former President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign.The same could be true of Mr. Sanders: His campaign believes he is well positioned to win three of the first four states -- with the Biden stronghold of South Carolina as the lone holdout -- and then cement his control of the race on Super Tuesday, when Mr. Sanders's financial strength and popularity with Latino voters could give him an edge in states like California and Texas.But Sanders allies concede that he will have to add more support from racial minorities, especially African-Americans, in order to clinch the nomination.""The hope is that our momentum gives people a chance to look at Bernie's record on civil rights, on mass incarceration, on a lot of other issues,"" said Representative Ro Khanna of California, a co-chairman of the Sanders campaign.Unlike Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders would have to overcome deep reservations in the party establishment about his strength as a general-election candidate.""Bernie is a disaster for me in South Florida,"" said Representative Donna Shalala, a first-term Democrat who faces re-election in a swing district where Mr. Sanders's embrace of socialism is deeply unpopular with many Latino voters. Ms. Shalala, who has not endorsed a candidate, suggested the nomination might be resolved in a brokered convention and predicted Mr. Sanders would ""stay in the primary right down till the end.""For all his team's optimism, Mr. Biden has yet to gain ground in Iowa and is no better than tied for the lead in New Hampshire, and his campaign could be stretched thin in bigger primary states, where he has done less than his top rivals to build out operations. Even some allies of Mr. Biden concede that Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have superior campaign organizations in many of the February and March states.Still, at a meeting with Democratic donors in New York this week, advisers to Mr. Biden projected confidence. Mr. Ricchetti told the group that voters would reward Mr. Biden for consistently delivering a moderate message, while Tom Donilon, a former national security adviser in the Obama administration, said the Iran crisis had reinforced the value of ""a pair of safe hands"" in the presidency.""I think the objective fact is that Biden is the most experienced foreign policy person in the field, and I think that's been highlighted,"" Mr. Donilon said in an interview, adding that Mr. Biden's critique of Mr. Trump, delivered in Manhattan on Tuesday, ""was a really sharp contrast"" with the incumbent.Other campaigns are not convinced that events abroad will work so neatly to Mr. Biden's advantage, since they also highlight his support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq.Representative Anthony Brown of Maryland, who on Thursday became the first black member of Congress to endorse Mr. Buttigieg, said in an interview that Mr. Biden's credentials would not decide the race.""Certainly, Vice President Biden, we know his résumé,"" said Mr. Brown, who like Mr. Buttigieg is a military veteran. Mr. Buttigieg ""understands the drag on the nation, being in these forever wars, because he served in one of those, not because he made the decision to send us,"" Mr. Brown said.There is still hope among the underdog candidates that an unsettled race could lead to a late breakout. But the Register poll offered little encouragement: The next-strongest challengers, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and the tech executive Andrew Yang, were both stuck in the mid-single digits.Sydney Ember contributed reporting from Des Moines, and Katie Glueck from New York.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders's campaign believes he is in position to win three of the first four nominating contests. Joe Biden, left, at Corinthian Baptist Church in Des Moines this month, has led in most polls, however, and remains popular among black voters.

| Jump to first hitA large, diffuse and unyielding field of candidates is helping Bernie Sanders dominate. Republicans who tried to beat Donald J. Trump in 2016 see parallels.FARGO, N.D. -- After a disappointing sixth-place finish in Nevada, which followed a less disappointing third-place finish in New Hampshire but a humbling fifth-place finish in Iowa, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota looked out at the crowd of more than 1,000 and predicted victory in the North Dakota primary -- at the time, more than two weeks away.""Somehow, I have a feeling this primary is still going to be going on,"" she said.That much seems certain.The no-end-in-sight nature of the contest for the Democratic nomination is alarming those in the party who are hoping to blunt the momentum of the front-runner, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The most likely way they believe that could happen -- a critical mass of the senator's rivals drop out so voters can coalesce around a single alternative -- seems like the least likely outcome.The irony is thick. Mr. Sanders, the candidate many establishment Democrats fear would have the most trouble beating President Trump in November, is benefiting from some of the same dynamics that helped Mr. Trump stampede to the Republican nomination four years ago.""It appears to me that the Democratic Party didn't learn a whole lot from watching the Republican Party's primary in 2015 to 2016,"" said Danny Diaz, a senior adviser to Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor who went from being the early favorite to win the Republican nomination with $100 million in super PAC money behind him to dropping out less than a month into voting after he failed to win a single state.""The reality is there's a diffuse field that's allowing for the establishment lane's vote share to be diluted, and in the process allowing someone with around a quarter to a third of the vote to dominate,"" Mr. Diaz said, describing Mr. Sanders's rivals' conundrum as if he were describing Mr. Bush's four years ago.As Republicans who weathered 2016 observe 2020, they are feeling a distinct sense of déjà vu. The parallels are not perfect, but there are many -- right down to the candidates themselves.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., they say, is Mr. Bush, pointing to his famous political legacy, deep ties to the party establishment and the sense of continuity and comfort he instills. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is Senator Ted Cruz of Texas: ideologically irreproachable, as far as her party's base is concerned, but encountering some difficulty attracting a broader coalition. Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., is Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, the telegenic, overachieving optimist who represented the youthful ideal for mostly older voters. And Ms. Klobuchar is John Kasich, the former governor of Ohio who won only a single state -- his own -- but resisted calls to drop out of the race until May.""I don't care, pick any one of them, Biden, Klobuchar, Buttigieg or even Warren,"" said Rick Tyler, a former senior strategist for Mr. Cruz. ""Consolidate the vote and you'll beat Bernie 60-40. But they're not going to do it because the parties are so pathetic and inept and weak. We say we love primaries because they're inclusive. Well, this is what happens.""The debates this year are providing a similar kind of nationally televised spectacle in which the candidates rip into each other, albeit without the insinuations of sexual prowess and hyper-masculinity that the Republican debates featured four years ago.If the general election ends up being a matchup between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump, the nominee of each major party would be someone who had spent much of his life unaffiliated with that party, but who has since forged a deep and somewhat unshakable connection with its base.Mr. Sanders, who describes himself as a democratic socialist, does not formally register with the Democratic Party except to run for office. In the Senate he is an independent. Mr. Trump also switched his party registration numerous times over the last 30 years -- from Republican to third party to Democratic to Republican to no affiliation to, finally, Republican again in 2012.Mr. Sanders has not yet demonstrated a majority of support in the primary, either in the three states that have voted so far or in national polls of the race. Mr. Trump, who picked up about one-third of the votes in the early states, did not start winning outright majorities until the end of April 2016. (He, like Mr. Sanders, came close in the Nevada caucuses. Both won about 46 percent of the vote.)Mr. Sanders is being openly attacked by his rivals, who say nominating him would amount to a gamble Democrats cannot afford to make in an election in which defeating Mr. Trump is of paramount importance. Republicans said the same thing about Mr. Trump when they similarly doubted he would be able to beat Hillary Clinton.It is entirely plausible that Mr. Sanders could soon be on the path to winning a plurality of delegates, even if a majority of Democratic primary voters continue voting for other candidates, just as the case was for Mr. Trump after Super Tuesday.""Just look at the Nevada caucus -- he didn't have that many votes,"" said John Weaver, a former senior strategist for Mr. Kasich. ""But come South Carolina and Super Tuesday, even if he gets one-third, and everyone else gets 18 percent or less, he keeps winning.""And few of Mr. Sanders's rivals can point to many states where they expect to win and pick up a meaningful number of delegates. (In Ms. Klobuchar's vision of triumph in North Dakota, for example, there are only 14 delegates up for grabs, tying it with Wyoming for the lowest number awarded by any state.)In recent days, as Mr. Sanders has opened up a wider lead, Republican strategists like Mr. Weaver have been unable to repress their amazement at the similarities.""Been there, done that. She will be stronger politically if she drops out now versus staying in and losing till the last rat dies,"" Mr. Weaver said in a tweet this week directed at Ms. Klobuchar that he has since deleted. The comparisons between Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Kasich strike supporters of both politicians as unflattering.As Mr. Trump continued to plow through states, Mr. Cruz, Mr. Kasich, Mr. Bush and Mr. Rubio all scrapped for seconds, thirds and fourths, splitting up the more traditional Republican vote and aiding Mr. Trump in his rise.In making his case for the Democratic nomination, former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York has argued that the muddle of candidates vying for the support of moderate and independent voters is doing the same thing, and that they should drop out and give him a clearer path forward -- a suggestion that was met with widespread disdain.Then, as is the case now, there is hypothetical talk of how stopping the front-runner could be accomplished if the lower-polling candidates quit the race and endorsed one alternative. That kind of unanimity, the thinking goes, would make it easier for an anti-Sanders coalition to form.It never happened in 2016, despite some false starts and half-baked attempts.Conservatives urged Mr. Rubio and Mr. Cruz to form a joint ticket, though neither wanted to play second fiddle to the other as the vice-presidential pick.Then Mr. Cruz announced shortly before dropping out that if he were nominated, he would choose as his running mate Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard chief executive who had also sought the nomination. The two traveled the country together as a team.But the combination of inertia and ego inside presidential campaigns usually stops these kinds of arrangements.""In order to have an impact with your endorsement, you have to have support,"" said Todd Harris, an adviser to Mr. Rubio's presidential campaign. ""And if you still have support, why are you dropping out?""All the speculative talk about what a so-called unity candidate might do to knock Mr. Sanders off the launching pad assumes that that is possible in the first place, which may not be the case. Republicans still argue about whether they could have done anything to stop Mr. Trump.Mr. Diaz, the former Bush adviser, said that Democrats should have their ""eyes wide open that they're allowing someone who has a plurality -- and not a majority -- to kind of walk away with the nomination.""Mr. Tyler said that after Mr. Cruz ended his campaign, he convened a group of his former campaign aides for an informal autopsy of the race. When the senator asked, in effect, if they did it all over again what could they do to deny Mr. Trump the nomination, Mr. Tyler said his answer was nothing.""We, like everybody else, sort of misunderstood what direction the country was going in,"" Mr. Tyler said.The data the 2016 campaigns possessed at the time suggested Mr. Trump might have always had a lock on the nomination.At the beginning of the primary season, the Rubio campaign asked likely Republican primary voters for their preference among three potential kinds of candidates: a fiscal and social conservative who shared their values; a proven executive leader; or an outsider who wanted to shake up the system.The outsider won by the biggest margin, with 46 percent. The values candidate won only 33 percent.""We've seen this movie before,"" said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster who worked on the Rubio campaign. ""The outsider runs away with the nomination.""PhotographBernie Sanders may soon be on the path to winning a plurality of delegates, even if a majority of voters cast ballots for other candidates.

| Jump to first hitIn a stark moment of political de-escalation, Mr. Sanders signaled that he wants to press Joe Biden on issues but may not want to fight to the bitter end like he did against Hillary Clinton in 2016.It was a concession speech, of a kind: Addressing reporters on Wednesday, Senator Bernie Sanders bowed not to Joseph R. Biden Jr., who trounced him in a second consecutive week of primary elections, but to the reality of his political predicament. Stripped of his briefly held status as the Democratic front-runner, Mr. Sanders acknowledged that he was ""losing"" to Mr. Biden but stopped short of accepting defeat.That careful distinction -- between accepting Mr. Biden's dominance in the race, and yielding to him altogether -- now defines Mr. Sanders's candidacy, and perhaps the Democratic presidential race as a whole.For in Burlington, Vt., Mr. Sanders was more visibly humbled than at nearly any other point since he emerged as a national figure five years ago, during his insurgent challenge to Hillary Clinton. There was no defiant battle cry on Wednesday, no vow to fight Mr. Biden all the way to the Milwaukee convention in July, no allegation of election-rigging or insinuation of an establishment conspiracy like he memorably made in 2016.There was, instead, a matter-of-fact assessment of his own diminished position in the race, followed by an equally unsparing recitation of the policy challenges Mr. Sanders intended to put to Mr. Biden in the coming days.Reaching for a kind of moral victory, Mr. Sanders insisted that his campaign had ""won the ideological debate,"" but allowed that he had not persuaded most voters that he was the likeliest candidate to defeat President Trump.Taken together, it was a stark moment of political de-escalation. Some Democratic officials interpreted it as a signal that Mr. Sanders may not be thirsting for a fight to the bitter end, of the kind he waged against Mrs. Clinton in 2016. Even his criticism of Mr. Biden was largely implicit, framed in terms of questions -- about health care, climate change, immigration and more -- that seemed intended to push Mr. Biden to address the concerns of Mr. Sanders's political base.The great question of the Democratic race may now be whether there is anything Mr. Biden can do to assuage those concerns, and how Mr. Sanders might respond if he does.Representative Peter Welch of Vermont, who is supporting Mr. Sanders, said that the senator sent a clear sign about his political priorities by emphasizing that defeating Mr. Trump was a goal of overriding importance. While Mr. Welch said it was up to Mr. Sanders to decide when his campaign was over, he was already suggesting on Wednesday that Mr. Sanders consider going on a ""unity tour"" to bring the Democratic Party together.""At some point, we're going to have to unify to achieve the overarching goal of defeating Donald Trump,"" Mr. Welch said, calling Mr. Sanders a figure with unique potential to achieve that goal: ""Bernie, more than any other person in this country, can help Biden be the person who defeats Donald Trump.""But Mr. Welch and other Democrats cautioned that Mr. Biden should not expect a quick end to Mr. Sanders's candidacy, or apply too much pressure on Mr. Sanders in the hope of bringing about that outcome. So far, Mr. Biden has shown no inclination to attempt any coercive measures: In his victory speech on Tuesday evening, the former vice president hailed the energy and commitment of Mr. Sanders's supporters and offered himself to them as an ally, but made no suggestion that Mr. Sanders should stand aside.By no means is Mr. Sanders giving Mr. Biden a free pass, however. If his tone was more subdued and the content more clinical -- like a policy questionnaire distributed to officeseekers -- his remarks on Wednesday cataloged considerable skepticism of Mr. Biden and his competing political vision.""Joe,"" he asked, ""how are you going to respond to the scientists who tell us we have seven or eight years remaining to transform our energy system?""""What are you going to do to make sure that all of our people can go to college or trade school regardless of their income?""""What are you going to do about the millions of people who are struggling with outrageous levels of student debt?""Still, after Mr. Biden's string of wins on Tuesday night, both camps seem to recognize that the two men will most likely need to find ways to bring Democrats together behind Mr. Biden this fall. It is a dual challenge that does not play to either man's strengths: convincing a zealous collection of young and progressive voters that Mr. Biden -- an institutionalist moderate who speaks of record players and long-dead Senate colleagues -- is the man to meet the moment.For Mr. Sanders, who has spent the past year suggesting that any candidate besides himself would be insufficiently bold for the times, an eventual endorsement for Mr. Biden would not necessarily persuade admirers that an establishment Democrat should be trusted. It might take a more robust show of support from Mr. Sanders, and even then there is no guarantee that the affections of Mr. Sanders's base can be transferred.For Mr. Biden, who has antagonized Mr. Sanders as a non-Democrat out to diminish the presidency of Barack Obama, even a firm insistence that he understands what is driving Sanders voters will be viewed skeptically.But despite Mr. Biden's success during the last two weeks of primaries, he will need to make gains with some key Sanders constituencies -- not only younger liberals but also Latinos across several age brackets -- to build the most formidable coalition possible in the fall. And he will almost certainly need Mr. Sanders's help to get there.Some veterans of Mrs. Clinton's campaign would advise Mr. Biden not to expect much. Though Mr. Sanders officially endorsed Mrs. Clinton in 2016 and rallied for her, her aides generally viewed the endorsement as somewhere between dutiful and inadequate -- especially when weighed against the months of negative attacks from Mr. Sanders and his supporters depicting her as a corporate tool well after she appeared to have the nomination in hand.There is some reason to believe that this election might be different. Mr. Sanders appears to harbor much less visceral disdain for his opponent than he did in 2016, when he and his aides seethed constantly at the perceived coronation of Mrs. Clinton. Mr. Sanders has never attacked Mr. Biden's character or his personal ethics, even as a good number of his political allies have done so repeatedly.""It needs to be a two-way dance,"" said Brian Fallon, Mrs. Clinton's national press secretary four years ago, noting that even a progressive like Senator Elizabeth Warren had been found wanting by Sanders fans. ""What the courting looks like, what will actually satisfy large chunks of his movement, is a mystery. So much of that movement could not even find Warren as an acceptable alternative. So, what the heck can Joe Biden do?""Mr. Fallon did have a few ideas: namely, some policy drift toward Mr. Sanders's platform on climate or health care issues from the Biden camp if Mr. Sanders leaves the race.At the moment, the Sanders base appears in no mood to settle. Some of his top surrogates continue to tweet eagerly amid his defeats on Tuesday night about Mr. Biden's weaknesses and elevate any scrap of good news about Mr. Sanders, from his strength with young voters to his projected victory in North Dakota.""Nah, it's not over,"" wrote Shaun King, a civil rights activist and Sanders surrogate with over a million followers on Twitter.""Not over indeed,"" said Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator and national campaign co-chair for Mr. Sanders.""We are just getting started,"" tweeted Representative Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, one of the senator's highest-profile endorsers.But there was also an awareness among Sanders allies that he has more at stake in this campaign than in 2016, and that the way his candidacy ends -- if indeed it ends in defeat -- could have far-reaching implications for the fate of the agenda he has championed and the movement he has built.""Whatever he does, he's going to go forward with a base of support that's going to continue to fight for issues,"" said James J. Zogby, a longtime Sanders ally who is the president of the Arab American Institute, in an interview on Tuesday night.Mr. Sanders, he said, had a longer legacy than a presidential campaign: ""He is a transformative figure in our political life.""It falls now to Mr. Sanders to square his grand stature, as an individual leader, with the perilous state of his presidential campaign. Mr. Welch, who has risen in Vermont politics alongside Mr. Sanders for more than three decades, urged his colleague not to bank on an astounding turn of fortune of the kind Mr. Biden enjoyed after the South Carolina primary.""We basically had a miracle in this election a couple weeks ago,"" Mr. Welch said. ""And Joe Biden was the beneficiary of that miracle.""For Mr. Sanders to expect another, he added, would be ""asking a lot of the higher powers.""Photograph""While our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability,"" Senator Bernie Sanders said Wednesday.

| Jump to first hitBernie Sanders is increasingly seen as the candidate on the rise. But the Iowa contest is unusually jumbled, and several candidates have realistic hopes for a sudden burst of momentum.DES MOINES -- The Democratic presidential candidates pleaded with voters in Iowa for their last-minute consideration on Sunday, competing with the Super Bowl for caucusgoers' attention and straining against an atmosphere of unusual uncertainty and indecision among Democrats ahead of the first-in-the-nation nominating contest.The cancellation on Saturday night of a final pre-caucus poll from The Des Moines Register and CNN, because of a survey error, frustrated campaigns that had come to depend on the poll as a reliable omen of caucus results. But strategists for several campaigns said there was a deepening sense that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont had an advantage ahead of Monday's contest.Public polling has shown Mr. Sanders gaining ground, and he has outspent all of the other leading Democrats on television by a wide margin in recent weeks. A New York Times polling average found Mr. Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. tied for first place in the state, with each of them collecting support from about 22 percent of likely caucusgoers. Trailing them in third and fourth place were former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.Mr. Sanders campaigned on Sunday in a confident tone, concluding a speech in Iowa City by standing beside his wife, Jane, and urging the crowd to imagine them in the White House: ""Some of you are unhappy with me and some of you think I might not be a great president,"" he said. ""Understand, she will be a great first lady!""Should Mr. Sanders emerge as a convincing victor from Monday's caucuses, he would aim to carry that momentum forward into next week's primary in New Hampshire, where he was already seen as having an upper hand, and the Nevada caucuses later this month. But there is still widespread concern among Democratic Party leaders and center-left primary voters about the implications of nominating a self-described democratic socialist to take on President Trump. Mr. Sanders's allies acknowledge there is little chance he will be able to lock up the nomination without a long fight.His chief opponents are unlikely to give way easily: Even if he is defeated here, Mr. Biden has a strong national following among moderate voters and African-Americans, while Ms. Warren retains a sizable base among educated liberals and women. And Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, is looming as a competitor in the March primary states.Mr. Biden, who has long anchored his campaign in appeals to electoral prudence, tried on Sunday to remind Democrats that the G.O.P. sees him as a strong general-election candidate. He pointed to a morning appearance on CNN by Senator Joni Ernst, the Iowa Republican, in which Ms. Ernst again suggested that Iowa voters might draw unfavorable conclusions about Mr. Biden as a result of Republican attacks on him during Mr. Trump's impeachment trial. Iowans, Ms. Ernst said, were ""very smart.""""Why don't you let Joni Ernst know just how smart you are, and caucus for me?"" Mr. Biden said, earning a standing ovation from voters in Dubuque.Calling the impeachment process a ""sham trial,"" Mr. Biden encouraged Iowans to ""hold Trump accountable"" by supporting the former vice president on Monday.But in an outlandish episode that seemed to reflect some senior Democrats' alarm about Mr. Sanders's strength here, NBC reported on Sunday afternoon that John F. Kerry, the former secretary of state, had been overheard in a Des Moines hotel talking about the possibility of entering the presidential race to stop Mr. Sanders from ""taking down the Democratic Party.""Mr. Kerry, who has been campaigning across the state as a surrogate for Mr. Biden, wrote on Twitter that he was ""absolutely not running for president"" and reaffirmed his support for Mr. Biden. But he notably did not deny having had the conversation NBC reported.If Democratic voters had been anxious, even tortured, about the task of choosing just one option in the 2020 race, over the weekend there was visible enthusiasm for many of the candidates, who were addressing swollen audiences on college campuses and in local gymnasiums.""The bad news is, there's no more room inside,"" Ms. Warren joked to an overflow crowd at Simpson College. ""The good news is, there's no more room inside!""Mr. Buttigieg, who addressed a crowd of about 2,000 people on the South Side of Des Moines on Sunday, acknowledged to reporters that his campaign had to clear a high bar on Monday. Among the top candidates in Iowa, Mr. Buttigieg has by far the most ground to make up in national polls and he is counting on a burst of new energy.""Let's face it, we need a very strong finish here,"" he told reporters in Coralville. ""This is our chance to show-versus-tell that we're building the organization that can turn people out and go on to defeat Donald Trump.""The senators in the mix repeatedly indicated to voters that they had felt constrained in their campaign activities by an impeachment process that kept them tethered to Washington. Ms. Warren skipped her signature photo lines, explaining regretfully that she needed to ""get around to as much of Iowa as possible."" Her internet-famous dog, Bailey, was stepping in to be photographed in her stead.Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who has been contesting Iowa as a vigorous underdog, implored voters here to ""have my back"" because she had to return to Washington briefly to attend to impeachment duties on Monday. ""I wish I could be here at the very last moment, but I can't,"" she told voters in Cedar Rapids.Ms. Klobuchar, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders were all planning to make hit-and-run appearances in Washington on Monday before returning to Iowa for the night of the caucuses.While a hectic scramble was underway in Iowa, a separate political feud, with potential implications for the Democratic primary, was unfolding on television and social media -- between Mr. Trump and Mr. Bloomberg.Mr. Bloomberg, who is skipping Iowa and using his multibillion-dollar fortune to saturate later-voting states with advertising, has been largely outside the political foreground in the run-up to the caucuses. But Mr. Trump changed that with an overnight diatribe on Twitter, belittling Mr. Bloomberg's modest height and accusing the Democratic establishment of favoring him over Mr. Sanders.Mr. Bloomberg, whose lavishly financed campaign was also running an ad during the Super Bowl, responded in a tart fashion that delighted some liberals. His spokeswoman, Julie Wood, said in a statement that Mr. Trump was ""a pathological liar who lies about everything: his fake hair, his obesity and his spray-on tan.""If the exchange was less than dignified, it was also a reminder of Mr. Bloomberg's looming presence in the race and the possibility that he could wind up as a last-man-standing option for centrist Democrats if Mr. Sanders dominated the early primaries and caucuses this month.Reporting was contributed by Sydney Ember from Iowa City, Reid J. Epstein from Coralville, Iowa, Shane Goldmacher from Indianola, and Katie Glueck from Dubuque.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders at his Newton field office on Sunday.

| Jump to first hitSenators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren argue over what was said at a private 2018 meeting, their dispute takes center stage at the debate and Cory Booker says goodbye.With less than three weeks to go before the Iowa caucuses, tensions escalated between two of the leading Democratic candidates and were on display on national television at a debate in Iowa.We'll catch you up on this and other moments you may have missed from a very busy week.A timeline of the Sanders-Warren tensionFor almost a year, Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts had a tacit nonaggression pact. But not anymore.The trouble started last weekend with the publication of a script that volunteers on the Sanders campaign had been using, telling voters that Ms. Warren appealed to ""highly educated, more affluent people"" and brought ""no new bases"" to the party. Then, on Monday, Ms. Warren said that Mr. Sanders had told her in a private meeting in December 2018 that he did not believe a woman could win the presidency -- a claim Mr. Sanders vehemently denied.The disagreement came to a head on Tuesday. During the debate in Iowa, the two senators had a brief, relatively cordial exchange in which Mr. Sanders again denied making the remark and Ms. Warren pivoted to a broader point about women's ""electability."" But afterward, as the candidates were mingling onstage, Ms. Warren confronted Mr. Sanders directly.Late on Wednesday, an audio recording revealed what she had said: ""I think you called me a liar on national TV."" Mr. Sanders responded that they should talk about it another time, and then said that it was Ms. Warren who had called him a liar. Our colleagues Jonathan Martin and Sydney Ember wrote about the fracture between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. Liberal Democrats are afraid that the infighting in the party's progressive wing could end up benefiting moderates.  We wrote about Ms. Warren tackling the ""electability"" question head-on, and about the backlash women in politics sometimes face when they call out sexism.  Our colleagues also looked at the challenge Ms. Warren faces in convincing Iowa caucusgoers that her sweeping plans won't be a liability in a general election.

Biden Jr., former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and the former hedge fund executive Tom Steyer. Among the major topics of discussion were foreign affairs, President Trump's trade policy, climate change and -- once again -- health care.Mr. Trump's dealings with Iran, including his decision to order the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, were the focus of the first part of the debate. All of the candidates onstage agreed that Mr. Trump had mishandled the situation, but as our colleague David E. Sanger wrote, they were more vague about their own diplomatic approaches and under what circumstances they would use military force. Here is our main story recapping the night.  We also tracked speaking time, collected experts' takes on the candidates' performances and provided six takeaways in case you want to catch up quickly.  About 7.3 million people watched the debate live on CNN, down from previous debates. Our chief television critic, James Poniewozik, wrote that ""prodded to spar, the candidates more often chose to strike at President Trump"" and took a ""gloves-on approach.""

""I got in this race to win,"" he told supporters, ""and I've always said I wouldn't continue if there was no longer a path to victory.""Mr. Booker had pitched himself as a positive, unifying candidate -- a posture that did not resonate with the Democratic base. Recent polls showed him between 1 and 3 percent, and he did not qualify for the last two debates.His departure leaves only one black candidate in the race: Deval Patrick, who entered very late and is struggling to reach even 1 percent in polls.

For daily updates, you can sign up for a newsletter from our colleagues in Washington.The start of the trial meant that the four senators in the Democratic race -- Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Michael Bennet of Colorado -- were forced to leave the campaign trail less than three weeks before the Iowa caucuses. While the senators have not dwelled publicly on the trial's campaign-related implications -- Ms. Warren has said repeatedly that some things are more important than politics -- there is no denying the timing is bad. Our colleague Stephanie Saul checked in on how they're framing their absence from Iowa.

Our colleague Stephanie Saul checked in on how they're framing their absence from Iowa.Warren wants to cancel debt without CongressMs. Warren released a plan on Tuesday to cancel student loan debt by executive action. Essentially, this is an extension of the student debt proposal she released months ago -- a more aggressive way of enacting the same policy, which would cancel up to $50,000 in debt for about 95 percent of borrowers.She argues that existing laws give the Education Department the authority to cancel federal loans as well as to issue them, and released a letter from lawyers at Harvard Law School's Legal Services Center that supported her interpretation. Ms. Warren said she would instruct her education secretary to begin canceling debt on her first day in office, and ""to amend any regulations or policy positions necessary to get there.""The proposal ""will require clearing a lot of red tape,"" she wrote. ""But let's be clear: Our government has cleared far bigger hurdles to meet the needs of big businesses when they came looking for bailouts, tax giveaways and other concessions.""In other policy news: Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City and another late entrant into the race, released five plans: one to cut pollution from homes and buildings, one to combat vaping, one on climate resilience, one on wildfire resilience and one on clean transportation.  Mr. Steyer introduced a plan to cut taxes by 10 percent for low- and middle-income families, as well as to increase the earned-income and child tax credits. He said he would pay for the plan by increasing taxes on the wealthiest Americans and taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income.  Michael R.

| Jump to first hitA classified briefing to House members is said to have angered the president, who complained that Democrats would ""weaponize"" the disclosure.WASHINGTON -- Intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump re-elected, five people familiar with the matter said, a disclosure to Congress that angered Mr. Trump, who complained that Democrats would use it against him.The day after the Feb. 13 briefing to lawmakers, the president berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing it to take place, people familiar with the exchange said. Mr. Trump was particularly irritated that Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the leader of the impeachment proceedings, was at the briefing.During the briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump's allies challenged the conclusions, arguing that he had been tough on Russia and that he had strengthened European security.Some intelligence officials viewed the briefing as a tactical error, saying the conclusions could have been delivered in a less pointed manner or left out entirely to avoid angering Republicans. The intelligence official who delivered the briefing, Shelby Pierson, is an aide to Mr. Maguire and has a reputation for speaking bluntly.Though intelligence officials have previously told lawmakers that Russia's interference campaign was continuing, last week's briefing included what appeared to be new information: that Russia intended to interfere with the 2020 Democratic primaries as well as the general election.On Wednesday, the president announced that he was replacing Mr. Maguire with Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and an aggressively vocal Trump supporter. And though some current and former officials speculated that the briefing might have played a role in that move, two administration officials said the timing was coincidental. Mr. Grenell had been in discussions with the administration about taking on new roles, they said, and Mr. Trump had never felt a kinship with Mr. Maguire.Spokeswomen for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and its election security office declined to comment. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.A Democratic House Intelligence Committee official called the Feb. 13 briefing an important update about ""the integrity of our upcoming elections"" and said that members of both parties attended, including Representative Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the committee.In a tweet on Thursday evening, Mr. Schiff said that it appeared that Mr. Trump was ""again jeopardizing our efforts to stop foreign meddling"" with his objections to the briefing.Mr. Trump has long accused the intelligence community's assessment of Russia's 2016 interference as the work of a ""deep state"" conspiracy intent on undermining the validity of his election. Intelligence officials feel burned by their experience after the last election, when their work became a subject of intense political debate and is now a focus of a Justice Department investigation.Part of the president's anger stemmed from the administration's reluctance to provide delicate information to Mr. Schiff. He has been a leading critic of Mr. Trump since 2016, doggedly investigating Russian election interference and later leading the impeachment inquiry into the president's dealings with Ukraine.Mr. Trump complained that Mr. Schiff would ""weaponize"" the intelligence about Russia's support for him, according to a person familiar with the briefing. And he was angry that he was not told right away about the briefing, the person said.Mr. Trump has fixated on Mr. Schiff since the impeachment saga began, pummeling him publicly with insults and unfounded accusations of corruption. In October, Mr. Trump refused to invite lawmakers from the congressional intelligence committees to a White House briefing on Syria because he did not want Mr. Schiff there, according to three people briefed on the matter.The president did not erupt at Mr. Maguire, and instead just asked pointed questions, according to the person. But the message was unmistakable: He was not happy.Ms. Pierson, officials said, was delivering the conclusion of multiple intelligence agencies, not her own opinion. The Washington Post first reported the Oval Office confrontation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Maguire, but not the substance of the disagreement.The intelligence community issued an assessment in early 2017 that President Vladimir V. Putin personally ordered a campaign of influence in the previous year's election and developed ""a clear preference for President-elect Trump."" But Republicans have long argued that Moscow's campaign was intended to sow chaos, not aid Mr. Trump specifically.Some Republicans have accused the intelligence agencies of opposing Mr. Trump, but intelligence officials reject those accusations. They fiercely guard their work as nonpartisan, saying it is the only way to ensure its validity.At the House briefing, Representative Chris Stewart, Republican of Utah, who has been considered for the director's post, was among the Republicans who challenged the conclusion about Russia's support for Mr. Trump. Mr. Stewart insisted that the president had aggressively confronted Moscow, providing anti-tank weapons to Ukraine for its war against Russia-backed separatists and strengthening the NATO alliance with new resources, according to two people briefed on the meeting.Mr. Stewart declined to discuss the briefing but said that Moscow had no reason to support Mr. Trump. He pointed to the president's work to confront Iran, a Russian ally, and encourage European energy independence from Moscow. ""I'd challenge anyone to give me a real-world argument where Putin would rather have President Trump and not Bernie Sanders,"" Mr. Stewart said in an interview, referring to the nominal Democratic primary race front-runner.Under Mr. Putin, Russian intelligence has long sought to stir turmoil among around the world. The United States and key allies on Thursday accused Russian military intelligence, the group responsible for much of the 2016 election interference in the United States, of a cyberattack on neighboring Georgia that took out websites and television broadcasts.The Russians have been preparing -- and experimenting -- for the 2020 election, undeterred by American efforts to thwart them but aware that they needed a new playbook of as-yet-undetectable methods, United States officials said.They have made more creative use of Facebook and other social media. Rather than impersonating Americans as they did in 2016, Russian operatives are working to get Americans to repeat disinformation, the officials said. That strategy gets around social media companies' rules that prohibit ""inauthentic speech.""And the Russians are working from servers in the United States, rather than abroad, knowing that American intelligence agencies are prohibited from operating inside the country. (The F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security are allowed to do so with aid from the intelligence agencies.)Russian hackers have also infiltrated Iran's cyberwarfare unit, perhaps with the intent of launching attacks that would look like they were coming from Tehran, the National Security Agency has warned.Some officials believe that foreign powers, possibly including Russia, could use ransomware attacks, like those that have debilitated some local governments, to damage or interfere with voting systems or registration databases.Still, much of the Russian aim is similar to its 2016 interference, officials said: search for issues that stir controversy in the United States and use various methods to stoke division.One of Moscow's main goals is to undermine confidence in American election systems, intelligence officials have told lawmakers, seeking to sow doubts over close elections and recounts. American officials have said they want to maintain confidence in the country's voting systems, so confronting those Russian efforts is difficult.Both Republicans and Democrats asked the intelligence agencies to hand over the underlying material that prompted their conclusion that Russia again is favoring Mr. Trump's election.Although the intelligence conclusion that Russia is trying to interfere in the 2020 Democratic primaries is new, in the 2019 report of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, there is a reference to Russian desires to help Mr. Sanders in his presidential primary campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2016. The report quoted internal documents from the Internet Research Agency, a troll factory sponsored by Russian intelligence, in an order to its operatives: ""Use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest except for Sanders and Trump -- we support them.""How soon the House committee might get that information is not clear. Since the impeachment inquiry, tensions have risen between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the committee. As officials navigate the disputes, the intelligence agencies have slowed the amount of material they provide to the House, officials said. The agencies are required by law to regularly brief Congress on threats.While Republicans have long been critical of the Obama administration for not doing enough to track and deter Russian interference in 2016, current and former intelligence officials said the party is at risk of making a similar mistake now. Mr. Trump has been reluctant to even hear about election interference, and Republicans dislike discussing it publicly.The aftermath of last week's briefing prompted some intelligence officials to voice concerns that the White House will dismantle a key election security effort by Dan Coats, the former director of national intelligence: the establishment of an election interference czar. Ms. Pierson has held the post since last summer.And some current and former intelligence officials expressed fears that Mr. Grenell may have been put in place explicitly to slow the pace of information on election interference to Congress. The revelations about Mr. Trump's confrontation with Mr. Maguire raised new concerns about Mr. Grenell's appointment, said the Democratic House committee official, who added that the upcoming election could be more vulnerable to foreign interference.Mr. Trump, former officials have said, is typically uninterested in election interference briefings, and Mr. Grenell might see it as unwise to emphasize such intelligence with the president.""The biggest concern I would have is if the intelligence community was not forthcoming and not providing the analysis in the run-up to the next election,"" said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former intelligence official now with the Center for a New American Security. ""It is really concerning that this is happening in the run-up to an election.""Mr. Grenell's unbridled loyalty is clearly important to Mr. Trump but may not be ideally suited for an intelligence chief making difficult decisions about what to brief to the president and Congress, Ms. Kendall-Taylor said.""Trump is trying to whitewash or rewrite the narrative about Russia's involvement in the election,"" she said. ""Grenell's appointment suggests he is really serious about that.""The acting deputy to Mr. Maguire, Andrew P. Hallman, will step down on Friday, officials said, paving the way for Mr. Grenell to put in place his own management team. Mr. Hallman was the intelligence office's principal executive, but since the resignation in August of the previous deputy, Sue Gordon, he has been performing the duties of that post.Mr. Maguire is planning to leave government, according to an American official.Adam Goldman, Julian E. Barnes and Nicholas Fandos reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York. Eric Schmitt and David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographAmerican intelligence agencies concluded that Russia, on the orders of President Vladimir V. Putin, interfered in the 2016 election.

| Jump to first hitBernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg emerge at the top of the field as two former front-runners fade.MANCHESTER, N.H. -- The revolution has not come. Bernie Sanders is looking like the front-runner anyway.The more moderate, non-Sanders alternatives combined to far outpace the liberal Vermont senator's vote share here on Tuesday night, with Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of a small Indiana city, again holding him to a virtual draw. His predictions of runaway progressive turnout remain unproved.But the two fading former favorites who once seemed to have a hold on the liberal establishment and the moderate establishment -- Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. -- lost, badly. Two other professed unity candidates, Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar, performed well in New Hampshire but have shown little capacity to resonate with nonwhite voters so far.And with no consensus among his doubters about how best to stop him, and who is best positioned to do it, Mr. Sanders's early hold on a fractured primary field has laid bare a distressing truth for some Democrats: The man who has long resisted the party's label might just become the standard-bearer.Mr. Biden had spoken for months of his peerless ability to win. But his debacle in New Hampshire, after another in Iowa, had him hustling to South Carolina by Tuesday evening, hastily scheduling an event in a state where he hopes his standing with black voters can save him.""We're still mildly hopeful here in New Hampshire,"" Mr. Biden said earlier on Tuesday before jetting off. The adverb was doing a lot of work.Mr. Buttigieg, hoping to supplant his rivals as the most viable center-left choice, has often leaned on tone as much as substance -- Democratic elevator music, some critics suggest -- presenting himself as broadly palatable to less ideological voters. After a punchy final few days in New Hampshire, where he and Mr. Sanders traded insults over electability and fund-raising practices, Mr. Buttigieg appeared to land a gentle dig at Mr. Sanders's age (smuggled in a compliment) in his remarks to supporters on Tuesday night.""I admired Senator Sanders when I was a high school student,"" Mr. Buttigieg said.Mr. Sanders's challenges remain legion. He is still a democratic socialist who recently survived a heart attack. He is still viewed skeptically across much of the Democratic electorate. He has, for the second state in a row, fallen well short of his support levels from the 2016 primary against Hillary Clinton, though the field was much smaller then.Yet ""the establishment"" of Mr. Sanders's daily warnings is less a monolith than a collection of anxious officials and strategists, with wishes not necessarily decisive in a moment this chaotic.And if there are probably still a few smoke-filled rooms where party eminences gather to worry aloud about his chances in a general election against President Trump, recent history suggests that a coalition this ungainly -- unbending progressives, disaffected moderates, Obama-Trump voters -- cannot be herded with ease.""This isn't the Kremlin,"" said Steve Israel, the former New York congressman and onetime chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ""The thought that Democrats are disciplined enough to march from orders on high is a fantasy.""So far, the orders from on low suggest that Mr. Sanders is doing something right.""We have an unprecedented grass-roots movement from coast to coast,"" he said in Manchester on Tuesday.The best way to win is to win, generally speaking, but the primary now includes several campaigns arguing that the reality is more complicated.Hours before the polls closed on Tuesday, Ms. Warren's team sent reporters a memo from her campaign manager, Roger Lau, maintaining that she is still the candidate ""with the highest potential ceiling of support.""Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, has wagered an entire candidacy on not bothering with the first four states and hoping for a messy February among his peers. (Iowa was particularly accommodating to his cause.) His nine-figure ad spending could further jumble the race in the coming weeks, as candidates like Ms. Klobuchar strain to establish a presence across the national map.Then there is Mr. Biden.Even when he has not attacked Mr. Biden directly, Mr. Sanders's crusades against the establishment can feel precision-engineered to diminish the onetime front-runner. Mr. Biden is a proud capital wheeler-dealer, trumpeting his ability to find compromise in the decades since he was elected to the Senate at 29.To this day, Mr. Biden defaults to language befitting a longtime committee chairman: He sometimes seeks to take a ""point of personal privilege,"" he frequently references various pieces of legislation from years ago, and he has referred to at least one campaign rival as his ""distinguished friend.""Some of his top 2020 surrogates were longtime Senate colleagues, including the Democratic Party's 2004 nominee, John Kerry.At the debate last Friday, he sought at every turn to highlight his past political and legislative accomplishments. Take on gun violence? ""I'm the only guy that beat the N.R.A. twice."" Campaign finance reform? ""The way to deal with Citizens United is to pass a constitutional amendment I introduced 25 years ago.""Yet voters have so far rejected Mr. Biden's insistence on Washington experience, and those who do believe in his message of bipartisanship have gravitated toward younger candidates offering their own versions of that pitch.Mr. Biden's campaign was already in turmoil in recent days, on the heels of a significant leadership shake-up and pleas from some supporters to embrace sweeping changes in media and travel strategy: Make Mr. Biden more accessible to the reporters, they suggested. Engage in more retail politics, Mr. Biden's greatest strength. Maybe even sharpen the message. (After spending a day lighting into Mr. Buttigieg on Saturday, complete with a digital ad that belittled the former mayor's small-town experience, Mr. Biden was back to oblique swipes on Sunday.)Perhaps his most urgent concern now is financial: While Mr. Biden's campaign worked to set expectations low for Mr. Biden in New Hampshire, some donors, alarmed by the Iowa result, have privately voiced nerves about another weak finish -- and showed renewed signs of interest in Mr. Bloomberg.Mr. Biden's allies hold no monopoly on political panic at the moment. For many Democrats, recent weeks have been pocked with reminders of a primary that could have been. After a midterm triumph that owed heavily to the success of female and nonwhite candidates, the contest has instead been dictated often by white men, including a few in their 70s.In particular, the stumbles of Ms. Warren, a polling leader for much of 2019, have registered as a startling disappointment for many supporters. In her closing days here, she had dwelled often on the third anniversary of the time Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, inadvertently coined the phrase ""nevertheless, she persisted"" inside the Capitol, a slogan now printed on T-shirts, embroidered on pillows and tattooed on bodies, as Ms. Warren has reminded voters.""Her life is her message,"" said Allison Cutler, 63, who had traveled from Vermont to help as a Warren volunteer. ""And her message is her life.""Addressing supporters on Tuesday night, Ms. Warren -- whose allies have suggested all week that prognosticators are not to be trusted -- was left to salute somebody else for defying predictions.""I also want to congratulate my friend and colleague, Amy Klobuchar,"" she said, ""for showing just how wrong the pundits can be when they count a woman out.""PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, above, is positioned as the Democratic front-runner, while former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. desperately needs a convincing win in South Carolina. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY TRAVIS DOVE FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES; CHANG W.

| Jump to first hitVladimir Putin is eager both to take the sheen off U.S. democracy and for a counterpart who is less likely to challenge his territorial and nuclear ambitions.
At first glance, it may seem contradictory that the nation’s intelligence agencies were telling Congress that President Vladimir V. Putin is presumably striving to get President Trump re-elected, while also warning Senator Bernie Sanders of evidence that he is the Russian president’s favorite Democrat.
But to the intelligence analysts and outside experts who have spent the past three years dissecting Russian motives in the 2016 election, and who tried to limit the effect of Moscow’s meddling in the 2018 midterms, what is unfolding in 2020 makes perfect sense.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders represent the most divergent ends of their respective parties, and both are backed by supporters known more for their passion than their policy rigor, which makes them ripe for exploitation by Russian trolls, disinformation specialists and hackers for hire seeking to widen divisions in American society.
But in this election, the broad strategy — as opposed to the specific tactics — is not exactly a mystery. Mr. Putin, the analysts agree, mostly seeks anything that will further take the sheen off American democracy and make presidential elections in the United States seem no more credible than his own. After that, he is eager for a compliant counterpart in the White House, one less likely to challenge his territorial and nuclear ambitions.
Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders disagree on almost everything, but both share an instinct that the United States is overcommitted abroad: Neither is very likely to pursue policies that push back aggressively on Mr. Putin’s plan to restore Moscow’s influence around the world, from the former Soviet states to the Middle East.
And if you are trying to sow chaos in an a vitriolic election, Mr. Putin can hardly hope for better than a face-off between an incumbent with a history of race-baiting who is shouting “America First” at rallies — while suggesting that the coming election is rigged — and a democratic socialist from Vermont advocating a drastic expansion of taxes and government programs like Medicare.
“Any figures that radicalize politics and do harm to center views and unity in the United States are good for Putin’s Russia,” said Victoria Nuland, who in a long diplomatic career had served both Republican and Democratic administrations, and had her phone calls intercepted and broadcast by Russian intelligence services.
The intelligence reports provided to the House Intelligence Committee, inciting Mr. Trump’s ire, may make the American understanding of Mr. Putin’s plans sound more certain than they really are, according to intelligence officials who contributed to the assessment. Those officials caution that such reports are as much art as science, a mixture of informants, intercepted conversations and intuition, as analysts in the nation’s 17 intelligence agencies try to get into the heads of foreign leaders.
Though intelligence officials have disputed that the officer who delivered the main briefing said Russia was actively aiding the president’s re-election, people in the room said that intelligence officers’ responses to lawmakers’ follow-up questions made clear that Russia was trying to get Mr. Trump re-elected.
Intelligence is hardly a perfect process, as Americans learned when the nation went to war in Iraq based in part on an estimate that Saddam Hussein was once again in search of a nuclear weapon.
Not surprisingly, the Kremlin says this is all an American fantasy, aimed at demonizing Russia for the United States’ own failings. “These are more paranoid announcements which, to our regret, will multiply as we get closer to the election,” Mr. Putin’s confidant and spokesman, Dmitry S. Peskov, was quoted by Reuters as telling reporters on Friday. “They have nothing to do with the truth.”
No matter who is elected, Mr. Putin has probably undermined one of his own primary goals: getting the United States and its allies to lift sanctions that were imposed after he annexed Crimea and accelerated a hybrid war against Ukraine.
“By actively exploiting divisions within American society and having its activities revealed, the Kremlin has ensured that its longer-term goal of having the U.S. remove sanctions and return to a less confrontational relationship so far has been thwarted,” Angela E. Stent, a former national intelligence officer for Russia and now a professor at Georgetown University, said in her book “Putin’s World: Russia Against the West and With the Rest.”
Ms. Stent noted on Saturday that if the Russians were in fact interfering in this election, “it could bring about new energy sanctions.” She said that one piece of legislation in the Senate would require new sanctions if evidence of Russian meddling emerged from intelligence agencies. So far, Mr. Putin may have concluded that the penalties are a small price to pay if he can bring his geopolitical rival down a few more notches, she added. And the early intelligence analyses suggested that by backing Mr. Sanders in the primary and Mr. Trump in the general election, Mr. Putin would probably have a good chance of maximizing the electoral tumult.
Robert O’Brien, the president’s national security adviser, said in an interview with ABC to be broadcast on Sunday that he had not seen evidence that Russia sought to intervene in Mr. Trump’s favor, and that the reports of Mr. Putin helping Mr. Sanders’s campaign came as “no surprise.”
Mr. Sanders, for his part, on Friday warned Moscow to stay out of the election.
The senator is hardly a new target for the Russians. The 2018 indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers for their activities in the last presidential election — issued by the Justice Department under the Trump administration — claimed that the officers “engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.”
Robert S. Mueller III, in the report on his investigation into Russian operations, concluded that the release of memos hacked from the Democratic National Committee were meant to inflame Mr. Sanders’s supporters by revealing that the committee was funneling assets to Mrs. Clinton.
The more recent public reports emerging from the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I., and classified reports generated by the C.I.A. and others suggest that while the Russian objectives have remained the same, the techniques have shifted.
“The Russians aren’t going to use the old playbook — we know that,” said Christopher C. Krebs, who runs the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
His organization, along with the National Security Agency and British intelligence, has been steadily documenting how Russian operatives are becoming stealthier, learning from the mistakes they made in 2016.
As they focus on evading more vigilant government agencies and technology companies trying to identify and counter malicious online activity, the Russians are boring into Iranian cyberoffense units, apparently so that they can initiate attacks that look as if they originate in Iran — which itself has shown interest in messing with the American electoral process. Russians are putting more of their attack operations on computer servers in the United States, where the National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies — but not the F.B.I. and homeland security — are prohibited from operating.
And, in one of the most effective twists, they are feeding disinformation to unsuspecting Americans on Facebook and other social media. By seeding conspiracy theories and baseless claims on the platforms, Russians hope everyday Americans will retransmit those falsehoods from their own accounts. That is an attempt to elude Facebook’s efforts to remove disinformation, which it can do more easily when it flags “inauthentic activity,” like Russians posing as Americans. It is much harder to ban the words of real Americans, who may be parroting a Russian story line, even unintentionally.
Mr. Krebs said that this was why the Department of Homeland Security had to focus on educating Americans about where their information was coming from. He asked last year: “How do you explain, this is how you’re being manipulated? This is how they’re hacking your brain?”
In 2018, the United States Cyber Command and the National Security Agency mounted a new and more public campaign to push back at the Russians, attacking and blocking their Internet Research Agency for a few days around the November elections and texting warnings to Russian intelligence officers that they were being watched. The N.S.A. is preparing for similar counterattacks this year: On Thursday, the United States cited intelligence and blamed Russia for a cyberattack last fall on the republic of Georgia, another place where Mr. Putin seems to be holding dress rehearsals.
Now American intelligence agencies face a new question: How do they run such operations, and warn Congress and Americans, at a moment when the president is declaring that the intelligence on Russian election meddling is “another misinformation campaign” that is “launched by Democrats in Congress”?
The intelligence agencies are loath to cross Mr. Trump. The acting director of national intelligence at the time, Joseph Maguire, had resisted appearing in public to provide the “Worldwide Threat Assessment,” which is usually given to Congress before the president’s State of the Union address. (He was dismissed this week before he had to testify.) Because Mr. Trump was so angered by how the testimony of Mr. Maguire’s predecessor contradicted his own statements last year — particularly on Iran, North Korea and the Islamic State — Mr. Maguire was in no hurry to repeat the experience.
Mr. Maguire’s successor, Richard Grenell, the current American ambassador to Germany, is known for his political allegiance to Mr. Trump, not for his knowledge of the American intelligence agencies. He is widely viewed by career officials as more interested in making sure public intelligence reports do not embarrass Mr. Trump than sounding the clarion call that the Russians are coming — again.

| Jump to first hitThe Democratic presidential candidate said he would spend big even if the nominee was someone he had sharp differences with, like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.SAN MARCOS, Texas -- Michael R. Bloomberg on Saturday did not rule out spending a billion dollars of his own money on the 2020 presidential race, even if he does not win the Democratic nomination, and said he would mobilize his well-financed political operation to help Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren win in November if either is the party nominee, despite their sharp policy differences.Mr. Bloomberg's plans would effectively create a shadow campaign operation for the general election, complete with hundreds of organizers in key battleground states and a robust digital operation, ready to be inherited by the party nominee -- regardless of who that nominee may be.Already, Mr. Bloomberg has spent more than $200 million on advertising, putting him on pace to spend by early March about the same as what President Barack Obama's campaign spent on advertising over the course of the entire 2012 general election. If Mr. Bloomberg fails to win the nomination, future spending would be redirected toward attacking Mr. Trump.""It depends whether the candidate needs help; if they're doing very well, they need less. If they're not, they'll need more,"" he said in an interview after a lunch stop at a barbecue restaurant during a campaign swing through Texas.While he did not rule out dropping a billion dollars on his effort, the former mayor of New York City blanched slightly at the size of the number, before mentioning the $2.8 billion he spent on charitable contributions last year, with the bulk going to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University.""You know how much money a billion dollars is?"" said Mr. Bloomberg. ""It's a lot of money to me. It's a lot of money to anybody.""No firm decisions have been made about how his operation might transition to a general election, or what form it would take, but aides say hundreds of field organizers have been offered jobs through the general election. In Texas, where Mr. Bloomberg spent Saturday campaigning, he plans to open 17 offices and keep the ""major ones"" operational through the general election, he said. In 2018, Mr. Bloomberg spent more than $110 million to elect Democratic House members through his Super PAC, a vehicle that could be transitioned to assist with a general election effort.His extraordinary wealth, estimated at more than $50 billion, has drawn a series of attacks from the liberal candidates in the field, who argue he is essentially trying to purchase the party nomination. Some of their aides also fear that Mr. Bloomberg could turn his massive machine against them in the primary, leveraging his spending to block them from capturing the nomination.Mr. Bloomberg said he would mobilize his operation behind any of the Democratic candidates, even Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts senator, or Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator. Mr. Bloomberg said he did not plan on running negative ads against any Democratic candidate, even those he strongly disagreed with.""I really don't agree with them,"" he said, of Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, ""but I'd still support them, yes, because compared to Donald Trump that's easy.""While most of the candidates are spending the bulk of their time in the first four primary states, Mr. Bloomberg is orienting his operation toward the Super Tuesday primaries in states like Texas on March 3, when about 40 percent of all the delegates are at stake.With recent polling showing four candidates -- Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. -- all in a position to win both Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr. Bloomberg could play an influential role in the primary process, once the race moves past the early contests. His aides have indicated that Mr. Bloomberg is not inclined to keep pouring money into an extended contest with Mr. Biden and would instead reorient his campaign into an organization dedicated to battering Mr. Trump, should the former vice president emerge as the leader in the race.His spending, entirely self-funded, has meant that though Mr. Bloomberg meets the polling requirement for the party debates, he does not meet the donor qualifications for participating.As he campaigned across Texas, Mr. Bloomberg cast that decision as a campaign strength, illustrating his independence from financial interests.Yet he also criticized the party's process, echoing concerns leveled by other candidates who say the rules set by the Democratic National Committee are excluding qualified contenders. Mr. Bloomberg will not appear on the debate stage on Tuesday, when the candidates meet in Des Moines for their final face-off before the Iowa caucuses.""I think Cory Booker's got a good complaint. If I wanted to complain, I could make a good case that it wasn't fair,"" he said. ""In the meantime, while they're debating, I'm out visiting a whole lot of people. I'm not wasting the time.""PhotographMichael R. Bloomberg greeting residents as he took a campaign swing through Texas on Saturday.

| Jump to first hitIt's hard to believe there are still contests to come. When they'll happen is anyone's guess.Hi. Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Lisa Lerer, your host.Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.We now almost certainly know how the Democratic primary is going to end. We just don't know when it will happen.Tuesday night, as San Francisco sheltered in place and the European Union barricaded borders, Joe Biden swept three primary contests. He won nearly every county in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, capturing majorities across virtually all major demographic groups.Now Bernie Sanders finds himself in a particularly difficult position.The spread of the coronavirus means he can't campaign. He can't get news coverage. And he can't seem to narrow the gap in delegates.The large rallies he uses to energize his supporters are suspended over concerns about the virus spreading. Cable news networks didn't air his remarks last night, sticking with coronavirus reports instead. To capture the nomination he would have to win the remaining delegates by around 20 percentage points, requiring a net 40-point improvement over his performance so far, as our colleague Nate Cohn points out.The only state Mr. Sanders has won since Super Tuesday is North Dakota. In a normal election, that would be a cue for Mr. Sanders to find a podium, give a concession speech before teary-eyed supporters and vow to back Mr. Biden.But, as we all know, these are not normal times.Every major state primary election until Wisconsin on April 7 has been postponed. Two states -- Louisiana and Kentucky -- have even pushed their elections past June 9, the deadline set by the Democratic National Committee.Wisconsin's primary, too, could get moved, as the coronavirus spreads. On Wednesday, Democrats sued to extend the state's deadline for online voter registration and vote-by-mail applications.To be honest, we don't know when the next round of voting will be.But what is clear is that the coronavirus crisis flipped a switch among Democratic primary voters.When asked today's most pressing questions -- who can best handle a crisis and who has the best chances to defeat Donald Trump -- Democrats picked Mr. Biden by significant margins in all three states, according to surveys by the National Election Pool.Some Democrats say the concern about Mr. Sanders is obvious: If you can't win primaries in states like Florida, Arizona and Michigan, how do you expect to win a general election? They're urging him -- in ways both quiet and more vocal -- to end his campaign.Mr. Sanders doesn't agree. At least not yet.The liberal champion sees the current crisis as a moment to press the case that he's been making for years about health care and income inequality, issues that are likely to become more immediate as the virus spreads.And with so much uncertainty, the race could shift if there's a gap of weeks -- or months! -- before the next voting.There's certainly one other candidate who sees an advantage if Mr. Sanders remains in the race: President Trump. For months, he has delighted in the prospect of an intraparty fight, which he believes will benefit his re-election bid, and has repeatedly claimed, without evidence, that the D.N.C. has ""rigged"" the election against Mr. Sanders.""The DNC will have gotten their fondest wish and defeated Bernie Sanders, far ahead of schedule,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Wednesday. ""Now they are doing everything possible to be nice to him in order to keep his supporters. Bernie has given up, just like he did last time. He will be dropping out soon!""The Sanders campaign has begun to prepare its supporters for political reality to sink in. ""No sugarcoating it, last night did not go the way we wanted,"" Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, wrote in a note to supporters Wednesday morning.He added, ""We are losing the battle over electability to Joe Biden.""In at least one way, Mr. Sanders has already won. On issues like climate change, taxes and health care, Mr. Biden's platform is further to the left than any Democratic nominee's in recent history.""I've been doing this a long time and it is by far the most progressive agenda we have ever seen on the Democratic side,"" said former Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, who once headed the D.N.C. ""Bernie has made a tremendous impact. My only hope is that Bernie continues his energies against Trump.""As for Mr. Sanders, aides say he plans to vote on the coronavirus relief package in Washington before heading home to Vermont with his wife to assess their path forward.When asked in the Capitol today about his campaign plans, Mr. Sanders lashed out: ""I'm dealing with a fucking global crisis,"" he told reporters.Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We'll try to answer it. Have a comment? We're all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com .When will polls open again?Is anyone holding elections anymore? I wanted to get a better sense of what's left of the primary calendar, so I called up Nick Corasaniti, political reporter, newsletter writer and Jersey rock expert.Here's what he told me about voting in the time of coronavirus:Hi, Nick! Where are you holed up?I am in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, right now. I am at my Ikea desk that I got on Craigslist and put in the corner of my room, and I also went on Craigslist and got an ergonomic chair. I'm actually more comfortable in this chair that I am at my desk chair at the office.My house is so small that I can't even fit a chair along with a desk for my husband and a desk for my kid. So, anyway, are there going to be any more primaries or are we done?There will be more primaries. Nothing is set in stone, but it does look like the next big one, Wisconsin, will probably happen on April 7. They also have some municipal and county elections and a state Supreme Court justice on the ballot. So there are some transfer-of-power issues there that make it a little bit harder to move than a simple presidential primary, as other states have done.Why can't all these states just switch to voting by mail?It's not an easy switch to flip, both practically and legislatively. All of our election systems are on a state-by-state basis, and then in some states decentralized further down to the counties. In Wisconsin, they're decentralized down to municipalities. There are 1,800 municipalities that cover an election. It's a jumble of governments that would need to all act together.You also have to find vendors --What do you need? You need that crayon?-- that can print your ballots. ... Oh, are you talking to your kid?Yeah. Sorry about that. Purple crayon crisis. Anyhow, you were saying?It's not like every state is sitting on enough vote-by-mail ballots for their entire voting population. You have to go print these ballots. You have to have enough envelopes.The bigger thing is that in a lot of states it would require either legislative action or an executive order from the governor. Not all states are on the same page for voting by mail and some would need different laws.Is there any effort to think through how we might need to change the general election voting in November, or are people just not there yet?There are efforts in Congress to mandate the opportunity to vote by mail for everyone. But the thought of this passing before any of the primaries seems unlikely.Any changes made for the primaries would likely also apply to a general election.So, how are you going to spend the rest of the day?I'm going to spend the rest of the day calling secretaries of state and state parties to find out how this vote by mail is progressing. But to be perfectly honest, I made the Alison Roman stew last night so I'll have that for lunch. I'll turn on the new Springsteen ""London Calling"" stream that he released last night and take a quick break.Who doesn't love that stew? Stay healthy!...

| Jump to first hitThe senator's sweeping critique of coverage has more merit than we in the media like to admit.When a BuzzFeed News colleague and I sat down with Bernie Sanders in his Capitol Hill office in 2015, he started with a thank you -- for doing what you do to provide an alternative to the corporate media.We stammered a bit, and half apologized. We weren't really doing that, sir; our backers were venture capitalists. He'd have to find an alternative elsewhere.Bernie Sanders has been searching for that alternative to for-profit media for a long time. Back in 1981, when he became mayor of Burlington, Vt., he turned to his staff and said: ""We can't survive. We have to develop our own media.""And while some left-wing media outlets are now emerging, they're not going to flower in time to save his campaign.That became painfully clear last Wednesday when, after his stunning setback on Super Tuesday, Mr. Sanders bent the knee and submitted to a barrage of not particularly friendly questions from the most powerful progressive on TV, the MSNBC host Rachel Maddow.He had been avoiding the network, suspicious of its wealthy hosts and corporate owners. He told Ms. Maddow in mild exasperation that one of his challenges was ""taking on the corporate media, if I might say so.""It was clear the primary voting had shaken the Vermont senator's whole theory of the election -- that he could mobilize a huge new cohort of young people.At the same time, the events of the past week have validated much of his criticism of the media, the subject of a 1988 town hall with Mr. Sanders and the radical provocateur Abbie Hoffman. Mr. Sanders complained that Vermont's television stations had been ""prostituted by commercials."" (The video is a trip, and worth the click.)His main point: ""The media itself is as important a political issue as exists.""Mr. Sanders is right about that, and about two other big things: that much of the U.S. media still covers elections as if they're sporting events and that the affluent New Yorkers who run and appear on television networks are not inclined to like him. The narrative of Joe Biden's comeback was an irresistible story to the media -- one that often eclipsed the coronavirus, never mind discussion of health care or poverty -- on cable news in recent days.The distance between Mr. Sanders's supporters and media executives could be felt with particular intensity in the halls of MSNBC last week. After Chris Matthews, the beloved embodiment of MSNBC's establishmentarian centrism, compared Mr. Sanders's campaign to the Nazi invasion of France, Mr. Sanders's supporters began a drumbeat of criticism that helped lead to Mr. Matthews' ouster. When Joe Biden -- the Chris Matthews of politics -- emerged as the Democratic front-runner on Super Tuesday, the on-air relief at MSNBC was palpable.""What a whole lot of people here see,"" said one senior producer, ""is the same thing as Trump.""That perspective is widely shared in the news business: That Mr. Sanders -- and really any politician who is hostile, or even cranky, to the media -- is following in President Trump's footsteps.It's a canard. Mr. Trump is a star of the corporate media who hacked its commercial incentives to his advantage, delivering free lively entertainment to cable networks desperate for programming. Mr. Trump wants to control that media, and to discredit competing voices. Mr. Sanders wants to remake the media in a new model.""Trump knew how to weaponize that capitalistic greed against them, whereas Bernie's approach has been just to build those other channels,"" said Krystal Ball, a former MSNBC host who has emerged as a leading voice of the pro-Sanders left.Ms. Ball's morning show for The Hill website is one of a handful of signs that the media landscape is beginning to shift in Mr. Sanders's direction. The show, which she co-hosts with a young Trump-backing conservative named Saagar Enjeti, posted impressive numbers on YouTube, with more than 3.4 million hours watched over the last month.The show's fans span left- and right-wing populism. They include leftist insurgents at The Intercept like Glenn Greenwald, who on Twitter called the show a ""super-perky radical trans-ideological 21st Century subversive sequel to the Katie Couric/Matt Lauer morning Today Show in its heyday (minus all that unpleasantness)."" Among its right-wing admirers are Steve Bannon, Mr. Trump's former campaign adviser, who in an interview described Ms. Ball as ""hard core,"" along with the Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who texted that the two ""seem to understand, better than almost anyone else talking about it, what's really happening in American politics.""On Friday morning in their chilly Washington studio, over a standard-issue cable news glass table, hosts and guests denounced blind support for female candidates as ""lady boss yass queen feminism"" and sneered at ""woke tokenism.""It's a kind of anti-establishment ""Crossfire"" aimed at ""hating each other as American people less -- and hating the elites more,"" as Ms. Ball put it.The other outlet seeking to fill the space where ""the Trump and Bernie person meet"" is Vice, the new television chief, Morgan Hertzan, told me. He says he's remaking the company's channel (formerly known as Viceland) based on research that shows there's a news audience alienated from ""corporate media.""The goal is to create an outsider's network in stark contrast to MSNBC's inside conversation. Mr. Hertzan said the network was recruiting top progressives to host a new wave of shows and developing a weekly program with Anand Giridharadas, an MSNBC enfant terrible whose book, ""Winners Take All,"" denounces self-serving billionaire philanthropists.Mr. Giridharadas said he wanted to make TV that is a rebuke to cable news as it now exists. ""When you get to that level of television, everyone is prosperous at the table,"" he said in an interview. ""I'm not sure I've ever sat next to an uninsured person on television. I sit next to uninsured people on the subway all the time.""Vice and The Hill are not, in fact, socialist institutions. They are companies on the shaky edge of big American media. Their programming choices, echoing the YouTube success of companies like the The Young Turks and a handful of independent outlets, more likely mark the beginning of a new generation's dissent getting slickly packaged and sold to the mainstream.Vice will struggle with the decidedly old media problem of how to get cord-cutters to watch a cable channel. But Vice's research, from the expensive strategy firm Magid, found what populists everywhere are discovering: Angry outsiderism is a growth industry. The new Vice mantra, Mr. Hertzan said, is, ""The everything system is broken -- let's fix it together.""Mr. Sanders has his own plan for the media revolution. He wants to break up big media and tech conglomerates, increase funding for public media and empower journalist unions. An adviser, Robert McChesney, said in an interview that Mr. Sanders is ""open to"" the more radical idea of having the federal government provide a $200 ""citizenship news voucher"" to all Americans, who would then use the voucher to support public media outlets of their choosing.While Mr. Sanders's criticism of the media has more merit than most reporters like to acknowledge, the media has often gotten Mr. Sanders right, too. His weaknesses, from a rigid attachment to the battles of an earlier generation to his struggle to persuade older black Democrats to join his revolution, aren't media inventions. They're good, fair stories.And in 2020, far more than in 2016, the media has also captured his strengths: his consistency, his commitment to the poor, his deep popularity with young people. A top supporter of Mr. Sanders, New York's mayor, Bill de Blasio, offered an explanation for that in an interview.Capitalist ownership or not, the mayor said, ""There are plenty of journalists who are class traitors.""PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders has long been searching for an alternative to for-profit media.

| Jump to first hitThe nominal Democratic front-runner denounced Russia's efforts to attack American democracy.WASHINGTON -- Russia has been trying to intervene in the Democratic primaries to aid Senator Bernie Sanders, according to people familiar with the matter, and Mr. Sanders said on Friday that intelligence officials recently briefed him.The disclosure came a day before the Nevada caucuses, where Mr. Sanders is a favorite, and followed revelations a day earlier that Moscow was interfering on President Trump's behalf this year, as it did in 2016.Mr. Sanders denounced Russia in a statement, calling President Vladimir V. Putin an ""autocratic thug"" and warning Moscow to stay out of the election. Drawing a contrast with Mr. Trump, he said he would stand against any efforts by Russia or another foreign power to interfere in the vote.""The intelligence community is telling us they are interfering in this campaign right now in 2020,"" Mr. Sanders separately told reporters in Bakersfield, Calif., where he held a rally on Friday. ""And what I say to Mr. Putin: 'If elected president, trust me, you are not going to be interfering in American elections.""'Mr. Sanders said he was briefed about a month ago. Asked why the disclosure came out now, he said: ""I'll let you guess about one day before the Nevada caucus. Why do you think it came out?""On Friday, the president aggressively disputed that Russia was interfering on his behalf. He called the disclosures a hoax and part of a partisan campaign against him. At a campaign rally in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump suggested that Mr. Putin would prefer Mr. Sanders, ""who honeymooned in Moscow."" Mr. Sanders and his wife traveled to the Soviet Union in 1988 on a trip that political opponents have called their honeymoon, a term that the couple have jokingly used, too.Russia's interference on behalf of both Mr. Trump, the dominant force in the Republican Party, and Mr. Sanders, a stalwart of the left, underscores its efforts to sow chaos across the political spectrum. Undermining the democratic system remains at the core of Russia's effort to raise its own stature by weakening the United States, according to current and former officials.Russia's interference measures and their intensity remain murky, even as intelligence officials sound alarms.In briefings to House Intelligence Committee members last week and to Mr. Sanders, officials said that Russia was actively interfering in the campaign, and people at the House briefing said intelligence officials said that Russia had a preference for Mr. Trump.Revelations about the House briefing enraged the president, who complained that Democrats would use Moscow's support for him against him, people familiar with the matter said. Days later, he replaced the acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, though administration officials have said it was not a direct result of the briefing.Richard Grenell, the American ambassador to Germany whom Mr. Trump appointed this week to replace Mr. Maguire, asked the agencies under his purview on Friday to provide the raw information and analysis that went into the briefing, people familiar with the matter said.Mr. Grenell's appointment has drawn criticism from former intelligence officials who question his lack of experience and his record as a partisan ideologue. He immediately began a major personnel reshuffle, forcing out the official acting as the top deputy to the director of national intelligence.Other officials have hastened planned exits, as Mr. Grenell looks to install his own team.The House briefing was a supposed to be a repeat of an unremarkable classified session with the Senate Intelligence Committee in January and to inform lawmakers about a broad range of election threats, not just Russian interference. But lawmakers focused on the disclosures about Russia's support for Mr. Trump and challenged the briefer, Shelby Pierson, the nation's election security czar.Intelligence officials disputed that Ms. Pierson said that Russia was actively aiding the re-election of the president. She did say Russia was seeking to influence American elections, including the primaries.But people who heard the briefing said that the intelligence officers presenting the material said, in response to questions from lawmakers, that Russia was trying to get Mr. Trump re-elected.Republicans have disputed that Russia supports Mr. Trump, insisting that Mr. Putin simply wants to broadly spread chaos and undermine the democratic system. They have also argued that Mr. Sanders's gestures of peace toward the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War might make him appealing to Mr. Putin.But some current and former officials expressed doubt that Russian officials think that Mr. Sanders has a hidden affinity for Moscow. Instead, they said that a Russian campaign to support Mr. Sanders might ultimately be aimed at aiding Mr. Trump. Moscow could potentially consider Mr. Sanders a weaker general election opponent for the president than a more moderate Democratic nominee, according to two people familiar with the matter.The Washington Post first reported the briefing of the Sanders campaign. The campaign sought to pin the blame for the disclosure on the Trump administration, suggesting it was retribution for critical remarks Mr. Sanders had made about Mr. Grenell in 2018.Russia also worked to support -- or at least not harm -- Mr. Sanders in 2016. Operatives at a Russian intelligence-backed troll factory were instructed to avoid attacking Mr. Sanders or Mr. Trump, according to the report by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, and an indictment he secured of 13 Russians working on the operation.Both the indictment and Mr. Mueller's report quoted internal documents from the Internet Research Agency ordering operatives to attack Hillary Clinton's campaign. ""Use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest except for Sanders and Trump -- we support them,"" the document said.Russian operatives used the troll factory in 2016 to pose on social media as Americans and sow divisions among already divisive issues like immigration, religion and race. It was one part of the Kremlin's multipronged attack on the election that also included hackings of Democratic emails, payments to unsuspecting Americans to stage pro-Trump rallies in battleground states and at least one scouting trip to the United States in 2014.Mr. Sanders said the Russians were again trying to interfere in the race. Some ""ugly stuff on the internet"" had been attributed to his campaign that could be coming from falsified accounts, he said.His online army of supporters is both coveted by his rivals and a source of complaints because of what they say is abusive behavior online. During the Democratic debate on Wednesday in Las Vegas, Mr. Sanders suggested that Russian trolls may be responsible for the some of the worst of the postings.""All of us remember 2016, and what we remember is efforts by Russians and others to try to interfere in our election and divide us up,"" he said. ""I'm not saying that's happening, but it would not shock me.""Julian E. Barnes reported from Washington, and Sydney Ember from Las Vegas. Katie Rogers contributed reporting from Las Vegas, and Adam Goldman and Zach Montague from Washington.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders, above, warned President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, right, to stay out of the presidential election. ""And what I say to Mr. Putin: 'If I am elected president, trust me, you will not be interfering in American elections.""'

| Jump to first hitThe move by SEA/SEIU Local 1984 stood in contrast to its national affiliate's decision so far to stay neutral in the presidential race.A local union branch of New Hampshire state and local employees said Sunday that it had voted to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the Democratic presidential nomination, another labor endorsement for a candidate whose political stock continues to rise less than a month before the Iowa caucuses.The endorsement, which will officially be made on Monday, is particularly notable because the union chapter, SEA/SEIU Local 1984, has acted separately from its national affiliate organization, the Service Employees International Union. That group, which represents about two million workers nationally, has remained neutral in the endorsement process up to this point, balancing relationships with multiple candidates and regional concerns that differ across local chapters.But the New Hampshire chapter wanted to use its political firepower to back Mr. Sanders in time for the state's first-in-the-nation primary, Rich Gulla, the local president, said in a statement. About 10,000 workers across the state are represented by the union's collective bargaining contract.The chapter also voted to endorse Mr. Sanders during the 2016 presidential election -- even as the national organization backed his rival and the eventual Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.""Senator Sanders has taken the time to stand with us on multiple occasions,"" Mr. Gulla said, citing a joint news conference that state workers held with Mr. Sanders in December. ""This type of unwavering dedication to New Hampshire's workers means that we can trust him to have our backs. For these reasons and more, we are thrilled to endorse Senator Bernie Sanders for president.""Both the 2016 primary and general elections for president disrupted many labor organizations and the political process that governs their endorsements. Several groups experienced a split between rank-and-file members and union leadership, emblematic of the larger grass-roots and establishment split that has roiled both political parties in recent years.As a consequence, many labor organizations have been more transparent, democratic and prudent about their endorsement process in this election cycle. At SEIU, which endorsed Mrs. Clinton in November 2015, well before the Iowa caucuses, there are few plans to back an individual candidate before early-state voting begins in 2020.Leaders have instead established a lengthy interview process for candidates that includes embracing a ""Unions for All"" agenda and walking for a day with SEIU members. According to union organizers who were familiar with Local 1984's process, the national group's board was aware that the local was set to endorse Mr. Sanders ahead of the state primary, and did not discourage it from doing so.It is unclear whether other local chapters will now become more involved in the presidential race. In a statement, Sara Lonardo, a spokeswoman for the national union, said, ""SEIU members are paying close attention to this race and are still evaluating candidates on their plans to put power back in the hands of working families and give all working people the ability to join together in unions, no matter where they work""Ms. Lonardo said. ""We will continue engaging our members nationwide to determine who they see as the best candidate for our union to endorse.""Mr. Sanders has increasingly gathered grass-roots support in recent months, as the Democratic Party's left wing has rallied around his candidacy. In October, Mr. Sanders announced endorsements from popular House Democrats including Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. He has also gained the backing of labor organizations like National Nurses United and left-wing advocacy groups including the Center for Popular Democracy Action and People's Action.Last week, he earned the backing of two progressive issue-focused groups: Dream Defenders, a Florida-based collection of activists that focuses on criminal justice reform, and the Sunrise Movement, a group made up of young climate activists.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders campaigning late last month in Plaistow, N.H. A local union branch said it wanted to use its political firepower to help his candidacy ahead of the state's crucial primary.

| Jump to first hitThe defense from Bernie Sanders was straightforward: It wasn't me.He had been milling about on the Senate floor one day in the summer of 2017 when a colleague, Kamala Harris, stepped toward him. ""Do we have a problem?"" Ms. Harris asked, according to Democrats familiar with the exchange.Some prominent Sanders supporters had been flaming Ms. Harris publicly as the preferred choice of the corporate Democratic establishment against which Mr. Sanders had long railed, a view amplified among Sanders-boosting accounts across social media. ""Pre-emptive strike,"" one person wrote on the popular SandersForPresident Reddit group, where Sanders fans were sharing details of Ms. Harris's recent fund-raising swing in the Hamptons with former Hillary Clinton donors. ""Start the conversation now, end it before 2020.""Mr. Sanders assured Ms. Harris that there was no issue, the Democrats familiar with their conversation said. He insisted that he could not control how his followers communicated.But two years later, as both senators pursued the party's 2020 presidential nomination and Ms. Harris returned to the Hamptons to collect campaign checks, Mr. Sanders broadcast an observation of his own after Ms. Harris raised doubts about his ""Medicare for all"" plan. ""I don't go to the Hamptons to raise money from billionaires,"" he tweeted last August, elevating a message that supporters had already been pushing. Thousands of retweets followed.Since the start of Mr. Sanders's first presidential campaign in 2016, his colossal online support base has been by turns a source of peerless strength and perpetual aggravation -- envied and caricatured by rivals who covet such loyalty, feared by Democrats who have faced harassment from his followers, and alternately cherished and gently scolded by the candidate himself.The zeal of Mr. Sanders's fans has helped establish him as one of the 2020 front-runners a week before the Iowa caucuses. No other Democrat attracts supporters more dedicated to forcefully defending their candidate and lashing his foes, more willing to repeatedly donate their time and money to sustain his bid. Through the end of 2019, Mr. Sanders had raised nearly $100 million from over five million individual donations, without ever holding traditional fund-raisers, leading the primary field.Yet as Mr. Sanders moves to position himself as a standard-bearer for a party he has criticized from the left for decades, the power of his internet army has also alarmed Democrats who are familiar with its underside, experienced in ways large and small.Some progressive activists who declined to back Mr. Sanders have begun traveling with private security after incurring online harassment. Several well-known feminist writers said they had received death threats. A state party chairwoman changed her phone number. A Portland lawyer saw her business rating tumble on an online review site after tussling with Sanders supporters on Twitter.Other notable targets have included Ady Barkan, a prominent liberal activist with A.L.S. -- whom some Sanders-cheering accounts accused of lacking decision-making faculties due to his illness as he prepared to endorse Senator Elizabeth Warren -- and Fred Guttenberg, the father of a shooting victim from the 2018 Parkland massacre, who had criticized Mr. Sanders's statements about gun violence.""Politics is a contact sport,"" said Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina State legislator who supported Ms. Harris in the Democratic primary. ""But you have to be very cognizant when you say anything critical of Bernie online. You might have to put your phone down. There's going to be a blowback, and it could be sexist, racist and vile.""In recent days, he said, one man sent a profanity-filled private message on Instagram, calling Mr. Sellers, who is black, an ""Uncle Tom"" and wishing him brain cancer.When Mr. Sanders's supporters swarm someone online, they often find multiple access points to that person's life, compiling what can amount to investigative dossiers. They will attack all public social media accounts, posting personal insults that might flow in by the hundreds. Some of the missives are direct threats of violence, which can be reported to Twitter or Facebook and taken down.More commonly, there is a barrage of jabs and threats sometimes framed as jokes. If the target is a woman, and it often is, these insults can veer toward her physical appearance.For some perceived Sanders critics, there has been mail sent to home addresses -- or the home addresses of relatives. The contents were unremarkable: news articles about the political perils of centrism. The message seemed clear: We know where you live.'I condemn bullying and harassment of any kind and in any space.'-- Bernie Sanders, in a 2019 letter to supportersInterviews with current and former staff members and major online supporters make clear that top advisers -- and often, Mr. Sanders himself -- are acutely aware of the bile spread in his name.In February 2019, shortly after announcing his second presidential run, Mr. Sanders emailed a letter to surrogates. ""I want to be clear,"" he said, ""that I condemn bullying and harassment of any kind and in any space.""That he felt compelled to append this note to his national reintroduction was perhaps as telling as its contents.The Sanders campaign declined to discuss its 2020 digital operation and the extent to which it monitored social media discussions.A spokesman, Mike Casca, flagged Mr. Sanders's call for civility from last February. The campaign also released a statement from a spokeswoman, Sarah Ford, emphasizing the candidate's previous remarks. ""As the senator has said loudly and clearly,"" she said, ""there is no room in the political revolution for abuse and harassment online.""Sanders aides routinely decide against commenting publicly about an online spat, reasoning that to do so would only elevate the conflict. The candidate's defenders are quick to reject any suggestion that Mr. Sanders is responsible for the most egregious conduct of his followers, who are disproportionately young and overrepresented online, when the vast majority proceed with greater care.His allies also argue that online combat is not unique to the Sanders side, with some high-profile women who support the senator saying they have been attacked, too.""The same folks who want to complain that Sanders supporters are more vicious than anybody else never come out to chastise the supporters of other candidates,"" said Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator and Mr. Sanders's national campaign co-chair.But many political veterans outside the Sanders operation fault the campaign's handling of the vitriol.Jess Morales Rocketto, a progressive strategist who worked on campaigns for Barack Obama and Mrs. Clinton, said Mr. Sanders had empowered aides and surrogates who ""have a tendency to aggressively amplify things that a campaign would normally shut down amongst supporters.""""There are always people who say things that are problematic. It's not that that is unique to Bernie's campaign,"" she said. ""What's unique is it is a consistent problem in the universe of Bernie Sanders.""'You can't control these folks.'-- RoseAnn DeMoro, a Sanders supporter and former leader of National Nurses UnitedWith more than 10 million followers on Twitter, Mr. Sanders has a larger audience on the platform than Ms. Warren, Pete Buttigieg, Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Amy Klobuchar combined. A sizable number could be automated bots or fictitious accounts. Federal prosecutors have detailed coordinated efforts by Russian nationals to interfere in the 2016 election, with an emphasis on two candidates -- Donald J. Trump and Mr. Sanders -- whom the Russians hoped to bolster while denigrating their opponents.In a party gripped with anxiety about unifying to defeat Mr. Trump, the venom among Sanders backers and their counterparts supporting other candidates is of serious concern to Democrats.Peggy Huppert, an Iowa activist who consulted for the 2016 Sanders campaign, said she had decided to support Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., in 2020 ""in large part because of the way he conducts himself."" She praised Mr. Sanders's letter to supporters after his announcement but said that this message had plainly failed to resonate.""Obama set the tone for his campaign: 'You are positive, you are respectful, you are civil,""' Ms. Huppert said. ""I guess Bernie hasn't.""In recent days, Sanders supporters have filled the social media feeds of Ms. Warren and her allies with snakes -- emojis, GIFs, doctored photographs -- following the candidates' quarrel over whether Mr. Sanders had told Ms. Warren privately in 2018 that a woman could not win the presidency. And last week, Mrs. Clinton resurfaced to revisit old wounds, telling The Hollywood Reporter that Mr. Sanders was to blame for permitting and ""very much supporting"" a toxic campaign culture.For many of Mr. Sanders's admirers, the interview only reinforced a conviction that traditional Democratic forces wish him political harm.So why, they ask, should he be expected to stifle his most potent megaphone?""You can't control these folks,"" RoseAnn DeMoro, a vocal Sanders supporter and former leader of National Nurses United, said of his online base. ""I should say, 'us folks.""'The 2016 roots of the Bernie Sanders internetThere was a running joke inside the Clinton campaign's 2016 Brooklyn headquarters: The cruelest surprise her digital team could pull on staff members was to retweet their personal account from the candidate's handle, putting them on the radar of Mr. Sanders's followers.Mrs. Clinton's aides mostly marveled at the scope and intensity of an ostensible long shot's online base.Mr. Sanders's supporters, now often identified on Twitter by the rose emoji of the Democratic Socialists of America, loosely coordinated in private channels on Slack, a messaging service designed for the workplace, and congregated on Reddit, posting memes, news and jokes. (Today, there are 384,000 members in the SandersForPresident group on Reddit. The central group for Mr. Biden has about 3,100.)'It would stun me that he wouldn't know what was going on.'-- Michael Ceraso, a 2016 Sanders aideTop Sanders aides initially worked to assemble traditional campaign infrastructure with staff on the ground in early nominating states like Iowa and New Hampshire. But much of the rest of the map was effectively the province of volunteers, who were responsible for helping to translate online enthusiasm into in-person support.To Mr. Sanders, who had long bet his career on the power of mass movements, the online momentum did not necessarily register as unusual, even if he did not understand all the nuts and bolts.Zack Exley, a senior adviser in 2016, said someone once asked Mr. Sanders how he had managed to draw so many people to his events.""What do you mean?"" the candidate replied, according to Mr. Exley. That was just how movements worked.""If you're in that position,"" Mr. Exley said, ""I don't think you're actually curious about how they got there.""Others suggested that Mr. Sanders was highly attuned to what was happening online. His campaign aides tracked popular hashtags and, at times, encountered caustic posts. The candidate was particularly cognizant of, and grateful for, his online supporters' capacity for small-dollar fund-raising.""It would stun me that he wouldn't know what was going on, positive or negative, online,"" said Michael Ceraso, a Sanders aide in 2016 who worked for Mr. Buttigieg's presidential campaign for part of last year.While Mr. Sanders has said he does not have Twitter or any other apps on his phone, he is aware of the power of his online platform. ""Given the fact that I have more social media followers than maybe all of my opponents combined, I guess we're doing something right on that,"" he told The New York Times editorial board. ""What I have recognized is the importance of it.""Ro Khanna, a California congressman who is now Mr. Sanders's national campaign co-chair, said that the same internet that helped usher in the presidencies of Mr. Trump and Mr. Obama had made Mr. Sanders an unlikely juggernaut.""If it weren't for social media, if it weren't for the use of email, Bernie Sanders would never have been a major contender,"" he said. ""It's a glimpse, I think, into what the future of what campaigns may be.""'You better watch where you're going or something's going to happen to you.'-- a message received by Maya Contreras, co-founder of a feminist think tank who has been critical of Mr. SandersThat is precisely what some Democrats fear. As the 2016 primary grew increasingly fractious, Mr. Sanders's campaign found a drawback to such fervor: the online bullying among some supporters.Sady Doyle, a progressive feminist author and Sanders critic who has been the subject of his followers' ire, recalled one message she received from a stranger: ""If you ever have a child, I'm going to dash it on the walls of Troy."" She said her husband asked her not to attend protests alone while pregnant.Maya Contreras, a graduate student and co-founder of a feminist think tank who has criticized Mr. Sanders on Twitter, recalled a deluge in the lead-up to the 2016 election. ""I got messages saying 'go back to where you came from' -- which is Denver, Colorado, where I was born,"" she said.""Someone tweeted and said 'You better watch where you're going or something's going to happen to you,""' Ms. Contreras added. ""I also got 'die bitch.""'In person, serious violence has been avoided, it seems, though there have been occasional low-grade clashes. A May 2016 fight over delegates in Nevada included reports of thrown chairs, which some Sanders supporters dispute, and threats against the state party chairwoman, Roberta Lange, who changed her phone number after receiving a torrent of menacing messages about her, her grandchild and other relatives.Former Senator Barbara Boxer of California, a Clinton supporter who had been at the Nevada convention, said she worried for her safety after being booed offstage.""After the incident, Bernie and I talked on the phone, and he said, 'I can't believe that, my supporters would never do that,""' Ms. Boxer recalled. ""I said, 'Well, you ought to get to the bottom of it, Bernie.""'She said Mr. Sanders responded, ""Those cannot be my people.""By early 2016, the behavior of Mr. Sanders's online supporters, short-handed in the media as ""Bernie Bros,"" had become a stubborn trope, diagnosed as a political problem at the highest levels of the senator's campaign, even as aides largely blamed Mrs. Clinton's operation for overblowing it.At times in public, Mr. Sanders tried to disclaim unseemly conduct. ""We don't want that crap,"" he said in February 2016.But he and his senior team also nursed a sharp sense of grievance. Jeff Weaver, a top Sanders strategist, played down the gravity of the Nevada unrest, telling CNN afterward that ""no one had a right to feel threatened.""""What happens,"" he said, ""is that when you rig the process and you get an angry crowd, you know, they're not used to that.""How 2020 built on what 2016 createdWhen the story broke this month detailing the private conversation between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren about female electability, Sanders surrogates received a message from the campaign, advising them against going out of their way to engage with it publicly.But later that day, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, told CNN that whoever had pushed the Warren story was lying. Shaun King, a civil rights activist and prominent Sanders supporter with more than one million Twitter followers, said he saw an opportunity.Among other widely circulated tweets, Mr. King wrote that he had spoken to Warren campaign staff members who reported that she ""routinely embellishes stories."" He alleged that the Warren campaign and its allies ""leaked this attack against Bernie to the press for political gain.""Eventually, Ms. Turner, the campaign co-chair, got in touch. ""She called me and said, 'Shaun, just let up on it,""' he said. He did, to an extent. But by then, much of the Sanders-aligned internet was about to begin tweeting snakes at Ms. Warren and her supporters en masse.In that instance and more than a handful of others over the past year, the campaign has publicly distanced itself from the rancor. Mr. Sanders's wife, Jane, called for unity as the Warren squabble persisted. Mr. Sanders weighed in when some followers scorched Mr. Barkan, the activist with A.L.S., after his endorsement of Ms. Warren. ""Bernie and all of his staff and surrogates were incredibly gracious and kind when I made the difficult decision to endorse one of my heroes over the other,"" Mr. Barkan said in a statement.The campaign recognizes the possible political downsides in any extreme behavior, but aides are perhaps most wary of the ""bro"" portion of the ""Bernie Bro"" descriptor, as Mr. Sanders prepares to make his case to a diverse Democratic electorate later in the primary calendar. Ms. Ford, the Sanders spokeswoman, said opponents were perpetuating ""a false myth to discount the diversity of our supporters.""While Mr. Sanders's poll numbers with nonwhite voters are stronger than many rivals', female and nonwhite Sanders critics say they continue to face disproportionate harassment from ostensibly progressive forces. ""People talk about white dudes getting radicalized on the right,"" said Imani Gandy, a senior legal analyst for Rewire.News behind a popular Twitter account, @AngryBlackLady. ""I feel like white dudes in Brooklyn are being radicalized too.""Candice Aiston, a lawyer who supported Ms. Harris before she left the primary, sparred with Sanders supporters last year and found herself targeted beyond Twitter: Some condemned her in Google reviews of her law practice and reported her to the Oregon state bar association, which dismissed the complaints.(""She's O.K. at her job, but her right wing ideology screams too loud,"" one online review read. ""Would not recommend."")For the campaign, the balance is delicate -- tut-tutting at times without diluting the force of online support. Mr. Khanna, the congressman and campaign co-chair, called Mr. Sanders ""the one person on our side who can counter what Trump's formidable presence is going to be online.""This view is shared among some online supporters who have turned Sanders fandom into something approaching a full-time job. Rodney Latstetter, a 62-year-old retiree in Illinois who posted repeatedly in 2017 about Ms. Harris's Hamptons fund-raising, said he and a partner spent about seven hours a day running dozens of pro-Sanders social media groups. His Twitter page boosts Mr. Sanders and raises doubts about his rivals to more than 17,000 followers.""Some of my followers -- there are a few of them that have a little bit of an issue with their mouth or something like that,"" Mr. Latstetter said, adding that he was unsure if he would support any of the other Democratic candidates if they won the nomination. ""I also have my moments, too, where I have my limits, and I come out fighting.""Such digital combat has seeped perceptibly into popular culture. The singer John Legend, endorsing Ms. Warren in a tweet this month, added a note of caution for Sanders supporters: ""Try not to drive people away with your nastiness. I will happily vote for him if he wins the primary. Chill.""This did not necessarily land with its intended audience.""Some of you millionaires need to realize that many of us actually *need* Bernie Sanders to win the Presidency,"" one account replied. ""We can't just 'chill.""'Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting.PhotographFor Senator Bernie Sanders, the online support has been a source of peerless strength and perpetual aggravation.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump claims Nancy Pelosi has intentionally undermined Bernie Sanders's presidential campaign by delaying the impeachment trial. Mr. Sanders denounced that theory on Friday.WASHINGTON -- The first version of the conspiracy theory was hatched on Twitter last Friday, Jan. 10.""Don't rule out that the reason Pelosi hasn't sent impeachment to the Senate is to hurt Warren and Sanders, and to help Biden,"" Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary for President George W. Bush, tapped out on his iPad. ""By timing the trial so it takes place during the Iowa lead-up, she has leverage over the liberals.""Mr. Fleischer's message was retweeted 1,400 times.Seven days later, Mr. Fleischer's theory that Speaker Nancy Pelosi was attempting to influence the Democratic primary -- for which there is no evidence -- was being promulgated by President Trump.""They are rigging the election again against Bernie Sanders, just like last time, only even more obviously,"" Mr. Trump tweeted on Friday, claiming his Senate trial was designed to keep Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator, grounded in Washington instead of campaigning in Des Moines ahead of the Feb. 3 caucuses.""Crazy Nancy thereby gives the strong edge to Sleepy Joe Biden, and Bernie is shut out again,"" the president added.An idea that caught fire on Twitter and became grist for Mr. Trump demonstrates how the same echo chamber of right-wing media that boosted him in 2016 is exerting its power again just before the first primary votes are cast in 2020.There was nothing new in terms of the process that got the idea in front of Mr. Trump. But the evolution from online conspiracy theory to Fox News fodder to presidential talking point demonstrated how a world of conservative influencers, Republican lawmakers and online media outlets can drive disinformation through repetition and amplification.Two days after Mr. Fleischer's tweet, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the House minority leader, appeared on Maria Bartiromo's show on Fox News and repeated it. ""This is the dirty little secret nobody is talking about: why the Speaker held these papers,"" Mr. McCarthy said on Sunday. ""This benefits Joe Biden. This harms Senator Sanders, who is in first place and could become their nominee.""In fact, Mr. Sanders is not the national front-runner for the nomination and never has been, although he had a narrow lead in a recent poll of likely Iowa caucusgoers. But Mr. Trump's re-election campaign in recent weeks has been seeking to elevate Mr. Sanders, viewing the self-described democratic socialist as the president's ideal Democratic opponent in November.The Trump camp, in turn, is worried about Mr. Biden's competitiveness against the president in Midwestern battleground states, and would like to do anything possible to trip up the moderate former vice president in his tight primary race against the liberal Mr. Sanders.Mr. McCarthy has continued to repeat the theory and profess support for Mr. Sanders, repeating the talking points in an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News. His television commentary was then written up by Breitbart News, the right-wing news and opinion site.On Thursday, The Federalist, a conservative website, ran an article with the headline: ""Is Impeachment Delay How Democrats Are Rigging Iowa Against Bernie Again?"" It said Ms. Pelosi's decision to delay impeachment ""provokes the question whether she is deliberately helping Joe Biden.""One day later, the message had reached the White House, where Mr. Trump, a frequent purveyor of conspiracy theories, presented the idea as a fact.""It's easy to see why Bernie and his supporters would think the establishment is screwing them again,"" said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign, noting that the campaign often looks to Mr. Trump's Twitter feed for its daily message.Conspiracies surrounding Mr. Sanders's political fortunes have been a particular fixation for Mr. Trump, dating back four years. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump circulated the false and unsourced claim that an ""analysis"" -- he did not say who wrote it or where it was published -- concluded that Mr. Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if not for superdelegates, the party leaders and officials who were not bound to vote for the winner of their states' primaries or caucuses.At the time, Mr. Trump and his advisers realized the potential political benefit in lobbing these kinds of accusations. Their campaign, which relied heavily on depressing Democratic turnout as a way to win battleground states like Florida and Michigan, stood to gain by fanning the flames of the rivalry between Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton and dredging up the bitterness that many Sanders supporters felt over their loss.Even after winning the election, Mr. Trump continued to claim that Mrs. Clinton had somehow robbed Mr. Sanders of victory. When Donna Brazile, the former Democratic National Committee chairwoman, released a memoir in 2017, Mr. Trump inaccurately said the book showed that Mrs. Clinton ""bought the DNC & then stole the Democratic Primary"" from Mr. Sanders.In an interview, Mr. Fleischer said he had not seen the idea about the timing of the impeachment trial anywhere else and had not consulted with anyone when he first pitched it on Twitter. ""I just do my best to realistically assess what's happening in Washington,"" he said. Mr. Fleischer said he believed that Ms. Pelosi does not think Mr. Sanders can beat Mr. Trump in November, and that ""she has one big thing on her mind: that's winning the White House.""He said his tweet took off because ""if it has merit, it starts to gather momentum.""""If it has no merit, it's just another tweet,"" he added.Republican staff members on Capitol Hill said the theory gained traction because of a broader narrative -- pushed by Mr. Sanders's own supporters -- that Mr. Sanders was generally getting a raw deal from the mainstream news media and other candidates in the race.In a statement on Friday, in response to a question from The New York Times about the president's conspiracy tweet, Mr. Sanders denounced the theories. ""Let's be clear about who is rigging what: It is Donald Trump's action to use the power of the federal government for his own political benefit that is the cause of the impeachment trial,"" he said. ""His transparent attempts to divide Democrats will not work, and we are going to unite to sweep him out of the White House in November.""Ms. Pelosi's team has also made it clear she was not trying to meddle in the nominating process.""Impeachment has nothing to do with politics or the presidential race,"" a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, Drew Hammill, wrote on Twitter this week, responding to Mr. McCarthy's accusation. ""As usual, the Minority Leader has no idea what he's talking about.""On Friday, he added: ""Regardless, Senator Sanders isn't the only senator running, so this doesn't make any sense.""Annie Karni reported from Washington, and Jeremy W. Peters from New York.A journey from Twitter to Fox News to the president's feed.PhotographPresident Trump claimed without evidence that Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, was ""rigging"" the Democratic presidential primary.

| Jump to first hitElizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are longtime allies on the left. But her pool of voters generally doesn't look like his base.Welcome to Poll Watch , our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election .Throughout the 2020 presidential race, Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have seemed like reluctant foes.They met with each other before starting their campaigns. They had each other's backs at the debates, until they didn't. Most important, they agreed on how to confront the issues -- boldly and structurally -- if not always on the exact details.But Ms. Warren's pool of voters, who are casting for an alternative after she dropped out of the Democratic race on Thursday, generally doesn't look like Mr. Sanders's base. There is reason to believe that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. could pick up nearly as many of Ms. Warren's former voters as Mr. Sanders does.""Obviously the more strong liberal policy folks should break more for Sanders than Biden,"" Paul Maslin, a longtime Democratic pollster, said in an interview. ""But I don't know that it's going to be anywhere near unanimous. If Biden is over the hump and is now clearly the accepted candidate as the best to beat Trump, and there's a coalescing of the party around that view, he's going to gain all kinds of support.""There is certainly significant overlap between the core support of Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren, the party's two leading liberals. He is particularly well positioned to usurp the kinds of older millennials and Generation X liberals who often favored Ms. Warren.Indeed, in a Quinnipiac poll conducted early last month, when Mr. Biden was reeling from a weak performance in the Iowa caucuses, Ms. Warren's voters were four times as likely to name Mr. Sanders as their second choice as they were to pick Mr. Biden.Even still, only a third of her supporters in that poll pointed to Mr. Sanders as a runner-up. That equals out to less than 5 percent of the Democratic electorate. Besides, a lot has happened in the past month; most other candidates have disappeared from the race, and much of the party has united behind Mr. Biden.Most troublingly for Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren's support profile has roughly as much overlap with Mr. Biden's as it does with his.Ms. Warren's base is heavily tilted toward college graduates, women, white people and middle-to-high-earners. It's not as if Mr. Sanders has been unable to win votes in these demographics. For instance, his backers on Super Tuesday were just as likely to be women as to be men.But there is a working-class tilt to Mr. Sanders's support that does not play out with Ms. Warren's. He is diminishingly popular as you go up the income scale, whereas the opposite is true of Ms. Warren.If the average Warren voter is an upper-middle-class white woman, Mr. Sanders is in a tough spot: He has serious vulnerabilities among this group. In Massachusetts -- where Mr. Sanders beat Ms. Warren in her home state by five percentage points -- he won just one-fifth of white women with college degrees, making this his weakest such age-education-gender group. Ultimately he lost the state to Mr. Biden by seven points.""For most suburban or upper-middle-class white women, Joe Biden is a pretty comfortable place to land,"" Mr. Maslin said.""There's the Obama connection, there's a sense of stability and experience that's probably pretty helpful, and then to the extent that they're being pragmatic, they probably see him as a potentially stronger candidate against Trump,"" he added, though he noted that polling did not suggest that either Mr. Biden or Mr. Sanders was significantly better positioned for the general election.The good news for Mr. Sanders is that Ms. Warren's backers are highly likely to identify as liberals -- even more so than his own -- and exit polls suggest that the two candidates' voters tend to agree on the issues.The bad news for him is that his remaining rival, Mr. Biden, has already shown an ability to win over a solid chunk of liberal voters. In Super Tuesday states with available data, 40 to 60 percent of Biden voters identified as liberals.But the moderate former vice president isn't an ideal choice for Ms. Warren's voters, either. He has not articulated policy goals nearly as far-reaching or precise as Ms. Warren did. Many of her higher-educated, technocratic-minded voters may struggle to find either candidate convincing.Ultimately, Ms. Warren's voters are likely to wash out, unless she makes a big endorsement that effectively pushes them one way or the other. And even in that case, it can be hard for candidates to break through with certain demographics that have proved stubbornly averse to them.The fundamental problems for Mr. Sanders as he looks to stall Mr. Biden's momentum are that he cannot seem to break through with black voters or older voters, in spite of his increasingly targeted appeals to African-Americans and his campaign's focus on his lifelong attempts to preserve Social Security. Ms. Warren's base -- heavily white, and light on voters over 65 -- doesn't have much to offer him on those fronts.PhotographSenator Elizabeth Warren's supporters skew liberal, as do Senator Bernie Sanders's. But there is a working-class tilt to Mr. Sanders's support that does not play out with Ms. Warren's.

| Jump to first hitAs Bernie Sanders shows strength in the early-voting states, his opponents face a challenge: Attacking him can help fuel his campaign.DES MOINES -- A Democratic super PAC wanted to undermine Senator Bernie Sanders's presidential candidacy just days before the Iowa caucuses. It may have handed him a gift instead.Mr. Sanders's campaign said on Wednesday that it had raised more than $1.3 million since it began fund-raising the day before off a negative ad produced by the super PAC that targets Mr. Sanders by name.The ad, backed by the political action arm of the group Democratic Majority for Israel, argues that Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, would be unable to beat President Trump in the November general election, citing his heart attack nearly five months ago and his left-wing ideology as evidence that he would be too risky a choice for Iowa caucusgoers focused on winning back the White House.The ad was scheduled to begin airing in Iowa on Wednesday, but the Sanders campaign sent an email to supporters on Tuesday warning that Mr. Sanders was being targeted by negative ads and alluding to an ""outside spending group"" without citing Democratic Majority for Israel.By Tuesday evening, Mr. Sanders had posted a video on Twitter addressing the ads. ""It is no secret that our campaign is taking on the political establishment and the big-money interests, who are now running negative ads against us in Iowa,"" he said in the video. ""The billionaire class is getting nervous, and they should.""The Sanders campaign, like many of its rivals, often points to signs of adversity to juice donations, and Mr. Sanders's supporters responded on Tuesday with a flood of contributions. The financial windfall underscored a central challenge facing his opponents: Attacking him can help fuel his campaign.The attack ad, which will run through the caucuses on Monday, comes amid rising concern among some Democratic Party elected officials and strategists, who have grown increasingly anxious about the prospect that Mr. Sanders could capture the nomination. Several recent polls have shown him leading in Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two nominating contests.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]Many Democrats now believe they need to act fast to prevent Mr. Sanders from stringing together a series of victories in the early contests, fearing that a wait-and-see approach could end up being too late and too divisive for the party.Democratic Majority for Israel is focused on raising support for Israel within the party, and the group and its allies worry that Mr. Sanders's questioning of the Democratic Party's longstanding support for Israel could damage the United States' historically strong relationship with the country. But Mark Mellman, the group's president, said it was equally worried about Mr. Sanders's chances against Mr. Trump if he were to become the nominee.In a statement, Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, condemned the ad and called on the rest of the Democratic presidential field to do the same.""Every single Democratic candidate running for president needs to condemn these kinds of negative attack ads run by dark money groups,"" he said. ""It does not reflect the values of our party and it is not in the spirit of our issues-driven primary contest.""He added, ""But what our fund-raising numbers show is our supporters know the establishment will do anything to try to stop Bernie, and they're ready to rally to his side at a moment's notice.""The campaign said its fund-raising haul came from more than 70,000 donations.Lisa Lerer contributed reporting from Ames, Iowa, and Shane Goldmacher from Des Moines.PhotographAn ad paid for by a Democratic super PAC cast doubt about Bernie Sanders's chances of beating President Trump.

| Jump to first hitIn a messy Democratic forum, Bernie Sanders, the emerging front-runner, faced his most serious test so far. Michael R. Bloomberg also drew withering criticism.CHARLESTON, S.C. -- The Democratic presidential candidates delivered a barrage of criticism against their party's emerging front-runner, Senator Bernie Sanders, at a debate on Tuesday night, casting him as a divisive figure with unrealistic ideas, even as they continued to batter Michael R. Bloomberg for his extreme wealth, his record on policing and his alleged behavior toward women.Mr. Sanders, in his first debate since a smashing victory in the Nevada caucuses last weekend, cut a combative but perhaps not a commanding figure, firmly defending his left-wing agenda on subjects like health care and foreign policy against attacks from all sides. The forum plunged repeatedly into an unsightly spectacle of flailing hands and raised voices, and even outright chaos, with candidates talking over one another and the moderators struggling and failing at times to direct an orderly argument.But Mr. Sanders said little that seemed intended to ease the concerns of Democrats who do not share his views or who worry that such stances could be politically damaging to the party. And the debate underscored vulnerabilities that are likely to shadow him for as long as the race lasts, and perhaps into a general election against President Trump.In one striking exchange, Mr. Sanders addressed his record of praising some accomplishments of the Castro government in Cuba by intensifying his denunciations of past American foreign policy, invoking what he called malign intervention in countries like Chile and Iran.Mr. Sanders also had highly skeptical Democrats sharing the stage with him in Charleston, some of them fighting fiercely for political survival. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who is counting on South Carolina to resuscitate his presidential candidacy, challenged Mr. Sanders on his comments about Cuba and his opposition to certain forms of gun control in an insistent performance that reflected the urgent stakes for his campaign.Mr. Biden's determined focus on South Carolina was apparent from the early moments of the debate. He vowed to win the state outright; delivered a lengthy attack on Tom Steyer, a billionaire investor who has spent freely there to woo black voters away from Mr. Biden; and, in the final minutes of the forum, abruptly pledged to appoint a black woman to the Supreme Court.And when Mr. Sanders invoked former President Barack Obama, arguing that he had gone no further in praising the Cuban system than Mr. Obama did during a visit there, Mr. Biden took issue with that characterization and indicated he had discussed it recently with Mr. Obama himself. Indeed, Mr. Biden and Mr. Obama spoke on Tuesday before the debate, a person briefed on the conversation said.""I never say anything about my private conversations with him,"" Mr. Biden said onstage. ""But the fact of the matter is, he, in fact, does not, did not, has never embraced an authoritarian regime and does not now.""For the first time, Mr. Sanders, a Vermont liberal, also drew pointed criticism from his fellow progressive, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts: After spending 14 months as a candidate avoiding direct confrontation with Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren opened the debate by questioning his record of policy achievements and presenting herself as a candidate who shared his ideas but ""would make a better president.""But it was not clear by the end of the debate that any one opponent stood apart from the pack as the most successful rival to Mr. Sanders, and time is running short for anyone to do so. If Mr. Biden is counting on a surge of support from black voters in South Carolina this weekend to propel him back into contention nationally, the rest of the contenders have even less certain paths forward. They are charting a coast-to-coast scramble for delegates that has left once-surging candidates, like former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, falling back on a range of guerrilla tactics to stay competitive.It was Mr. Sanders, however, who came in for the roughest night. Mr. Buttigieg warned that nominating Mr. Sanders would not only cost Democrats their chance to capture the White House, but also jeopardize their majority in the House and their chance of taking the Senate.Pointing to the congressional Democrats elected in 2018, Mr. Buttigieg told Mr. Sanders, ""They are running away from your platform as fast as they possibly can.""Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City who is trying to claim the mantle of centrist standard-bearer, joined in, saying of Mr. Sanders: ""Can anybody in this room imagine moderate Republicans going over and voting for him?""As he has done throughout the campaign, Mr. Sanders dismissed the warning about his ability to win over moderates by pivoting to what he views as a strength: his largely untested ambition to drive up voter turnout among constituencies that already lean toward the Democratic Party.""If you want to beat Trump,"" he said, ""what you're going to need is an unprecedented grass-roots movement of black and white and Latino, Native American and Asian, people who are standing up and fighting for justice.""Mr. Biden, fighting for survival in the state on which he has staked his candidacy, delivered perhaps the most searing critique of Mr. Sanders, invoking the 2015 church massacre here in Charleston to confront Mr. Sanders for his mixed record on guns.""Nine people shot dead by a white supremacist,"" Mr. Biden said, then rebuked Mr. Sanders for his past opposition to waiting periods for gun purchases: ""I'm not saying he's responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon if the waiting period had been what I suggest.""The former vice president demonstrated more vigor than at many of the previous debates, when he often seemed somnolent. He sprinkled local references into his comments, sought to interject even when he was not called on and complained when he felt he was not given enough time.Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bloomberg both answered their critics somewhat sparingly, choosing a handful of attacks to parry without delivering point-by-point rebuttals.Mr. Sanders acknowledged that he had taken stances on guns in the past that he later came to regret. And he responded forcefully to an attack by Mr. Bloomberg claiming that the Russian government was seeking to buoy Mr. Sanders's campaign by interfering in the election, citing Mr. Bloomberg's past laudatory remarks about President Xi Jinping of China.Addressing the Russian head of government, Mr. Sanders declared, ""Hey Mr. Putin, if I'm president of the United States, trust me, you're not going to interfere.""Most of all, Mr. Sanders insisted from start to finish that, contrary to the claims of his critics, his ideas were far from ""radical,"" and pointed abroad for evidence that even his most ambitious proposal -- ""Medicare for all"" -- was a mainstream idea in many other countries.""In one form or another,"" Mr. Sanders said of his policies, ""they exist in countries all over the world.""Mr. Sanders was also pressed about his comments on CBS's ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday praising the literacy programs enacted by Fidel Castro in Cuba. Plainly irritated, he said he condemned all authoritarian governments but repeatedly returned to a broad denunciation of American aggression in Latin America and the Middle East.""Occasionally,"" Mr. Sanders said at one point, ""it might be a good idea to be honest about American foreign policy, and that includes the fact that America has overthrown governments all over the world.""Mr. Buttigieg used the moment to again raise his claim that Mr. Sanders would be a general election disaster, suggesting that Democrats would be asked why their standard-bearer ""is telling people to look at the bright side of the Castro regime.""On display, too, was Ms. Warren's dual challenge as she fights for national momentum ahead of next week's Super Tuesday contests: On the one hand, she is plainly eager to keep up a battle against Mr. Bloomberg that has delighted her supporters and reinvigorated her candidacy. At the same time, she must contend, perhaps more urgently, with the fast and formidable rise on the left of Mr. Sanders -- a force she tried to counter by casting herself as a more accomplished progressive.She pointed to their shared history of battling Wall Street: ""In 2008, we both got our chance,"" Ms. Warren said, ""but I dug in, I fought the big banks, I built the coalitions and I won.""For the second consecutive debate, Mr. Bloomberg visibly sighed and rolled his eyes as Ms. Warren assailed his variegated political history and demanded fuller disclosure from his company about its treatment of women. Mentioning his history of giving large campaign contributions to Republicans, Ms. Warren said, ""The core of the Democratic Party will never trust him.""Mr. Bloomberg tried to pivot away from Ms. Warren's criticism to make an argument about his own experience, alluding to his role taking over as mayor of New York after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. ""I have the experience, I have the resources and I have the record,"" Mr. Bloomberg said, ""and all of the sideshows that the senator wants to bring up have nothing to do with that.""But as in the debate last week, Mr. Bloomberg's loose phrasing offered Ms. Warren the chance to throw a hard counterpunch: What Mr. Bloomberg called a ""sideshow,"" she said, involved matters as serious as pregnancy discrimination. She also raised an allegation that he had once pressured an employee to have an abortion, a charge Mr. Bloomberg vehemently denied.Mr. Bloomberg is not on the ballot in South Carolina on Saturday, but his strength as a candidate in the Super Tuesday primaries next week may depend in large part on whether he can maintain a solid bloc of support among black voters, or whether African-American voters who have drifted away from Mr. Biden over the past month return to his side in the coming days.Mr. Biden projected confidence when he was asked directly about his support from black voters, the cornerstone of his coalition and a group that will make up over half of the Democratic electorate on Saturday.""I will win the African-American vote here in South Carolina,"" Mr. Biden said, taking care to note he was not taking their support for granted. ""I'm here to ask. I'm here to earn it.""In a sign that Mr. Steyer was making inroads with South Carolina's black voters, Mr. Biden also took on the billionaire and first-time candidate, noting that Mr. Steyer had invested in private prisons that ""hogtied young men.""Stung by the attack, Mr. Steyer said he had sold his stock in private prisons, then sought to highlight Mr. Biden's support for the hard-line 1990s crime bill. But Mr. Biden interrupted him and tagged him with a new nickname for changing his mind on private prisons: ""Tommy Come Lately.""Still, Mr. Sanders was clearly the primary target of the night. Ms. Klobuchar also confronted him, boring in on his expansive policy proposals and the risk she said they would pose.""The math does not add up,"" Ms. Klobuchar said, arguing that Mr. Sanders's agenda amounted to ""a bunch of broken promises that sound good on bumper stickers.""When Mr. Sanders was able to defend himself, he cited studies indicating that ""Medicare for all will save money."" But before long he was facing another barb from Mr. Bloomberg, who called the long-term consequences of a Sanders nomination and a Trump re-election a ""catastrophe.""Jonathan Martin reported from Charleston, and Alexander Burns from New York.PhotographThe Democratic forum in Charleston, S.C., on Tuesday night sometimes descended into chaos, with voices rising and hands flailing.

| Jump to first hitHow Democratic voters feel about Bernie Sanders's views on foreign policy and socialist governments tends to split along generational lines.MIAMI -- In the spring of 1989, as the outgoing mayor of Burlington, Vt., Bernie Sanders and his wife, Jane, traveled to Cuba on an eight-day trip, with the hopes of meeting the Cuban dictator, Fidel Castro.The 47-year-old Mr. Sanders didn't get time with Mr. Castro, but he toured Havana, met with its mayor and marveled that visitors could take a cab anywhere in the country. ""The revolution there is far deeper and more profound than I understood it to be,"" he said back home, according to The Burlington Free Press, and commended Cuba for providing free health care, free education and free housing.Many older Democrats with sharp memories of the Cold War have been baffled and even offended by Mr. Sanders's praise for the country -- which is in the spotlight after he repeated some of it on ""60 Minutes"" this week -- and it is one of the reasons they believe a self-described democratic socialist like Mr. Sanders would be a risky presidential nominee.""It was a colossal blunder,"" said Bob Squires, 70, of Murrells Inlet, S.C. ""Loses Florida. If you look at Twitter, the people who had relatives come from Cuba, they have quite a different view. Bernie's got blinders on.""But for many younger progressives, the negative reactions to Mr. Sanders's comments -- which were also aired and debated in his 2016 presidential campaign -- seem like boomer panic and a pernicious form of red-baiting, and reveal the divides within the Democratic Party.""Socialism is a supposedly scary term that we've talked about so much, but we really don't understand,"" said Nolan Lok, 18, a chemistry major at the University of California, Los Angeles, where he cast a ballot early on Wednesday, ahead of its primary next week.""In a society where technology is so important, where it takes fewer people to produce more things, we're going to have to have a more socialistic society, where the government needs to step in more,"" he said. ""The government is going to be required to do more, and it's something we should welcome, not be afraid of.""This generational divide among Democrats was vividly apparent in interviews across the country this week assessing Mr. Sanders's views and history, which included trips to the Soviet Union and Nicaragua as Burlington's mayor as well as complimentary remarks about the Sandinistas. He has repudiated American foreign policy backing anti-Communist governments and resistance forces, and he has been fervently against war. But his remarks about Mr. Castro stand out, like his expression of amazement in 1989 that the Cubans he met ""had almost a religious affection for him.""Older liberals show varying support for Mr. Sanders's positions, and the generational split was less apparent in South Florida, where many Cubans, Venezuelans and Nicaraguans do not like his views. Yet progressive voters born after the end of the Cold War -- many of them people of color -- dismissed the concerns about socialism as anachronistic and irrelevant.For years in Washington, those left-wing views defined and to some extent diminished Mr. Sanders, an independent congressman and then senator who was widely regarded as a quirky outsider to the Democratic establishment. But now as the front-runner for the party's nomination, Mr. Sanders is being pressured to explain his anti-imperialist worldview in the face of scrutiny and criticism from his rivals.Mr. Sanders, 78, was pilloried during Tuesday night's debate in Charleston, S.C., for his remarks on ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday, when he complimented the literacy programs Mr. Castro had enacted. Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., said Mr. Sanders had a ""nostalgia for the revolutionary politics of the 1960s"" and lamented the prospect of ""reliving the Cold War.""Mr. Buttigieg and other Democrats say Mr. Sanders's views are not only misguided but also reinforce his image as a socialist, which will make him and other Democratic candidates down the ballot easy targets for President Trump and Republicans. And if he were to win the nomination, his stances could jeopardize his chances in Florida, the largest presidential general election battleground, where there is little room for appreciation of the 1959 Communist Cuban revolution.Mr. Sanders stood by those positions at the debate, where he criticized U.S. policy in Latin America and repeated his praise for Mr. Castro's literacy program.""Occasionally it might be a good idea to be honest about American foreign policy, and that includes the fact that America has overthrown governments all over the world in Chile, in Guatemala, in Iran,"" Mr. Sanders said.Many older Cuban-Americans cringed at Mr. Sanders's remarks, saying he sounded like an apologist for Communist indoctrination. And his views provoke particularly strong resistance in Miami, where the Cuban diaspora remains a powerful political force.""I was offended by his ignorance,"" said Mario Cartaya, a 68-year-old architect in Fort Lauderdale who left Cuba when he was 9 and is on the board of the Florida Democratic Party. ""It is hurtful not just to Cubans, but it's hurtful to every other Latin American who has fled their country because of the tyranny in those countries.""""And it's not an old comment that he can take back now, 'He's learned from his past mistakes,' or whatever,"" Mr. Cartaya added. ""He said it now; he doubled down on it.""The backlash was evident not only among conservative Cubans but also among liberal ones who helped former President Barack Obama win Florida twice.""It's actually incredible that it's 2020 and we have to talk about this again,"" said Fabiola Santiago, a columnist for The Miami Herald who wrote an emotional column about her experience as a young girl in Cuba. ""We have to rehash Fidel, and we have to rehash the Cuban system. I don't understand exactly what his motivation is.""Mr. Sanders's campaign does not view his remarks on Cuba, or his history of praising socialist governments, as problematic for him because it matters more to older moderate voters, a demographic Mr. Sanders already finds hard to reach.Aides believe he is competitive in Florida in the Democratic primary, and the campaign plans to run commercials in all of the major media markets by next week. It is already deploying staff members to every region of the state.In South Carolina, which holds its primary on Saturday and where many Democrats are evaluating candidates based on their perceived ability to defeat Mr. Trump, older voters examined Mr. Sanders's unyielding views through the lens of electability.""The man had his honeymoon in the old Soviet Union,"" said Harvey William, 70, who works in Charleston, referring to a trip Mr. Sanders and his wife made there shortly after they married in 1988. Mr. William, who intends to vote for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., spoke bitterly about his experiences with socialism growing up in Guyana.Voters at Mr. Sanders's events, however, hardly mention his foreign policy views, instead ticking off his domestic policy agenda that includes implementing Medicare for all and making public colleges and universities tuition-free.""Millennials don't remember the Cold War,"" said Maurice Isserman, a history professor at Hamilton College who has studied democratic socialism. ""They don't react in the same way to the word 'socialist' and associate it with totalitarian communism.""Instead, young voters have experienced a structural shift in the economy, including the 2008 financial crisis and the crushing burden of college debt, that has given them a more critical view of capitalism, he said. Professor Isserman, though, warned that Republicans would use the senator's comments to attack him in a general election.""Bernie is not a communist,"" Professor Isserman said. ""He's not a totalitarian. He's a Scandinavian-style democratic socialist. But he's also a product of the '60s, and he has a kind of in-your-face confrontational style. It's not so much politics as style that is his liability.""Blanca Estevez, a member of the National Political Committee of the Democratic Socialists of America from Arkansas, said her political leanings initially confused her mother, given that the family fled the civil war in El Salvador. But Ms. Estevez said she had made some inroads.""I've been able to tie in my mom's everyday values to the work that we do -- telling her that she's always shared everything she has, she's always helped her neighbor, she's made sure people have what they need where they're down on their luck,"" Ms. Estevez said. ""Four years ago she hated Bernie Sanders. Now we have his sign in our yard.""Even in Florida, Mr. Sanders has some support among younger Cuban-Americans, though they do not necessarily agree with his views on the Castro dictatorship. Defending Mr. Castro's literacy program ""kind of misses the bigger picture, which is the means don't justify the ends,"" said Julián Santos, 30, a legislative aide who was raised by Cuban immigrant parents in Hialeah, the most heavily Cuban-American city.Still, Mr. Santos backs Mr. Sanders, as he did in 2016, because of his emphasis on addressing economic inequality and racial injustice.In states like California, where Mr. Sanders has devoted time and resources to reaching out to the Latino community, some older Democratic voters have come around to him.Concepción Cruz, a 64-year-old Mexican immigrant who voted early in Los Angeles this week, said she had backed Hillary Clinton in the last election. But her three sons have supported Mr. Sanders since 2015, and despite her initial intention to back Mr. Biden this year, she changed her mind after watching several debates.""I want someone who is strong and experienced and will get the current president out,"" she said. ""We're not going to become a socialist country. That's not something I am worried about.""Patricia Mazzei reported from Miami, and Sydney Ember from Winston-Salem, N.C.

| Jump to first hitAn early look at fourth-quarter fund-raising shows Joseph R. Biden Jr. bouncing back, Elizabeth Warren lagging her previous benchmark and Bernie Sanders continuing to haul in cash.Senator Elizabeth Warren's slip in the 2020 primary polls has been accompanied by a dip in donations, with her campaign setting a rare public goal: aiming to raise $20 million for the fourth quarter of 2019 ending Tuesday, or about 20 percent less than what she raised in the previous three-month period.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., meanwhile, has rebounded from a weak third quarter, in which he raised only $15.7 million and spent $2 million more than he took in. Now his campaign is trying to assert his front-runner status in the Democratic race, pushing in the final 48 hours of the year to post ""our biggest fund-raising quarter yet,"" as Mr. Biden wrote in an email on Sunday, by topping the $21.5 million he raised last spring.The shifting financial fortunes of Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden illustrate the unsettled nature of the Democratic presidential contest heading into 2020, with four candidates -- Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren of Massachusetts, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. -- battling for position in the top tier of polling and seeking to bolster their treasuries ahead of the final sprint to the Iowa caucuses and beyond.Mr. Sanders is expected to remain a financial pacesetter in the 2020 contest. He has about 1.6 million individual donations this quarter alone and is nearing a goal of five million total contributions. With an average donation of $18 for the year, and slightly less than that now, the numbers suggest he has already raised about $26 million in the fourth quarter -- more than any Democratic candidate has raised in any quarter this year.No other 2020 candidate has announced reaching three million donations for the year.Mr. Buttigieg is closing in on two million donations (he has more than 1.95 million, according to campaign emails). That means he has already received more than 700,000 contributions this quarter, his most in a three-month period. He recently said his average donation was around $30, suggesting a haul of more than $21 million. Mr. Buttigieg raised $19.1 million and $24.6 million in the previous two quarters.The impending quarterly deadline on Tuesday is critical for the campaigns as they urge their supporters to help them finish the year on a strong note. It is also the last time before the nominating contests begin that they will be required to open the books on their finances, with full reports to be released on Jan. 31.The money chase shows not only which candidates are most viable for a potentially long and contested primary battle but also who has a diverse and well-built financial foundation for a potential general election matchup against President Trump, who entered October with $158 million between his campaign and shared committees with the Republican Party.The estimated hauls are very much subject to change, since campaigns can bank millions in the final days of the quarter. And while the top-line figures for money raised are significant, the Democratic campaigns' cash situation -- how much they have in the bank for ads, organizers and field programs -- is more crucial now that voting begins in less than 40 days.Despite Mr. Biden's turnaround on the fund-raising front -- he raised more in just October and November than he had the previous three months -- he entered the fall with only a fraction of the cash of his leading rivals. His $9 million in the bank on Sept. 30 trailed Mr. Buttigieg by $14.4 million, Ms. Warren by $16.7 million and Mr. Sanders by $24.7 million, gaps he is unlikely to substantially close.That is perhaps one reason Mr. Biden reversed himself in late October and blessed his supporters' forming a super PAC, which has already begun airing television ads in Iowa. (His campaign has said he reversed his stance because of anti-Biden ads funded by Mr. Trump.)It has been a turbulent three months in the fund-raising world as one of the race's stronger fund-raisers, Senator Kamala Harris of California, dropped out unexpectedly in early December, sparking a frenzy among other campaigns for her mostly California-based team of financiers. Former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York also entered the race and began to spend some of his multibillion-dollar personal fortune on an enormous nationwide television ad campaign, reshaping the financial landscape beyond the early-voting states where another billionaire, Tom Steyer, has been flooding the airwaves.Besides the race's four polling leaders, Andrew Yang, the businessman who has surprised political observers with his staying power and a devoted online following he affectionately calls the Yang Gang, is expected to be the only other contender to crack $10 million raised in the fourth quarter.""We expect to raise more than $12.5 million, at least 25 percent more than the previous quarter,"" said S.Y. Lee, a spokesman for Mr. Yang.How candidates are raising their money -- and whom they solicit for contributions -- has become a central point of contention in the primary in recent weeks, with Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren touting their independence from the traditional world of big contributors while hitting Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg for their reliance on wealthy donors.""For far too long, the wealthy and the powerful have used their money to buy our candidates and our elections,"" said Tim Tagaris, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders. ""And what Bernie Sanders is proving -- for the first time -- is that one can run for president without begging them for their money.""In a sign of the breadth of donors that Mr. Sanders counts, his campaign was pushing for 135,000 donations in the last two days of the year; Mr. Biden has set a goal of 500,000 donations for the entire quarter.Ms. Warren, who like Mr. Sanders has decided not to make appeals to big donors at traditional fund-raisers, has called for her rivals to disclose their lists of ""bundlers,"" who have gathered campaign checks for them. In turn, Ms. Warren has been pressed about the $10 million she transferred to her presidential campaign from her 2018 Senate bid, when she was still courting such large contributors.Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg recently did disclose their bundlers, with Mr. Buttigieg sharing the names of more than 100 people or couples who had gathered at least $25,000 and Mr. Biden disclosing more than 200. Mr. Biden appeared to time his release to minimize attention, revealing the names of his top fund-raisers late on the Friday evening after Christmas.Mr. Biden has seen some of the bundlers for his former rivals who have left the race -- especially Ms. Harris but also former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas -- gravitate toward him as he continues to lead in national polling. Former Harris supporters now backing Mr. Biden include John Emerson, an investment executive in California; two influential New York finance-world fund-raisers, Marc Lasry and Blair Effron; and Alex Heckler, an attorney in Florida.""As the field narrows, we're seeing Democrats coalesce and rally around Vice President Biden,"" said Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager for Mr. Biden. ""Voters want a candidate who can bring people together and defeat Donald Trump, and a sense of urgency about that as we approach voting is clearly driving a new wave of support.""Wade Randlett, a fund-raiser for Mr. Biden in the San Francisco Bay Area, said that concerns over Mr. Biden's cash had been overblown and that ""if money were the majority driver of success we'd be talking about a Bloomberg-Steyer ticket.""""Money matters because you need to have enough,"" Mr. Randlett said. ""And we are definitely going to have enough to prosecute a campaign in all 50 states through the primaries.""Ms. Warren was the No. 2 fund-raiser in the field in the third quarter, when she raised $24.6 million. But her campaign said on Friday that she was ""a good chunk behind"" that mark this time, with a little more than $17 million collected with four days left in the quarter.""It will be nearly impossible to match last quarter at this point. But we need to start closing the gap,"" read one Warren solicitation for donations.For the first time in the campaign, Ms. Warren also signed an email to the list of a group that supports her, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which split the proceeds between her and the organization.Mr. Buttigieg's campaign has set a $750,000 target in the final 48 hours of the quarter. He recently told The Des Moines Register's editorial board that ""the average contribution was coming in around 30 bucks.""Beyond the end of the year, Mr. Buttigieg's campaign is expecting at least a small windfall in early January from Wall Street, where he has become a popular figure, as some donors are waiting to avoid running afoul of laws restricting contributions to those who oversee public pensions (Mr. Buttigieg will then no longer be mayor).Two other candidates who have struggled relative to the leaders to raise money and garner attention are hoping to finish 2019 on a high note.Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey, who missed the December debate because of the polling threshold, said two weeks ago that he needed to raise $800,000 to have his best quarter of the year. His previous high was $6 million. He had raised $641,000 of the $800,000 goal as of early Monday, according to a campaign fund-raising email.Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has announced raising more than $1 million in the 24 hours after two recent debates, and has said she would report more money than last quarter, when she raised $4.8 million.PhotographThe shifting fund-raising fortunes of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Elizabeth Warren illustrate the unsettled nature of the Democratic presidential contest.

| Jump to first hitJoseph R. Biden Jr. is now the overwhelming favorite in the Democratic race, amassing a substantial lead over Bernie Sanders in the delegate count and an even larger advantage in the polls. As of Thursday, Mr. Biden had about 150 delegates more than Mr. Sanders, out of more than 1,770 allotted so far, with a number still left to be assigned from Washington State and California.There have been only a few national polls since Super Tuesday, but they have reflected a dramatic shift in Mr. Biden's favor -- one that has lifted him far higher than he was even last spring, when he entered the campaign as a front-runner.The withdrawal of several other candidates, including the progressive Elizabeth Warren, has largely led voters to rally around Mr. Biden. Mr. Biden is now ahead of Mr. Sanders in our polling average, 45 percent to 34 percent, but that almost certainly understates Mr. Biden's advantage because it still includes several older polls taken before his national surge. (At the end of February, Mr. Biden was in the mid-teens in our polling average.)So, is the race over? Not necessarily. Mr. Biden is not close to having the 1,991 delegates he needs to lock up the nomination, and Mr. Sanders can most likely bring in the money he needs to compete indefinitely. With a solid base that appears to make up at least a third of the party at this point, Mr. Sanders may be in a position to press his case for a while. But there is a difference between staying in the race to drive a message, and truly competing to win, and right now it is not clear how Mr. Sanders might be able to overcome Mr. Biden's current lead.Even in the darkest days of his campaign, Mr. Biden had a political firewall he hoped he could count on: the South Carolina primary on Feb. 29, which ultimately rescued his candidacy. Mr. Sanders has no such firewall on the calendar. Indeed, the next few rounds of primary elections appear to favor Mr. Biden, and the dynamics in states like Florida, Illinois and Georgia make it possible that Mr. Biden could build a delegate lead so wide as to be insurmountable.If that were to happen, Mr. Sanders could be forced to consider the possibility that he might imperil the credibility of his agenda by continuing to wage a losing fight against Mr. Biden. ALEXANDER BURNSCoronavirus Changes The CampaignBoth former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont canceled primary-night campaign events on Tuesday.The Democratic National Committee moved Sunday's debate to Washington and announced that it would go on without an audience or the news media (more on that later).Mr. Biden swapped out inperson campaigning for ""virtual events,"" and Mr. Sanders, too, curtailed travel and canceled big gatherings.Congressional Democrats, Republicans and President Trump tried to agree on a relief package in between attacks on each other.Mr. Trump addressed the nation about the crisis. Then, seeking to contrast themselves with him, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders did the same.In his speech, Mr. Biden used the language and tone of crisis in proposing a detailed coronavirus plan and setting goals for testing, hospital capacity and a vaccine. Mr. Sanders warned that the American death toll could exceed the number of American soldiers killed during World War II. Both sharply criticized Mr. Trump.""This virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,"" Mr. Biden said.Four big states -- Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio -- will hold their primaries on Tuesday, and election officials say they are taking extra precautions. Meanwhile, Louisiana announced on Friday that it would postpone its April 4 primary until June 20.The Tuesdays Remain Super for Surging BidenA week after dominating on Super Tuesday, Mr. Biden ""took command of the Democratic presidential race in decisive fashion,"" winning at least four more contests this past Tuesday on the strength of a multiracial coalition that proved especially powerful in the South and the Midwest.Mr. Biden's victory in Michigan -- the biggest prize of the night -- was particularly damaging to Mr. Sanders, who won the state in the 2016 primary. Mr. Biden is also ahead in Washington State with nearly all of the vote counted.So far, Mr. Sanders has won only one of the six states that voted Tuesday: North Dakota, which awarded just 14 delegates.Before Tuesday, several highprofile figures offered their endorsements. Mr. Sanders got the backing of the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Mr. Biden received endorsements from Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, both of whom dropped out of the presidential race before the first nominating votes.Sanders Stays In (For Now, at Least)Mr. Sanders did not give a speech Tuesday night as race after race was called for Mr. Biden. Instead, he elected to wait, assess and ultimately speak to reporters the next day.He declared that he would stay in the primary race and participate in Sunday's debate with Mr. Biden. But he also made what our colleagues called ""a defiant case for his liberal policy agenda,"" asserting that ""a strong majority"" of Democrats supported his progressive ideas.He did not, however, attack Mr. Biden or vow to carry his fight to a bitter end.And in case you were wondering, Senator Elizabeth Warren is unlikely to endorse Mr. Sanders, according to several people close to her.New Management For Biden CampaignAs our colleagues Katie Glueck and Thomas Kaplan have noted, Mr. Biden's campaign organization has for months been flimsy, underfunded and filled with operational challenges. Thankfully for him, it did not end up hurting him on Super Tuesday or this past week.Nonetheless, on Thursday Mr. Biden announced that he had hired a new campaign manager: Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, a veteran Democratic strategist who managed former Representative Beto O'Rourke's presidential campaign and before that was a top aide on President Barack Obama's re-election team.The move is a way for Mr. Biden to signal to Democratic donors and elected officials ""that he knows he has to broaden"" his operation as he prepares for a general election fight against Mr. Trump.Sunday's Debate Moved to WashingtonAs we mentioned above, there will be yet another Democratic debate on Sunday, but because of the coronavirus, it has been moved from Phoenix to Washington, D.C. And as another precaution, the event will take place without a live audience or assembled press corps.Perhaps most notable of all, this debate will feature only two candidates: Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders.Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is still running, too, but she has not qualified for a debate in months.PhotographA Michigan rally for Senator Bernie Sanders, who had hoped the state would sap former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s surge. (PHOTOGRAPH BY CHANG W. LEE/THE NEW YORK TIMES)Word count: 1117Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitThe voting on the biggest day of the Democratic presidential campaign increasingly suggested a two-person race between candidates representing competing wings of the party.The Democratic presidential race emerged from Super Tuesday with two clear front-runners as Joseph R. Biden Jr. won Texas, Virginia, North Carolina and at least six other states, largely through support from African-Americans and moderates, while Senator Bernie Sanders harnessed the backing of liberals and young voters to claim the biggest prize of the campaign, California, and several other primaries.The returns across the country on the biggest night of voting suggested that the Democratic contest was increasingly focused on two candidates who are standard-bearers for competing wings of the party, Mr. Biden in the political center and Mr. Sanders on the left. Their two other major rivals, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Michael R. Bloomberg, were on track to finish well behind them and faced an uncertain path forward.Mr. Biden's victories came chiefly in the South and the Midwest, and in some of them he won by unexpectedly wide margins. In a surprising upset, Mr. Biden even captured Ms. Warren's home state of Massachusetts, where he did not appear in person, and where Mr. Sanders had campaigned aggressively in recent days.It was a remarkable show of force for Mr. Biden, the former vice president. In just three days he resurrected a campaign that had been on the verge of collapse after he lost the first three nominating states. But he bounced back with a landslide win in South Carolina on Saturday, and on Tuesday, in addition to victories in Texas,Virginia, North Carolina and Massachusetts, he prevailed in Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma and Minnesota.Mr. Sanders rebounded late in the evening in delegate-rich Western states: He was quickly declared the winner in Colorado and Utah after polls closed there, and he also claimed the largest delegate lode of the primary race, California, The Associated Press reported. Mr. Sanders also easily carried his home state of Vermont.Yet Mr. Biden's sweep of states across the South and the Midwest showed he had the makings of a formidable coalition that could propel him through the primaries. As he did in South Carolina, Mr. Biden rolled to victory in several states with the support of large majorities of African-Americans. And he also performed well with a demographic that was crucial to the party's success in the 2018 midterm elections: college-educated white voters.""We were told, well, when you got to Super Tuesday, it'd be over,"" a triumphant Mr. Biden, 77, said at a celebration in Los Angeles. ""Well, it may be over for the other guy!""After a trying stretch in February, even Mr. Biden appeared surprised at the extent of his success. ""I'm here to report we are very much alive!"" he said. ""And make no mistake about it, this campaign will send Donald Trump packing.""For his part, Mr. Sanders continued to show strength with the voters who have made up his political base: Latinos, liberals and those under age 40. But he struggled to expand his appeal with older voters and African-Americans.The results also called into question Mr. Sanders's decision to spend valuable time over the past week campaigning in both Minnesota and Massachusetts, two states where he had hoped to embarrass rivals on their home turf. The gambit proved badly flawed: It was Mr. Biden who pulled off upset wins in both states, with the help of a last-minute endorsement from Senator Amy Klobuchar that upended the race in Minnesota.The unexpected breadth of Mr. Biden's success, on a day when more than one-third of the delegates were at stake, illustrated the volatility of this race as well as the determination of many center-left Democrats to find a nominee and get on to challenging President Trump. The former vice president had little advertising and a skeletal organization and scarcely even visited many of the states he won, including liberal-leaning Minnesota and Massachusetts.But his smashing victory in South Carolina echoed almost instantaneously, and his momentum from there proved far more powerful than the money Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bloomberg had poured into most of Tuesday's contests.The early returns were a comprehensive setback for Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, who entered the race late and spent more than half a billion dollars on an aggressive advertising campaign. But Mr. Bloomberg slumped badly after a series of damaging clashes with Ms. Warren, and many moderates and African-Americans appeared to have abandoned him for Mr. Biden. Hours into vote-counting, Mr. Bloomberg had won only one contest, in American Samoa.Addressing supporters in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Tuesday night, Mr. Bloomberg tried to put the best face on a dismal evening. ""Here's what is clear,"" he said. ""No matter how many delegates we win tonight, we have done something no one else thought was possible: In just three months, we've gone from 1 percent in the polls to being a contender for the Democratic nomination for president."" Still, Mr. Bloomberg planned to review Tuesday's results and decide his path forward in the race, people familiar with the campaign's plans said.Ms. Warren's loss in Massachusetts left her without a single victory after a month of primaries and caucuses, and in many places on Tuesday she was running in a relatively distant third or fourth place. Most dispiriting to Ms. Warren may be that she lost her home state not to Mr. Sanders, who worked hard to defeat her in her home state, but rather Mr. Biden, suggesting that none of the recent tumult in the race had worked to her advantage.But Ms. Warren's campaign in recent days explicitly laid out a strategy of accumulating delegates for a contested convention, and it was not clear that her latest setbacks would deter that approach. Ms. Warren campaigned on Tuesday in Michigan, which holds a primary next week, and urged voters to ""cast the vote that will make you proud"" rather than making more calculated assessments. And she has announced campaign stops in Arizona and Idaho, two other states that vote this month.At Mr. Sanders's campaign party in Vermont on Tuesday night, he answered Mr. Biden's surge in the race with a battle cry for his supporters: He proclaimed ""absolute confidence"" that he would win the Democratic nomination, and delivered a scathing critique of Mr. Biden's record that left little doubt he would confront Mr. Biden's revived candidacy in blunt terms in the coming days.Without naming the former vice president, Mr. Sanders said there was another candidate in the race who had supported the invasion of Iraq, endorsed cutting Social Security, voted for international trade deals and ""represented the credit card companies"" by backing a 2005 overhaul of the bankruptcy code. As for himself, Mr. Sanders said, he had stood on the opposite side of every issue.""You cannot beat Trump with the same-old, same-old kind of politics,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""What we need is a new politics that brings working-class people into our political movement.""Mr. Sanders was on track to rack up delegates in California, but he was sharing some of them with Mr. Biden in his own state of Vermont. And in Colorado, another state Mr. Sanders carried, he was dividing them four ways, as he, Mr. Biden, Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Warren all reached the 15 percent threshold to win delegates there.The voting followed an extraordinary reframing of the race in the past 48 hours, as moderate candidates came together to form a united front against Mr. Sanders, a democratic socialist whose general election prospects are viewed skeptically by much of the party leadership. Mr. Biden's overwhelming victory in South Carolina on Saturday established him as the clear front-runner in the Democrats' centrist wing, prompting two rivals, Ms. Klobuchar and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., to end their bids and throw their support to Mr. Biden.As Mr. Sanders, 78, returned to Vermont, where he voted Tuesday morning, his allies acknowledged that they had been caught off guard by the swiftness with which Mr. Biden's former adversaries had locked arms to oppose Mr. Sanders's campaign. They argued that Mr. Sanders was still far better equipped -- financially and in his campaign organization -- than Mr. Biden to compete for the nomination over a long primary race. And they vowed to highlight to voters the sharp differences in their agendas.With their long tradition of elevating moderate Democrats, Virginia and North Carolina were fertile terrain for Mr. Biden. He got a lift from his triumph in nearby South Carolina, a state many Super Tuesday voters were watching to see whether Mr. Biden could recover from his early struggles, and then won a series of endorsements from party leaders, including many in Virginia.His advantage only grew after Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg, who were competing for some of the same voters, withdrew from the race and gave their support to Mr. Biden.Mr. Bloomberg had poured millions of dollars from his personal fortune into TV ads in the two states and made repeated appearances in both, with his advisers holding out the most hope in North Carolina. And while he has been more focused on liberal states, Mr. Sanders made multiple stops in Virginia and North Carolina in the weeks after the New Hampshire primary last month.The Democratic campaign barreled into Super Tuesday in a state of extraordinary flux, as a loose alliance of party leaders, elected officials and centrist voting blocs seemed to fall in behind Mr. Biden since his weekend triumph in South Carolina. On Monday night, Mr. Biden made appearances in Texas with three former rivals -- Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Buttigieg and former Representative Beto O'Rourke -- who are now supporting his candidacy, while Mr. Sanders rallied supporters in Minnesota in an effort to capture Ms. Klobuchar's home state.Few presidential candidates have endured the political roller coaster Mr. Biden has found himself riding in recent weeks. After finishing a distant fourth in Iowa and then coming in fifth in New Hampshire, he was short on money, in danger of losing support to Mr. Bloomberg and facing a do-or-die primary in South Carolina.Yet after shaking up his campaign and installing a longtime adviser, Anita Dunn, as his chief strategist, Mr. Biden was able to claw back into contention by finishing second in Nevada. Then, after two solid debate performances during which his ascendant rivals were the ones under attack, he picked up a crucial endorsement: Representative James E. Clyburn, the highest-ranking African-American in Congress and the most influential South Carolina Democrat, came out for Mr. Biden at an emotional news conference.With Mr. Clyburn's imprimatur, Mr. Biden built a considerable advantage with black voters that propelled him to a 28-point rout in South Carolina.His big victory immediately prompted what Mr. Biden had been seeking for months: a flood of support from Democratic leaders, donors and his onetime rivals. By Monday night, just 48 hours after what was his first victory over three separate presidential runs, Mr. Biden was at the rally in Dallas, gaining the endorsements of his three former opponents.Mr. Sanders entered the day with a modest delegate advantage and was poised to extend his lead because, having consolidated much of the party's left, he was better organized and better funded than any of the more moderate candidates.Having finished at the top of Iowa and New Hampshire with less than 30 percent of the vote, Mr. Sanders extended his lead with a commanding victory in Nevada, where he demonstrated that he could expand his heavily white base to include Hispanic voters.The propulsive energy behind both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders posed a challenge to two other formidable candidates, Ms. Warren and Mr. Bloomberg, who have charted drastically different paths to the final stages of the Democratic race. For Mr. Bloomberg, the Super Tuesday contests were the first time he appeared on a ballot, because he bypassed the February contests entirely.Mr. Bloomberg, the wealthy former mayor of New York City, has been a pervasive presence in the race: He has run more than half a billion dollars in paid advertising since he announced his campaign in November, offering himself to the Democratic establishment as a potential savior if Mr. Biden failed to halt Mr. Sanders in the earliest primaries and caucuses.Yet Mr. Bloomberg's prospects were uncertain heading into Super Tuesday, after his disastrous performance in a debate last month in Las Vegas and Mr. Biden's resurgence in the polls.Mr. Bloomberg's campaign publicly signaled he planned to forge ahead even if he faced a disappointing night, announcing plans to stump later this week in Pennsylvania and Michigan, and holding his election-night event in Florida, which holds a primary in two weeks. But advisers to Mr. Bloomberg have also acknowledged that the former mayor would make a cold assessment of his options once the results of Super Tuesday became known. He is likely to face intense pressure to make way for Mr. Biden if his self-funded candidacy does not yield impressive results.Katie Glueck contributed reporting from Oakland, Calif., and Patricia Mazzei from Miami.PhotographJoseph R.

| Jump to first hitBernie Sanders had an advantage on Super Tuesday he will not see again: many early votes cast before moderates coalesced around one candidate.
Joe Biden not only reclaimed his status as a front-runner on Super Tuesday, but his victories also gave him a clear path to amassing enough delegates to clinch the nomination by the Democratic National Convention.
Bernie Sanders, the left wing’s champion, has dodged a knockout blow for now. While he has lost his lead in pledged delegates, he remains competitive in the delegate count, and he has probably stopped Mr. Biden well short of an overall majority of delegates awarded on Super Tuesday.
But an Upshot analysis suggests that the close delegate race might not last for long. If the race doesn’t take a decisive turn in favor of Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden is likely to build an insurmountable delegate lead over the next few weeks.
Mr. Biden largely swept the Eastern half of the country, where most of the delegates awarded after Super Tuesday are at stake. And in many states, Mr. Sanders was able to forestall greater defeats only because of the large number of early voters who cast their ballots before the South Carolina race, when the party’s moderate voters were still divided. He will no longer have that advantage.
Mr. Biden got an additional lift on Wednesday as his leading moderate rival, Mike Bloomberg, dropped out of the race. His departure could free additional moderate voters to join Mr. Biden, and it seems Mr. Bloomberg will be willing to use his considerable wealth to support him. Even in the unlikely event that his voters don’t break toward Mr. Biden, Mr. Bloomberg’s absence would allow Mr. Biden to claim even larger delegate majorities in the remaining Southern states. In Florida, for example, Mr. Bloomberg might have otherwise cleared the 15 percent threshold for earning delegates, at Mr. Biden’s expense.
Mr. Biden swept the South with expected, overwhelming support among African-American voters, who backed him by a margin of 56 percent to 19 percent across the Super Tuesday states, according to exit polls. His success among white voters was less expected and allowed him to extend his strength well beyond the South.
He ran even or ahead among white voters in every state east of the Mississippi River, except for Mr. Sanders’s home state of Vermont, according to the exit polls, and won decisive victories in the affluent suburbs around Boston, Washington and Minneapolis. He even carried much of the old, moderate rural vote that Mr. Sanders swept four years earlier.
Mr. Biden rapidly consolidated moderate-leaning voters in the days after his landslide victory in the South Carolina primary. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar left the race and endorsed him, with the result that he appeared to add nearly all their former supporters. His strength across the rural North and in affluent suburbs mirrored their strengths in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.
Mr. Biden also seemed to benefit from the high turnout in many states, particularly in many of the affluent, well-educated metropolitan areas where Democrats have gained in recent years but where Mr. Sanders has long struggled. Mr. Sanders, in contrast, did not benefit from a long-promised surge in youth turnout, and his core base of support was overwhelmed across most of the South and even the North, where relatively liberal white voters make up a larger share of the electorate.
Texas offered a different test. The state’s Democratic electorate is a mix of African-Americans and more conservative and affluent white voters who tend to back Mr. Biden, and younger, urban and Latino voters who tend to back Mr. Sanders. According to the exit polls, Mr. Sanders won Latinos by a margin of 50 percent to 24 percent across the Super Tuesday states, with a margin of 41 percent to 24 percent in Texas.
In an election night count that reflected the shift in the national political environment over the last week, Mr. Biden eventually overtook Mr. Sanders in the Texas returns, with a wide advantage among late-deciding voters who cast their ballots on Election Day. In a telling indication of how quickly moderate voters had coalesced behind Mr. Biden, the exit polls across the Super Tuesday states found that among voters who decided in just the last few days, Mr. Biden won by a margin of 48 percent to 21 percent.
In North Carolina, which separates out early and Election Day results, Mr. Biden won just 28 percent among early voters but 41 percent of the vote statewide after winning 52 percent among Election Day voters. Mr. Bloomberg saw his support collapse in the Election Day vote.
Mr. Sanders denied Mr. Biden a more sweeping victory with decisive wins of his own in the West, where Mr. Sanders can count on his strengths among Latinos, liberals and younger, urban voters without fully facing his weakness among African-American voters and conservative rural whites. The West also has the highest rate of early voting in the country, which helped blunt Mr. Biden’s surge.
Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar combined for 22 percent support in the exit poll in Colorado, where advance voters represented well over half of all voters — the largest share of the vote of any state on Tuesday. Their support was not recorded in the election night tabulation because they withdrew from the race, but they routinely breached 10 percent in early voting elsewhere in the country, including California.
The large early and absentee vote in some of the states most favorable to Mr. Sanders was enough to keep him close and competitive in the overall delegate count, despite 10 losses in 14 states. Over all, Mr. Biden holds only 45 percent of pledged delegates after Super Tuesday, according to preliminary Upshot estimates, while Mr. Sanders is expected to finish with around 39 percent. These tallies could change depending on the eventual result in California (which might not become official for weeks), but if they hold, Mr. Biden’s delegate lead would be far from irreversible. In fact, Mr. Sanders would need to defeat Mr. Biden by only three points in the remaining two-thirds of the country to overtake him.
A three-point deficit is not a daunting handicap, certainly not when Mr. Biden was polling 20 points lower just a few days ago. But the Super Tuesday results do not augur well for Mr. Sanders’s odds of pulling it off. He remained so competitive on Super Tuesday in part because of the large number of early and absentee voters who cast ballots before it became apparent that Mr. Biden was the viable moderate candidate.
The rest of the country may be even less favorable to Mr. Sanders. With Texas and California off the board, most of the remaining populous states lie in the East, where Mr. Sanders tended to lose, often badly. They also tend to have a below-average Latino share of the vote. It is hard to identify any state where Mr. Sanders would be obviously favored outside of the Northwest, if voters broke approximately as they did on Super Tuesday.
The states where Latino voters do represent roughly their average share of the electorate do not seem likely to be as favorable to Mr. Sanders as California or Texas. Arizona, New Mexico, New York and Florida allow only registered Democrats to vote, and therefore exclude a disproportionate number of young Hispanic voters — many of them registered as independents — who are likeliest to back Mr. Sanders. These closed primaries will exclude many young non-Latino voters as well, posing a broader challenge to Mr. Sanders that he did not overcome in 2016 and has not yet had to face in 2020.
Mr. Biden, in contrast, will continue to find many states in the next few weeks where black voters represent an average or above-average share of the population. He is all but assured to win commanding delegate majorities in Mississippi, Georgia and Florida. And there are many other states, including Missouri, Ohio and Michigan, where Mr. Biden would be the favorite if he could continue the pattern of his success with white voters in the East.
He needs around 54 percent of the remaining delegates to claim a majority heading into the Democratic nomination, and his path to accomplishing this might be as simple as repeating a Super Tuesday outcome under a more favorable set of states, without the burden of early votes cast before he emerged as the top rival to Mr. Sanders.
Mr. Sanders now needs around 57 percent of the remaining delegates to claim a majority. To pull it off, he would need to post decisive victories in states he would have almost certainly lost if they had voted on Super Tuesday. He would probably need the race to fundamentally change in the coming weeks, as it has before.

| Jump to first hitBernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar hit the 2020 campaign trail on Saturday during a break in the impeachment trial.MARSHALLTOWN, Iowa -- Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar dashed back to Iowa for a frenzied burst of campaigning on Saturday after a week in which they were confined to Washington for the impeachment trial of President Trump.Their appearances took place amid signs of growing strength in Mr. Sanders's candidacy, particularly a New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers released Saturday that showed him leading the field in Iowa. Given the fears of some Democrats that he could be portrayed as too far to the left to defeat Mr. Trump, his show of strength is likely to alarm some of his detractors as much as it pleases his own supporters coming so close to the Feb. 3 caucuses.Pete Buttigieg's campaign sent a fund-raising email on Saturday warning that ""Bernie Sanders could be the nominee of our party,"" followed by another email that cast doubt on Mr. Sanders's ability to beat Mr. Trump. And former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in a tweet took an implicit jab at Mr. Sanders over his campaign's promotion of an endorsement from Joe Rogan, the popular podcast host who has been criticized for comments he has made on race and about transgender people.Mr. Sanders, sounding a bit congested, made it to Iowa in time to attend a rally in Marshalltown with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and the filmmaker Michael Moore.He made no mention of his poll showing, but he didn't have to.""We're taking on the establishment, and the establishment is getting a little bit nervous,"" he told a modest but enthusiastic crowd.But he did take a swipe at the impeachment trial for scrambling his campaign plans.""As you well know, we have had to radically change our schedule in the last week -- kind of toss it into the garbage can and begin anew,"" he said. ""But we are going to be back here in Iowa in the next week every moment that we possibly can.""Mr. Sanders plans to hold events across the northwestern part of Iowa on Sunday before the trial resumes on Monday.Before he settled into his familiar talking points, Mr. Sanders also issued something of a warning, suggesting he was aware of the renewed attacks from rivals as he continued to display strength in Iowa and other early voting states.""In the last week of a campaign, a lot of stuff is going to be thrown around -- that's what happens in campaigns,"" he said. ""But I would hope that this state, New Hampshire and the country does not lose focus on what are the most important issues.""The day also brought good news for Ms. Warren, who returned to Iowa for the first time since the impeachment trial with a town-hall-style event at a middle school in Muscatine. ""Good not to be in Washington,"" she told reporters.She was working her way through her selfie picture line when the news broke that she had received the coveted endorsement of The Des Moines Register. In other endorsements Saturday, The New Hampshire Union Leader backed Ms. Klobuchar, and The Sioux City Journal in Iowa gave its support to Mr. Biden.Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who has struggled to gain traction in the primary race and has also been tethered to Washington because of the impeachment trial, traveled to New Hampshire on Saturday and planned to campaign there through the weekend.Two other leading contenders, Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, were not stuck in Washington this past week. Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., arrived in Iowa for the beginning of a 10-day sprint across the state before the caucuses. His first stop was a town-hall-style event before about 300 people inside of an old opera house in Fort Dodge.Mr. Buttigieg began his remarks by reminding the audience that, after 13 months of candidate events, they were in ""the final days"" of the race in which he has outlasted a handful of adversaries who began the race better-known and better financed than the mayor of South Bend.After a town-hall-style event in Storm Lake, he was asked about his campaign's reference to Mr. Sanders in one of the fund-raising emails as ""a risk we can't take.""""I believe that we should be very mindful that one of the worst risks we can take at a time like this is to recycle the same Washington-style political warfare that brought us to this point,"" he said. ""If we believe it's important to win, then the best thing we can do is put forward a candidate who offers something new, something different and something that will break us through the dynamics that have gotten us into this era that's just got to change.""Mr. Biden flew to Iowa after beginning his day with an event in Salem, N.H. Speaking in an elementary school gym, Mr. Biden alluded to the impeachment trial that is playing out in Washington and reminded the crowd that he had come under relentless attack from Mr. Trump.""My guess if you go back and turn your TV on today, you're going to find the name 'Biden' mentioned many, many, many times,"" Mr. Biden said. ""I wonder why he doesn't want to run against me.""Mr. Biden also received a boost on Saturday when he picked up the endorsement of Representative Cindy Axne of Iowa, a freshman Democrat who unseated a Republican incumbent.""He is who I believe is the one sure bet to beat Donald Trump,"" Ms. Axne said in an interview.Ms. Axne hails from the kind of swing district that was key to the party's takeover of the House in the 2018 midterm elections, and will be crucial to its continued control of the chamber.Ms. Axne appeared with Mr. Biden on Saturday night at an event in her district in Ankeny, a suburb of Des Moines.""It's not just that Joe's been there, and he's been in the Situation Room,"" she told the crowd in Ankeny. ""We also need somebody who's running on a message of hope, a message of unification of this country.""Mr. Biden has now been endorsed by two of Iowa's three Democrats in Congress. Representative Abby Finkenauer, another freshman who flipped a Republican-held seat in 2018, endorsed him in early January. The state's other House Democrat, Representative Dave Loebsack, has endorsed Mr. Buttigieg.Ms. Axne's district includes Iowa's most populous city, Des Moines, and covers the southwestern corner of the state. President Barack Obama won the district in 2012, but Mr. Trump carried it in 2016. Two years later, in the midterm elections, Ms. Axne unseated a two-term Republican, David Young.Ms. Axne said she believed that Mr. Biden would drive turnout in districts like hers, and emphasized the importance of protecting the Democratic majority in the House.She also nodded to what she suggested was Mr. Biden's broad appeal. ""I truly believe that there are Iowans that would have some difficulty with some of the positions by other people running in this party,"" she said.Sydney Ember reported from Marshalltown, and Thomas Kaplan from Salem, N.H. Shane Goldmacher contributed reporting from Muscatine, Iowa; Reid J. Epstein from Fort Dodge, Iowa; and Maggie Astor from Ankeny, Iowa.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont looks on as he is introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York during a campaign event on Saturday in Marshalltown, Iowa.

| Jump to first hitA multiracial coalition brought the senator's long-promised political revolution to vivid life, for perhaps the first time in the 2020 race.LAS VEGAS -- They showed up to Desert Pines High School in Tío Bernie T-shirts to caucus on Saturday morning, motivated by the idea of free college tuition, ""Medicare for all"" and the man making those promises: a 78-year-old white senator from Vermont. To dozens of mostly working-class Latinos, Bernie Sanders seemed like one of their own, a child of immigrants who understands what it means to be seen as a perpetual outsider.For at least one day, in one state, the long-promised political revolution of Mr. Sanders came to vivid life, a multiracial coalition of immigrants, college students, Latina mothers, younger black voters, white liberals and even some moderates who embraced his idea of radical change and lifted him to victory in the Nevada caucuses on Saturday.By harnessing such a broad cross-section of voters, Mr. Sanders offered a preview of the path that he hopes to take to the Democratic presidential nomination: uniting an array of voting blocs in racially diverse states in the West and the South and in economically strapped parts of the Midwest and the Southwest, all behind the message of social and economic justice that he has preached for years.His advisers argue that he has a singular ability to energize voters who have felt secondary in the Democratic Party, like Latinos and younger people, and that Nevada proved as much -- and could set the stage for strong performances in the Super Tuesday contests on March 3. The Sanders campaign is looking in particular to the delegate-rich states of California and Texas, whose diverse Democratic electorates include a high percentage of voters from immigrant backgrounds.Mr. Sanders's chances also depend in part on the field of moderate candidates remaining crowded and divided, which is not a guarantee, especially if voters seeking an alternative to the right of Mr. Sanders align behind one candidate. To earn enough delegates to be the Democratic nominee, Mr. Sanders will also have to win big in other large states, including California and Texas, where his coalition remains untested. And his brand of democratic socialism could prove to be a hard sell, including among Latinos elsewhere in the country.Mr. Sanders delivered his victory speech Saturday evening not in Nevada, but in Texas, one of the diverse powerhouses on the Super Tuesday calendar.""They think they are going to win this election by dividing our people up based on the color of their skin or where they were born or their religion or their sexual orientation,"" he said in San Antonio, speaking of President Trump and his allies. ""We are going to win because we are doing exactly the opposite, we're bringing our people together.""In the entrance polls on Saturday, Mr. Sanders led the field across many demographic groups: men and women, whites and Latinos, union and nonunion households, and across education levels.The breadth of his appeal amounts to a warning shot at those in the moderate Democratic establishment he often rails against, many of whom have staked their hopes for a ""Stop Sanders"" effort on the idea that he has a political ceiling within the party and could not grow his base of supporters.Instead, as the primary shifted to Nevada from the racially homogeneous electorates of Iowa and New Hampshire, it was Mr. Sanders who grew more formidable, while other candidates have struggled.Strong showings in the first two states have not significantly helped former Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar break through with nonwhite voters. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has called himself the one candidate who can build a diverse coalition, but he finished in second place in Nevada, the most diverse nominating contest so far.Only Mr. Sanders, with his uncompromising message that working-class Americans affected by injustice can unite across ethnic identity, has shown traction in both predominantly white Iowa and New Hampshire and the more black and brown Nevada.""He's been saying the same thing for 40 years -- I trust him,"" said Cristhian Ramirez, a 31-year-old technology support specialist who began volunteering for the Sanders campaign in November. Mr. Ramirez brought several friends with him Saturday and scoffed at the idea that Mr. Sanders would face challenges in the general election. Like many supporters, Mr. Ramirez was first drawn to Mr. Sanders during the senator's 2016 presidential bid. ""Why should we vote for a moderate? We already tried that last time and we lost.""The strong showing in the first-in-the-West caucus state seemed to be a payoff for Mr. Sanders's unique political philosophy and his campaign team's electoral strategy, which bet big on grass-roots outreach to Latinos and immigrant populations. It's a model the campaign is looking to take across the country, working to reach people across racial and ethnic groups who have traditionally been less likely to vote.""We've been saying for a while, candidates and the Democratic Party need to engage Latino communities sooner and substantively,"" said Marisa Franco, the executive director of Mijente, a community organization that has backed Mr. Sanders. ""If you do that, they respond accordingly.""While ideologically liberal voters and young people powered Mr. Sanders toward popular vote victories in Iowa and New Hampshire, Nevada showed the candidate's brand of authenticity could have cross-cultural appeal, even as the campaign sparred over ""Medicare for all"" with the culinary workers' union, the state's largest union and one of the most powerful organizations in Nevada Democratic politics.Activists and leaders who have endorsed Mr. Sanders, particularly people who work with immigrant populations, argue that a focus on ""Bernie Bros"" -- a caricature of his supporters as predominantly white and male -- misses the scope of the campaign's outreach to historically marginalized groups.They praised Mr. Sanders for articulating a global frame of injustice that has led him to uncharted places among the Democratic field: He was the first to support a moratorium on deportations, has consistently spoken of the plight of the Palestinian people during debates, and has talked about his own family's immigrant experience as a way to connect with voters, something he rarely did during his 2016 run.No demographic is a monolith, of course, and Mr. Sanders's support comes with fissures along fault lines of age and educational attainment. But, if Nevada is any measure, he is well positioned to galvanize a cross-section of Latino voters in a way that earlier candidates have done with black voters in the Democratic Party, amassing an advantage that could help create a path to the nomination.""If you have focused intention and ongoing support for Latinos and other voters of color you can win,"" said Sonja Diaz, the executive director of the Latino Policy & Politics Initiative at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""They did not take the Latino vote for granted.""When early voting began last week, the Sanders campaign sent a neon truck blasting local Spanish radio out onto the Las Vegas streets, urging people to show up at dozens of early caucus sites. They attracted hundreds of people to a soccer tournament, then offered rides to caucus sites to anyone who showed up.After months of knocking on doors in largely Latino neighborhoods in Las Vegas, on Saturday morning, the Sanders campaign said it sent text messages and phone calls to every Latino registered as a Democrat or independent in the state.For months, the Sanders campaign has boasted that it was the first to organize and advertise in largely Latino neighborhoods, not just in Las Vegas, but in Des Moines and east Los Angeles. Many people who showed up at the caucuses wearing Sanders buttons and stickers said his campaign was the only one they ever heard from. Latino political activists -- including those backing other candidates -- routinely applaud the Sanders campaign for doing the kind of expensive, labor intensive outreach they have been trying to convince other candidates to do for years.Former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has virtually unlimited resources, is also investing in Latino outreach and competing aggressively in Super Tuesday states, which could cut into support for Mr. Sanders. He has already spent more than $10 million on Spanish-language advertising.Mr. Sanders's appeal seems particularly strong in the West, where his ability to harness not just Latinos, but also liberal black and Asian-American voters could portend a strong showing in California, which will award more delegates than the four early voting states combined.The Sanders team has long said that California, where early voting is already underway, is a cornerstone of its campaign. It has invested roughly $6.5 million in advertising there so far, including more than $1 million for Spanish language advertising. A poll from the Public Policy Institute of California released last week showed Mr. Sanders with 30 percent of the vote, and Mr. Biden in second, trailing by nearly 20 percentage points.The support for Mr. Sanders in Nevada was particularly notable given the intense fight with the Culinary Union, which represents 60,000 housekeepers, bartenders, cooks and others who work in casinos here. Leadership for the union, whose membership is more than 50 percent Latino, declined to back any one candidate, but spent the weeks leading up to the caucus criticizing Mr. Sanders's ""Medicare for all"" plan, because it would effectively eliminate the union's prized private health insurance.But in interviews in recent days, many rank-and-file union members said they supported Mr. Sanders precisely because of his health care proposal, explaining that they wanted their friends and relatives to have the same kind of access to care that they have.On Saturday, Mr. Sanders won at five of the seven caucus sites on the Strip, losing one to Mr. Biden and tying with him at another -- a clear sign that the messages from union leadership had largely been ignored.Ana Maria Archila, co-executive director of Center for Popular Democracy, a national collective of progressive groups, said she heard all day about people voting for the first time. She also said that she expected states like California and Texas could turn out even better.At a recent event in Las Vegas geared toward Latino voters, Ms. Archila said she asked the audience to ""close your eyes and imagine a country where we are not a target,"" citing Mr. Sanders's support for a moratorium on deportations.""People started to cry,"" she said. ""We have never known what it feels like to be in this country and not be under threat.""Jennifer Medina reported from Las Vegas and Astead W. Herndon from Charleston, S.C.

| Jump to first hitLatino voters in California, Texas and around the country are invested in picking someone who can beat President Trump, though they don't all agree on who that is.LOS ANGELES -- Latino voters are poised to pick the Democratic nominee.Long overlooked by the political establishment and dismissed as a sleeping giant of a demographic that didn't vote as reliably as it could, millions of Latinos are expected to go to the polls on Tuesday in key states like Colorado, Virginia, North Carolina and, most significantly, in Texas and California.One analysis estimates that roughly one-third of the 643 delegates up for grabs in those two states will be determined by Latino voters.Latinos are expected to make up the largest nonwhite ethnic voting bloc in 2020. Around the country, Latino Democrats are seeking the candidate who is best poised to take on President Trump, who many believe has placed a target on their own backs with his anti-immigrant rhetoric. These voters, far from a monolith but united on some key issues, will cast their ballots in Texas exactly seven months after the deadliest anti-Latino attack in modern American history took place in El Paso.""It's hard to be Latino right now,"" said Christian Arana, the policy director for the Latino Community Foundation, a philanthropic group based in California. ""There are so many of us who feel we have to constantly be on the watch for something terrible. People are channeling their anger into voting in a way we have not seen historically.""Polls have consistently shown that Latino voters in Texas and California list health care, economic inequality and immigration as their top issues. But the upcoming primaries are likely to show the splits and contradictions among the group. Interviews with dozens of Latino voters in El Paso and Los Angeles in recent days show that though Mr. Sanders has built up a loyal base among Latinos, particularly younger and working-class voters, there are many lifelong Democrats who are still searching for a moderate alternative.""It's a historic moment and a historic disappointment because yet again we are the most underinvested community from the establishment and the big donors and yet still in every election, the Latino voting segment keeps growing,"" said Héctor Sánchez Barba, the executive director of Mi Familia Vota, which does Latino voter outreach throughout the country. In 2018, Latino voters helped flip several Congressional districts to the Democrats.Now, he said, is the time Latino groups are pressing to get more promises from candidates on what they will do on health care, education and immigration.Democratic candidates have made more of an effort in recent weeks to court Latino voters, recognizing the decisive role they could play on Super Tuesday. No other candidate has put more effort into courting Latinos than Senator Bernie Sanders, who has made it clear that he is counting on Latinos as a kind of firewall on Tuesday, nationally and particularly in California. So far, recent surveys seem to reflect that effort: Mr. Sanders has a significant lead among Latino voters in both Texas and California, ahead of his rivals by double digits.""We've lived in fear for our families for the last three years,"" said Janette Espino, a 26-year-old sports merchandising buyer from Long Beach, Calif., who attended a rally for Mr. Sanders in Los Angeles Sunday. Ms. Espino said health care was the most important issue for her, but added that she has several family members who are undocumented immigrants. She said several of other family members had become citizens in the last two years and planned to cast their first ballot Tuesday, choosing Mr. Sanders. ""We've never had a candidate for president who listened to us like this, who we are really excited about.""Seeming to recognize the need for more of an effort targeting the Latino community, Joseph R. Biden Jr. held rallies in Texas leading up to Super Tuesday, and touted the endorsement of Congresswoman Veronica Escobar of El Paso. And on Saturday, four former Latino cabinet secretaries from the Clinton and Obama administrations published a letter in La Opinion, Los Angeles' largest Spanish-language newspaper, urging their ""Latino brothers and sisters"" to vote for Mr. Biden, arguing that they ""know Joe"" and that he is ""running to restore the American dream.""Former New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has poured in a record-breaking amount of money into Spanish-language advertising in California and Texas. Mr. Bloomberg's campaign has focused particularly on finding local endorsements from heavily Latino regions and featuring those leaders in ""Ganamos Con Mike"" advertisements.Like Mr. Sanders's campaign, Mr. Bloomberg has opened field offices in heavily Latino regions that have long been ignored in presidential elections, such as the Central Valley and the Inland Empire in California. The campaign has also sent millions of campaign mailers to Hispanic voters in both states.""What used to happen was you avoided talking about Latinos until Florida,"" said Mayra Macías, the executive director of Latino Victory Fund, which tries to get more Latinos elected and backed Mr. Biden last month. ""Now we are seeing that there is no path to victory without speaking holistically to them.""In some ways, California Latinos began their steady march to political power after Proposition 187, an anti-immigrant ballot initiative approved by voters in 1994. Dozens of current Latino elected officials in the state became engaged in activism during the protests against the measure, which was eventually struck down by the courts. And many in California believe that Texas Latinos are in the midst of a similar political transformation.It has now been nearly seven months since the shooting at an El Paso Walmart. The white 21-year-old gunman, Patrick Crusius, turned a Saturday morning in the binational, majority-Hispanic border city into a scene of horror: He killed 22 people and wounded nearly two dozen others. Most of those killed or injured were either Mexicans or Mexican-Americans.Minutes before the shooting, the gunman had posted an anti-immigrant manifesto online, declaring that the attack was in response to ""the Hispanic invasion of Texas."" He wrote that he feared that the Hispanic population in Texas would make it a Democratic stronghold that would ""win nearly every presidential election.""For 27-year-old Elisa Tamayo, the shooting last year was personal. It was her neighborhood Walmart, a place to shop and meet her family from across the border. One of her mother's friends was killed in the attack -- Maria Eugenia Legarreta Rothe, 58, from the Mexican state of Chihuahua. Ms. Tamayo called her ""tía,"" Spanish for aunt, although they were not related.But for Ms. Tamayo, the attack has since veered to the political.She is running for public office for the first time in her life, pushed in part by the Walmart shooting and the rhetoric from President Trump and state Republican leaders that she believes fueled the anti-Latino hatred of the gunman. Ms. Tamayo is vying to become a Democratic lawmaker in the state House of Representatives and to represent the House district that includes the Walmart. She announced her candidacy eight weeks after the shooting, standing with relatives and supporters in front of a mural reading ""El Paso Strong.""Ms. Tamayo, who is on the Democratic primary ballot in El Paso on Tuesday and who voted for Ms. Warren for president, said that in knocking on doors for her campaign, she has seen firsthand a new level of engagement of Hispanic voters.""We've been knocking on doors for more than three months, and I keep hearing that they want to vote in this election,"" she said. ""They really want to vote in this election because they feel like we've got to get Trump out of office. Instead of saying my vote doesn't matter, I think people are now more willing to show up and more willing to vote because of that.""Around El Paso, many people described similar reasons for voting: Mr. Trump's rhetoric and the shooting last summer. But they came to different conclusions about their preferred candidates.Anna Casas, 33, a single mother and home health aide in El Paso, voted for the first time in her life last week -- her vote went to Mr. Sanders, and she had registered to vote last year about three months after the attack at the Walmart, where she would often shop with her three sons. ""What about if we were there and that happened?"" she said. ""It did open my eyes. It pushed me to vote.""Ms. Casas said it was clear to her that Mr. Trump's words fueled the shooter's hatred of Hispanics.""I'm trying to push other people to vote, because they think that their vote doesn't matter,"" she said. ""But it actually does. I used to think that way, honestly, until Trump became president.""Irma Vasquez, 67, a former school-district worker who voted for Mr. Bloomberg, put the role the president's words played in the attack this way, tugging at the skin on her cheek: ""He put a bull's-eye on our backs, especially this color.""Pedro Gandara, 74, a retired telephone-company repairman and Air Force veteran who voted for Mr. Biden, said Mr. Trump evokes for him the anti-Latino racism he has faced his entire life. He remembered being refused service at a restaurant in the Panhandle city of Amarillo when he was a high school student.""This was '63 or '64, so the racism has been here ever since, but Trump has really brought it out,"" Mr. Gandara said. ""He's very much against us all.""Perhaps no one exemplified the split of Latino Democratic voters in Texas heading into Super Tuesday better than the Balcazar family.Last Wednesday, Miguel Balcazar, 66, a retired middle-school history teacher, walked slowly to an early voting site at a recreation center in the city's Mission Valley neighborhood, a little more than two miles from the scene of the Walmart shooting. He used a cane because of his knee problems as his wife, Lucinda, 65, a retired special-education teacher's assistant, walked alongside him, just as slowly. They've been married for 41 years.They were making their way cautiously to vote, but they were eager for political revolution. When they got back to their car wearing ""I voted"" stickers, both said they had supported Mr. Sanders.""I feel strongly that he's more radical than anything else,"" Mr. Balcazar said of Mr. Sanders.Their three sons were not with them, but their parents know exactly how they will vote. One of their sons plans on voting for Mr. Sanders, one is undecided and the other will vote for Mr. Trump, a sign of the Hispanic Republican support for the president that exists in a conservative state like Texas.""I can't change his mind,"" Mr. Balcazar said, shaking his head and adding with a chuckle, ""He says, 'Dad, I'm going to put the sign up on top of your roof, because you can't get up there anymore.""'Jennifer Medina reported from Los Angeles, and Manny Fernandez from El Paso.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders, campaigning in San Jose, Calif., left, has built up a loyal base of younger and working-class Latino voters.

| Jump to first hitBernie Sanders had an advantage on Super Tuesday he will not see again: many early votes cast before moderates coalesced around one candidate.Joe Biden not only reclaimed his status as a front-runner on Super Tuesday, but his victories also gave him a clear path to amassing enough delegates to clinch the nomination by the Democratic National Convention.Bernie Sanders, the left wing's champion, has dodged a knockout blow for now. While he has lost his lead in pledged delegates, he remains competitive in the delegate count, and he has probably stopped Mr. Biden well short of an overall majority of delegates awarded on Super Tuesday.But an Upshot analysis suggests that the close delegate race might not last for long. If the race doesn't take a decisive turn in favor of Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden is likely to build an insurmountable delegate lead over the next few weeks.Mr. Biden largely swept the Eastern half of the country, where most of the delegates awarded after Super Tuesday are at stake. And in many states, Mr. Sanders was able to forestall greater defeats only because of the large number of early voters who cast their ballots before the South Carolina race, when the party's moderate voters were still divided. He will no longer have that advantage.Mr. Biden got an additional lift on Wednesday as his leading moderate rival, Mike Bloomberg, dropped out of the race. His departure could free additional moderate voters to join Mr. Biden, and it seems Mr. Bloomberg will be willing to use his considerable wealth to support him. Even in the unlikely event that his voters don't break toward Mr. Biden, Mr. Bloomberg's absence would allow Mr. Biden to claim even larger delegate majorities in the remaining Southern states. In Florida, for example, Mr. Bloomberg might have otherwise cleared the 15 percent threshold for earning delegates, at Mr. Biden's expense.Mr. Biden swept the South with expected, overwhelming support among African-American voters, who backed him by a margin of 56 percent to 19 percent across the Super Tuesday states, according to exit polls. His success among white voters was less expected and allowed him to extend his strength well beyond the South.He ran even or ahead among white voters in every state east of the Mississippi River, except for Mr. Sanders's home state of Vermont, according to the exit polls, and won decisive victories in the affluent suburbs around Boston, Washington and Minneapolis. He even carried much of the old, moderate rural vote that Mr. Sanders swept four years earlier.Mr. Biden rapidly consolidated moderate-leaning voters in the days after his landslide victory in the South Carolina primary. Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar left the race and endorsed him, with the result that he appeared to add nearly all their former supporters. His strength across the rural North and in affluent suburbs mirrored their strengths in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary.Mr. Biden also seemed to benefit from the high turnout in many states, particularly in many of the affluent, well-educated metropolitan areas where Democrats have gained in recent years but where Mr. Sanders has long struggled. Mr. Sanders, in contrast, did not benefit from a long-promised surge in youth turnout, and his core base of support was overwhelmed across most of the South and even the North, where relatively liberal white voters make up a larger share of the electorate.Texas offered a different test. The state's Democratic electorate is a mix of African-Americans and more conservative and affluent white voters who tend to back Mr. Biden, and younger, urban and Latino voters who tend to back Mr. Sanders. According to the exit polls, Mr. Sanders won Latinos by a margin of 50 percent to 24 percent across the Super Tuesday states, with a margin of 41 percent to 24 percent in Texas.In an election night count that reflected the shift in the national political environment over the last week, Mr. Biden eventually overtook Mr. Sanders in the Texas returns, with a wide advantage among late-deciding voters who cast their ballots on Election Day. In a telling indication of how quickly moderate voters had coalesced behind Mr. Biden, the exit polls across the Super Tuesday states found that among voters who decided in just the last few days, Mr. Biden won by a margin of 48 percent to 21 percent.In North Carolina, which separates out early and Election Day results, Mr. Biden won just 28 percent among early voters but 41 percent of the vote statewide after winning 52 percent among Election Day voters. Mr. Bloomberg saw his support collapse in the Election Day vote.Mr. Sanders denied Mr. Biden a more sweeping victory with decisive wins of his own in the West, where Mr. Sanders can count on his strengths among Latinos, liberals and younger, urban voters without fully facing his weakness among African-American voters and conservative rural whites. The West also has the highest rate of early voting in the country, which helped blunt Mr. Biden's surge.Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar combined for 22 percent support in the exit poll in Colorado, where advance voters represented well over half of all voters -- the largest share of the vote of any state on Tuesday. Their support was not recorded in the election night tabulation because they withdrew from the race, but they routinely breached 10 percent in early voting elsewhere in the country, including California.The large early and absentee vote in some of the states most favorable to Mr. Sanders was enough to keep him close and competitive in the overall delegate count, despite 10 losses in 14 states. Over all, Mr. Biden holds only 45 percent of pledged delegates after Super Tuesday, according to preliminary Upshot estimates, while Mr. Sanders is expected to finish with around 39 percent. These tallies could change depending on the eventual result in California (which might not become official for weeks), but if they hold, Mr. Biden's delegate lead would be far from irreversible. In fact, Mr. Sanders would need to defeat Mr. Biden by only three points in the remaining two-thirds of the country to overtake him.A three-point deficit is not a daunting handicap, certainly not when Mr. Biden was polling 20 points lower just a few days ago. But the Super Tuesday results do not augur well for Mr. Sanders's odds of pulling it off. He remained so competitive on Super Tuesday in part because of the large number of early and absentee voters who cast ballots before it became apparent that Mr. Biden was the viable moderate candidate.The rest of the country may be even less favorable to Mr. Sanders. With Texas and California off the board, most of the remaining populous states lie in the East, where Mr. Sanders tended to lose, often badly. They also tend to have a below-average Latino share of the vote. It is hard to identify any state where Mr. Sanders would be obviously favored outside of the Northwest, if voters broke approximately as they did on Super Tuesday.The states where Latino voters do represent roughly their average share of the electorate do not seem likely to be as favorable to Mr. Sanders as California or Texas. Arizona, New Mexico, New York and Florida allow only registered Democrats to vote, and therefore exclude a disproportionate number of young Hispanic voters -- many of them registered as independents -- who are likeliest to back Mr. Sanders. These closed primaries will exclude many young non-Latino voters as well, posing a broader challenge to Mr. Sanders that he did not overcome in 2016 and has not yet had to face in 2020.Mr. Biden, in contrast, will continue to find many states in the next few weeks where black voters represent an average or above-average share of the population. He is all but assured to win commanding delegate majorities in Mississippi, Georgia and Florida. And there are many other states, including Missouri, Ohio and Michigan, where Mr. Biden would be the favorite if he could continue the pattern of his success with white voters in the East.He needs around 54 percent of the remaining delegates to claim a majority heading into the Democratic nomination, and his path to accomplishing this might be as simple as repeating a Super Tuesday outcome under a more favorable set of states, without the burden of early votes cast before he emerged as the top rival to Mr. Sanders.Mr. Sanders now needs around 57 percent of the remaining delegates to claim a majority. To pull it off, he would need to post decisive victories in states he would have almost certainly lost if they had voted on Super Tuesday. He would probably need the race to fundamentally change in the coming weeks, as it has before.PhotographBernie Sanders had an advantage Tuesday that he will not see again: many early votes were cast before moderates coalesced.

| Jump to first hitOne week ago, Bernie Sanders had a double-digit lead in national polls. His closest opponents -- Joseph R. Biden Jr., Elizabeth Warren and Michael R. Bloomberg -- were bunched up in a group well behind him. The rest of the candidates, including Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, were even further back.Since then, the race has been transformed. Mr. Biden's broad victories in South Carolina and on Super Tuesday have propelled him ahead of Mr. Sanders in the delegate count: On Friday morning, he led by a small but meaningful margin of 76 delegates out of the 1,337 that have been allotted so far. Mr. Buttigieg, Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Bloomberg all dropped out of the race to endorse Mr. Biden, while Ms. Warren ended her campaign without issuing an immediate endorsement.With only Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders remaining as serious contenders, Mr. Sanders will face incredible pressure in the next round of primaries to show he can compete with the coalition Mr. Biden so suddenly assembled.Our national polling average has not caught up with any of these developments. None of the pollsters that qualify for our chart have released surveys taken since Super Tuesday, and a few polls that we do not include have suggested a drastic shift in Mr. Biden's favor.It remains to be seen how high Mr. Biden might rise, and whether Mr. Sanders will be able to expand his political base: So far, no Democratic candidate has assembled support from more than about a third of primary voters at any point in this campaign. Now that it is almost a binary contest, Mr. Biden or Mr. Sanders could be in a position to construct an electoral majority of primary voters pretty quickly.If either man manages to do that, it could bring about a swifter resolution to the Democratic primary than most party leaders have been anticipating. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders could well split the vote more or less evenly, leading to a drawn-out campaign fought over a few undecided voters. At the moment, however, all the biggest trends are in Mr. Biden's favor, opening the possibility -- for the first time in a while -- that the former vice president could establish a dominant advantage over Mr. Sanders in a matter of weeks. ALEXANDER BURNSBiden Came Back In South Carolina . . . We know the South Carolina primary might seem like ancient history, but it was actually only last Saturday. So it's worth remembering where the race stood going into it. Eight days ago, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was the clear front-runner for the nomination, having basically tied in Iowa, won in New Hampshire and blown the rest of the field away in Nevada. South Carolina was always going to be more challenging for him, but he was polling competitively with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. there, and if needed, he had Super Tuesday right around the corner to lift him back up. Instead, Mr. Biden won South Carolina by nearly 30 percentage points, and his moderate competitors started dropping like flies. Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota both ended their campaigns and endorsed Mr. Biden -- a development that caught Mr. Sanders's team off guard. . . . Then Dominated On Super Tuesday A week ago, Mr. Biden was lagging in polls of Super Tuesday states. But South Carolina reshaped the race exactly as Mr. Biden had hoped. Aided by several competitors' withdrawals and endorsements, Mr. Biden dominated states he was expected to win narrowly, won states he was expected to lose and topped it off with victories in places he hadn't even visited. All told, he won 10 of the 14 states that voted on Super Tuesday, while Mr. Sanders took Colorado, Utah, Vermont and probably California. (Mr. Sanders leads there, but the race has not been called.) California is a big deal -- it awards far more delegates than any other state -- but that doesn't change the reality coming out of Super Tuesday: While the race certainly isn't over, Mr. Biden is now the frontrunner. The results were devastating for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who finished third in her home state and whose delegate haul was in the dozens, while Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders won hundreds. They were also a stinging rebuke to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, who had gambled hundreds of millions of dollars on the idea -- incorrect, as it turned out -- that he could seize moderate voters from Mr. Biden. The Field Shrank, And Alliances Shifted Five candidates ended their campaigns in the past week, in this order: Tom Steyer (on Saturday) Pete Buttigieg (Sunday) Amy Klobuchar (Monday) Michael R. Bloomberg (Wednesday) Elizabeth Warren (Thursday) The dropouts reflected, over the course of just a few days, a decisive consolidation around one standard-bearer in the centrist wing of the Democratic Party, Mr. Biden, and one on the left, Mr. Sanders. (Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii is still in the race, but she is averaging less than 1 percent in polls and has won only two delegates, both from American Samoa.) What Happens Next Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington will all vote on Tuesday. Michigan is particularly important because it is the first of the former ""blue wall"" states -- the ones that decided the 2016 election -- to hold its primary. (The other two, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, won't vote until April.) The Democratic nominee will almost certainly need to win back those states to beat President Trump, and Mr. Sanders is focusing heavily on them: On Thursday, he canceled a rally in Mississippi to go to Michigan.PhotographA rally for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Dallas. A suburban surge and support from black voters gave him a surprise edge in Texas over Senator Bernie Sanders, whom many pundits had considered to be the favorite to win there on Super Tuesday.

| Jump to first hitWhen it comes to the Democratic presidential primary candidates, President Trump is worried about Mike Bloomberg while his campaign sees an opportunity in Bernie Sanders.President Trump's advisers see Senator Bernie Sanders as their ideal Democratic opponent in November and have been doing what they can to elevate his profile and bolster his chances of winning the Iowa caucuses, according to Republicans familiar with the plans.But their new focus on Mr. Sanders, independent of Vermont, comes at a time the president himself has been closely watching Michael R. Bloomberg, a late arrival to the Democratic primary race, unnerved by his campaign spending and his suggestion he might spend $1 billion of his own fortune on opposing Mr. Trump, even if he does not emerge as the nominee.It has left the president and his campaign focused on two different candidates in the weeks before Democrats cast their first votes in Iowa -- one, a populist running with a grass-roots movement behind him, and the other, a liberal billionaire who could refashion the general election because of his bottomless bank account.Neither is the national front-runner, but Mr. Sanders is believed to have gained significant ground in Iowa, and both are on the minds of the president and his team.Most of Mr. Trump's advisers see his biggest looming threat as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has maintained a steady level of support despite an onslaught of attacks from the president and his team. But there is often a divide between how Mr. Trump and his aides view opponents.Over the past few weeks, aides to the president in a series of conversations have discussed how to keep the focus on Mr. Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist who favors a significant expansion of government health programs and who is currently at the top of some Iowa polls. They see attacking him as a way to excite his base and draw attention away from other Democrats.Such efforts tend to be haphazard and revolve around Mr. Trump's comments at rallies and on his Twitter feed, as does much of the messaging of his campaign. The president, his advisers say, has been in need of a clear target for months, and he believes he is actually hurting Mr. Sanders.Mr. Trump's advisers do not necessarily share that view. But they find utility in trying to elevate Mr. Sanders, and aides are discussing ways to keep attention on Mr. Sanders in the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3.""Wow! Crazy Bernie Sanders is surging in the polls, looking very good against his opponents in the Do Nothing Party,"" Mr. Trump posted Sunday on Twitter, after a Des Moines Register poll showed Mr. Sanders leading in the state. ""So what does this all mean? Stay tuned!""""It means you're going to lose,"" Mr. Sanders tweeted in response.At a rally last week in Toledo, Ohio, the president singled out Mr. Sanders for his criticism of Mr. Trump's Jan. 3 drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani at Baghdad International Airport.""Bernie is going up,"" Mr. Trump said. ""He's surging. Crazy Bernie is surging.""Most of the president's advisers see Mr. Sanders, if he were to become the nominee, as helping to solve Mr. Trump's problem with suburban voters in states like Virginia, where the 2018 midterm elections showed that moderate and independent voters have recoiled from the president's behavior, controversies or policy positions.But some have concerns that Mr. Sanders might be more durable in the Rust Belt states, like Michigan and Wisconsin, with high concentrations of white working-class voters that emerged as trouble spots for the president in the 2018 elections.The advisers say that in their voter research Mr. Sanders registers with his own supporters as authentic -- the same quality that Mr. Trump's base ascribed to the president in 2016. They view Mr. Sanders as a more difficult opponent than Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, but less of a challenge than Mr. Biden.And Mr. Trump's advisers are discussing rolling out policies to counter Mr. Sanders's populist appeal.In recent days, Mr. Trump's team has been interested in focusing attention on Mr. Sanders's comments after the strike that killed the General Suleimani, arguing that he will appear too dovish for the general electorate.""We have no preference in potential opponents because President Trump will beat any one of them handily,"" Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, said in a statement. ""However, over the last two weeks Bernie Sanders has proved himself to be dangerous -- not as an opponent but as a potential president -- by excusing and appeasing Iran's aggression and belligerence.""""Bernie Sanders would not protect American interests as president and his weakness is something that begs to be highlighted,"" he added.Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, pointed out that Mr. Trump ran as the candidate who ""would stop the endless wars"" and is now attacking the senator as weak. He added of Mr. Trump's efforts to tar Mr. Sanders: ""There's no 'there' there.""As for Mr. Bloomberg, the president has made clear he is aware of the money Mr. Bloomberg, a former New York mayor, is pouring into the race -- especially into the attack ads hitting him in 118 media markets across the country. And this week he responded on Twitter to a TV spot focused on the top issue for Democrats in the 2018 midterms: health care.""Mini Mike Bloomberg is spending a lot of money on False Advertising,"" Mr. Trump tweeted, going on to misrepresent his role in the health care debate. ""I was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your Healthcare, you have it now, while at the same time winning the fight to rid you of the expensive, unfair and very unpopular Individual Mandate.""Bloomberg aides noted that the ads highlight a core weakness for Mr. Trump, one that he seemed cognizant of defending himself over.""My view from watching the president's tweets is that he is clearly seeing our ads, he's clearly concerned about their impact,"" said Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Mr. Bloomberg. ""It's a massive television buy that is nationwide, attacking his biggest vulnerability and contrasting his failed record on health care.""Mr. Bloomberg spent over $100 million in 2018 through his super PAC, involving himself in two dozen races across the country, and that has made him and his team confident they have identified his weaknesses.""We amassed an enormous amount of data about what works in terms of identifying targeting the president's vulnerabilities,"" Mr. Wolfson said.But the Trump campaign has waved away concerns about Mr. Bloomberg's spending, arguing that it will only encourage Republican megadonors like Sheldon G. Adelson to spend more money for Mr. Trump.Despite Mr. Trump's own history of upending expectations of which candidates succeed, his aides insist they do not view Mr. Bloomberg as a serious contender for his party's nomination, and they believe that the power of his money is limited, noting that Mr. Bloomberg's aides would be legally prohibited from direct coordination with the Democratic nominee's campaign, unlike the national party committees.""Hillary Clinton said she 'inherited nothing' from the D.N.C., which is as broke today as it was when she lost,"" said Mike Reed, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. ""Growing a $300 million data-driven field operation like we have at the R.N.C. takes years. Liberal billionaires can spend as much outside money as they want, but the eventual nominee cannot coordinate with anything they build.""Campaign finance experts, however, said the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee were underestimating the effect of Mr. Bloomberg's cash infusion into the race and that Mr. Trump was right to be concerned.""If Bloomberg does this, it will be unprecedented in American history,"" said Fred Wertheimer, the founder and president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit watchdog group. ""They will probably have more organizers than the R.N.C. will have. They will have loads of people in the battleground states, they'll have TV ads, they'll have digital ads.""""It will neutralize any financial advantages he thought he had,"" Mr. Wertheimer said, referring to the president, ""and if they're not worried, they're kidding themselves.""Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, agreed that Mr. Bloomberg should not be dismissed.""By any traditional measure, it's a pipe dream, but if we learned anything in 2016 it's that just because something has never happened before doesn't mean it can't happen now,"" he said. ""No one has ever talked about spending remotely as much money as he's talking about spending on this race.""PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders on Sunday at a rally in Iowa City.

| Jump to first hitJoseph R. Biden Jr. and Bernie Sanders will be auditioning for the presidency, trying to convey leadership, against the backdrop of an unfolding national emergency.For the first time in the long Democratic primary campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will meet in a one-on-one debate, facing off Sunday night as Mr. Sanders fights for the future of his candidacy against a rival who has taken a commanding position in the race.But that isn't why this debate is different from most others in modern politics.Both men will be auditioning for the presidency amid an unfolding national emergency over the coronavirus; the last candidates to debate in such urgent circumstances were Barack Obama and John McCain during the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Sanders will be under added pressure to show why he is still running, at a time when people are worried about far more than presidential politics, while Mr. Biden -- often uneven in these debate settings -- must navigate far more speaking time as he tries to appear capable of uniting the country and leading it through a crisis.Rarely has a debate been so shaped by palpable anxiety: The event has been relocated from a Phoenix theater to a Washington, D.C., television studio to limit any unnecessary travel. There will be no live audience and no spin room. One moderator who had potentially been exposed to the virus has bowed out to avoid spreading it.Debates are often unpredictable, but it is especially hard to game out how this debate featuring a moderate standard-bearer and a liberal challenger will unfold and how people will process it. Hundreds of thousands of viewers, if not millions, will have been personally affected by Sunday, as public gathering spaces are shuttered, schools are closed and on Thursday the stock market plunged by the largest percentage in decades (it snapped back upward on Friday).""It is going to be a different kind of debate,"" Senator Chris Coons of Delaware, an early ally and surrogate for Mr. Biden, said with more than a little understatement.The extraordinary situation offers an unusual challenge and opportunity. It will provide a national platform and audience for Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders to preview their own brands of presidential leadership, especially in contrast to that of President Trump, who had spent weeks downplaying the threat that the coronavirus presented.""You have to throw the entire playbook out the window and focus on what people care about because the agenda has shifted dramatically since they were last onstage together,"" said Jared Leopold, a Democratic communications strategist who worked for Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington during his 2020 presidential bid. ""It's like you were preparing to pitch in the World Series and suddenly you found yourself at bat at a key moment. The dynamics have totally shifted.""Stephanie Cutter, a Democratic strategist who worked on the Obama campaigns, said moments like this are when ""voters want to see leaders, not politicians,"" warning against anything that would look like ""petty politics.""""This is a time for leadership and demonstrating that you have the judgment and vision to fix the incompetence that we're seeing out of the White House,"" Ms. Cutter said. ""That is job No. 1 in this debate.""Then there are less consequential questions: Will Mr. Biden, 77, and Mr. Sanders, 78, shake hands? And in a new moment of ""social distancing"" should these two septuagenarian men who are in an at-risk age group make a gesture of doing something else entirely -- like an elbow bump?The state of the race itself has been fundamentally upended since the last debate, too.Back then -- less than three weeks ago -- Mr. Sanders had won the most votes in three consecutive contests and was threatening to seize control of the nominating contest. Now, Mr. Biden has romped through two straight weeks of sizable victories, so much so that Mr. Sanders's campaign is facing what experts see as a nearly insurmountable delegate climb.Mr. Sanders now trails Mr. Biden by more than 150 delegates after losing four states last Tuesday and 10 the week before. His defeats were so thorough in Mississippi, Missouri and Michigan (a state Mr. Sanders won four years ago) that he trailed in every county. The states that vote next week -- Ohio, Florida, Illinois and Arizona -- are challenging for Mr. Sanders, as well.That difficult math might typically suggest an aggressive new posture for Mr. Sanders, who needs a real restructuring of the race to be successful. But his speech after last week's disappointing elections -- ""we are losing the debate over electability"" -- was widely interpreted as an effort at de-escalation, as he pressed Mr. Biden to win over his liberal supporters on issues ranging from the environment to student debt, repeatedly asking ""Joe, what are you going to do?""In his own speech on Tuesday night, Mr. Biden offered an olive branch to Mr. Sanders and his supporters, thanking them for their contributions to the contest.Mr. Coons expected more of that approach on Sunday. ""I suspect that we will see Joe say he wants to work with Bernie on some of his policy proposals,"" Mr. Coons said. But, he said, ""if Bernie insists on simply picking up tools and swinging at Joe the whole time, I think it will be harder to do that.""""They have a shared fundamental goal of preventing Donald Trump's election and the longer that Bernie Sanders spends attacking Joe Biden the more likely he is to undermine the strength of his candidacy against Donald Trump in the fall,"" Mr. Coons added.Still, for Mr. Sanders, the rapid spread of the coronavirus and the predicted shortcomings of America's medical system are shining a spotlight on his signature issue: a universal and government-run health care system.""It's obviously a health care crisis and so Bernie's longstanding support for providing affordable health care for everyone through 'Medicare for all' is particularly relevant today,"" said Ben Tulchin, a pollster for Mr. Sanders. ""And he is consistently seen as the most trusted candidate on health care.""Mr. Tulchin said the coronavirus's economic fallout would shape the debate to Mr. Sanders's benefit, too.""Bernie has a lot of credibility talking about economic issues especially for those being left behind in today's economy and there are soon going to be millions of more people facing financial challenges,"" Mr. Tulchin added. ""There are millions of workers who don't have paid sick leave, millions of workers who are living paycheck to paycheck, and if you're out of work for a few weeks that is potentially catastrophic.""The two candidates offered a preview of their contrasting approaches to the crisis in a pair of speeches on Thursday.Standing in front of a row of American flags, in Wilmington, Del., Mr. Biden adopted the scene and serious tone of a statesman, calling for collective action as a country. ""The coronavirus does not have a political affiliation,"" he said. ""It will affect Republicans, independents and Democrats alike and will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or ZIP code.""Mr. Sanders, speaking from Burlington, Vt., with the state and American flags positioned in front of ""Bernie"" signage, warned starkly of casualties that could top World War II, while pivoting to his central message of the urgent need for universal health care.""Our country is at a severe disadvantage compared to every other major country on Earth because we do not guarantee health care to all people as a right,"" Mr. Sanders said.PhotographThe Democratic debate stage in Charleston, S.C., last month before the state's primary election.

| Jump to first hitFive days before the New Hampshire primary, the race is looking more like a two front-runner competition between Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders.Welcome to Poll Watch, our weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election .The New Hampshire Democratic primary is increasingly looking like a dual front-runner race as former Mayor Pete Buttigieg leaps ahead to join Senator Bernie Sanders at the front of the pack, according to newly released polls.Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg are statistically tied in both a Monmouth University survey released Thursday and a Boston Globe/Suffolk University poll out Friday. Each survey was taken during the aftermath of Monday's bungled Iowa caucuses.These results set up a possible outcome that few had given much thought to before this week: Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg may emerge from the two earliest-voting states with roughly equal momentum, leaving even their strongest rivals scrambling to regain footing -- even as the race expands to more diverse contests in the South and West.The Monmouth poll showed Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, with the support of 24 percent of likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire, and Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., with 20 percent. Those numbers are technically within the poll's margin of error of each other. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was at 17 percent and Senator Elizabeth Warren had 13 percent. Senator Amy Klobuchar was at 9 percent.The Suffolk numbers were even tighter: Mr. Sanders was at 24 percent, and Mr. Buttigieg was at 23 percent. No other candidate was within 10 points of them in that poll.Suffolk has been polling New Hampshire voters constantly this week, releasing new results from its ""tracking poll"" every day. According to the poll, Mr. Buttigieg's support has doubled since the beginning of the week, when he captured just 11 percent of likely voters.Campaigning around New Hampshire this week, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg have each claimed victory in the Iowa caucuses. And as of right now, both have a legitimate argument: With 99 percent of precincts reporting, Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders are locked in a virtual tie in the delegate count.While the Monmouth poll had a four-day collection period, which began on the day of the Iowa caucuses, the latest Globe/Suffolk poll was only collected on Wednesday and Thursday. That meant the news of Mr. Buttigieg's unexpectedly strong showing in Iowa had sunk in a bit more by the time that poll's field period began.A little over half of primary voters in both polls said they had yet to firmly settle on a Democratic candidate.""I don't think Iowa has sunk in yet -- things are still shifting there,"" Patrick Murray, who runs the Monmouth poll, said in an interview. But even without an outright win, Mr. Buttigieg's strong showing has the potential to bring him more attention, Mr. Murray said -- particularly if he performs strongly in the Democratic debate in Manchester, N.H., on Friday.That's because Mr. Murray sees the most uncertainty existing among electability-minded voters -- those who say they are most interested in finding a candidate who will defeat President Trump. And Mr. Buttigieg tends to be more popular among these voters than among those who prioritize particular issues.""Some of these other supporters of Biden and Klobuchar are the ones taking a look, because they're the ones most concerned about electability,"" Mr. Murray said, referring to voter curiosity about Mr. Buttigieg.There is sometimes a temptation to lump Iowa and New Hampshire together as a kind of opening chapter to the nominating process. After all, both are heavily white states and nonrepresentative of the country's population at large. And indeed, the results this year could end up being quite similar in both states.But the two contests differ significantly. Iowa's consists of caucuses -- which favor candidates with younger and more activist supporters -- and includes only Democrats. New Hampshire's election is a simple primary, and is also open to political independents.In 2016, when Mr. Sanders beat Hillary Clinton in the primary there, he relied largely on the support of independent voters. He is himself a political independent, and he still does well among this group. But the 26 percent support he is now earning from non-Democrats in the Monmouth poll is still far less than the nearly three-quarters of independent voters he got in 2016.This reflects the complications of a more crowded field this year, and the fact that the independent voters who participate on Tuesday may skew slightly more conservative than they did in 2016. That is because there was a competitive Republican primary that year. With Mr. Trump's nomination all but guaranteed among Republicans this year, a broader cross-section of independents may consider weighing in on the Democratic race.Mr. Buttigieg, who is the only other candidate to break 20 percent among non-Democrats in the Monmouth poll, could stand to gain.Ms. Warren -- whose poll numbers in New Hampshire crested in the fall, but who still stands a chance at a strong showing -- is far less popular among independents. She pulls the vast majority of her backing from Democrats, and from liberals.The divide between her liberal supporters and Mr. Sanders's falls strikingly along gender lines. He is nearly twice as popular among New Hampshire men than he is among women there, according to the Monmouth poll. For Ms. Warren, the inverse is true.A possible asset for Ms. Warren is that college graduates make up an outsize share of the New Hampshire primary electorate. Mr. Sanders tends to underperform with this group; according to Iowa entrance polls, on Monday he did only half as well among those with a college degree as he did among less-educated voters.But so far, no other candidate has consolidated the support of college-educated New Hampshire Democrats either. Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg each command about one-fifth of these voters, according to Monmouth. Mr. Biden and Ms. Klobuchar are not far behind.Poll Watch, is a weekly look at polling data and survey research on the candidates, voters and issues that will shape the 2020 election.PhotographPete Buttigieg campaigning in Merrimack, N.H., on Thursday.

| Jump to first hitFund-raising numbers for the fourth quarter of 2019 show an unusually high number of viable campaigns. Waiting for the winner: President Trump and his huge war chest.A flood of money rushed into the presidential race in the last three months of 2019, producing an unusually large number of Democratic candidates with the resources to battle deep into the 2020 primary calendar, all vying for the right to face an incumbent president boasting his own enormous war chest.The five strongest Democratic fund-raisers are expected to report over $115 million raised in just the final quarter of the year, and they join two self-funding billionaires who are pouring their fortunes into expansive advertising campaigns.Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont is pacing the Democratic field, announcing on Thursday that he had raised $34.5 million in the last three months -- the largest sum of any Democrat in any quarter so far. Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., collected $24.7 million, and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. raised $22.7 million, his best showing of the year. Senator Elizabeth Warren has not revealed her haul but told supporters in late December that she had banked $17 million, while setting a $20 million goal.In a sign of how widespread the money windfall was, Andrew Yang, the former entrepreneur who was unknown nationally a year ago, raised a striking total of $16.5 million in the fourth quarter -- more than Mr. Biden had managed in the third.Whoever emerges from the fractious Democratic primary will face a financial powerhouse in President Trump, who leveraged the impeachment fight of recent months to shatter his previous fund-raising records, collecting $46 million in the fourth quarter, his campaign said Thursday. He enters 2020 with $102.7 million in cash on hand.While Mr. Trump is stockpiling cash for the general election, Democrats are expected to spend tens of millions of dollars in the coming months taking aim at one another in an intensifying primary fight. And with an uncommonly high number of well-funded candidates in a surprisingly fluid race, party leaders are bracing for an extended nomination battle, especially if the first four states to vote in February deliver a split verdict.""Put your seatbelts on, because I do expect we're in for a protracted race to the finish line,"" said Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, a member of the House Democratic leadership.The fact that so many candidates can simultaneously raise so much money is a testament to the rising power of small, online donors in presidential politics. Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren combined to raise more than $160 million in 2019 while refusing to hold any traditional fund-raisers with large contributors. And Mr. Biden credited his recent fund-raising uptick to increased online support, which doubled from the previous quarter.Ami Copeland, who was deputy national finance director for Barack Obama's 2008 campaign, said that the fourth-quarter numbers ""really just lock in that top tier, period,"" and that the candidates' substantial financial resources would ""create some legs to this primary process.""""This is going to go on for a while,"" Mr. Copeland added.Awaiting the top Democratic contenders in March is the billionaire former mayor of New York City, Michael R. Bloomberg. Though he is skipping the first four states, Mr. Bloomberg has already spent nearly $140 million of his fortune on television ads, according to the ad-tracking firm Advertising Analytics, mostly in the Super Tuesday states that will vote in early March and other states that will follow.The scope of Mr. Bloomberg's spending is staggering: He has reserved more in TV ads, $37 million, in the first days of January than the fund-raising leader, Mr. Sanders, had collected in the final three months from more than 1.8 million contributions.The high number of candidates with significant resources -- the billionaire Tom Steyer is filling the airwaves in the four early states with ads, as well -- has stirred early worries that the party could go all the way to its July convention without a nominee, which would drastically truncate the window to focus on combating Mr. Trump.""To have the best chance of beating Trump and moving on to the general, candidates will need to drop out when they still have plenty of money but no delegate path,"" said David Plouffe, who managed Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign and was a senior adviser in 2012. ""It defies history they will do so, but it's what will be required. This can't be a cycle where just because you can keep going on, you do.""Mr. Jeffries said it was crucial for the party to coalesce around whoever emerges, whenever it happens.""We cannot afford the degree of recklessness and political immaturity among some who conclude that unless my candidate wins, I'm taking my ball and going home,"" he warned, in an apparent reference to Mr. Sanders's disgruntled supporters in 2016. ""That is what delivered Donald Trump the first time.""For the second consecutive quarter, Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump's campaign manager, declared the incumbent to be building a financial ""juggernaut"" for the general election. His $102.7 million war chest will be supplemented by tens of millions of dollars more in the coffers of the Republican National Committee, which Mr. Trump functionally controls.Together, Mr. Trump's re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee raised roughly $125 million in the third quarter, and a Trump campaign official said on Thursday that their combined total for the fourth quarter would be even larger.But Democrats were heartened that, collectively, their campaigns far surpassed the total of Mr. Trump's re-election campaign; the full field of 14 candidates will more than double the president's take, signaling the intense desire in the party to win back the White House.""What you're seeing is a Democratic base so aware and so paying attention so early on,"" said Karine Jean-Pierre, a Democratic strategist and a spokeswoman for MoveOn.org, a progressive activist group. ""It's just been part of the reaction to Trump. The last three years we've seen a very engaged Democratic base.""The full picture of the financial race will not become clear until Jan. 31, when all the candidates must file their fund-raising reports with the Federal Election Commission. How much money the Democratic candidates actually have in the bank to spend in the closing stretch is an even more significant metric of their viability so close to votes being cast; notably, no Democrats have voluntarily disclosed that information.Still, Mr. Sanders enters 2020 with a clear financial advantage over his primary rivals: His treasury allows him to buy additional television ads in the early states -- he purchased new airtime in New Hampshire on Thursday -- and to invest in staff in Super Tuesday states like California, where he had already dispatched 80 staff members as of December.Mr. Sanders's strongest month of the year was December, when he raised more than $18 million from more than 900,000 contributions, and he particularly benefited from a rush of donations in the final two days of the year. He can also keep raising cash online without spending days off the trail doing fund-raisers.Mr. Biden had entered the fourth quarter with nearly $25 million less in cash on hand than Mr. Sanders. His campaign manager, Greg Schultz, wrote in a memo Thursday that the campaign would ""always be playing from behind in the cash race"" because Mr. Biden did not transfer funds to his presidential bid from other campaign accounts (as did two of his top rivals, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders).Mr. Biden's campaign said it had received a financial boost from Mr. Trump's impeachment; the average amount of money it raised online per day, it said, more than doubled during the House's impeachment inquiry compared with previous weeks. But despite his greater success online, Mr. Biden will continue to hold fund-raisers into January, with events in the coming days in New York City, Philadelphia and Washington.Mr. Buttigieg's campaign out-raised Mr. Biden's for the third consecutive quarter, and it raised roughly $76 million in 2019, compared with about $60 million for Mr. Biden. What began as a bare-bones operation now counts more than 500 staff members nationwide, with 65 field offices in early voting states, according to a memo on Wednesday from Mr. Buttigieg's campaign manager, Mike Schmuhl.Among the top-tier candidates, only Ms. Warren has not yet released her fund-raising total. Her campaign emailed supporters in late December to say her pace was behind her third-quarter haul by millions of dollars and set a reduced goal of $20 million. On the trail in New Hampshire on Thursday, she brushed aside questions about her total, saying that unlike some rivals, she ""didn't spend one single minute selling access to my time to millionaires and billionaires.""Mr. Yang, who rang in the New Year with a champagne toast in New Hampshire, was bullish on his $16.5 million haul, including more than $4 million in the last nine days of December from an online following known as the ""Yang Gang.""""We're going to continue to surprise people,"" Mr. Yang said in a high school gym in Concord, N.H., on Thursday, ""and shock the world when the voting starts in February.""Patrick Healy and Matt Stevens contributed reporting from Concord, N.H.PhotographPete Buttigieg, above left, collected $24.7 million last quarter. Elizabeth Warren, above right, has not revealed her haul but said in late December that she had banked $17 million.

| Jump to first hitMr. Sanders's victory in the New Hampshire primary and his strengths in the 2020 race are worrying moderates who fear he could cost Democrats the presidency and the House in the fall.CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. -- As Senator Bernie Sanders and his supporters reveled in his victory in the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday, Jimmy Tawater's mood was less celebratory.""I love Bernie Sanders. Love Bernie, love his ideas. But he can't win,"" said Mr. Tawater, 72, of Ringgold, Ga.Late Tuesday, Lloyd Blankfein, the former Goldman Sachs chief executive, wrote on Twitter that the Vermont senator would ""ruin our economy"" if elected president.And on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, Representative Dean Phillips, a centrist Democrat from Minnesota who flipped a Republican House seat in 2018, said he was worried that Mr. Sanders would doom his re-election campaign -- and cost Democrats their House majority.""I'm the first Democrat to win in my district since 1958,"" said Mr. Phillips, who backs his home state senator, Amy Klobuchar, in the presidential contest. ""I attracted a lot of independent and moderate Republican support, many of whom probably voted for a Democrat for the first time in a long time. And while I respect Bernie Sanders as a senator, as a candidate, his candidacy is very challenging for people who come from districts like mine.""Forty-eight states have yet to render judgment on Mr. Sanders and the other candidates seeking the Democratic nomination for president. But with Mr. Sanders solidifying his standing at the top of the field, concerns about his electability and whether a possible Sanders nomination might alienate some swing voters rippled through different corners of the country on Wednesday -- from Wall Street to the halls of Congress to the Bessie Smith Cultural Center in downtown Chattanooga, where over 1,000 people turned out in the rain to hear Michael R. Bloomberg speak.Jenny Gaines of Chattanooga thought about the results from New Hampshire and couldn't help doubting whether the Democratic Party was in a healthy place. ""We're very divided,"" Ms. Gaines, 58, said. ""And let me say this: If we don't come together, Trump is going to be back in office.""Mr. Sanders has now won the most votes in the first two nominating contests, energizing many liberal voters with a consistent message championing ""Medicare for all"" and free public colleges and fighting against income inequality and climate change. He has also proposed sharp tax increases on the wealthiest Americans and on corporations to pay for much of his agenda, and he has been a sharp critic of Wall Street excesses.Mr. Sanders, in turn, unsettles many upper-income and moderate Democrats who worry about the political, economic and personal consequences if a self-described democratic socialist becomes president. Some Wall Streeters compared Mr. Sanders to failed candidates like Jeremy Corbyn, the British Labour Party leader who was soundly defeated by Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a recent election.Mr. Sanders is likely to view such criticism as validation of his campaign's success, arguing that he is not trying to appeal to Wall Street bankers or hedge fund managers but to ordinary Americans who feel they have no voice in the political process.In Washington, the anxiety is particularly acute among a small but politically important group of freshman House Democrats who helped their party win control of the House in 2018 by flipping Republican seats in districts that President Trump won in 2016.Concern is also building among centrists in the Senate, where Democrats face an uphill battle in their quest to flip the four Republican seats they would need to regain the majority, and must defend moderates like Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire. Ms. Shaheen, who has not endorsed any candidate, said she was not concerned by Mr. Sanders but sounded frustrated on Wednesday by the suggestion that he had won big in her state.""He did not win big!"" she exclaimed. (Mr. Sanders took about 26 percent of the vote, just ahead of Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind.)In the House, members of the group of about three dozen moderates -- often called ""front-liners"" or ""majority-makers""-- have toiled to carve out political identities distinct from their party's progressive base, and most are facing competitive re-election challenges from Republicans who bill them as radicals who have empowered a far-left agenda in Congress.Eight of the front-line Democrats, including Representatives Haley Stevens of Michigan, Max Rose of New York and Lucy McBath of Georgia, have endorsed Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor. Others, including several military veterans -- Representatives Conor Lamb and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, and Elaine Luria of Virginia -- are coalescing around former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.Two former chairmen of the party's House campaign arm -- Steve Israel, who has endorsed Mr. Biden, and Rahm Emanuel, who is not backing any candidate -- said the lawmakers were right to be worried. Mr. Emanuel, the former mayor of Chicago, led Democrats to retake the House in 2006 using a playbook he called ""metropolitan majority"" -- a ""center-left"" agenda aimed at uniting urban and suburban voters.""Back in 2006, we created Red to Blue as a political entity,"" Mr. Emanuel said, referring to a program Democrats made to help candidates flip Republican seats. ""We never established or created 'blue to deep blue.' That's not how you create majorities.""Mr. Israel sees two reasons for concern: The race for president will be won or lost in seven swing states and about 20 to 30 swing counties. And the ""down ballot effect"" -- the tendency for the candidate at the top of the ticket to dominate voters' assessments of other candidates of his or her party -- is very strong in a presidential race.""Donald Trump will paint every Democrat -- whether they're running for U.S. Senate or county sheriff -- as a socialist, as a 'Bernie Sanders socialist,""' he said, ""and that's a tough deal in a lot of these districts.""Anxiety in the Democratic Party is exactly the sentiment that Mr. Bloomberg hopes will propel his unorthodox presidential bid forward. He is the only candidate who is skipping the four states that vote first in the nominating process -- Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. Instead, he has been campaigning and spending heavily on advertising in states like Tennessee that vote in the March 3 Super Tuesday contests.And while the candidates trying to appeal to the country's political middle -- Mr. Biden, Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg -- jockey for advantage in the early states, Mr. Bloomberg is betting that enough voters elsewhere in the country will come to see him as the consensus alternative to Mr. Sanders.""I was not running, remember, in four states,"" Mr. Bloomberg said on Wednesday in response to a question about his campaign strategy. ""I'm a believer that if we're going to unite this country, we should unite the whole country. So I've been going to small states as well as big states, states that are on Super Tuesday and states that don't vote for a long time.""Over the next several weeks, Mr. Bloomberg plans to campaign heavily, starting on Wednesday in Tennessee before going to North Carolina and Texas on Thursday, then Virginia on Saturday. All four states vote on Super Tuesday.Speaking to reporters in Chattanooga, Mr. Bloomberg said he saw nothing productive about joining in the criticisms of Mr. Sanders. And in a speech to prospective voters, he made an appeal for unity. ""The stakes couldn't be higher,"" he told the crowd, only 500 members of which made it into the main room to hear him speak while 500 more waited in an overflow room or stood outside in the rain. ""The way to defeat Trump is by appealing to the broadest possible coalition -- Americans of all backgrounds and parties -- to stand shoulder to shoulder.""Ms. Stevens says voters in her congressional district outside Detroit are looking for just such a candidate. She avoided talking about Mr. Sanders. But in explaining her support for Mr. Bloomberg, she made it clear that she did not believe Mr. Sanders had a profile that would appeal to her constituents.""What I think is going to resonate in my district is somebody who is a world-class business leader or a government leader,"" she said, ""somebody who has led a city that is bigger than the populations of certain states.""The concerns among many Wall Street executives about Mr. Sanders are straightforward: His worldview is at odds with the capitalist, free-market system on which the American finance industry thrives. Vin Ryan, founder of the venture-capital firm Schooner Capital and a supporter of Ms. Warren, said he viewed Mr. Sanders as ""a lightning rod"" whom Republicans would attack nonstop as a socialist.""You've got enormous numbers of independent voters that don't like Trump,"" he added, ""but when you come to the pocketbook issues -- particularly that fact that in spite of Trump the economy's doing well,"" that redounds to the president's benefit, he said.Jeremy W. Peters reported from Chattanooga, Sheryl Gay Stolberg from Washington, and Kate Kelly from New York.PhotographResults in Iowa and New Hampshire, above, have given momentum to Senator Bernie Sanders's campaign, but have also ratcheted up concerns among large blocs of more moderate Democrats.

| Jump to first hitOlder voters have easily carried Mr. Biden to victory in multiple primaries. But if he wants to beat President Trump, he will have to win younger voters too -- and that may not be easy.The magnitude of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s recent primary victories has obscured an important schism within the Democratic Party: between the older voters who carried Mr. Biden to victory and the younger voters who overwhelmingly rejected him.The dividing line is around age 45, and it is as stark as a flipped switch. In some states on Tuesday, Mr. Biden won two-thirds or more of voters older than 45, while Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont won about two-thirds of voters younger than that.Comparatively low turnout among young voters helped save Mr. Biden in the primaries. But in the general election, a similar lack of turnout could become a huge liability -- a point Mr. Sanders made explicitly on Wednesday as he announced that he would continue his campaign at least through the next debate on Sunday.""I say to the Democratic establishment: In order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""You must speak to the issues of concern to them. You cannot simply be satisfied by winning the votes of people who are older.""Mr. Biden's campaign and some of his supporters have acknowledged this. Unite the Country, a pro-Biden super PAC, said in a memo on Wednesday that winning in November would depend on bringing young voters in. And Mr. Biden's wife, Jill Biden, said at a fund-raiser in Illinois last week that her husband was talking to his staff about ""engaging the youth vote and coming up with some youth advocacy.""But Mr. Biden has been campaigning for nearly a year to represent a party that young voters often prefer, and his lack of support among those voters has been evident for a long time.""What I'm a little nervous that we're in the middle of right now is a repeat of 2016,"" said Sarah Audelo, executive director of the Alliance for Youth Action, who worked on Hillary Clinton's campaign and said it did not invest enough in outreach to young voters during the primaries. ""What that meant was the campaign had to start from scratch in the general, and that is not something Joe Biden can afford to do.""The New York Times spoke with more than 30 young Democrats from 17 states this week, ranging in age from 17 to 34. Most of them said they had voted for Mr. Sanders or planned to do so if he stayed in the race through their state's primary. Some had voted for Senator Elizabeth Warren before she dropped out. Only two said they wanted Mr. Biden to be the nominee.And while many said they would reluctantly vote for Mr. Biden in November for the sake of beating President Trump, about a third said they would consider staying home or voting for a third-party candidate unless Mr. Biden made significant concessions to the party's left wing.They were well aware of his plans to address climate change, student debt and other issues that matter to them -- plans that would help Mr. Biden appeal to young voters, his wife said. But those plans, the young Democrats said, were not the solution to the generational gap among the candidates' supporters; they were a cause.""The plan the Biden campaign put forward for climate change is nowhere near good enough to save our Earth,"" said Benjamin Brumer, 28, who lives in California and said he felt hopeless about his future under either Mr. Trump or Mr. Biden. ""It will be hard, if not impossible, for them to convince me to vote for Biden. But a good first step toward reconciliation would be to make bolder promises for solving climate change.""Lindsay Huber, 29, who lives in Oregon, said that at an ""absolute bare minimum,"" to win her vote, Mr. Biden needed to stop accepting super PAC money and endorse both ""Medicare for all"" and the Green New Deal.""And it would still be difficult to trust that he's being truthful, because he has decades of racist, sexist, corporatist, warmongering votes,"" Ms. Huber said. ""To win us back, the Democratic Party needs to actually listen to us and serve us. Or else they need to die and we will create a new party ourselves.""Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr. Biden's campaign, said his agenda ""would be the most progressive of any administration since the Great Society.""Mr. Trump's ""values and record are repellent to young Americans, who deserve a leader that will mobilize the whole country to overcome the climate emergency, defeat the N.R.A. in order to heal the epidemic of mass shootings, and deliver universal health care,"" Mr. Bates said. ""Both the vice president and Senator Sanders have pledged that either of them will be all in for whomever the Democratic nominee is, and surging turnout has proven how energized our party is to defeat Donald Trump in 2020.""The campaign also pointed to the geographic sweep of Mr. Biden's victories on Tuesday, particularly in Michigan: He won every county there, including those home to the University of Michigan and Michigan State University, which Mr. Sanders won by double-digit margins in 2016, though Mr. Biden's margins there were much smaller than in other parts of the state.From the start, Mr. Biden's argument for his candidacy has centered explicitly on a return to ""normalcy"" after four years of life under Mr. Trump. And that is not what many young voters are looking for.""The Republican Party has moved farther to the right than Democrats have moved to the left, which leaves this huge vacuum, I feel, for younger people who actually want to be a part of a truly progressive movement,"" said Hajar Khalid, 20, a student at Columbia University.Ms. Khalid said she supported Medicare for all and would feel somewhat better about voting for Mr. Biden, should he win the nomination, if he had a more comprehensive health care plan or if he chose a truly progressive running mate.""I want to say that despite all of this, I will still vote for the Democratic Party in the general no matter who it is,"" she said. ""But it's really hard to say that when the other candidate is Joe Biden, who doesn't have any real attractive attributes and whose main message seems to be: 'I won't change anything to help progressive causes, really, but at least I'm not Trump.""'Beyond the disconnect between young progressives' ideals and Mr. Biden's more moderate proposals, there is also a deeper problem: While Mr. Sanders has actively engaged with young people, Mr. Biden has never given much indication that he is seeking their votes at all. At times, he has appeared openly disdainful or condescending toward them.Groups that work with young voters said winning their votes would require speaking more to the policies they want to see enacted, but also considering them in event planning, advertising and communications. And it could mean enlisting surrogates who have more credibility among young voters than Mr. Biden does.""It's going to be up to the campaign to craft messages for young people and develop a really good surrogate program,"" said Anne Moses, founder and president of Ignite, which encourages young women to enter politics. ""I don't think Biden is the best person to speak directly to young people.""The lack of political attention is a tremendous source of frustration for young people: both those who are considering not voting because they feel they are being ignored, and those who are angry with their peers for not voting because it perpetuates their exclusion.""Biden and other Democrats would be more receptive to young people if they actually voted,"" said Ariel Schwartz, 21, a student at SUNY New Paltz. ""Would I like a candidate like Bernie Sanders, who puts young people at the forefront? Of course I would. But young voters didn't turn out in the primaries to support him. That's our generation's mistake. We can't make that same mistake in the general election.""There are many reasons young people are less likely to turn out, ranging from structural obstacles -- including voter suppression on college campuses -- to disillusionment or distaste for all of the available candidates. But one rationale that came up repeatedly this week was that they did not want to be taken for granted.Democrats assume progressives will vote for them ""even as they ignore and dismiss the policy positions most young and progressive voters care about, and yet enough people voted for Jill Stein to lose Hillary the election in multiple key states,"" said Sam Anderson, 25, a New Yorker who plans to vote only in down-ballot races unless the party crafts a more progressive platform and Mr. Biden chooses a progressive running mate.""I worry, win or lose, that the party will learn nothing from this election and continue to dismiss the concerns and policy goals of the younger generation they rely upon,"" Mr. Anderson said. ""The most I can do to influence that at this point is simply not vote and reduce the margin of victory in New York.""Katie Glueck contributed reporting.PhotographLast month, Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitA historically large Democratic presidential field has been narrowed to 11, with these seven candidates mounting competitive efforts in Iowa. If history and the laws of mathematics are any guide, no more than four of them will emerge from the caucuses on Monday with a plausible case to be the Democratic nominee against President Trump.Public polling averages show Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. atop the field, with Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., bundled close behind. Yet there are few close observers of Iowa politics who feel confident in their prognostications. Other than a widespread belief that Mr. Sanders will place first or, at worst, second, the other three leading candidates could each place anywhere from first to fourth without it being a shock.Iowa awards just 41 delegates to the Democratic National Convention, a tiny fraction of the more than 1,900 required to become the party's nominee. But all the candidates competing here agree that whoever wins, or at least overperforms expectations, will suddenly have momentum as the field moves to New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina and beyond.Joseph R. Biden Jr.Former vice president, 77The choice of establishment Democrats since he entered the race, Mr. Biden will aim to overcome a substandard organization in Iowa and the state's historical skepticism of the next-in-line candidate. His biggest advantage is the idea, put forth by his campaign and allies and supported by most public polling of swing states, that he would do best against President Trump in a general election.But Iowa has historically rewarded campaigns that spend months doing the hard work of organizing and creating a sense of excitement -- two areas where Mr. Biden lags the field. Alone among the candidates, he has a super PAC pouring money into Iowa TV ads backing his candidacy.Mr. Biden is also the only candidate who can perhaps survive a poor showing -- provided he maintains his strength with black voters.Days spent in Iowa: 58Money spent on TV: $4.09 millionIowa polling average: 22%National polling average: 27%Bernie SandersSenator from Vermont, 78He almost won Iowa four years ago and is poised to claim what would be a seismic victory Monday night. Leading in the recent polls, Mr. Sanders has drawn big crowds to rallies when he's been able to slip away from the impeachment trial over the last week.Popular especially with working-class voters and young people, Mr. Sanders's biggest advantage may be that he figures to reach the 15 percent viability threshold in more caucuses than any of his opponents, giving him more chances to accrue delegates than anyone else.Days spent in Iowa: 58Money spent on TV: $10.1 millionIowa polling average: 22%National polling average: 24%Pete ButtigiegFormer mayor of South Bend, Ind., 38Regardless of where he finishes in Iowa, Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., has cemented his status as the breakout star of the 2020 presidential campaign. The youngest major candidate in the race at 38, his support is strongest among Iowa's white-haired set, particularly in the state's rural areas.With the impeachment trial confining the senators to Washington on weekdays, Mr. Buttigieg has had an opportunity to be the only candidate on the ground in a lot of places on his final barnstorming tour. He's also been the most aggressive in attacking his rivals, denouncing Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders by name in the last few days.Mr. Buttigieg has a lot riding on a strong Iowa finish -- without one, he has less of a chance to do well in subsequent states.Days spent in Iowa: 62Money spent on TV: $9.99 millionIowa polling average: 18%National polling average: 7%Elizabeth WarrenSenator from Massachusetts, 70There was a time this fall when Ms. Warren was the Iowa front-runner. She led the field in the Des Moines Register's September poll, then got eclipsed first by Mr. Buttigieg and then by Mr. Sanders. Her crowds in the final days were smaller than they'd been months earlier. Polls have shown her slipping, with even some of her own supporters doubtful that she'd have the best chances to defeat Mr. Trump.Still, she is widely said to have the strongest field organization, which can boost a candidate on caucus night. She figures to be strongest among college-educated women in the state's suburban enclaves.Days spent in Iowa: 56Money spent on TV: $6.14 millionIowa polling average: 15%National polling average: 14%Amy KlobucharSenator from Minnesota, 59Did you hear she's from Minnesota, the state just to Iowa's north? Ms. Klobuchar's bet is that Iowans will pick someone who stresses the just-like-them argument in searching for a moderate candidate who can carry the Midwest.But she's never broken double digits in Iowa's polling, leaving her well behind the top four candidates. Ms. Klobuchar would declare Iowa a victory if she sneaks into the top four, especially if she winds up ahead of Mr. Biden or Ms. Warren.<. But she has run a very Iowa-centric campaign and a poor finish there risks her chances of advancing in the other states.Days spent in Iowa: 67Money spent on TV: $3.74 millionIowa polling average: 8%National polling average: 5%Andrew YangFormer tech executive, 45The outsider's outsider, Mr. Yang has used his pitch for a universal basic income and the perils of automation to keep himself in the race longer than far more established and famous politicians. He's spent the most days in Iowa of any remaining candidate, even though he's operated with far less media attention.His supporters skew male more than anyone else in the field and are likely to shift to Bernie Sanders, or just go home, in precincts where Mr. Yang fails to meet the 15 percent viability threshold.Days spent in Iowa: 71Money spent on TV: $6.52 millionIowa polling average: 3%National polling average: 4%Tom SteyerFormer hedge fund investor, 62Since joining the race in July, Mr. Steyer used his billions to blanket the Iowa TV airwaves for months. After spending two years pushing for impeaching President Trump, he's focused his presidential campaign on protecting the environment. Iowa isn't his strongest state -- his polling numbers are much better in Nevada and South Carolina -- but he is widely known because of his pre-campaign work to turn out the Democratic vote in the state's college towns.Days spent in Iowa: 47Money spent on TV: $14.27 millionIowa polling average: 3%National polling average: 2%Other candidatesOther candidates who campaigned heavily in Iowa last year have shifted their focus from Iowa to New Hampshire. Tulsi Gabbard invested in billboards all over the state. Michael Bennet moved most of his resources from Iowa to New Hampshire. Deval Patrick visited Iowa once and hasn't been back. Michael R. Bloomberg is skipping the first four states and has focused his TV advertising on other states. None of them are likely to make much of a dent on Monday, though they may have a handful of supporters caucus for them.Photograph(A20; A21)Word count: 1137Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitHollywood stars are making their way to Iowa and South Carolina. Will they change anyone’s mind?
SUMTER, S.C. — Bernice Harris was with her granddaughter Saturday afternoon when they heard a surprising rumor: Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was going to visit their city later that day, holding a rally at an African Methodist Episcopal Church.
But when Ms. Harris arrived at the church, Mt. Pisgah A.M.E., it became clear that there had been a mistake. Mr. Sanders was not in Sumter, but in Iowa. The event was a question-and-answer session, attended by only about 50 people. And playing the role of septuagenarian keynote was Danny Glover, the activist and actor perhaps best known, at least by the Sumter crowd, for the “Lethal Weapon” films.
“I thought Bernie Sanders would be here, and I wanted to hear him one-on-one,” said a confused Ms. Harris, 68, a caregiver.
“But you know what,” she said, looking on as Mr. Glover conducted a selfie line in front of a large campaign banner, “he represented Bernie well.”
As voting in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary inches closer by the day, candidates are increasingly sharing top billing with a wide array of stars, clearly aware that celebrities can often connect with audiences that the candidates themselves can’t reach..
In the last week, Judy Sheindlin, the retired family court judge better known as Judge Judy, opened for former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, joining him over the weekend as he stumped in Texas.
Martin Sheen, the actor who played a fictional president on the television drama “The West Wing,” announced at a recent climate rally that he was supporting Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. On Monday, the singer and actress Mandy Moore campaigned for former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg in the vitally important caucus state of Iowa. And on Tuesday, the comedian and actor Dave Chappelle endorsed the entrepreneur Andrew Yang and announced he would perform two shows in South Carolina later this month to benefit Mr. Yang’s campaign.
Over the weekend, Mr. Glover toured rural communities in South Carolina on behalf of Mr. Sanders, pitching black voters in Hartsville, Dillon and Mullins on his vision of a political revolution.
At times, he related to the audience, often made up of older black voters, in ways Mr. Sanders would find hard to replicate, referencing his upbringing in the A.M.E. church or his family’s roots picking cotton in the South. With Mr. Glover speaking, Mr. Sanders’s slogan of “not me, us” meant something different. It was targeted directly at black people.
At the stop in Sumter, Mr. Glover told a crowd that Mr. Sanders was the 2020 embodiment of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s political ideology.
“If Dr. King was with us today, at 90 years old last year, he would be voting for Bernie Sanders,” Mr. Glover said.
In a later interview, Mr. Glover questioned whether celebrities have extraordinary persuasive power.
“I honestly don’t know, but I don’t abdicate my responsibility as a citizen because I make movies and people like to go to my movies,” he said. “And there are other people supporting him I know — Mark Ruffalo, Susan Sarandon — we can’t wait to get together and campaign for Bernie.”
The 2020 candidates are all seeking political and celebrity endorsements, and proudly announcing them when they land, but the value of big-name fans has not yet seemed to translate into broader support.
Senator Kamala Harris of California, who had more endorsements from the Congressional Black Caucus than anyone in the Democratic field, was also a leading candidate on the Hollywood front. Mindy Kaling, the comedian and actress, put out a cooking video with Ms. Harris in November, just weeks before she dropped out of the race. Former Representative Beto O’Rourke of Texas had stars like Beyoncé and Frank Ocean in his corner during his 2018 challenge to Senator Ted Cruz. His presidential campaign lasted less than eight months.
In South Carolina, voters attended Mr. Glover’s stops for a variety of reasons. While there were some gawking fans, eager to see an actor whose career stretched back decades, the focus was undoubtedly political. Even in his introduction, Mr. Glover’s political activism got more attention than his film work.
Jannie Lathan, 69, attended the Hartsville event and said she viewed the event no differently than when any campaign comes to town: It was “an opportunity to get informed.” Sue Catanch, 74, was direct: She was planning to vote for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and seeing Mr. Glover did nothing to change that.
“Bernie Sanders isn’t a Democrat. He’s too liberal. And Joe Biden will beat Trump,” Ms. Catanch said flatly. “And Danny Glover did not really answer those questions.”
She decided against a photo with Mr. Glover — choosing instead to shake his hand — because the pictures were being taken in front of a “BERNIE 2020” banner.
Ms. Lathan said she understood the sentiment, and this election was too important to get caught up anything but the issues.
“We’re not about to fall for the okie-doke,” she said. “This is not about a popularity contest.”
An endorsement, more than anything, can send a signal. If high-impact ones from elected officials come with the added political benefit of volunteers or increased fund-raising, the best celebrity endorsements pull cultural weight. Campaigns package them for larger resonance, hoping for a viral online moment or an opportunity to drive more grass-roots donations.
When Ms. Warren earned the endorsement of the soccer star Megan Rapinoe, it came as the candidate was emerging as the only woman in the race’s top tier. In a phone call between the two, a video of which has nearly 2 million views on Ms. Rapinoe’s Twitter account, they discuss gender equity and allude to the ongoing fight for increased wages for the national women’s soccer team.
Critics say that because celebrities in music and film are overwhelmingly liberal, their endorsements create a bubble effect, in which the chattering cultural class is out of step with the electorate at large.
President Trump, who spent years as a pop culture icon himself, was mostly shunned by the Hollywood class during his 2016 run. He won anyway.
In the Democratic primary, Mr. Biden has opted for political and celebrity surrogates whose names largely reflect an earlier era, including John Kerry, the former Democratic nominee, and the Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan. He remains the primary’s front-runner.
But Mr. Sanders, in particular, continues to hold a unique cultural footprint, and the celebrity endorsements to match it. He is helped by sky-high name recognition, off the back of his insurgent presidential run in 2016. His support among young voters and progressives also plays out in the Hollywood sphere — he tweeted photos with the singer Ariana Grande, 26, and released an endorsement video with Emily Ratajkowski, 28, an actress and model.
Cardi B, 27, the Bronx-born rapper, interviewed Mr. Sanders in a video released this summer.
“Don’t you ever feel, like, scared that these people that run drug companies and schools, you know it’s all a business, and it’s like, are you scared that you will get so many powerful people upset?” she asked.
“Cardi, that’s what I’ve been doing my whole life,” Mr. Sanders replied.
In South Carolina, Mary Williams, 75, a retired educator from Sumter, said she had heard Mr. Sanders was popular with young voters. But she added that celebrities, and even black celebrities, would not be able to convince her to blindly back a particular candidate.
“Of course it’s nice to see and meet him,” Ms. Williams said of Mr. Glover. “But hey — I’m a star myself.”
