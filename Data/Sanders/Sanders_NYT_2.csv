| Jump to first hitMr. Biden was moving quickly to capitalize on his South Carolina victory and recast the Democratic primary campaign as a two-man contest between himself and Mr. Sanders.The Democratic presidential campaign took a dramatic turn on Sunday as a top candidate, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, quit the race and started clearing the way for moderate voters to coalesce around candidates better positioned to stop Senator Bernie Sanders, the liberal front-runner for the party's nomination.Mr. Buttigieg made his decision after a devastating loss in Saturday's primary in South Carolina, where a fellow moderate, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., won his first victory in the presidential race. The departure of Mr. Buttigieg could lift Mr. Biden's political fortunes heading into the major Super Tuesday primaries, but might also benefit other candidates, particularly Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who also hold appeal with swaths of Mr. Buttigieg's supporters.Even before Mr. Buttigieg's exit, Mr. Biden was moving quickly to capitalize on his victory and recast the Democratic campaign as a two-man contest between himself and Mr. Sanders. Yet there were also signs that Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren and other rivals were fighting for their own survival against Mr. Sanders on Super Tuesday, the single most important election date on the 2020 primary calendar.In a show of strength, Mr. Sanders announced on Sunday morning that he raised $46.5 million in February, by far the biggest amount of any candidate so far, giving him a huge financial war chest. Mr. Sanders is using those funds to dramatically expand his advertising in states that vote deep into March, including Florida, Michigan and Ohio. Mr. Biden is not yet on the airwaves in those states or any other that votes past Tuesday.The pressure to persevere on Super Tuesday was even more acute for other Democratic candidates as some reckoned with losses in the South Carolina primary on Saturday but were unwilling to quit a race that has been defined by unpredictability.In a blunt memo on Sunday, Ms. Warren's campaign all but admitted she no longer has a path to the nomination beyond a contested Democratic convention. Mr. Bloomberg appeared in a three-minute nationwide commercial on Sunday night, further pushing the bounds of what his billions could buy after his candidacy was undercut by his debate performances. And Senator Amy Klobuchar strained to make the case she was still a serious contender, boasting that she had been ""in the top five vote getters in these small caucuses and primaries"" in a local television interview.Ratcheting up the pressure on Democrats to unite behind a single stop-Sanders candidate, an influential donor for Mr. Biden circulated an email to his political network calling for some rivals to the former vice president to drop out. At the same time, Bloomberg campaign officials presented internal polling projections to skittish Democratic Party leaders, arguing that Mr. Bloomberg's presence in the race was actually containing Mr. Sanders's potential to run up the score on Super Tuesday.If Mr. Biden appeared suddenly ascendant on Sunday, the Super Tuesday map still favored Mr. Sanders, given his money, organization and breadth of support in key states. But the primaries on Tuesday remain highly volatile because so many Democrats are competing, each with some pockets of support in multiple states, and because Mr. Buttigieg's departure makes his supporters free agents.Polls show Mr. Biden, Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Warren are all at risk of falling short of the critical 15 percent threshold of support necessary to win delegates in various states and congressional districts on Tuesday.Mr. Buttigieg, the first openly gay major presidential candidate, drew support from different ideological wings of the Democratic Party. With him out of the race, his backers could help one or more of those other candidates rise above the 15 percent margin. Some could also support Mr. Sanders. Mr. Buttigieg spoke with Mr. Biden on Sunday and the former vice president asked him for his support. Mr. Buttigieg told aides he wanted to sleep on it.In remarks on Sunday night about his decision to leave the race, Mr. Buttigieg dropped his recent criticism of Mr. Sanders by name, but did warn against a Democratic politics that could get ""lost in ideology."" He pledged to do ""everything in my power"" to defeat President Trump this fall.Mr. Biden had been left for dead politically after three consecutive losses to open the contest, but he recovered on Saturday thanks to the overwhelming support from black voters. Mr. Biden benefited from his association with the nation's first black president, Barack Obama, and in a phone call Mr. Obama congratulated Mr. Biden on his victory in South Carolina, a person familiar with the call said.Mr. Biden predicted their big vote of confidence would help reset a race that Mr. Sanders had been threatening to run away with.The result was Mr. Biden's best day of fund-raising since his launch -- he raised $5 million on Saturday, and another $5 million on Sunday -- as he reasserted the fundamental strengths of his candidacy.""I think we're moving into constituencies that when they hear me, they've always been mine. Diverse communities, white working-class folks, African-Americans and Hispanics, women in the suburbs,"" Mr. Biden said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday.With the Super Tuesday primaries imminent, there were competing tactical imperatives on display on Sunday. Mr. Sanders -- alone among the major candidates -- skipped a commemoration of ""Bloody Sunday"" in Selma, Ala., flying instead to California for a pair of rallies in a state he leads in the polls and is worth nearly triple the delegates of all the February contests combined.Mr. Biden, meanwhile, won the endorsement of Selma Mayor Darrio Melton and was received warmly at Brown Chapel A.M.E. church, as his speech was interrupted by a stream of affirmations as he denounced white supremacy. ""Say it, Biden!"" someone cried out.Despite Mr. Biden's decisive, nearly 30-point win in South Carolina, it was not clear how much his win would alter the hardening contours of the race. Millions of votes have already been cast in Super Tuesday states, particularly in California, and Mr. Biden has been dramatically outgunned on the airwaves and out-organized on the ground there. In February, Mr. Biden's $18 million fund-raising total, announced on Sunday, amounted to less than 40 cents for every dollar that Mr. Sanders collected.And in the last week, Mr. Biden essentially bunkered down in South Carolina to achieve his campaign-saving victory, while Mr. Sanders has been building up his operation, airing ads and making inroads across the country.""They invested everything they had in South Carolina at the cost of everything else because they knew it was the only path forward,"" Patti Solis Doyle, a Democratic strategist and former campaign manager for Hillary Clinton in 2008, said of the Biden operation. ""It leaves them with incredible momentum, new energy but still lacking the resources and bodies to execute.""What limited resources Mr. Biden has deployed in Super Tuesday states have been focused buying ads on shows and stations that draw an outsized African-American viewership, according to a campaign official. His campaign has previously announced a $2.2 million ad buy across eight states; the same Biden campaign official said they planned to use much of the new infusion of money to make investments in March 10 and March 17 states.For now, Mr. Sanders has outspent Mr. Biden in Super Tuesday radio and television advertising by a margin of more than seven-to-one, according to the media-tracking firm Advertising Analytics; Mr. Bloomberg is outpacing Mr. Biden by closer to a 100-to-one margin.Ari Rabin-Havt, a deputy campaign manager on the Sanders campaign, urged caution about over-interpreting the results from South Carolina and its impact. ""Wait until you see what happens in other states,"" he said. ""I think taking one state and transmuting one state's population to every state in the country is a mistake.""Two other main candidates in the race -- Ms. Warren and Ms. Klobuchar -- pressed to justify the rationales for their continued candidacies in memos, media appearances and appeals to the arcana of delegate math on Sunday, predicting a contest that would not be resolved until the convention this summer.The Warren campaign memo about the post-Super Tuesday landscape was the most plain-spoken. ""The reality of this race will be clear: no candidate will likely have a path to the majority of delegates needed to win an outright claim to the Democratic nomination,"" wrote Roger Lau, Ms. Warren's campaign manager.The Warren campaign, he argued, was positioned to ""ultimately prevail at the national convention in Milwaukee.""An online gusher of donations has allowed those whose fund-raising might otherwise have dried up in past cycles to linger deeper into 2020.Ms. Warren was on track to be the No. 2 fund-raiser in February, raising $29.3 million, despite never finishing better than third in any of the February contests. Ms. Klobuchar had hoped her surprise third-place finish in New Hampshire would propel her forward but while her momentum has long since evaporated, the money she raised provided a financial lifeline. She is now digging in to defend her home state of Minnesota on Tuesday.Even Mr. Buttigieg had raised money steadily until the end, with an online counter on his website showing him more than $9 million toward his $13 million Super Tuesday goal when he dropped out.It is not just Mr. Buttigieg's supporters who are now up for grabs but the enviable network of big-dollar bundlers who helped him raise more than $82 million last year.After his appearance in Selma, Mr. Biden headed to Virginia to rally supporters with two of his recent, big-name Democratic backers, Senator Tim Kaine, who had been Hillary Clinton's vice-presidential pick four years ago, and former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, also a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee chairman.The event was an establishment show-of-force that came after two other Virginia members of Congress, Representatives Bobby Scott and Jennifer Wexton, also endorsed him over the weekend, along with the former D.N.C. chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz.Mr. Bloomberg readied for his first test in Tuesday's primaries after skipping the four early contests. He paid for a three-minute address to the nation on Sunday evening about the spreading coronavirus. Ms. Warren accused him of trying to ""pretend he's the president.""Bloomberg advisers have grown frustrated with Ms. Warren's repeated attacks, including in her commercials, and recently produced an ad hitting Ms. Warren for her reversal on super PACs, going from denouncing super PAC money to benefiting from the biggest super PAC ad buy in the race. Aides presented a plan to spend twice as much on the anti-Warren ad as Ms. Warren has spent on her anti-Bloomberg spots.""Mike said no,"" said Jason Schechter, a Bloomberg spokesman. ""He wanted to stay positive."" (Mr. Bloomberg is running negative ads on Mr. Sanders but entirely online and not on television.)For Mr. Biden's supporters, the results in South Carolina and the departure of Mr. Buttigieg added fuel to their efforts to prune the field in hopes of setting up Mr. Biden as the single alternative to Mr. Sanders.""The Democratic Party needs to come together behind Joe and make this a two person race,"" Jon Henes, who was Senator Kamala Harris's finance chair and now supports Mr. Biden, wrote to friends and other donors before Mr. Buttigieg quit the race, according to a person who reviewed the email.He went on to add, ""Suspending a campaign is incredibly difficult for any candidate but right now we need our candidates to be realistic.""A pro-Biden super PAC, Unite the Country, was even more to the point, accusing Mr. Bloomberg's $500 million in advertising of amounting to ""the Bernie Sanders super PAC.""""His entire argument for existence was Joe Biden stumbling -- and after four states, Joe Biden has received more votes than anyone,"" said the memo. ""Mayor Bloomberg should decide soon if he wants to be the reason why Bernie Sanders is the nominee of the party.""Shane Goldmacher reported from New York and Reid J.

| Jump to first hitThe move was a peace offering to the intelligence agencies the new director oversees, and the election security official, Shelby Pierson, sought to reassure Americans that the vote remains secure.WASHINGTON -- The new acting director of national intelligence, Richard Grenell, has asked an intelligence official who angered some lawmakers with a briefing about Russian interference in the 2020 election to stay on in her role.Mr. Grenell's move is a peace offering to the 17 intelligence agencies he oversees and a potential sign that he will not be conducting a widespread purge, as some administration officials have feared. Mr. Grenell, a Trump loyalist who has little experience in intelligence, removed the No. 2 official in his office in his first day on the job last week.Whether Mr. Grenell, appointed to the post last week by President Trump, can win over members of Congress and the intelligence community will depend in part whether he can convince them that he will focus on protecting the elections from outside interference.Some administration officials feared that the official who briefed the lawmakers, Shelby Pierson, would be removed as well. As the intelligence community's top election security official since last year, she was subjected to withering criticism after her briefing to a classified hearing of the House Intelligence Committee on Feb. 13 touched off a fierce partisan debate over the nature of Russia's interference in the 2020 election.The briefing angered Mr. Trump, who was given a partial account of it the next day. It is unclear exactly what Mr. Trump was told, but five people in the briefing said Ms. Pierson relayed to them that Russia was intervening in the election, and that Moscow preferred Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump is highly sensitive to the view that Russian interference in the 2016 campaign helped him win the election and was upset that the issue had come up again.Ms. Pierson, in a brief interview on Tuesday, would not address the substance of her briefing, noting that it was classified, and said only that she would keep her job. Ms. Pierson has discussed election security with Mr. Grenell several times since he was appointed last week.""Ambassador Grenell has not asked me to leave,"" Ms. Pierson said in the interview. ""In fact, he has encouraged and affirmed his support for my position here in the organization. I have not asked to depart nor discussed resignation in any way.""Some intelligence officials worry that the disclosures about Russian interference have in essence done President Vladimir V. Putin's work for him, needlessly undercutting confidence in the 2020 vote.Administration officials have been trying to reassure the public that despite any operations underway to influence the thinking of Americans, no foreign power has so far this year affected the voting infrastructure.Those systems remain secure, and Americans should feel confident as they go to the polls in the weeks to come, Ms. Pierson said Tuesday.""We have yet to identify any activity designed to prevent voting or change votes,"" Ms. Pierson said. ""It is important for us to restate that at every juncture.""Her comments were meant to echo the claims senior administration officials have been making for days, even before Mr. Grenell took charge, including in an op-ed by administration officials in USA Today.While intelligence officials have not detected any effort by Russia to hack into election systems to alter votes, interfere with vote counts or block people from casting a ballot, they have consistently said there are efforts to influence the thinking -- and potentially the voting behavior -- of Americans.Ms. Pierson's job security comes after nearly two weeks of turmoil that grew out of her Feb. 13 briefing.The next day Mr. Trump confronted Joseph Maguire, the previous acting director of national intelligence. A few days later, the White House decided to replace Mr. Maguire with Mr. Grenell, sowing worry in Washington that Mr. Trump would politicize the intelligence agencies.The briefing caused an immediate fury among Republicans and has become a deeply politicized topic. Mr. Trump called the Russian intervention a hoax. His national security adviser, Robert C. O'Brien, has said he has not seen any intelligence that suggested the Russians are intervening on behalf of Mr. Trump, but suggested that Russia wanted to see Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont win the Democratic nomination.Mr. Sanders said last week that he had been given a briefing about Russian attempts to intervene in the campaign. Some intelligence officials believe the Russians may be working to favor Mr. Sanders in an effort to help Mr. Trump win the election, on the theory that Moscow believes Mr. Sanders might be a weak candidate against the president.The appointment of Mr. Grenell was greeted with anxiety by many current and former intelligence officials, who feared he would engage in multiple firings, especially after the acting deputy director was pushed out.But officials said that in his first days, Mr. Grenell has gone out of his way to reassure officials at his intelligence headquarters.Dan Coats, the former director of national intelligence, appointed Ms. Pierson last year as the election security coordinator in an effort to help intelligence agencies work better together and more quickly provide information on foreign threats to the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security.""The priority and focus of the intelligence community on election security is unwavering and unchanged,"" Ms. Pierson said.PhotographA move by Richard Grenell, the acting director of intelligence, is seen as a peace offering to the 17 intelligence agencies he oversees and could be a sign he will not be conducting a widespread purge.

| Jump to first hitA first wave of results showed Pete Buttigieg and Bernie Sanders with an early lead, with Joseph R. Biden Jr. well behind.DES MOINES -- Democratic officials in Iowa on Tuesday provided a measure of clarity to the muddled outcome of its statewide caucuses, releasing a delayed first wave of partial results that showed Pete Buttigieg and Senator Bernie Sanders with a preliminary lead and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. falling well behind the other top-tier candidates.The release of the partial data, which accounted for 71 percent of caucus precincts, came after a night and day of suspense, confusion and silence from the Iowa Democratic Party after major problems with its new results reporting system. Even as the party began preparing to release the partial results on Tuesday afternoon, it drew sharp criticism from several campaigns that wanted a complete result, either to have a definitive outcome or frame their Iowa performance in the best possible light.While the results of Monday night's caucuses could change with more data, the highly competitive race between Mr. Buttigieg, a moderate, and Mr. Sanders, a liberal, reflected the divisions among Democrats about the ideological direction of the party, and sets up a crucial test for both wings of the party in the New Hampshire primary, on Feb. 11, where Mr. Sanders leads in the polls.The partial Iowa results also showed Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in third place, with Mr. Biden trailing her by several points and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota behind him.Yet there was little evidence in the data released Tuesday that any candidate was on the way to the kind of dominant victory that would have a good chance of transforming the Democratic race. No one appeared on track to receive more than about a quarter of the vote, and five held support in the double digits -- a further indication that the Iowa caucuses were unlikely to play a decisive role in deciding the Democratic nominee. Several other candidates, including Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer, registered about 1 percent support or less.In Iowa, the candidates' support is measured chiefly in the number of state-level delegates that each amasses, which in turn determines how many delegates they can collect for the Democratic nominating convention next summer. The state party is in the process of releasing popular vote totals as well, though their significance can be diluted in the arcane, multistage caucus process.In a sign of how uncertain the final outcome remained, Mr. Sanders held a lead over Mr. Buttigieg in the popular vote but trailed him narrowly in the state delegate count, with nearly three quarters of the totals reported. The precinct data was released in two batches, most of it in the late afternoon and then a smaller installment at night, and the state party said it came from across all 99 counties.It was not immediately clear whether the initial tranche of caucus returns were reflective of the overall dynamics in the state, nor did the state party indicate when the complete results would be available. Several campaigns, including that of Mr. Biden, expressed frustration to state officials earlier on Tuesday with the idea of publicizing a partial data set, amid widespread confusion about the breakdown in reporting the results.But under pressure to salvage the caucuses from a humiliating logistical debacle, Iowa Democratic leaders decided to go ahead with releasing numbers from a majority of precincts without waiting for the counting process to be completed.The halting and hectic process in Iowa was an unsightly spectacle for the Democratic Party at the start of its presidential nominating process, offering President Trump an easy target for gloating and ridicule and raising serious questions about whether Iowa would be allowed to retain its first-in-the-nation status in future elections.Troy Price, the chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party, appeared downcast on Tuesday as he described the process as ""unacceptable"" in remarks to reporters. ""As chair of the party, I apologize deeply for this,"" he said.Mr. Price repeatedly stressed that the data was accurate and said the security of the returns was his ""paramount concern.""The returns posted on Tuesday largely mirrored the scenario that the leading presidential campaigns detected during the caucuses, gathering precinct-level information on their own and in some cases releasing it to the media to make up for the void of hard results.Should the rest of the Iowa results mostly mirror the data published on Tuesday, it could represent a significant embarrassment for Mr. Biden, who entered the race as a front-runner last spring but has struggled mightily in recent months to compete with fresher-faced and more liberal rivals in both Iowa and New Hampshire. For a period in January, his campaign had grown hopeful that he had a chance of winning Iowa and establishing early dominance, but by caucus night that seemed a remote prospect.Mr. Biden is aiming to retake control of the race later in February, when the competition moves to Nevada and South Carolina, two far more diverse states long seen as friendly to his candidacy. But first he may have to explain his Iowa slump to the political donors whose support he needs to compete in the larger primary states that vote at the beginning of March.Mr. Biden's campaign has said it expected to accrue delegates in Iowa and was bracing for an extended contest.Yet if Mr. Biden's dismal standing appeared clear enough, the actual identity of the Iowa winner remained a question mark.Both Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, and Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., have tried to claim an overall victory in the state, and they were too closely matched in the initial returns to declare a single winner. But in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Mr. Buttigieg brandished the available data to once again declare something like victory, and his supporters were encouraged to see his slim edge over Mr. Sanders in state delegates hold up as another installment of results came through close to midnight on the East Coast.""They're not complete, but results are in from a majority of precincts and they show our campaign in first place,"" Mr. Buttigieg said.The strength displayed so far by Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg underscored just how fluid the Democratic race remains, with a 78-year-old democratic socialist who ran for president four years ago deadlocked in Iowa with a 38-year-old former municipal official who was largely unknown a year ago -- and both of them substantially ahead of a former two-term vice president.The result also underscored the divisions on the moderate side of the Democratic Party, with three candidates closer to the political center -- Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. Biden and Ms. Klobuchar -- collecting a majority of delegate votes so far, but a candidate of the left, Mr. Sanders, still in a position to prevail because of the strength of his progressive base.The chaos surrounding the caucus process may limit the impact of the Iowa outcome: It is already apparent that, in a departure from past presidential campaigns, no candidate intends to drop out as a result of a disappointing finish in Iowa. Several candidates, including Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren, emphasized on the night of the caucuses that the nomination would be decided over a long process.And by late afternoon on Tuesday, every major candidate -- and a number of lower-profile competitors -- had already moved on to New Hampshire, the next state in line, which holds a primary on Feb. 11.Arriving there on Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Sanders struck a balance between lamenting the procedural breakdowns in Iowa and defending the ultimate significance of the vote there. He eagerly held up his advantage in the popular vote as proof of his strength in the race, also acknowledging the caucuses were ""not a good night for democracy.""""I think we should all be disappointed in the inability of the party to come up with timely results,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""But we are not casting aspersions on the votes that are being counted.""Ms. Warren, also campaigning in New Hampshire, said Iowa had to ""get it together"" and criticized the decision to publish fragmentary results.""I just don't understand what that means to release half of the data,"" Ms. Warren said in Keene. ""So, I think they ought to get it together and release all of the data.""In Iowa, Mr. Price declined to lay out a timeline for completing the tabulation and releasing the results.On a midday conference call and in other private conversations with Iowa party leaders, representatives for Mr. Sanders, Mr. Buttigieg, Ms. Warren and Ms. Klobuchar urged local officials to provide the most complete set of results possible, and several campaign emissaries pushed for access to the paper trail that the party was using to verify returns from the caucuses.Mr. Biden's campaign took a more combative approach, repeatedly questioning -- in public and private -- the integrity of the caucuses and objecting to the party's plans for releasing the results.""If you put out 50 percent of results, people are going to take that as final,"" Jesse Harris, a Biden adviser in Iowa, said on the conference call with the party. ""That's only half. That's not the total picture of what happened yesterday.""In an uncharacteristic reversal of roles, it was Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, who spoke up to defend the Iowa Democratic Party against criticism from the Biden camp on the conference call. Four years ago, it was the Sanders camp that raised alarm about the reliability of Iowa's opaque results, in a clash that yielded a more complex set of data-reporting requirements that appear to have snarled the state party this time around.But Mr. Weaver suggested that those raising the sharpest objections this time had ulterior motives.""I do want to urge people in the interest of not discrediting the party,"" he said, ""that folks who are just trying to delay the return of this because of their relative positioning in the results, last night, I think that's a bit disingenuous.""Caucuses are largely a relic of the past, and Democratic Party rules prodded all but a few states to switch this year to holding straightforward primary elections. Democratic leaders in two states that still use the caucus system, Nevada and North Dakota, made statements on Tuesday distancing themselves from the fiasco in Iowa.""I am 100% confident that what happened in Iowa will not happen in Nevada,"" Harry Reid, the former Senate Democratic leader from Nevada, said on Twitter.Sydney Ember contributed reporting from Des Moines, Astead Herndon from Keene, N.H., and Matt Stevens from Laconia, N.H.PhotographA field office in Des Moines on Tuesday, a day after the caucuses.

| Jump to first hitThe president described the intelligence finding that Russia was meddling in the 2020 election, delivered last week to House lawmakers, as a partisan ""misinformation campaign.""LAS VEGAS -- President Trump said Friday that the disclosure by American intelligence officials that Russia was again meddling in a presidential election in his favor was merely another partisan attack against him, continuing a pattern in which he has sought to dismiss warnings of foreign interference in American elections.""Another misinformation campaign is being launched by Democrats in Congress saying that Russia prefers me to any of the Do Nothing Democrat candidates who still have been unable to, after two weeks, count their votes in Iowa,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Hoax number 7!""He was responding to reports of a classified briefing in which intelligence officials told members of the House Intelligence Committee that Russia was interfering in the 2020 presidential campaign to aid his re-election. Republicans on the committee challenged the conclusions and Mr. Trump berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing the briefing to happen.Intelligence officials have also concluded that the Russians are seeking to help Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic presidential primaries.At an afternoon campaign rally in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump continued with his accusations that Democrats were behind the reports and said they were trying to ""poison our democracy"" and were circulating ""vile"" hoaxes.""I was told a week ago,"" the president said. ""They said, 'You know they're trying to start a rumor.' It's disinformation. That's the only thing they're good at. They're not good at anything else. They get nothing done. Do nothing Democrats.""During the final event of a four-day swing through the West, Mr. Trump suggested that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia would prefer Mr. Sanders. Mr. Trump claimed, inaccurately, that Mr. Sanders ""honeymooned in Moscow."" And while Mr. Sanders did visit Yaroslavl in the Soviet Union in 1988 a day after his wedding, the trip was made to work out a sister-city relationship between Yaroslavl and Burlington, Vt., where Mr. Sanders was mayor at the time. In his 1997 autobiography, Mr. Sanders described the trip as a ""very strange honeymoon,"" but he and his wife went on a more traditional honeymoon a year later in St. Lucia, in the Caribbean.Mr. Trump, who has been cheerful in public and private about his re-election prospects, used the trip to raise millions from high-dollar donors and charm his political base at rallies in three states. And by returning every night to Las Vegas and holding his final rally there, he also tried to divert attention from Saturday's Democratic caucuses in Nevada.The president has visited every state that has held a primary or caucus so far this year, making trolling Democratic candidates a cornerstone of his campaign strategy.At his rally on Friday, the president called up members of the 1980 ""Miracle on Ice"" men's hockey team to take the stage behind him and waxed at length about his reality show ""The Apprentice.""""Speaking also of reality television: This is the greatest show of all time, huh?"" the president said. ""I have to get back to Washington and work. I feel guilty. This is too much fun.""Mr. Trump spoke for nearly two hours and fired the crowd up with a litany of claims about his accomplishments during his first three years in office, many of them exaggerated or misleading.During an extended discussion about the dangers of illegal immigration, Mr. Trump noted that ""illegal crossings are down 75 percent from last spring."" He did not mention that the decrease followed a huge surge in border apprehensions on his watch, leaving the number about where it was when he took office.Aside from appearing unbound and ebullient on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump also used the trip as an opportunity to take on some favorite targets, casting doubt on assorted institutions at every turn.He voiced his suspicions about Saturday's Nevada caucuses, comparing it to the disastrous ones held in Iowa earlier this month.""I hear their computers are all messed up just like they were in Iowa,"" he said.The president described members of the media as ""the most dishonest human beings in the world"" and accused law enforcement of harboring ""dirty cops.""He also repeatedly joked with the crowd that he would stay president longer than two terms, a comment he has made at other events.Mr. Trump has a long history of dismissing the assessments made by intelligence agencies that he has deemed unfair or unflattering.Multiple agencies have determined that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, and, before the 2018 midterms, delivered warnings that Russia was prepared to do it again. Early in his presidency, Mr. Trump grudgingly accepted those assessments before falling back on personal assurances from Mr. Putin.""He said he didn't meddle,"" Mr. Trump said in November 2017. ""I asked him again. You can only ask so many times. Every time he sees me, he says, 'I didn't do that.' And I believe, I really believe, that when he tells me that, he means it.""Since then, Mr. Trump, with the assistance of his Justice Department, has moved to retaliate against the intelligence community rather than Mr. Putin. A federal prosecutor is scrutinizing how intelligence officials assessed Russia's 2016 election interference, targeting the former C.I.A. director John O. Brennan in particular.Mr. Trump's anger at the intelligence assessment delivered on Feb. 13 to lawmakers was magnified by the presence at the briefing of Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, who is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee and played a lead role in the impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump.The president's decision to remove Mr. Maguire and install Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and a fervent loyalist, was also seen as a direct outcome of the briefing.On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, an ally and a vocal opponent of impeachment, was one of the candidates under consideration as a permanent successor. By Friday morning, Mr. Collins said he was not interested.""This is not a job that interests me; at this time, it's not one that I would accept because I'm running a Senate race down here in Georgia,"" Mr. Collins said in an interview on Fox News. Mr. Trump then wrote on Twitter that he had a list of four candidates to succeed Mr. Grenell, and that he would make his decision in the coming weeks.Michael D. Shear and Linda Qiu contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographPresident Trump brushed off an intelligence finding about Russian election interference as a partisan attack against him.

| Jump to first hitThe Democratic candidates are all debating a singular issue. New polls offer insights, not answers.Hi. Welcome to On Politics , your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Giovanni Russonello, your morning newsletter writer taking over your afternoon edition.Sign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.At Wednesday night's Democratic presidential debate, the candidates bickered and battled over health care policy; over Michael Bloomberg's record and his right to represent a party that he only recently rejoined; over the possible dangers of nominating a democratic socialist.But in a way, it all seemed like just window dressing around one big question: Who has the best chance in November? Every policy critique seemed to lead inexorably back to this issue of electability.In his very first comments at the debate, Mr. Bloomberg didn't just criticize Senator Bernie Sanders's plan to create a single-payer health care system -- he said it would cause Democrats to lose the general election.""I don't think there's any chance of the senator beating President Trump,"" Mr. Bloomberg said. ""You don't start out by saying I've got 160 million people, I'm going to take away the insurance plan that they love.""Mr. Sanders shot back, arguing that Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, was ""a billionaire saying that we should not raise the minimum wage or that we should cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.""""If that's a way to beat Donald Trump, wow, I would be very surprised,"" Mr. Sanders said.A wide majority of Democratic primary voters have said in poll after poll that they care about finding someone who can win the general election more than finding a candidate who agrees with them on the issues.But who is that candidate? It's far from clear.Until recently, Democratic voters tended to see former Vice President Joe Biden as the strongest option. But after he failed to place in the top three in either Iowa or New Hampshire, he lost any veneer of invincibility. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday showed that for the first time in the race, Democrats are most likely to name Mr. Sanders as the candidate with the best chance to beat Mr. Trump.Meanwhile, Mr. Trump's approval rating has risen, most likely lifted by the strength of the economy and his acquittal in the Senate's impeachment trial. His Gallup approval rating hit 49 percent this month -- the highest number of his presidency. So while a majority of Americans still disapprove of him, he has the potential to win at least as much support as he did in 2016, when he lost the popular vote but pulled off a decisive win in the Electoral College.The ABC/Washington Post poll showed that in head-to-head matchups with all six of the candidates onstage at the debate, Mr. Trump would earn between 45 and 47 percent of the vote nationwide. The Democrats' shares varied from 49 to 52 percent. The differences between each Democrat were all within the poll's margin of error.This suggests that, despite Mr. Sanders's claim that a ""political revolution"" would be needed to drive turnout, and in spite of his more moderate rivals' argument that his left-wing proposals would alienate a huge swath of voters, any Democratic nominee would probably have a good chance of winning the popular vote.But Republicans have won the Electoral College three times this century, even though they have won the popular vote only once. So what really matters is who can beat Mr. Trump in a handful of key swing states.That's why Quinnipiac University asked voters in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- three states that Mr. Trump narrowly flipped in 2016, giving him an Electoral College win -- to choose between the president and each of the six leading Democratic candidates.The data from those polls suggests that Mr. Trump is in a very strong position to win Wisconsin, a heavily white state that was once solidly blue but has trended conservative over the past 10 years. None of the six leading Democratic candidates finished ahead of Mr. Trump there.Conversely, in Michigan and Pennsylvania, he didn't have a lead against any of them. Mr. Biden beat Mr. Trump by eight percentage points in Pennsylvania -- where he was born -- and by four points in Michigan. Mr. Sanders was up by five points against the president in Michigan, and by four points in Pennsylvania. Mr. Bloomberg led Mr. Trump by six points in Pennsylvania, and by five points in Michigan.The other three candidates included in the poll -- Senator Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg and Senator Elizabeth Warren -- generally fared a little less strongly, though Ms. Klobuchar had a strong, seven-point lead over Mr. Trump in Pennsylvania, and none of them were behind him there or in Michigan.A University of North Florida poll released this week found meaningful differences between the candidates' chances in that state. Mr. Bloomberg beat Mr. Trump by six points among registered Florida voters, thanks in part to the strength of his support among voters with college degrees, according to the poll. Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, both hobbled by relatively weak support from black and Latino voters, each finished four points behind the president.Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden both ran neck-and-neck with Mr. Trump.Like all surveys, head-to-head polls are not actually able to predict the future. They simply show what might happen if the election were held today. A lot will change over the course of the campaign.Still, what happens in these bellwether states will determine the election -- so you can expect these kinds of head-to-head polls to be more common as the primary season rambles on, and as Democrats continue to fret over their chances to take down Mr. Trump.Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We'll try to answer it. Have a comment? We're all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com .From Opinion: The trickiness of electabilityIn this new weekly feature, our colleagues from The New York Times's Opinion section will share expert analysis and perspectives from across the political spectrum. In today's installment, there's more to read about why electability is so unpredictable.There is a home base that all the conversation about the Democratic presidential primary comes back to in the end: Primary voters prioritize, above all, someone who can defeat President Trump.In any election that features an incumbent president, the main goal of the out-of-power party is to nominate a candidate well-suited to defeating the incumbent. That's why both Republican Party elites and less enthusiastic conservative voters got behind Mitt Romney after a series of polls in 2011 showed he was the only Republican beating President Barack Obama in head-to-head matchups.This year, Democrats' desire to replace the incumbent has reached a fever pitch, arguably higher than it's ever been for either party. But paradigm-shifting presidents have complicated the idea of electability, as Adam Jentleson, a former deputy chief of staff for Senator Harry Reid, pointed out this week in an Op-Ed.Mr. Obama won his first election despite being a ""black man who had admitted to using cocaine, who was caught on tape calling working-class whites 'bitter' people who 'cling to guns and religion,' and who sat in the pews with a pastor who declared, 'God damn America',"" Mr. Jentleson said.Mr. Romney, the Republicans' supposed safe bet, lost despite running against the sluggish economy under Mr. Obama.And Hillary Clinton, another supposed safe bet, lost to Donald J. Trump.So does anyone know what electability even means anymore? Our columnist Bret Stephens believes that ""of course Bernie can win,"" but also thinks that the current front-runner's democratic socialist vision may be disqualifying for many voters: ""For some of us, none-of-the-above is a viable option. For far too many others,"" he writes, Trump will ""be the devil they know.""-- Talmon Joseph SmithThanks for reading.

| Jump to first hitErrors in the results have led The Times and others to refrain from calling the race, and the Sanders campaign manager said a partial recanvass of precincts could change the outcome.DES MOINES -- Nearly a full week after the Iowa caucuses, the state Democratic Party on Sunday released results indicating that Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., was the winner after it updated data from 55 precincts. But errors in the result tabulations have led several news organizations, including The New York Times, to refrain from calling the race.And shortly after the party's announcement, Senator Bernie Sanders's campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said the campaign would be calling for a partial recanvass of the results. The deadline for a campaign to make such a request is noon Central time on Monday.The party's re-examination did not change earlier projections that Mr. Buttigieg led in the count of national delegates, but it moved one more into his column. The party said that Mr. Buttigieg had received 14 delegates, Senator Bernie Sanders took 12, Senator Elizabeth Warren earned eight, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. received six and Senator Amy Klobuchar got one.The Associated Press, which historically verifies election results and makes calls on the outcome of races, has not allotted the final delegate to Mr. Buttigieg because of the errors in the caucus results-counting, nor has The A.P. declared a winner in the Iowa race. The Times, which has followed The A.P.'s calls in the past, has not assigned the final delegate to Mr. Buttigieg.In an interview with CNN, Mr. Shakir expressed confidence that Mr. Sanders would have the same number of national delegates as Mr. Buttigieg ""after it's all said and done,"" suggesting that the Sanders campaign believed a recanvass could result in a delegate being reassigned from Mr. Buttigieg to Mr. Sanders.A Sanders aide confirmed that the campaign would be seeking a partial recanvass of results. The Iowa Democratic Party did not immediately respond to a request for comment.In recent days Mr. Buttigieg has claimed to have won Iowa because he leads the delegate count by a thin margin, while Mr. Sanders claimed victory because he had the most total supporters in both rounds of voting on caucus night. A tally of another metric, ""state delegate equivalents,"" showed an even tighter race: By the party's count, Mr. Buttigieg earned 564.302 and Mr. Sanders had 561.528 -- a difference of one-tenth of one percent of the total awarded.The party's re-examination of the results -- after it failed to report results on Monday night, throwing the Democrats' nominating race into an uproar -- is unlikely to assure the candidates and voters. Internal Iowa Democratic Party emails over the weekend revealed that although the party was taking a second look at some problematic precincts, close to 5 percent of the total, it would not fix errors that occurred on the official handwritten tally sheets from precincts.Those records are known as ""caucus math worksheets."" The party only corrected discrepancies between the data as recorded on the worksheets and what was officially reported in public releases of the results.The party could not change even blatant miscalculations on the worksheets, according to a lawyer for the party, because they were a legal record and altering them would be a crime.""The incorrect math on the Caucus Math Worksheets must not be changed to ensure the integrity of the process,"" wrote the party lawyer, Shayla McCormally, according to an email sent by Troy Price, the chairman of the party, to its central committee members. The lawyer said correcting the math would introduce ""personal opinion"" into the official record of results.Thanks to greater transparency in reporting the caucus results this year, outsiders were able to identify internal inconsistencies. The New York Times reported last week that some precincts, for example, had awarded more delegates to candidates than they were allotted.In addition, caucus ""captains"" for individual candidates photographed the worksheets in their precincts and shared them internally with their campaigns. Those photographs provided further examples of problems. The most blatant were errors in adding up votes for candidates, which take place in two rounds, and miscalculations when using a formula that translates raw votes to ""state delegate equivalents.""But because the caucus chair and secretary of each precinct had certified the results on the worksheets, along with representatives of candidates, the documents could not be readjusted without violating election law, the state party lawyer said.""It is the legal voting record of the caucus, like a ballot,"" Ms. McCormally wrote in her opinion. ""The seriousness of the record is made clear by the language at the bottom stating that any misrepresentation of the information is a crime. Therefore, any changes or tampering with the sheet could result in a claim of election interference or misconduct.""""The I.D.P.'s role is to facilitate the caucus and tabulate the results,"" Ms. McCormally continued. ""Any judgment of math miscalculations would insert personal opinion into the process by individuals not at the caucus and could change the agreed upon results. That action would be interfering with the caucus' expression of their preferences. There are various reasons that the worksheets have errors and may appear to not be accurate, however changing the math would change the information agreed upon and certified by the caucusgoers.""Mr. Sanders said in an interview with CNN on Sunday that the Iowa contest had been ""an embarrassment"" and ""a disgrace.""""They screwed it up badly, is what the Iowa Democratic Party did,"" Mr. Sanders said.In response to pressure by candidates and the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Tom Perez, the Iowa state party permitted campaigns to flag precincts that had problems. On Saturday, it said 95 had been identified by three campaigns, those of Mr. Sanders, Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren. Only 55 required updating, it said.The party had notified campaigns that it would re-examine reported results if presented with ""documentary evidence"" of ""inconsistencies"" between the data on the worksheets and the reported results. ""The inconsistencies must show a discrepancy between the Caucus Math Worksheet and the publicly reported results,"" the party told campaigns.In the party lawyer's opinion, the only recourse a campaign has if it wants to challenge the worksheets themselves is to seek a recount, which would require examining ""presidential preference cards"" filled out by everyone who attended the caucuses. These cards were collected at the end of the evening, and were included in a packet that was sent to state party headquarters by the caucus chairs.But even a full recount may not be definitive. Several caucus chairs said in interviews that not all caucusgoers had turned in their preference cards. They left into the Iowa evening after performing a proud civic duty, with no hint of the mess to come.Sydney Ember and Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting from Manchester, N.H.PhotographPete Buttigieg greets attendees during a town hall event at Salem High School in Salem, N.H.

| Jump to first hitDean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, reflects on the coverage of that campaign and how it has shaped the coverage of this election season.Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.The media's coverage of the 2016 campaign -- how news outlets including The New York Times covered the surprising rise of Donald Trump, as well as the battle between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination -- has been debated extensively since that election.Recently, Michael Barbaro, host of ""The Daily"" podcast, sat down with Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, to reflect on that campaign and how it has shaped The Times's approach in covering this election season. Below are some of Mr. Baquet's thoughts from that conversation. His comments have been condensed and edited for clarity.On the effort to understand voters in 2016:I think that the combination of post-economic crisis, and a sense that there are parts of America that were still shaken by the economic crisis, I think a lot of Americans -- more Americans than we understood at the time -- were rattled and were looking for something dramatic. And that desire for something dramatic was reflected in the rise of Bernie Sanders, and it was certainly reflected in the rise of Donald Trump. And I don't think we -- I don't think anybody quite got it.There were [Times] reporters out in the country who were writing stories about what was going on in the country. But we didn't elevate them and say, ""Wait a minute, there's something powerful going on here."" We didn't see that.On changes to The Times's coverage in 2020:It's a little narcissistic for my taste to spend forever beating ourselves up over it. Some things you can anticipate, but there are 300 million Americans. Some things you can't anticipate. While we should change our rules to understand it, to keep from missing a story like that in the future, I don't think we should go into it with the assumption that all of our rules are wrong.We've done a whole series of stories from out in the country. We've brought in people from the Business staff to go out to the country to talk about the effects of the economy. We are about to announce a plan to put writers in seven or eight states that we're usually not in. We have added to our regular political staff a religion writer, because I think that religion, and to be frank, abortion, are currents that I don't think we quite had a handle on. And we give huge play now to stories about anxiety in the country. I think if you read The New York Times right now, you read a New York Times that reflects a country that's in some turmoil, a country that's divided much more than we understood in 2016. We have doubled the number of people who cover the internet.And I don't think we've labeled any -- the campaigns would disagree -- but I don't think we've made anybody feel like the inevitable candidate. Or the long shot. I am extremely proud of where our coverage is right now.On whether he sees a danger of overcorrecting and overrepresenting the perspective of Trump voters.I don't. Not as long as you write about the other perspective. One of the greatest puzzles of 2016 remains a great puzzle. Why did millions and millions of Americans vote for a guy who's such an unusual candidate? People roll their eyes and say, ""Why are you going to talk to those people?"" Because understanding how those people voted and how they will vote in the future is a big and important thing.On criticisms of engaging in ""bothsidesism"" -- representing both sides of a debate as equal:I think that we're at a moment where people very much want us to take sides. And I don't think that's the right stance for The New York Times.I do think that American journalism has a tendency to go for the easy version of what I call ""sophisticated true objectivity."" And the easy version is: ""OK, this guy said this. This guy said that. I'll put them together. You decide."" That's not what I mean when I say ""sophisticated true objectivity"" as a goal.True objectivity is you listen, you're empathetic. If you hear stuff you disagree with, but it's factual and it's worth people hearing, you write about it. Does The New York Times and every news organization, in producing tons of stories on deadline, fall into ""on the one hand, on the other hand?"" Absolutely. Because when you cover a trial and when you cover some kinds of stories, that's an OK formula. It's not the best formula for covering Donald Trump and the impeachment trial.I think of the reader who just wants to pick up his paper in the morning and know what the hell happened. I'm beholden to that reader, and I feel obligated to tell that reader what happened.Follow the @ReaderCenter on Twitter for more coverage highlighting your perspectives and experiences and for insight into how we work.PhotographUnder the executive editor Dean Baquet, The Times has widened its political coverage recently.

But not for the reason you might think.Sure, Ms. Klobuchar is running a vigorous campaign in the state. Stuck in the Senate for the impeachment trial most of the week, she flew back for a hastily scheduled event in Council Bluffs on Tuesday night. Her daughter, Abigail Bessler, has been traveling across Iowa in her stead, wooing voters with Ms. Klobuchar's family hot dish recipe.But in poll after poll, Ms. Klobuchar still hasn't hit the 15 percent threshold needed to win delegates. Her standing hints that her supporters could be up for grabs on the second ballot in many precincts. And four days before the caucuses, rival camps are already coming courting, trying to increase their margins by scooping up some of her caucusgoers.Call it the second-place shuffle.""Second choice matters,"" said Norm Sterzenbach, a caucus adviser to Ms. Klobuchar. ""You have to be careful in how you talk about not only your own candidacy and your strengths but the strengths of the other candidates as well.""Already, aides to former Vice President Joe Biden reached out to Ms. Klobuchar's team to try to broker a caucus-night alliance -- and were rebuffed, according to her advisers. Her team says she's running to win in Iowa and plans to remain in the race at least through the New Hampshire primary eight days later. There are no plans to direct her backers to a second choice.But chances are, if you're a lower-tier candidate, your supporters are being eyed by the higher-ups like a heaping serving of hot dish.Andrew Yang said he anticipated that much of his backing would naturally gravitate to Senator Bernie Sanders, though he declined to give the ""Yang Gang"" specific directions.""The people that support my campaign are very diverse in their leanings,"" Mr. Yang told reporters. ""I frankly think I'd have a hard time getting them to do anything that they weren't naturally inclined to do.""With nearly 1,700 caucuses across the state, even some of the higher-polling candidates are unlikely to make the 15 percent threshold in all of them. On Wednesday, the former mayor Pete Buttigieg declined to point his supporters toward another candidate when asked by reporters.This isn't the first time Democratic strategists have tried to play a game of caucus chess. In 2008, some supporters of Bill Richardson flocked to Barack Obama after rumors circulated of a pact between the two campaigns -- even though they were denied by both camps.How these kinds of efforts will actually play out is harder to predict, say old Iowa caucus hands. In the moment, individual caucuses can be chaotic, making it hard to pull off the kinds of deals that the campaigns and their top aides might like to strike.Even more important, voters often think about the race in ways the political experts might not anticipate. That may be particularly true this year when many caucusgoers are considering a wide -- and ideologically diverse -- field of candidates.At an event for Mr. Buttigieg on Wednesday evening, Ginger Thompson, 63, said she was considering Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Yang. ""I think Bernie and Biden are too old,"" said Ms. Thompson, a retiree. ""They're younger, and to me, it seems they give us hope.""Facing a big field packed with well-known names, Democrats sometimes seem as if they want to back multiple people at once. In town hall meetings, voters have frequently asked the candidates whom they would consider as a running mate.On Jo Walter's list? Mr. Buttigieg, along with Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren.""Well, they're all Democrats. We got to get the Trumpster out of there,"" said Ms. Walter, an emergency medical technician from Clarksville. ""None of them are anything like him.""Maggie Astor contributed reporting from Des Moines.Drop us a line!We want to hear from our readers. Have a question? We'll try to answer it. Have a comment? We're all ears. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com .The final countdownWith just four days remaining before the Iowa caucuses, we're all in the homestretch before voting begins. I was curious how the candidates are ending their campaigns in this crucial state. Fortunately, I have a whole bunch of friends who can help answer that question.Here's what our campaign reporters are hearing from the leading candidates as they crisscross the state:Astead Herndon:Elizabeth Warren has shifted away from her policy focus in the run-up to the Iowa caucuses. Instead, she's making the case that she's best suited to beat President Trump and unite the Democratic Party. The plans are still there, but she focuses on rooting out Washington corruption and outlining her path to victory more.Reid Epstein:Pete Buttigieg is closing his Iowa campaign by pitching himself as the arbiter of a new era in American politics, attacking Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders and calling for the party to move past the ""the same Washington playbook.""Thomas Kaplan:Joe Biden is emphasizing the need to defeat Mr. Trump. He's leaning hard into contrasting himself with the president, speaking of bringing people together and unifying the country, and telling voters that ""character is on the ballot.""Sydney Ember:Bernie Sanders's closing argument has hardly differed from his core message: He is fighting for the working class, emphasizing ""Medicare for all"" and climate change. But he is also focusing more than ever on voter turnout, and his campaign is urging people to ""fight for someone you don't know.""And me:Amy Klobuchar is casting the election as a ""decency check"" on Mr. Trump, arguing that she can unite the country -- including moderate Republicans -- around the idea of restoring American values.The week in impeachmentWith the impeachment trial possibly headed toward its conclusion after a wild week, my colleague Noah Weiland , who writes our Impeachment Briefing newsletter , volunteered to catch us up on the latest. Here's what happened this week:The trial could end in the next few days. In the last 48 hours, Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, and the rest of the Republican leadership team have rallied their senators against tomorrow's vote to hear new witnesses and consider more evidence, effectively shutting down the trial and speeding toward a presumed acquittal. Mr. McConnell argued that opening the trial to witnesses would extend it indefinitely and introduce a degree of uncertainty that would cede control of the proceedings to Democrats, who are eager to call several top current and former White House officials to testify.John Bolton could be left hanging. The Times reported on Sunday night that Mr. Bolton, President Trump's former national security adviser, had submitted to the White House a draft of his upcoming book. In it, he gave a firsthand account of Mr. Trump's conditioning security assistance to Ukraine on help with investigations into Democrats. The revelation threatened to turn the trial on its head -- Republicans suddenly anticipated a majority vote to hear witnesses, and began to suggest that they would call Hunter Biden, Joe Biden's son, in a kind of witness exchange. Within days, though, the prospects of a Bolton appearance had seriously declined.We finally heard from senators on the Senate floor -- sort of. Yesterday and today, Democrats and Republicans had a chance to ask the House managers and White House lawyers anything related to the impeachment inquiry. Their questions, submitted in writing and read aloud by Chief Justice John Roberts, were wide-ranging: about the definition of obstruction, the history of security aid to Ukraine and the whistle-blower whose complaint led to the inquiry. Many of them were merely prompts from one party to its respective side to deliver talking points, including a response from White House lawyers that showed a startlingly expansive view of executive power.Democrats warned that a trial without witnesses would be illegitimate. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said today that if the Senate refused to call new witnesses or subpoena more documents, Mr. Trump's acquittal would not count. ""He will not be acquitted,"" she told reporters at her weekly news conference. ""You cannot be acquitted if you don't have a trial, and you don't have a trial if you don't have witnesses and documentation.""Subscribe to the Impeachment Briefing here ....

| Jump to first hit""Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in?"" he said a day after Joe Biden beat him in several key states. ""The answer is no.""BURLINGTON, Vt. -- After losing most Super Tuesday states to Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senator Bernie Sanders delivered a striking assessment of his campaign, acknowledging that he was ""disappointed"" with the results and that his crucial campaign message of inspiring young people to vote was falling short.""Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in?"" he told reporters during a hastily assembled news conference at his campaign office in Burlington, Vt. ""The answer is no.""The concession underscored a fundamental challenge for Mr. Sanders's political revolution, one that has become increasingly clear: In state after state, there has been little evidence -- at least outside California -- that he has generated higher turnout among young voters. And though he has promised to deliver record turnout, it may in fact be Mr. Biden who is accomplishing that, lifted by his strong support among black voters.In Texas, where Mr. Biden prevailed over Mr. Sanders, only 15 percent of voters were younger than 30, and nearly two-thirds were 45 or older, according to exit polls. The age breakdown was similar in California.In no state did people younger than 30 account for more than 20 percent of the electorate, based on exit polls, and in most states they accounted for 15 percent or less.Because so few young people voted, it did not matter that Mr. Sanders won them by huge margins, because Mr. Biden won the much more plentiful older voters.In addition, while Mr. Sanders has succeeded in galvanizing Latino voters -- he won them by about 27 percentage points over Mr. Biden in California -- he has struggled to build support among black voters.In Alabama, where black voters were half of the electorate, Mr. Sanders lost them by more than 60 points. He lost them by more than 50 points in Virginia, and by more than 40 points in Texas and North Carolina. In several states, he came in third among black voters, behind not only Mr. Biden but also Michael R. Bloomberg.In Minnesota, Mr. Sanders had a large gender gap. He had the support of 37 percent of men, according to exit polls, very close to Mr. Biden's 39 percent. But he only won 25 percent of women, compared with 41 percent for Mr. Biden. Mr. Sanders did do unusually well among black voters, who were a point of struggle for him in other states: He won 43 percent of them. But he only won 27 percent of white voters, who account for most of the Minnesota electorate.Unlike in the first nominating contests, when these failures did not stop Mr. Sanders from winning, his inability to expand the electorate was crucial to his losses on Super Tuesday, when Mr. Biden beat him in 10 of 14 states, including Texas, Virginia and North Carolina.After Mr. Sanders's dominant performance in Nevada less than two weeks ago, his aides and advisers had operated with new swagger, cautiously optimistic about his chances even in Southern states like South Carolina that they had expected to lose. He competed especially heavily in Virginia, North Carolina, Massachusetts and Minnesota, holding big rallies that doubled as shows of force.But as the clock ticked toward midnight on Tuesday and his losses began to pile up, the campaign's buoyant tone shifted sharply. When Mr. Sanders took the stage at an election-night rally in Essex Junction, Vt., he was defiant, declaring that he would ""win the Democratic nomination"" despite a series of weaker-than-expected results. Aides and advisers insisted it was still early, and urged reporters not to jump to conclusions.""If you turn off your television at 10 p.m. tonight, you will wake up tomorrow to a different race,"" Mike Casca, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said at one point.But by Wednesday morning, that optimism was gone.""Of course I'm disappointed,"" Mr. Sanders said at the news conference in Burlington. ""I would like to win every state by a landslide. It's not going to happen.""He blamed his underperformance in part on the ""venom"" of the ""corporate media.""As he has begun to do in recent days, he also framed the race as one between him and Mr. Biden, and drew explicit contrasts between his record and the former vice president's.""Joe and I have a very different voting record,"" he said. ""Joe and I have a very different vision for the future of this country. And Joe and I are running very different campaigns.""""My hope is that in the coming months, we will be able to debate and discuss the very significant differences that we have,"" he added.Appearing on ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" on MSNBC on Wednesday night, Mr. Sanders sharply criticized Mr. Biden's record on the Iraq war, bankruptcy and Social Security.Mr. Sanders also said that Michigan, which holds its primary on Tuesday, had been ""decimated"" by trade deals that Mr. Biden supported.""I walked the picket lines against NAFTA,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""I went to Mexico to see what NAFTA would do. Joe voted for those terrible agreements.""Some supporters of Mr. Sanders -- including prominent surrogates like Representative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota -- have argued that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, by staying in the race while several moderates dropped out, was partly responsible for Mr. Sanders's disappointing performance.But while backers of Mr. Sanders believe many of Ms. Warren's supporters would have migrated to him, exit polls suggested that the shift would have been too small to change the outcome in key states.Take college-educated white women: Ms. Warren's strongest group and one of Mr. Sanders's weakest. If Ms. Warren had dropped out, Mr. Sanders could have benefited twice as much as Mr. Biden among those voters, said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. But Maine would probably have been the only state to flip from Mr. Biden to Mr. Sanders as a result.Mr. Biden would most likely still have won Texas, Minnesota and Massachusetts -- just with somewhat smaller margins, according to Mr. Murray. Warren voters generally like Mr. Sanders, he said; ""it's just her support isn't large enough that it would have split enough in his direction.""In fact, based on exit polls, Mr. Bloomberg almost certainly siphoned more votes from Mr. Biden than Ms. Warren did from Mr. Sanders.Despite Mr. Sanders's wins or near-wins in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, the results in those contests had already challenged his pledge to fundamentally transform the electorate and expand the Democratic base.Turnout in Iowa was lower than expected, up 3 percent from 2016, and the increase was concentrated in well-educated areas where Mr. Sanders struggled, according to a New York Times analysis; in the precincts where he won, turnout increased by only 1 percentage point.There was no sign of a Sanders voter surge in New Hampshire either, or in Nevada, where turnout fell well short of 2008 levels despite a decade of population growth and a new early-voting option that attracted some 75,000 voters.There was also no clear evidence across the early states of much greater participation by young people, a typically low-turnout group that Mr. Sanders has long said he can motivate to get out to the polls. First-time Democratic voters' share of the electorate actually decreased in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada compared with 2016.Sydney Ember reported from Burlington, Vt., and Maggie Astor from New York. Michael Levenson contributed reporting from New York.Photograph""Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in? The answer is no,"" Senator Bernie Sanders said.

| Jump to first hitThe point of the attacks was not to set off mass defections between the left and the center, but rather to consolidate support on one side of the party or the other.HOOKSETT, N.H. -- Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., clashed throughout the day on Sunday, in a combative display of their determination to treat the upcoming New Hampshire primary as a two-person race, with former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. continuing to struggle.After a year when Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren dominated the campaign at different stages, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg have arrived in New Hampshire with the greatest momentum, according to public polling and a consensus of Democratic strategists in the state. A one-two finish for Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg here, after their near-tie in Iowa, could reorder the race and hasten a reckoning among Democratic leaders about which man would be the stronger nominee against President Trump.For all its divisions, the Democratic presidential field has been united for a year around the goal of defeating Mr. Trump, and even as attacks flew on Sunday the candidates continued to pledge that they would lock arms and work together in the general election. But the weekend melee -- complete with dark allusions to billionaire donors, allegations of intellectual dishonesty and sarcastic references to political inexperience -- showed how difficult that task could be if the primary becomes a prolonged and acrimonious affair.One way to avoid a long primary would be for Mr. Sanders or Mr. Buttigieg to fully unite either liberals or moderates behind their campaigns. Such unity seems unlikely: Mr. Sanders must contend with Ms. Warren on the left, while Mr. Buttigieg is a long way from clearing the race of moderates like Mr. Biden and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who has drawn fresh interest from many voters since a strong debate performance on Friday night.But if they could not eliminate their other competitors, Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders managed at least to overshadow them on Sunday by escalating the rivalry that has emerged between them. In Plymouth, Mr. Sanders denounced Mr. Buttigieg for relying on campaign contributions from the extremely wealthy, slamming his 38-year-old rival by name.""Our views are different: Pete has raised campaign contributions from over 40 billionaires,"" Mr. Sanders said. Telling the crowd that television interviewers had questioned whether fund-raising was an important campaign issue, Mr. Sanders thundered, ""Of course it matters!""In Dover, Mr. Buttigieg offered his own broadside, alleging that Mr. Sanders had not leveled with voters about the cost of his policy ambitions, especially single-payer health care. Rebuking Mr. Sanders again for what he has called an uncompromising view of leadership, Mr. Buttigieg suggested that voters ""deserve somebody who can actually deliver math that adds up.""""What we could do without is a plan so expensive that Senator Sanders himself freely admits he has no idea how it's supposed to be paid for,"" Mr. Buttigieg said.The rivalry played out on television as well, with Mr. Sanders chiding Mr. Buttigieg on CNN for having raised money from ""the C.E.O.s of some of the largest drug companies in America."" Mr. Buttigieg retorted, in perhaps the most personal barb of the day, ""Well, Bernie's pretty rich and I'd happily accept a contribution from him.""Neither argument was likely to win converts from the opposing candidate's camp: It would be difficult to imagine supporters of Mr. Sanders suddenly recoiling from the price tag for ""Medicare for all,"" or for Mr. Buttigieg's backers to abandon him over his fund-raising practices.The point of the exercise, however, was not to trigger mass defections between the left and the center, but rather to consolidate support on one side of the party or the other. Mr. Sanders has been focused on driving up turnout among progressives and trying to wrest away liberal support from Ms. Warren, the third-place finisher in Iowa, while Mr. Buttigieg has been appealing both to moderate Democrats, and also to independents and Republican voters who can cast ballots in New Hampshire's open Democratic primary.Mr. Buttigieg's television advertisements have focused on his outreach beyond the Democratic Party, and on Sunday he underscored the point when he asked voters -- as he often does -- to imagine the first day when Mr. Trump is no longer president. ""I don't even think that's a partisan statement anymore, to look forward to that,"" he added.At a campaign stop in Hanover, Mr. Sanders's supporters cheered his criticism of Mr. Buttigieg, sometimes in terms that captured the stark nature of the choice the two candidates have framed for voters. Alison Campion, 26, a researcher at Dartmouth, said she faulted Mr. Buttigieg for failing to ""lead by example"" in getting money out of politics; Ms. Campion said she believed Mr. Buttigieg's financial entanglements were more politically problematic than the label for which Mr. Sanders is most often criticized.""In my world, there's more support for the word socialist than billionaire,"" Ms. Campion said.The possibility that moderate voters could rally behind Mr. Buttigieg has seemed to pose a dire threat to Mr. Biden, whose weak finish in Iowa has sent at least some of his New Hampshire supporters fleeing to Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar.Kevin Donohue, a retired federal employee who attended a rally for Ms. Klobuchar on the campus of Southern New Hampshire University, said he had not entirely made up his mind but was leaning strongly toward supporting her. Mr. Donohue, 63, said he was also tempted to vote for Mr. Buttigieg, but had definitively ruled out Mr. Biden after watching him in a televised town hall event last week.""Joe Biden just seems too old and out of touch,"" said Mr. Donohue, who said he admired Ms. Klobuchar's experience in government and praised Mr. Buttigieg as ""something different.""Faced with the former vice president's imperiled status, his campaign charted a zigzagging course through the weekend, sometimes striking hard at Mr. Buttigieg and at other points taking a restrained and even gentle approach to a trying moment.On Saturday, Mr. Biden's campaign released a cutting video that ridiculed Mr. Buttigieg's limited record in government, lining up Mr. Biden's formidable experience with matters of state against Mr. Buttigieg's municipal résumé. In a television interview, Mr. Biden questioned whether Mr. Buttigieg could win support from African-American voters and dismissed him again to reporters.But on Sunday, Mr. Biden declined to keep up the offensive against Mr. Buttigieg, limiting his criticism on the stump to veiled allusions to Mr. Buttigieg's failure to win over people of color and speaking broadly about the importance of experience.He was more pointed in taking on Mr. Sanders over a familiar subject: Medicare for all. He suggested that the senator was not being straightforward about what the far-reaching proposal would cost.The former vice president also noted that he was ""far ahead of everybody"" among black voters, but sounded at times like he was more inclined to make his stand in the diverse primary states that vote later this month -- Nevada and South Carolina -- than to wage an all-out battle against Mr. Buttigieg here.""Guess what, it's the base of the Democratic Party,"" Mr. Biden said, referring to African-American voters.Mr. Biden was not the only candidate seeming to move past New Hampshire. Ms. Warren, too, indicated in Concord on Sunday that she was looking to states further down the primary calendar and perhaps anticipating a very long primary campaign.""There are 55 more states and territories after this,"" Ms. Warren told reporters. ""I've got plenty of energy left.""Among moderates, the risk to Mr. Biden does not come solely from Mr. Buttigieg: Ms. Klobuchar, too, has shown signs of gaining ground since Iowa, and her campaign said she drew her largest crowd yet on Sunday in Manchester.Ms. Klobuchar continued on Sunday to make a strenuous case to moderate voters that she was the best choice for those ""tired of the extremes in our politics,"" and several times mentioned that she hoped to win support from independent and Republican voters.Even amid signs of a shift toward Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, voters were still expressing anxiety about their final decision. At Ms. Klobuchar's stop in Hooksett, Janet White, 70, said she had settled on Ms. Klobuchar through a ""process of elimination,"" excluding several candidates who were ""too much to the left"" and ultimately rejecting Mr. Biden as well.""I like him as a person, I just think we need somebody younger,"" Ms. White said. ""We need somebody younger, and that's what I like about Amy: She's not too young, she's not too old.""Of Mr. Buttigieg, she said, ""He's another one I like, but I'm not sure it's his time.""Alexander Burns reported from Hooksett, and Nick Corasaniti from Plymouth, N.H.

| Jump to first hitThe candidates may be getting a bit testy, but organizers for three Democratic presidential campaigns amiably share a farmhouse that reflects Iowa's culture of grass-roots politics.RICEVILLE, Iowa -- Charles Uffelman, a bearded and burly Tennessean who is working in Iowa for Elizabeth Warren, stirred gravy on a stovetop while biscuits rose in the oven.Jared Sherman, a Pete Buttigieg organizer in a checked lumberjack shirt, scrambled eggs.Bryan McNamara, a staff member for Joseph R. Biden Jr. who is fond of a light leather jacket in the Midwest winter, poured strong coffee.""I love these guys, I love organizing alongside them,"" Mr. Uffelman said as he and the others prepared a country breakfast on a recent weekday morning.The Democratic presidential candidates may have thrown some sharp elbows on a debate stage in Des Moines last week. But two and a half hours away, in a farmhouse beneath a wind turbine, with the odor of a hog farm wafting across a rural road, field organizers for three of the combatants have found a way to coexist in harmony as housemates.""It helps we all have thick skin,"" said Mr. McNamara, who has added 8,000 miles and a coat of dust to a sedan with New York plates. ""Being able to come home and, you know, if I had a rough day, being able to talk to people and see that we're all having similar challenges out here -- it's not just our candidate or our campaign -- there are issues with rural organizing that we all encounter.""The monthslong buildup to Iowa's first-in-the-nation nominating contest, and the challenges of turning out voters to more than 1,000 caucus sites on Feb. 3, have led to a culture of grass-roots organizing in the state unlike anywhere else. All four leading Democratic campaigns, including Bernie Sanders's team, have dispatched small armies of field organizers, mostly idealistic young people from out of state, to embed themselves in communities.They knock on doors, hold meet-ups of potential supporters and otherwise build out networks of volunteers who play a large part in determining the results of the caucuses. Lack of an Iowa ground game in 2016 was a big part of why Donald J. Trump finished second in the state despite leading in pre-caucus polls. Barack Obama's enormous organizing footprint in 2008 was largely why his margin of victory exceeded expectations.""You have to build community around the campaign -- it has to feel like a family,"" said Mr. Uffelman, 26, the Warren organizer, who has joined a local Methodist church in an effort to meet people and become known.Mr. McNamara, 22, the Biden representative, held a potluck dinner for volunteers he recruited and people just considering the former vice president. ""I love community events that pull our supporters together but also don't put pressure on them to just make it about the candidate,"" he said.Laura Hubka, who has opened her large home to the organizers rent-free since October, in a windswept region on the Minnesota border, is chairwoman of the Howard County Democratic Party. An area of declining population with many older rural voters, Howard County is famous in political circles for having swung more jarringly than any county in America from Mr. Obama to Mr. Trump. It voted for Mr. Obama by a 21 percentage point margin in 2012 and for Mr. Trump by 20 -- a 41-point gyration.""I've been asked 300 times what happened,"" Ms. Hubka said. The closest she's come to an answer is that the Obama-Trump vote was a fed-up rejection of both parties by people who had lost faith in government. The county seat, Cresco, is a town of fewer than 4,000 rarely visited by presidential candidates. A wall mural of standout local wrestlers represents community pride, but downtown storefronts are increasingly going dark.Also, there was a lot of ""Hillary hate"" in 2016, Ms. Hubka acknowledged. ""We were chased out of yards with rakes while door knocking.""Some of that sentiment still lingers. Mr. McNamara told of knocking at the door of an older woman who had caucused for Mr. Biden in 2008, only to be turned away by a family member, who shouted: ""She doesn't want to talk to you. Trump 2020!""""That's one of those experiences where I said, O.K., this is real,"" said Mr. McNamara, who grew up in New York's Hudson Valley.Ms. Hubka, 55, an ultrasound technician married to a long-haul truck driver, was a Sanders supporter four years ago, when Howard County Democrats gave the Vermont senator 54 percent of their caucus vote. After the general election, she quit the state party central committee in frustration over the factionalism between supporters of Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton.But she did not stay away long from activism. Ms. Hubka endorsed Mr. Buttigieg, the first county chair in Iowa to do so. She believes Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., can bridge the divisiveness in her party, in Howard County and in the country.She does not demonize Trump voters, who include friends and family members. She ticks off some who regret their choice: the husband of a dietitian at the medical center where she works. A conservative official at the Chamber of Commerce angry at the lack of fiscal restraint under Republicans. A ""shirttail uncle"" of her husband's, a small farmer hurt by tariffs, who she said ""came up to me and put his fist down on the table"" and declared he would not vote for Mr. Trump again.Such voters are not hard to find in Howard County, even if far from the majority. They include Sara Burke, who plans to participate in her first Democratic caucus next month, an abrupt reversal in her short voting history. Ms. Burke, 38, cast her first ballot ever for president in 2016 for Mr. Trump.At the time, she said, she was ""terrified"" that Muslim extremists would harm her family in rural Iowa, a fear driven by Mr. Trump that even her 11-year-old son echoed. ""He legitimately felt fear; it's horrible as a parent,"" she said.Her disappointment set in early. She described the president's bullying speech and braggadocio as ""disgusting.""""Democrat or Republican, I can't support anybody like that,"" she said.The auto parts factory where Ms. Burke works is near full employment, running three shifts, but she said her income from a $21.50 an hour job is barely above the line that would entitle her children to subsidized school lunches. ""If I'm at one of the best paying places around here, I should be able to be grateful and do my job and pay for the lunches and not have to need help,"" she said. ""It's crazy to me.""Last year Ms. Burke became active in the political wing of the United Automobile Workers union. She concluded the president was anti-worker. ""What I really realize now, and didn't before, is if he had his way, my God, our children would be working right alongside of us and none of us would be making any money, there would be no union,"" she said.""From what I was paying attention to and where I was getting my information,"" Ms. Burke recalled of 2016, ""I was not informing myself well at all.""Neil Shaffer, the chairman of the Republican Party in Howard County, said he saw no signs of a ""Trump revolt."" He predicted the general election would turn on the tone of the two major candidates, in a county where many voters have weak partisan identity and dislike divisiveness. ""I think honestly this election will have more to do with personalities than with issues,"" he said.Ms. Hubka is not optimistic the county will swing back to the Democrats in November. If she can shave 10 points off Mr. Trump's 2016 margin, that would be a victory, she said. ""I think it's going to be a horrible, nasty election,"" she said.Even though she favors Mr. Buttigieg, she welcomes all of the organizers staying under her roof. ""One of these three people's candidates is going to be the nominee,"" she said.Usually after dinner, her three lodgers head upstairs to separate rooms to log data from their day or work the phones. ""They call until 9, which I've advised against because Iowans don't like to be called after 8,"" Ms. Hubka said.Late at night, the organizers drift down to a bar in the basement. They walk a fine line in talking shop -- swapping general stories without sharing details about the caucusgoers they've recruited or the canvassing scripts used by their campaigns. ""We talk about what we're doing without actually talking about what we're doing,"" Mr. Uffelman, the Warren organizer, said.All three find that some of the best parts of the job are the lengthy conversations that rural residents are willing to engage in. Mr. Uffelman, in his Southern lilt, recalled speaking for 30 minutes to a farmer fixing a tractor, who had concerns about his health care and corruption in the farm economy. Mr. Uffelman persuaded him to support Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts senator.""I'm a farm boy, I grew up on a farm, and you know, being able to talk about what his job is like,"" he said, ""that's my favorite part of organizing -- you get to hear the story.""The three men said they have never debated among themselves the No. 1 issue for many Democrats: Who is most electable in November?""We'll say, well, I know my candidate's most electable,"" Mr. McNamara said to laughter.""I think that's why this dynamic works,"" Mr. Sherman, 28, the Buttigieg organizer, who is an Ohio native, said. ""Yes, we're on different teams now, and yes, we think our candidate is the best person to move forward. But once our party has a nominee, we have to work with each other.""Mr. Sherman's laptop is a collage of stickers for candidates he has worked for. He said the housemates hope to stay together after Iowa and through Election Day.""I'm trying to get these guys to come to Ohio,"" Mr. Sherman said.PhotographTop, from left, Bryan McNamara, Jared Sherman and Charles Uffelman preparing to turn out supporters for three different Democratic presidential campaigns in Riceville, Iowa, this month.

| Jump to first hitHis placement behind his leading rivals in the caucuses on Monday dealt a damaging blow to his campaign. Some party officials say it was a long time in the works.DES MOINES -- Maybe it was the threat of bad weather. Maybe it was a seating assignment debacle. Maybe it was a struggling campaign organization that still hadn't found its footing.But as Joseph R. Biden Jr. spoke at a major Iowa Democratic Party dinner in November, one thing was clear: His support appeared tepid compared with the vocal cheering sections of top rivals. The reception angered Mr. Biden and his top aides -- and it left little doubt about his standing, three months before the nominating process in the Democratic presidential race would begin: The former vice president was in deep trouble in Iowa.Two days after the dinner, Mr. Biden ripped into his campaign chairman, Steve Ricchetti, according to a person familiar with the conversation. And at the Biden headquarters in Philadelphia, senior officials sternly told staff members they needed to step up their performance.The dinner's damaging optics marked the beginning of a flurry of changes: Trusted aides were deployed to Iowa sooner than anticipated. Mr. Biden rescheduled time with donors to make space for a bus tour in Iowa. Former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa and his wife, Christie Vilsack, major players in Iowa Democratic politics, announced their Biden endorsements.It was too late.Mr. Biden's performance in the Iowa caucuses on Monday dealt a damaging blow to the former vice president; with well over 90 percent of the results counted by Wednesday night, he trailed Pete Buttigieg and Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, with Senator Amy Klobuchar not far behind.""I am not going to sugarcoat it,"" Mr. Biden said Wednesday as he campaigned in New Hampshire. ""We took a gut punch in Iowa.""Certainly over the past year, Mr. Biden has proved far more resilient than many expected. He has led national polls for months despite verbal gaffes, scrutiny of his long and sometimes controversial record in Washington, and a relentless assault from Republicans over his son's dealings in Ukraine. The slow drip of vote totals in Iowa -- and a swirl of other major news events -- may blunt the attention on Mr. Biden's challenges. And Iowa is an overwhelmingly white state, while Mr. Biden's biggest political strength is with black voters, whom he is counting on for support in later-voting, more diverse states.But he now faces jittery donors, an uncertain landscape in upcoming Democratic contests and a sharp challenge to the central argument of his campaign message: that he is the party's strongest candidate to win a general election.Interviews with more than a dozen advisers, allies and Iowa strategists show that Mr. Biden was late in focusing on Iowa, put together an organization there that fell well short of his top rivals' and that his core pitch about electability and experience wasn't enough to persuade voters who wanted a fresh face or more boldly progressive ideas.Mr. Biden was also a less-than-inspiring presence on the trail, according to some voters, struggling at times in the homestretch to deliver crisp, energetic, on-message performances.A late start proves costlyWhen Mr. Biden announced his candidacy on April 25, some of his chief rivals had already been running for months.His late start had long-lasting consequences, according to some of his supporters.""He could have been here sooner and more aggressively,"" said Mr. Vilsack, who became Mr. Biden's top surrogate in the state. ""Because this is all about relationships.""""It was frustrating that they weren't seeming to reach more people,"" added Susan Judkins, a member of the Clive City Council. ""Some of the other campaigns had been getting momentum. They had hired staffers who are known to Iowans, who had an ability to influence.""When he did get to the state over the summer and into the fall, Mr. Biden's team produced carefully managed events. He traveled with a phalanx of staff, sometimes used teleprompters and typically spoke from behind rope lines. None of that prevented a spree of verbal stumbles in Iowa in August -- but according to some of his allies, it did keep Mr. Biden from showing off his biggest strength: his retail politicking skills.""I've had that conversation at least since the end of May, beginning part of the summer, that Joe would do better and has always done better meeting with people,"" said State Representative Bruce Hunter, a staunch Biden ally who said he made that case to Mr. Biden's state campaign leadership. ""He needed to get out more, talk to smaller groups of people, listen to them, give his vision one-on-one to people.""Yet no amount of glad-handing could remedy an organization that even his supporters here found frustrating.""His campaign is not a good campaign,"" Roxanna Moritz, the Scott County auditor and a Biden supporter, said late last month. ""They're not embedding loyalty to the organization, he doesn't do groundwork.""She said that the campaign was ""not returning phone calls, no follow through.""""It's kind of sad because I really do think he is the right person,"" she added.By the fall, Mr. Biden's advisers felt that their campaign organization in Iowa had steadied -- but events in Washington took him down a detour that no one could have foreseen, or prevented.On Sept. 21, more than 1,000 Biden supporters assembled at the Polk County Steak Fry, featuring the kind of chummy interaction in which Mr. Biden is at his best.But their efforts were overshadowed by news that President Trump had asked Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden's son, Hunter Biden, a story that would consume the campaign for months. That night, a Des Moines Register poll revealed that Mr. Biden had slipped from first place in Iowa, overtaken by Ms. Warren of Massachusetts.Mr. Biden spent the next weeks grappling with the best way to respond to the Ukraine controversy. And party officials continued to describe his Iowa organization as scattershot, an issue thrown into sharp relief at the party dinner in November, the Liberty and Justice Celebration.Mr. Biden's team said that it had around 1,200 people in the arena, many of whom went on to become precinct captains and dedicated volunteers. But the empty seats and the smaller and less boisterous Biden sections spread throughout the arena cut a sharp contrast with the loud, unified crowds of Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., in a major test of organizational strength.More damaging than the evident differences in crowd strength was what many Iowa Democrats were seeing for the first time in person: a once-fiery candidate who was looking his age compared with a number of his younger rivals.A key endorsement, and some adviceMr. Biden's campaign could do little to alter the presentation of a candidate who was given to meandering into verbal cul-de-sacs even in his prime.But they concluded that they needed to better display Mr. Biden's strong interpersonal skills, and to connect with more moderate voters who live in rural areas.Mr. Vilsack, the former governor, had long advocated that approach, joining with his wife to advise their old friend to spend time in small towns during a private conversation last spring.After spending months meeting with candidates, the Vilsacks -- who supported Mr. Biden in his first presidential campaign, in 1987 -- informed Mr. Biden in a phone call that they would endorse him, impressed with his rural policy proposal, his empathy and his ""capacity to take a punch.""Behind the scenes, they offered the campaign leadership two major pieces of advice.""One, you need to be out there in all parts of the state,"" Mr. Vilsack said. ""And two, you need to spend time with voters in a way that they will get to know you.""After Thanksgiving, the Vilsacks joined Mr. Biden on a bus trip, called the ""No Malarkey"" tour, across rural parts of the state where the Biden campaign saw chances to accrue delegates.The trip revealed strategic openings for the campaign, officials said. They spotted an opportunity with Latino voters in Storm Lake and were reminded to accentuate Mr. Biden's advantage with Catholics in Dubuque.The problem: Those lessons were arriving with just weeks to capitalize on them. Other candidates had already spent many months trying to win over the state's Democratic caucusgoers.""Had he done the 'No Malarkey' tour in the summertime, you may never have seen that Elizabeth Warren bounce,"" said Representative Ami Bera, Democrat of California, who supports Mr. Biden.Jesse Harris, a senior Biden Iowa adviser, said the timing was designed to coincide with when caucusgoers intensified their focus on the race. ""The vice president did spend quite a bit of time in the state,"" he said. ""Obviously, he got into the race a bit later than the other candidates, so two or three months behind when he first visited the state compared to others. But we were actively here in Iowa.""""The bus tour,"" he added, ""was a very visible extension of what we were already doing.""Disappointing some supportersAs 2020 arrived, there were some encouraging developments, building on what the campaign saw as post-bus tour momentum.On Jan. 2, Representative Abby Finkenauer, a Democrat who in 2018 had flipped an eastern Iowa district, endorsed Mr. Biden, signaling that candidates in the toughest races believed Mr. Biden was their safest bet at the top of the ticket. Representative Cindy Axne, a Democrat from another competitive Iowa district, later followed suit.And tensions with Iran propelled national security matters into the spotlight, playing into Mr. Biden's message of experience.Yet even as he continued to land high-profile endorsements, Mr. Sanders of Vermont was on the rise, expanding his progressive support and seeking to cut into Mr. Biden's base of blue-collar workers by attacking his record on Social Security, pointing out that he had occasionally entertained freezes to the program. The specter of a possible conflict with Iran allowed Mr. Sanders to continually remind voters that Mr. Biden had approved the use of force in Iraq.A New York Times/Siena College poll released late last month found that even in eastern Iowa -- home to many white working-class voters with whom Mr. Biden expected to be strong -- he was struggling.Ahead of the 2016 campaign, David Plouffe, Barack Obama's former campaign manager, had warned Mr. Biden, according to an article in The Atlantic, ""Do you really want it to end in a hotel room in Des Moines, coming in third to Bernie Sanders?""In the final weeks before the 2020 Iowa caucuses, Mr. Plouffe's warning was starting to sound prescient.Recognizing the need to win new supporters, Mr. Biden's Iowa director, Jake Braun, floated a deal over dinner in Des Moines with an adviser to Ms. Klobuchar of Minnesota. The two moderate Democrats should form an alliance, Mr. Braun suggested a week before the vote, and urge their supporters to back the other if one of them did not advance to the final round in a precinct.Ms. Klobuchar's camp quickly shot down the prospect when the story leaked, and Mr. Braun, who had already been marginalized by Mr. Biden's national campaign, found himself isolated by his enraged superiors, who had warned him not to freelance, according to a person familiar with internal discussions.Sue Dvorsky, a former Iowa Democratic chair, had backed Senator Kamala Harris of California. After Ms. Harris dropped out, Ms. Dvorsky said she was inclined to support Mr. Biden, whom she and her husband had met when he ran for president in 1987.But Ms. Dvorsky was appalled at the state of Mr. Biden's organization, which was lacking precinct captains even in her own heavily Democratic community. Last week she endorsed Ms. Warren.""This has been a sloppy effort that was always aimed at a general election,"" she said of Mr. Biden's organization, deeming it worse than his first two Iowa campaigns. ""Right now, they're bringing in hundreds of people from out of state -- not to be canvassers but to be precinct captains.""Even some of Mr. Biden's high-profile supporters were perplexed by the campaign's choices, which included dispatching a number of his former Senate colleagues, all of them white men over 70, to stump for him in the Iowa campaign's final days.On the Saturday before the caucuses, Ms. Judkins had an uneasy feeling about the decision her state was about to make. She had spent the day knocking on doors with a host of prominent Biden supporters from across the country. She came away impressed by what her colleagues had told her -- that Mr. Biden had more support and organizational strength in later-voting states. She wished they had come to Iowa sooner.""I said to my husband, 'I feel like all of these people from around the country are coming in to try to save us from ourselves,""' she said when they went out that evening. ""Here we are, going out dancing. Kind of like the Titanic, the ship going down.""Photograph""We took a gut punch in Iowa,"" Joseph R. Biden Jr. said.

| Jump to first hitMr. Sanders and his aides are now struggling to reconcile a sense of resignation with a desire to press on, and some allies are urging the senator to stay in the race.Senator Bernie Sanders jabbed his finger in the air. He left Joseph R. Biden Jr. resorting to misstatements to defend his stance on bankruptcy legislation. He instructed viewers to ""go to the YouTube"" to check out the former vice president's record themselves.It was not the kind of debate performance suggesting a candidate ready for reconciliation.After delivering a speech last week that appeared aimed at de-escalating the primary battle against Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders laced into his opponent on Sunday night with a vigor that signaled that the fight -- if not for delegates, then for the soul of the Democratic Party -- was not over.Under intense pressure to win nominating contests and already grappling with the effects of the coronavirus on the election, Mr. Sanders and his aides are now struggling to reconcile a sense of resignation and a desire to press on.Yet even as his path to the nomination looks increasingly bleak, with Mr. Biden favored in three more primaries on Tuesday, some allies are publicly urging Mr. Sanders to remain in the race, eager for him to continue to pitch voters on a liberal agenda that he has promoted for decades.""I want the senator to stay in,"" Nina Turner, one of the campaign's national co-chairs, said in an interview on Monday. ""I think other voters have a right to have a choice. This is not a coronation. We know what happened last time in 2016 -- it gave us Donald J. Trump.""This campaign, she added, was ""the culmination of this man's life's work.""The decision on whether to drop out or continue the campaign is one that ultimately rests with Mr. Sanders and his wife, Jane Sanders, allies and friends say. His inner circle has only grown smaller in recent days, and hardly anyone on his campaign is willing to speculate where he may land.Some Sanders aides and supporters privately acknowledge that his chances are daunting if not impossible given the broad coalition of Democrats that Mr. Biden appears to have assembled, and Mr. Sanders's inability to bring new voters under his tent. But they describe Mr. Sanders as a fighter, and a headstrong one, whose instinct will be to keep battling. They also see an advantage in continuing to accrue delegates to use as leverage in negotiations with Mr. Biden over potential policy concessions.To several Sanders aides and allies, the aggressiveness their candidate showed on the debate stage was a way of holding Mr. Biden accountable on the issues Mr. Sanders cares deeply about, perhaps fueled by the faint hope that he can persuade voters that he remains the best choice to consolidate the party and defeat President Trump.""Even though Joe Biden is ahead in delegates at the moment, he is far from unifying the party,"" Jeff Weaver, a longtime Sanders adviser, said after the debate. ""And he hasn't made the case that he can provide the kind of inspired leadership necessary to beat Donald Trump.""Still, the campaign has not made a major television ad buy since last Wednesday, when it added about $2 million worth, though it did add another $250,000 worth on Thursday, spread across three states originally scheduled to vote on Tuesday: Florida, Illinois and Ohio (on Monday Ohio moved to postpone its primary). And Mr. Sanders risks looking out of step with the times if he persists in extending the primary against long odds, while the nation is in the middle of a public health crisis.Even some of his biggest supporters suggested that the race was effectively over and that the time had come for Democrats to unite behind Mr. Biden.""The chance of getting the nomination is so tiny, the stakes are so high given Trump and coronavirus and the economic fallout, that he does need to face that reality,"" Robert Reich, a former labor secretary who endorsed Mr. Sanders, said in an interview on Monday.Mr. Reich said that some onus was on Mr. Biden to demonstrate to Mr. Sanders that he is sufficiently devoted to progressive causes. The former vice president could do that, Mr. Reich said, by naming Mr. Sanders as a top policy adviser to his campaign or by naming Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as his running mate.""It's the only way he's going to get the type of enthusiasm he needs,"" he said.With the Democratic primary at an inflection point as Mr. Sanders considers his next steps, Mr. Biden's campaign has tried to strike a balance between acting presidential, as if he will be the nominee, and not alienating Mr. Sanders and his loyalists. Last Wednesday, hours after Mr. Biden had collected four more victories, his aides seemed reluctant to call on Mr. Sanders to drop out even as they sent out a memo describing Mr. Biden's lead as nearly insurmountable.""Should our broad base of support remain -- and we have seen no signs that would indicate otherwise -- it will be nearly impossible for Sanders to recoup his current delegate disadvantage,"" the Biden campaign memo said.After Mr. Sanders refrained from attacking Mr. Biden at a news conference that afternoon, and instead presented a list of policy priorities, some of Mr. Biden's backers hoped the debate would be the next step toward unifying the party around his candidacy. Mr. Biden's team believed it had extended an olive branch to Sanders loyalists in the hours before the debate, embracing a version of a plan Mr. Sanders has championed that calls for tuition-free public college for many students.So some Biden backers said they were caught off guard when Mr. Sanders spent much of Sunday's debate criticizing Mr. Biden's long record, which revived their broader frustrations with some of Mr. Sanders's surrogates who have slashed Mr. Biden in more starkly personal terms.""I didn't expect some of the sharp elbows we saw from the senator,"" said state Representative Malcolm Kenyatta, Democrat of Pennsylvania and a Biden supporter, even as he praised Mr. Sanders's pledge to support the eventual nominee.There were more overt indications of displeasure from the Biden camp directly after the debate. Anita Dunn, Mr. Biden's chief strategist, compared Mr. Sanders to a political demonstrator, telling reporters that the former vice president had spent the debate ""graciously dealing with the kind of protester who often shows up at campaign events, on live television.""Some Sanders advisers are still hoping to eke out victories on Tuesday in Illinois and Arizona but are also cognizant that the outlook looks increasingly challenging. A poll released on Monday showed Mr. Sanders trailing Mr. Biden in Arizona by 20 percentage points. Florida also votes on Tuesday, and aides acknowledge that the state at this point is effectively out of reach. And in a blow that was long in coming, Washington State's final results were announced on Monday, with Mr. Biden emerging as the victor after nearly a week of counting ballots.Beyond that, the crisis surrounding the coronavirus has cast a cloud of uncertainty over the race, scrambling the primary, forcing Mr. Sanders to forgo his signature rallies and making the process even more unpredictable.Speaking with CNN after the debate, Mr. Sanders openly questioned the wisdom of holding primaries during a pandemic.""I would hope governors listen to the public health experts and what they are saying is, you just indicated, we don't want gatherings of more than 50 people,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""I'm thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people, all that stuff. It does not make a lot of sense.""Establishment Democrats are desperately hoping to avoid a reprise of 2016, when Mr. Sanders battled to the bitter end against Hillary Clinton; his posture enraged some in the party who later blamed him for stoking division among Democrats that led to her loss to Mr. Trump.There have been more recent signs that he is reluctant to give up without a fight.Asked recently whether his attacks would weaken Mr. Biden in the general election against Mr. Trump, Mr. Sanders grew exasperated. ""I heard that back in 2016,"" he told reporters in Phoenix, before asking whether anointing a candidate before the race was over was ""really what democracy is about.""In an enduring sign of strength, his campaign said it raised $2 million on Sunday, and has hit 10 million individual contributions.Those close to Mr. Sanders say he may want to forge ahead not because he thinks he can still win but to keep his political revolution alive.""This is about building that movement for change, not just about him,"" said Larry Cohen, the chairman of the Sanders-aligned group Our Revolution. ""Obviously, he wants to be the president on every level, but it's much deeper than that.""Even if Mr. Sanders does decide to soldier on, his campaign will be severely curtailed because of guidelines for containing the coronavirus demand, a new reality that is not lost on many of his advisers.In recent days, some of Mr. Sanders's closest advisers, including his campaign manager, Faiz Shakir; Ari Rabin-Havt, a deputy campaign manager; and Mr. Weaver, decamped to Burlington to strategize there. Several of them gathered around a wood-burning stove on Saturday as Mr. Sanders live-streamed a ""fireside chat.""None have said much publicly, but on Monday the campaign sent a fund-raising email noting that ""this primary is far from over.""Nick Corasaniti, Reid J. Epstein and Katie Glueck contributed reporting.PhotographSome allies are urging Bernie Sanders to press on in the race for the Democratic nomination.

| Jump to first hitWith impeachment behind the president, his re-election campaign wants to address political weaknesses exacerbated by his policies and behavior.WASHINGTON -- Buoyed by his impeachment acquittal and the muddled Democratic primary race, President Trump and his campaign are turning to address his re-election bid's greatest weaknesses with an aggressive, well-funded but uncertain effort to win back suburban voters turned off by his policies and behavior.His campaign is aiming to regain these voters in battleground states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, after losing many of them to Democrats in the 2018 midterms. Advisers hope to expand the electoral map for November by winning moderate-leaning states like Minnesota and New Hampshire. And the White House is gearing up to help with policy issues directed at swing states, such as the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada and paid family leave for federal workers.Trump campaign officials are also stockpiling cash to help with these efforts, with $200 million in the bank now and fund-raising continuing at a brisk pace. They have put up television ads relatively early in the race, allocating $6 million for the final three months of 2019 to highlight a booming economy and the low unemployment numbers.Among the goals is trying to appeal to black voters and suburban and upper-income white voters with ads such as a spot focusing on criminal justice reform that first aired during the Super Bowl and is continuing on cable channels with large female audiences, like Bravo and Lifetime.Yet Mr. Trump's messaging, like so much else about his approach to politics, is contradictory. For all the focus on appealing to moderates, the campaign is also engaging the president's hard-core supporters with Facebook ads warning of the danger of undocumented ""aliens"" and their ""invasion"" of the U.S., and decrying ""the impeachment hoax,"" while also promoting polarizing policies like curtailing immigration.Those inflammatory, targeted ads are ones that suburban voters may never see, a reflection of the campaign's broad strategy: Keep his conservative base energized and chip away at his problems in the suburbs and communities of color.The challenge facing Mr. Trump's advisers remains the same as it has been since 2017: The president is among the most deeply divisive leaders in the nation's history, whose conduct has helped accelerate a realignment of moderate suburban voters toward Democrats. These voters have been the cornerstone of Democrats' electoral revival since 2016, helping them flip governorships and propelling their capture of the House.Mr. Trump cannot win a second term without winning back suburban voters and independents in a handful of states he carried in 2016. But he is highly averse to staying on script and delivering a consistent message aimed at moderate voters rather than his hard-core admirers, or his own need to get things off his chest.Mr. Trump's advisers argue that the suburban voters who eschewed Republicans in the 2018 midterms will vote differently when the president's name is on the ballot. And they are lacing the strong economy into much of their messaging and policy plans: Mr. Trump himself sees the economy as his calling card and is monitoring fluctuations in stock market closely, and his team thinks the economy is one of their best selling points in the suburbs.""Suburban women is where he has a challenge,"" said Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican from North Dakota.""I think the biggest problem that he has with suburban women is the part that so many in his base like about him,"" Mr. Cramer said. ""His rhetoric, his punching down at his opponents. It's so different than anything they've seen.""Scott Reed, the top political adviser to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, nodded to the fleeting nature of Trump-era politics as he assessed the electoral landscape for the president.""Politics in Trumpville are great right now, but these days, a week feels like three months and we have a long way to go,"" Mr. Reed said.Republican National Committee officials are tracking the suburban problem. In 2016, about 100,000 Michigan residents who voted in state legislative races left the box for president empty. Many of those voters were men in the suburbs, R.N.C. officials said, and were people who didn't believe Mr. Trump was truly a conservative, but who have come back after seeing him deliver on conservative judicial appointments and a tax-cut bill.But suburban women remain difficult to sway, Trump advisers acknowledge. Some messages have moved the dial, if only temporarily: When Mr. Trump talks about Democrats wanting to provide government health care benefits to undocumented immigrants, for instance, Republican officials have seen an uptick of support in their own surveys of the suburbs of Pennsylvania. When Mr. Trump paints the entire Democratic field, falsely, as supporting ending private health insurance, his advisers see room for him to grow. But they admit that it's a difficult line to walk.The G.O.P. strategy ultimately depends on who his Democratic opponent turns out to be. And Mr. Trump faces an unknown in Michael R. Bloomberg, a billionaire former New York City mayor running a general election strategy, who is spending so much money that Mr. Trump's advisers acknowledged that he cannot be ignored even if Mr. Bloomberg loses the Democratic nomination.With the Democrats enmeshed in the start of their primary season, Mr. Trump is beginning his own new phase: He has reasons to feel reassured about his prospects as he turns more fully to his re-election effort, and the apparatus of the White House and the Republican Party are more able to focus on winning him a second term.Mr. Trump's approval ratings have inched up and he's now around where the last three incumbent presidents were at the start of their own, successful, re-elections. And the economy shows no signs of slowing.""The White House and the campaign should focus 100 percent on the economic growth and opportunity society Trump is creating for America,"" Mr. Reed said, somewhat hopefully.But greater confidence and a freer hand can lead Mr. Trump to take risks: His phone call with the Ukrainian president on July 25, 2019, which ultimately helped lead to his impeachment in the House, came after he had seen the end of the two-year investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Just this past week, Mr. Trump fired from the White House two witnesses and an ambassador who testified in the House impeachment inquiry, including Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a decorated war veteran, prompting outrage from Democrats and private concern among some Republican lawmakers. On Saturday, he tweeted that Colonel Vindman had earned his dismissal.As Mr. Trump has repeatedly shown, he can show a measure of discipline in one moment -- like his teleprompter-ready speech at the State of the Union that was sprinkled with appeals to different demographic groups -- and then do or say something that alienates swing voters.His 62-minute stemwinder of retribution in the East Room of the White House the day after the acquittal was the type of ventilating performance Mr. Trump had been craving, but which some advisers acknowledge undermines the carefully-crafted efforts at broadening his appeal.""Many people are evaluating the president based on his conduct and behavior in office rather than the state of the economy,"" said Whit Ayres, a longtime Republican pollster. ""It's his conduct and behavior in office that have kept a foot on his job approval rating. Any other president would be in the upper 50s or even low 60s with this economy.""Most of the president's aides concede that his base of supporters is not enough to re-elect him, and that he must attract the voters who were repelled by his behavior and voted against Republicans in the 2018 midterms -- particularly upscale whites, suburban women and self-described independent voters who polls repeatedly show think the president is racist, or has a troubling temperament, or both.To that end, the president's campaign aired a Super Bowl ad featuring Alice Johnson, a black woman convicted on charges related to drug trafficking whose sentence the president commuted. The president also awarded an ""Opportunity Zone"" scholarship to a young African-American girl during his State of the Union address, and tailored other moments during the speech to appeal to members of the military.Trump advisers are focused not just on the three states that elected Mr. Trump in 2016 -- Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- but also the forever battleground of Florida, and battleground states with competitive Senate races that could help the Democratic nominee in Georgia, Arizona and North Carolina.The campaign also sees opportunities for pickups in New Hampshire and especially in Minnesota, states that have voted for Democrats in recent presidential races but where the margins were close in 2016. But while the campaign manager Brad Parscale has insisted New Mexico is within reach, other Trump advisers say there's been little movement, in part because of the president's disinterest in taking the day trips he favors to the western part of the country.In an interview, Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the R.N.C., said they have the resources to appeal to multiple groups of voters. ""That gives us an advantage to focus on the rural vote that we need to turn out, but then also go after places where we've lost voters to bring them back in,"" she said. And Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman, said they had always planned to woo various demographics, ""regardless of what Democrats in Congress were trying to do to him.""The administration is pulling out the policy stops. Vice President Mike Pence has recently made stops and bus tours in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, highlighting Trump administration efforts like the ""school choice"" initiative to help low-income students enter private schools.On Thursday, Mr. Trump tweeted that he was looking to move away from a proposal pushed by his former energy secretary, Rick Perry: storing nuclear waste in Nevada's Yucca Mountain, an effort his two top political advisers, Bill Stepien and Justin Clark, opposed for years. And officials are expected to hold events in the Midwest highlighting provisions aimed at helping domestic automakers that were included in the U.S.M.C.A. trade deal.""We've been chopping wood for a while, and it feels like everyone else is seeing what we've been seeing for a long time,"" said Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law who is overseeing his campaign. ""Everyone else has been distracted, but it's not like we invented these policies for the State of the Union.""What's unclear, and what could prove decisive, is whether the country is exhausted by Mr. Trump and is ready for a so-called return to normalcy, or if voters have grown inured to his eruptions and have effectively priced in his behavior.A key factor will be the candidate the Democrats eventually nominate. Interviews with more than a dozen Republican strategists, lawmakers and state chairs reveal a consensus that Senator Bernie Sanders would be the easiest Democrat for them to beat because they believe his avowed socialism would help them reclaim suburbanites and better frame the election as a choice.""It's easy to call him a socialist because he admits it,"" said Tim Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor. ""At least Warren tries to deny it.""Mr. Sanders's aides, of course, see it very differently and believe that they would tear up Mr. Trump's 2016 electoral map by reclaiming working-class white voters in states like Michigan and Wisconsin, something some Trump advisers agree with. And Trump advisers have been caught by surprise by the success of Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind.""We don't have a Democratic opponent yet,"" said Mr. Cramer. ""It's always harder to run against the unnamed opponent. Once you have the opponent, you get to draw the distinctions.""PhotographPresident Trump on Friday in North Carolina. Mr. Trump's campaign is trying to address his re-election bid's greatest weaknesses by targeting suburban voters with ads and policy priorities.

| Jump to first hitThe House impeachment managers sought to put the Senate on trial while the president's defense team argued he that had done nothing wrong.WASHINGTON -- In their final appeals in President Trump's impeachment trial, House Democrats argued on Monday that he had corrupted the presidency and would continue to put American interests at risk if the Senate failed to remove him from office. Mr. Trump's defenders, denouncing the case against him, said he had done nothing wrong and should be judged by voters.Making their closing arguments from the well of the Senate, the House managers and the president's lawyers invoked history and the 2020 presidential campaign as Democrats and Republicans prepared to take the fight over Mr. Trump's fate to the broader public arena. Neither side expected to change the outcome of the final vote on Wednesday, when the Senate is all but certain to acquit the president, largely along party lines.The Democratic impeachment managers, led by Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, warned that Mr. Trump had tried to rig the 2020 election in his favor -- by withholding military aid from Ukraine in an effort to pressure the country to investigate his political rivals -- and had put a blot on the presidency that would stain those who failed to stand up to him. Calling the president ""a man without character or ethical compass,"" Mr. Schiff insisted that now was the time for members of his own party to choose between normalizing corruption or removing it.""Truth matters to you. Right matters to you,"" Mr. Schiff said, making a case aimed at Republicans. ""You are decent. He is not who you are.""Casting the impeachment managers' case as shoddily constructed, the president's defense team issued a scathing indictment of the House Democrats' argument, contending that removing Mr. Trump from office would subvert the will of the electorate and fundamentally alter the functioning of the separation of powers. Their final word sounded as much like a campaign pitch as a legal defense.""This is an effort to overturn the results of one election and to try to interfere in the coming election that begins today in Iowa,"" said Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, speaking only hours before voting began in the caucuses there. ""The only appropriate result here is to acquit the president and to leave it to the voters to choose their president.""In an awkward confluence of events, Mr. Trump will have an unimpeded platform to make his own final case on Tuesday, when he is to deliver his annual State of the Union address from the floor of the very House that impeached him in December.The abbreviated closing arguments constituted the substantive end of Mr. Trump's impeachment trial, the third such proceeding in American history. In a mark of just how entrenched both sides were in their positions, senators skipped a period of deliberation and instead made their way to Senate floor one by one to announce their positions ahead of Wednesday's final vote on the House's abuse of power and obstruction of Congress charges. In 1999, the Senate spent three days weighing President Bill Clinton's fate during his impeachment proceeding.One moderate Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, broached the idea on Monday of censuring Mr. Trump after the trial concludes, a largely symbolic gesture that he said could attract bipartisan support.""His behavior cannot go unchecked by the Senate,"" Mr. Manchin said, ""and censure would allow a bipartisan statement condemning his unacceptable behavior in the strongest terms.""But given the stark polarization in the chamber -- where most Republicans are reluctant to criticize Mr. Trump and Democrats are almost uniformly in agreement that he should be removed for his behavior -- there was no serious discussion of that option.Despite the president's lawyers' frequent references to the Iowa caucuses, few senators needed a reminder of the political calendar. Just after the arguments concluded, three senators sitting in judgment of Mr. Trump who are running for the Democratic presidential nomination -- Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota -- raced to catch planes back to the Midwest for rallies. A fourth, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, traveled to New Hampshire, which will hold the 2020 race's first primary next week.So far, the senators who have stated their decisions on acquittal or conviction have lined up along party lines, with Democrats echoing the House managers as they announced support for conviction and Republicans insisting the president's removal was unsupportable on varied grounds.""Simply asserting -- at least 63 times -- that their evidence was quote unquote overwhelming doesn't make the House of Representatives' allegations proven or an impeachable offense,"" said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the longest serving Senate Republican, on Monday as he announced his acquittal vote.But several moderate Republicans and Democrats, whose votes could swing against their parties, had yet to declare their intentions. It would take a two-thirds vote of the Senate -- 67 senators -- to convict and remove Mr. Trump, an outcome that appeared far out of reach. Still, the president is eager to be acquitted by a bipartisan vote and to avoid the spectacle of having even one Republican vote to convict him.Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, another potential swing vote, announced that she would vote to acquit Mr. Trump, while also taking jabs at both parties for devolving in a partisan brawl and calling the president's conduct ""shameful and wrong.""""His personal interests do not take precedent over those of this great nation,"" Ms. Murkowski said. But, she added, ""the response to the president's behavior is not to disenfranchise nearly 63 million Americans and remove him from the ballot.""Mr. Manchin said he was still undecided.Monday's closing remarks made evident just how far apart the two sides remained after two weeks of heated arguments before the Senate. They disagree not only on how to interpret the facts of the case, but on what actually constitutes an impeachable offense, too. Lawyers for the president advanced a theory rejected by most scholars that neither abuse of power nor obstruction of Congress met the definition of high crimes and misdemeanors.The House managers insisted that they had compiled a mountain of evidence capped by new disclosures by John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, that Mr. Trump had acted corruptly and with his own interest in mind when he conditioned nearly $400 million of military aid to Ukraine and a meeting at the White House on investigations into his political rivals.Mr. Schiff portrayed it as part of an insidious pattern of conduct -- dating to Mr. Trump's embrace of Russian election interference on his behalf in 2016 -- that continues to put the country at risk.""The short, plain, sad, incontestable answer is no, you can't, you can't trust this president to do the right thing,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""Not for one minute, not for one election, not for the sake of our country. You just can't. He will not change, and you know it.""Mr. Trump then tried to shield himself and hide his wrongdoing from the public and Congress, the managers said, by mounting a defiant campaign of obstruction, blocking witness after witness from testifying while refusing to produce a single subpoenaed document.""We know what the president did and why he did it. This fact is seriously not in doubt,"" said Representative Sylvia R. Garcia, Democrat of Texas. ""Senators on both sides of the aisle have said as much. The question for you now is, does it warrant removal from office? We say yes.""Mr. Trump's lawyers condemned the impeachment managers' case as a hastily thrown together partisan enterprise, noting that the only bipartisan vote in the House was in opposition to impeachment.""This is exactly and precisely what the founders feared,"" said Jay Sekulow, one of Mr. Trump's personal lawyers. ""This was the first totally partisan presidential impeachment in our nation's history, and it should be our last.""Mr. Trump's defenders vigorously denied that he withheld the military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting with the nation's president as leverage for investigations into his political rivals, dismissing ample evidence to the contrary. But their claims were narrowly tailored, carefully skirting the new disclosures from Mr. Bolton.Taking aim at the second article of impeachment, charging Mr. Trump with obstruction of Congress, Patrick Philbin, the deputy White House counsel, upbraided the House for jumping ""straight to the ultimate nuclear weapon of the Constitution."" The president, he said, was empowered by decades of precedent to stonewall the House's subpoenas, and to assert otherwise would be ""antithetical to the proper functioning of the separation of powers.""The dueling arguments were a prelude to the senators' final vote, capping the five-month impeachment drama.Michael D. Shear, Patricia Mazzei and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.PhotographJay Sekulow, a lawyer for President Trump, condemned the ""totally partisan impeachment."" Representative Adam B. Schiff, near left, told Republicans that Mr. Trump ""is not who you are.""

| Jump to first hitWith millions of ballots left to count, it is impossible to know how the delegates will be allocated.LOS ANGELES -- California appeared to deliver a pivotal victory to Senator Bernie Sanders Tuesday night, driven by a coalition of Latinos, young people and liberal voters up and down the state. With 415 pledged delegates, California is by far the biggest prize of Super Tuesday and Mr. Sanders had been banking on a significant win there.With millions of ballots left to count, it is impossible to know how the delegates will be allocated, and it may not be clear for several days or even weeks. Roughly two-thirds of California delegates are distributed based on congressional districts, with candidates needing at least 15 percent of the vote to win any delegates.But with Mr. Sanders receiving more than 70 percent of Latino voters under the age of 30, and about half of Latino voters over all, according to exit polls, his lead over the other candidates looked decisive.The Associated Press projected Mr. Sanders as the winner of the state just minutes after the polls closed, while thousands of voters in Los Angeles County were still in line to cast their ballots because of problems with voting machines.A new $300 million voting system caused waits as long as four hours at dozens of polling sites throughout Los Angeles County, including in Westwood, the San Fernando Valley, Los Feliz and the east side of Los Angeles. The sign-in process to check voters against the voting rolls took hours at several sites, and internet issues left many centers with a small fraction of working machines. Lines continued past 10 p.m. at many locations, including several college campuses.More than 4 million mail-in ballots had been sent in by Tuesday morning, and as many as 5 million ballots were left to count by Wednesday, according to an analysis from Political Data Inc., a California-research group that closely tracks returns.Along with Mr. Sanders, both former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, seemed likely to receive delegates in the state, based on early returns. Mr. Bloomberg had poured $66 million into television advertising here, far more than any other candidate.[Sign up for California Today, our daily newsletter about the Golden State.]State officials moved up the state's primary to March this year in an attempt to make California more politically influential when it comes to choosing the Democratic presidential nominee. The change meant that voters saw far more television advertisements: roughly $120 million worth, with the majority coming from Mr. Bloomberg.Several candidates visited parts of the state that have long been ignored in statewide elections, including Bakersfield and Riverside. Still, California never drew the candidates of early-voting states like Iowa or New Hampshire and most of the candidates relied on national news coverage to gain recognition in the state.There was a clear generational split in the state, with Mr. Sanders winning among voters under 49, but Mr. Biden was the clear preference with voters older than 50. Mr. Biden won among older voters, black voters and moderates in California, the same coalition that helped him win several other states Tuesday. Mr. Sanders appeared to win among voters at all education levels, according to exit polls.Mr. Sanders won more white and Asian-American voters, but reflecting a national trend, Mr. Biden took the lead among black voters, according to exit polls. Voters who chose a candidate in the final days sided with Mr. Biden by a 10-point margin, those polls showed.In 2016, California proved to be something of a firewall for Hillary Clinton, who beat Mr. Sanders with 53 percent of the vote to his 46 percent. That year, the state voted in June, when the primary race was all but over.This year it was Mr. Sanders who counted on California to be his own firewall. His campaign frequently referred to the ""first five"" states, lumping California with Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. In turn, the campaign poured significant resources into advertising and organizing in a state that has traditionally been viewed as impossible to penetrate by door knocking because of its vast size.Mr. Sanders also held several large rallies in California, including one at Venice Beach in December with Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, and several in the final days before Tuesday's vote.""I'm cautiously optimistic that later in the evening, we can win the largest state in this country, the state of California,"" Mr. Sanders said during a rally in Vermont, before the polls had closed in California.For months, the Sanders campaign focused its efforts in heavily Latino neighborhoods around the state, from the Coachella Valley and Bakersfield to Santa Ana, as well as in South and East Los Angeles.For Lorena Vellanowth, Mr. Sanders clearly showed a commitment to issues that she believes are important to Latino voters. Ms. Vellanowth came to Los Angeles from Mexico as a baby, and her daughter went on to graduate from U.C.L.A., and then to attend graduate school at the University of Southern California.But all that success came with a big caveat: Her daughter, who works in public administration for the city of Anaheim, is struggling under the weight of almost a half-million dollars in student loans.""Bigger than my mortgage,"" said Ms. Vellanowth, 43, who works in health care. She said her daughter is getting married this month, and she worries about how her daughter and husband will ever be able to afford having children, or buy a home.That reason alone was enough to draw her, and many of her family members and friends in the Latino community in Los Angeles to Mr. Sanders, attracted, she said, by his message of fighting the type of inequality they feel every day.""I'm Latina, and you'd think that's not someone I'd vote for, an old white guy,"" she said on Monday afternoon, standing outside a polling place at a park in the heavily Latino East Los Angeles named for Ruben Salazar, a Los Angeles journalist who was killed in 1970 during a protest against the Vietnam War.But she worries about her candidate's future, now that the establishment of the Democratic Party is coalescing around Mr. Biden.""I just hope the Democratic Party doesn't screw him,"" she said, of Mr. Sanders. Ms. Vellanowth, who became an American citizen in 2013 and cast her first presidential vote for Mr. Sanders in the 2016 primary, said she feared history would repeat itself, with the moderates of the party gathering around Mr. Biden as they did with Hillary Clinton in 2016, thwarting Mr. Sanders's candidacy.Mr. Sanders also captured the imagination of California's young people, many of whom are struggling with the exorbitant cost of living in the state and buckling under student loans.""It's called a living wage for a reason,"" said Alex Mora, 24, who lives in East Los Angeles, and voted for Mr. Sanders because of his promise to raise the minimum wage. ""A lot of us are stuck at home and we can't find a way out because of how low paying our jobs are.""In California, which has the fifth-largest economy in the world but is also home to the highest poverty rate in the nation when housing costs are factored, wealth inequality has been a paramount political issue driving voters to the polls.With such a wealth chasm as a backdrop, Mr. Sanders's platform of ""Medicare for all,"" free college tuition and student loan relief has resonated deeply. He has also promised to protect so-called dreamers -- immigrants who arrived in the country illegally as children -- and roll back the Trump administration's executive orders on immigration.It's not only California's poor and working class who have supported Mr. Sanders; some who may not struggle financially have been moved by the stark inequality they see every day.""He's the one who seems like he's most likely to improve the quality of life for the average person,"" said Michael Lussier, 29, who works in real estate.Mr. Lussier lives in downtown Los Angeles, which has been engulfed by a worsening homeless crisis. ""Living so close to all that makes it harder to vote for anyone who will perpetuate the status quo,"" he said.PhotographU.C.

| Jump to first hitThe president is brazenly grabbing his only clear option to bolster his re-election hopes, portraying himself as a take-charge leader the country can't afford to lose.WASHINGTON -- With the economy faltering and the political landscape unsettled as the coronavirus death toll climbs, a stark and unavoidable question now confronts President Trump and his advisers: Can he save his campaign for re-election when so much is suddenly going so wrong?After three years of Republicans' championing signs of financial prosperity that were to be Mr. Trump's chief re-election argument, the president has never needed a new message to voters as he does now, not to mention luck. At this point, the president has one clear option for how to proceed politically, and is hoping that an array of factors will break his way.The option, which he has brazenly pushed in recent days, is to cast himself as a ""wartime president"" who looks in charge of a nation under siege while his likely Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., is largely out of sight hunkered down in Delaware. This gambit, however, requires a rewriting of history -- Mr. Trump's muted approach to the virus early on -- and it's far from clear if many voters will accept the idea of him as a wartime leader.Then there are other variables that he and his allies hope will fall in their favor: that the outbreak of the virus will slow and, in the warmer months, dissipate; that the states will get it under control; that the federal government's steps taken so far will flatten the curve; that Mr. Biden and the Democrats will look impotent and inconsequential by comparison; and that enough voters will move past his initial efforts to play down the virus's dangers.The great unknown, of course -- and the tremendous risk to Mr. Trump's political fate, no matter what he says or does -- is that the human cost, the economic toll, and the longevity and course of the pandemic are all X factors that will most likely play out for months and could be strongly salient if not severe by the time of the November general election.In perhaps the best-case scenario for Mr. Trump, the patina of a ""wartime president"" could prove to be influential with casual voters who don't dig into the details of his belated response to the coronavirus, which included dismissing the criticism of his handling of the threat as a Democratic ""hoax"" and contributing to a slow start in testing for the virus.""He is counting on people being so traumatized on a day-to-day basis that they will forget his inaction,"" said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University. ""It's better for him to be a wartime commander in chief than someone who, when the big crisis hit, misread it completely.""Politically, Mr. Brinkley said, the new posture made sense. ""He can claim credit for the curve flattening at some point,"" he said, ""and hope people will be afraid to push a leader out of office if the crisis pushes into the fall.""The president's course correction showed some quick results that were seized on by his political advisers. An ABC News poll released last week showed that 55 percent of Americans approved of Mr. Trump's response to the pandemic, up from 43 percent the week before.Rarely have incumbent presidents seen their arguments for re-election evaporate so quickly. Mr. Trump and his advisers had planned to argue that the strong economy warranted a second term and that supporters and detractors alike wanted their 401(k)'s in the Trump-era stock market; that has now become an impossible sell. And as the administration negotiates an enormous bailout package with Congress for multiple industries, his strategy of caricaturing Democrats as ""socialists"" is not tenable either.So Mr. Trump is trying to mount a new version of his old argument: that ""I alone can fix it,"" as he said at the 2016 Republican convention about the nation's problems. He is counting on enough voters believing they have to stick by a leader in the midst of an immense global crisis.Addressing fearful Americans, Mr. Trump said on Sunday evening: ""You have a leader that will always fight for you and I will not stop until we win. This is going to be a victory."" He added at another point, ""No American is alone as long as we're united.""But shortly after reading his new script on Sunday night, Mr. Trump mocked Senator Mitt Romney of Utah for self-quarantining. ""Romney's in isolation? Gee, that's too bad,"" he said sarcastically at the briefing room podium.Mr. Trump is on uncertain political ground. His poll numbers in critical swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan have been wavering, with most surveys showing him behind Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Republican officials are banking on voters seeing him as take-charge in contrast to Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, who have been following the government's guidance about staying indoors but have not yet found memorable ways to show how they would lead in this crisis.Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have held news conferences from remote locations, and Mr. Biden has participated in ""virtual"" fund-raisers. While Mr. Biden has an all but insurmountable lead in the race for the Democratic nomination, he has no real ability to steer events because he is not officially the presumptive nominee, and therefore is not the head of the party either.As a result, Mr. Biden finds himself with far fewer options than Mr. Trump or Democratic governors like Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, who have real authority and are holding news conferences often broadcast live.In turn, Republican officials and Sanders allies are pushing out attacks on Mr. Biden's low profile, asking ""Where's Joe?"" in emails to supporters and the news media. (A spokesman, T.J. Ducklo, said Sunday that Mr. Biden had not been tested for the virus because he had shown no symptoms.)But the ""wartime"" strategy also presents risks to Mr. Trump. In his new posture, he is trying to rewrite recent history, erasing his comments from as recently as a week ago when he told Americans that they needed to ""just relax"" because ""it all will pass."" It is also undercut by his resistance to calls for additional federal action from governors in hard-hit states.Mr. Trump's temperament is also dissimilar to ""wartime presidents"" with whom he is seeking to compare himself. Over the course of his presidency, Mr. Trump has struggled to stick to any bipartisan message, or speak emotionally to the pain and fear of Americans during crisis points like natural disasters or mass shootings.""That's why it's so hard to be a wartime president,"" said Michael Beschloss, the historian and author of ""Presidents of War."" ""Not only are you coming up with a strategy and tactics, but at the same time you have to let Americans know that you know how hard this is for them.""Mr. Trump, so far, has struggled to feel anyone's pain, unlike past presidents, while continuing to play out the fights with the news media that enliven his base. Last week, he lashed out at a journalist who had prompted him to explain what his message was to the millions of Americans watching him from home, who felt scared.The president has also continued to credit his own administration's response. But Mr. Beschloss added that ""part of being a wartime president is being willing to give people bad news,"" a job Mr. Trump has mostly left to others.At the same time, he has been timid of using wartime powers to fight what he has called an ""invisible enemy."" Last week, for instance, he resisted invoking the Defense Production Act, a federal law that grants presidents extraordinary powers to force American industries to ensure the availability of critical equipment.Mr. Trump's allies are aware that his re-election now hangs almost entirely on how he handles the crisis. And the question is whether he will be seen as President George W. Bush was in the immediate aftermath of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when he was widely viewed as bringing the nation together, or if he will be compared to Mr. Bush amid the fallout from Hurricane Katrina, when he tried to minimize a crisis that eventually became too big for him to ignore, and during which Mr. Bush praised cabinet officials even as the federal government bungled the response.Aides said that how Mr. Trump ends up being perceived would also depend on Mr. Trump's own disposition during the crisis. It is not clear to them whether he will be able to maintain his focus on the crisis for months, especially as the economic situation worsens. Over the weekend, some Trump advisers weren't ready to accept the likelihood of jobless claims climbing into the millions by next month.The White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, defended Mr. Trump's response as apolitical. ""While it seems many in the media continue to use every opportunity to destroy this president, the fact remains that he has risen to fight this crisis by taking aggressive historic action to protect the health, wealth and well-being of the American people,"" Ms. Grisham said in an email.Some Democrats, meanwhile, said the mistakes made at the beginning of the response had already colored how Mr. Trump would be remembered both in the history books and at the ballot box in November. ""At the end of the day, this will be Katrina with the waters at a much higher level, and lasting a longer time,"" said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster.But there is an emerging split in Democratic circles about whether to attack Mr. Trump's response to the virus in real time, or whether the gravity of the moment calls for a pause in negative political advertising and attacks.Some of Mr. Trump's highest-profile political adversaries leading states that have become epicenters of the virus have been striking conciliatory notes as they seek federal assistance. Mr. Cuomo said the president was ""fully engaged"" on the crisis. Gov. Gavin Newsom, Democrat of California, described a recent phone conversation with Mr. Trump as ""a privilege.""Other antagonists have continued to criticize him. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York tapped into one of Mr. Trump's greatest fears when he referred to him on CNN as the ""Herbert Hoover of his generation,"" comparing him to a president who failed to recognize or take bold actions to stave off the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression.The debate about whether to embrace or attack Mr. Trump in a national emergency played out most succinctly on Twitter between David Axelrod and David Plouffe, the two men who led Barack Obama's presidential campaigns.Mr. Axelrod said that voters would have plenty of time to judge Mr. Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis, ""but now doesn't seem the moment for negative ads."" Mr. Plouffe responded that time was of the essence, and that Democrats couldn't afford to ""disarm"" and let Mr. Trump create his own reality.Veterans of John Kerry's 2004 campaign said Mr. Biden was in a stronger position against Mr. Trump than they were when they faced an election against Mr. Bush. Back then, Mr. Bush still basked in good will from his performance in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.Some Democratic Party officials said a comparison between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump at a moment of crisis only helped Mr. Biden.""You can see the contrast between the steady, assured, informed and strong leadership that Vice President Biden has shown and the bungling, chaotic and dishonest start-stop approach that Mr. Trump has shown us since the beginning of this crisis,"" said Gilberto Hinojosa, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.PhotographPresident Trump spoke on Saturday during a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House.

| Jump to first hitSupporters of the former vice president say he can win back union members who rejected Hillary Clinton. But he must overcome some hard feelings first.On the campaign trail, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has highlighted the first two years of the Obama administration as a time when he helped enact sweeping legislation to widen access to health care and revive the economy, accomplishments most Democrats revere.But to many union officials, those years were a disappointment -- a time when the administration failed to pass a labor rights bill that was their top priority and imposed a tax that would affect many union members' health plans. And they partly blame Mr. Biden.""They were in the driver's seat for the first two years, and what did they get done from a labor perspective?"" said Chris Laursen, the president of a United Automobile Workers local in Ottumwa, Iowa, with nearly 600 members. ""Joe Biden is complete status quo.""Since Mr. Biden began his third campaign for the presidency last April, his supporters have portrayed him as the Democrat best positioned to win back union members who deserted the party in 2016 in crucial industrial states.There is some basis for that claim. Mr. Biden, who has longstanding ties to many labor leaders, quickly gained an endorsement from the politically powerful firefighters' union, and just won an endorsement from the ironworkers' union. Polls frequently show him leading other Democratic candidates in battleground-state matchups against President Trump.But for many labor voters -- even white, blue-collar union members whose votes skewed toward Mr. Trump -- the reaction to the former vice president has been more mixed. They frequently cite his policy centrism, which many associate with his time in President Barack Obama's White House.A mid-January poll by SurveyUSA showed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont surging to within three points of Mr. Biden among union households nationally. The combined support of Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has generally outpaced Mr. Biden's among union households since August.The Biden campaign declined to comment, as did a spokesman for Mr. Obama. A campaign surrogate, former Labor Secretary Hilda L. Solis, called Mr. Biden ""a champion for organized labor"" and said, ""It's easy to take more extreme positions on issues when no one holds you accountable for actually enacting them.""The reservations of union members could be a bigger problem for Mr. Biden than they were for Hillary Clinton during her 2016 Democratic race against Mr. Sanders. Some large unions, including the American Federation of Teachers, endorsed Mrs. Clinton, though many members later supported Mr. Sanders.In the current cycle, many of these unions have skipped an early endorsement, making it easier for individual members and in some cases locals to support their own candidates. The teachers' union in Los Angeles has endorsed Mr. Sanders, as has the Ottumwa local of the United Food and Commercial Workers, whose 1.3-million-member international endorsed Mrs. Clinton before the 2016 Iowa caucuses. A large Pennsylvania local of the food workers' union has endorsed Mr. Biden.While the Labor Department recently reported that union membership last year fell to a record low -- 10.3 percent of the work force -- labor endorsements can still be critical because of the role of unions in educating members about candidates and canvassing for them on the ground.Mr. Laursen, the U.A.W. local leader in Ottumwa, estimates that more than half his members -- who are primarily workers at a John Deere plant -- backed Mr. Trump in 2016. But he says many of those who oppose the president's re-election are supporting Mr. Sanders over Mr. Biden.And the skepticism toward Mr. Biden among union voters may be even more pronounced in the less white, less male parts of the labor force.Nicole McCormick, a West Virginia music teacher who helped organize a statewide walkout that made national headlines in 2018, said she worried that Mr. Biden wasn't ""willing to push for the things that we as Americans look at as radical, but the rest of the world looks at and is like, 'We did that 50 years ago.""' She cited expanded access to unions, universal health care and paid parental leave as examples.(Mr. Biden has proposed wide-ranging labor-law reforms, though his plan isn't as ambitious as Mr. Sanders's or Ms. Warren's in some respects. He supports paid family leave.)Keon Liberato, the president of a Philadelphia-based local of more than 200 workers who maintain and construct railroad tracks, said many of his members preferred Mr. Sanders. Mr. Liberato said his members, both African-American and white, knew Mr. Biden as a friend to railroad workers, but tended to believe that taking health care off the bargaining table under Mr. Sanders's Medicare for All plan ""would be huge for the American people.""In voicing their concerns about Mr. Biden, union officials frequently cite dismay over the Obama years. They acknowledge a number of accomplishments, including the economic stimulus, the rescue of Chrysler and General Motors, and elements of the Affordable Care Act, as well as a variety of pro-labor appointments and regulations. But they express reservations about the administration's focus on deficit reduction, its ties to Wall Street, and especially its efforts to lower barriers to foreign competition.""I was really disappointed with his trade policies,"" said Nick Diveley, a U.A.W. member in Ottumwa, who supported Mr. Obama in 2008. ""That's what pushed me to Trump."" Mr. Diveley said he was open to voting for someone other than Mr. Trump in the fall but called Mr. Biden ""just another established Washington guy.""Union members and leaders also grumble about the so-called Cadillac tax on expensive health care plans that the Obama administration sought as a way to rein in wasteful spending. ""It was an egghead Ivy League idea, that people overuse health care,"" said D. Taylor, the president of the hospitality and casino workers union UNITE HERE, which helped lead the unsuccessful fight against the tax.(The union was supportive of the law and the administration over all; the tax was recently repealed.)And some complain that the Obama administration delayed action on labor's top priority -- a bill that could have expanded their ranks by making it easier to unionize through a sign-up process called card check, rather than a secret ballot -- partly so that it could focus on health care.""He failed to fight for our priorities and stand up for the main reason we endorsed him -- card check,"" said Norwood Orrick, a telecom technician and member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in Tampa, Fla. ""It was discussed a lot in my immediate circles of activists.""Beyond any single policy, there are complaints that the Obama administration sometimes treated labor as an interest group to be managed rather than a partner in making policy. Ana Avendaño, a former senior official at the A.F.L.-C.I.O., recalled a White House meeting on immigration that the federation's president, Richard Trumka, attended.""They sat him at one of the corners of the table,"" squeezed between two other people, Ms. Avendaño said. ""He couldn't even open his pad. In D.C. terms, it was a show of disrespect.""A spokesman for Mr. Trumka said: ""While President Trumka worked with and respected President Obama, he felt there were times when the president tried to split the difference between Main Street and Wall Street. That did not serve him or us well.""Some labor officials and union members see the more pragmatic approach of the Obama years, and Mr. Biden's moderate reputation, as a selling point. ""Our guys lean 55 percent Republican,"" said Thomas Hanify, president of the Indiana firefighters' union. ""Over all for my members, Warren and Bernie Sanders are a little extreme.""And many prefer Mr. Biden's approach to health care, voicing concern that Mr. Sanders would do away with insurance plans that unions have worked hard to negotiate.Other labor leaders, while citing shortcomings of the Obama presidency, say Mr. Biden was an advocate for their interests within the administration. Teachers' unions were furious after Mr. Obama publicly embraced the firing of the entire faculty of an underperforming school in Rhode Island in 2010. But Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, said Mr. Biden helped resolve the situation.""We started having a fairly heated argument, me and the vice president, at an A.F.L. meeting,"" Ms. Weingarten said. ""But he heard what I was saying.""Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser to Mr. Biden during his vice presidency, said the same was often true on trade and other issues, including labor-law reform, which faced a complicated path in the Senate. ""I know for a fact where Biden is on these things,"" Mr. Bernstein said. ""But he was part of an administration that at times very much pleased the unions, and at other times very much pissed them off.""(As a senator, Mr. Biden supported some free-trade legislation, like the North American Free Trade Agreement.)But many labor officials regard Mr. Biden as essentially a sympathetic face for unfriendly policies he was either powerless to reverse or personally advanced. One cited Mr. Biden's role in leading the negotiations with Republicans over a long-term deficit-cutting deal that could have led to cuts in programs like Social Security and Medicare.Mr. Biden, whose record on Social Security has been a subject of sparring with the Sanders campaign, says he supports an expansion of benefits for many retirees.Frank Flanders, the political director of the food workers' local in Ottumwa, said that he was skeptical of Mr. Biden's views on trade and his more hawkish foreign policy views, and that he regarded Mr. Biden as a ""corporate Democrat.""""I think we had a lot of Trump voters in the general, for the most part it's because he wasn't Hillary,"" said Mr. Flanders, describing how his members voted in 2016. ""It's also a concern I have about a Biden candidacy.""PhotographChris Laursen, the president of a U.A.W. local in Iowa, said most of his members backed President Trump or Bernie Sanders.

| Jump to first hitRoughly 80 members of Congress, cabinet secretaries and administration officials will descend on the state to drive voter enthusiasm and make a show of force.WASHINGTON -- The Iowa caucuses on Monday will be a competitive race for only one party, the Democrats, but President Trump's campaign does not see it that way.Roughly 80 cabinet secretaries, administration officials and members of Congress will descend on the state that day to drive voter enthusiasm and make a show of force intended to jolt whoever emerges as the Democratic caucus winner.The surrogates will include two former presidential candidates who once campaigned against Mr. Trump in Iowa: Housing Secretary Ben Carson and Rick Perry, the former energy secretary.Mr. Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, as well as Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will fan out to speak to Iowa voters at various caucus sites. A group of Trump loyalists from the House -- including Representatives Elise Stefanik of New York, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Matt Gaetz of Florida -- will also be on the ground to make their case for Mr. Trump, the campaign announced Tuesday.They will be joined by a host of loyal ""formers,"" including Mr. Trump's former 2016 campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski; the former White House communications director, Bill Shine; and Matthew Whitaker, an Iowa native who briefly served as the acting attorney general.""Our Caucus Day operation is just a preview of what is to come,"" said Brad Parscale, Mr. Trump's 2020 campaign manager. ""This will be the strongest, best funded and most organized presidential campaign in history. We are putting the Democrats on notice: good luck trying to keep up with this formidable re-election machine.""The idea is to show off a deep well of support for Mr. Trump even as Democrats are choosing their nominee in a nail-biter of a contest that will help whoever emerges as the winner and determine the shape of the rest of the party's primary fight.Senator Bernie Sanders, the crowd-drawing independent from Vermont, has placed first in Iowa in a series of polls, and Mr. Trump has recently been seeking to elevate his candidacy. Mr. Trump has also been focused on Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City, who is running a parallel effort in the states that will vote on Super Tuesday on March 3 and skip Iowa altogether.Incumbents -- and party nominees -- often try to swamp early states where their opponents are campaigning by flying in government officials who volunteer their personal time for the campaign, along with lawmakers and aides. But Mr. Trump's show of force is still unusual.""I'm even pleasantly taken aback by this over-the-top interest in Iowa,"" said Jeff Kaufmann, the chairman of the Iowa Republican Party. ""This is about making a statement on the part of the president.""Mr. Trump placed second in Iowa in 2016, after Senator Ted Cruz of Texas. This time around, two Republican challengers, Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman, and Bill Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts, have failed to make any dent in Mr. Trump's support from Republican voters.But the Trump campaign said their showing in Iowa was less about two opponents it has been studiously ignoring and more about recruiting volunteers and small-dollar donors, with whom they will continue to engage through November.""Strategically, it's important for Trump surrogates to be in Iowa to consume some of the media coverage,"" said David Bossie, who was Mr. Trump's deputy campaign manager in 2016 and plans to participate in the Iowa offensive. ""We want to plant the flag, because we are looking ahead to the general election.""Mr. Bossie said it would be a mistake to ignore a battleground state simply because there was no competitive primary on the Republican side.""I don't think anybody on that plane is worried about Bill Weld,"" added Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union. ""This campaign is always on offense; it's on its front foot. It doesn't give Democrats a day to do their own thing.""Mr. Trump himself is expected in Des Moines for a rally on Thursday night, a move Mr. Kaufmann compared to President Ronald Reagan showing up in Iowa during his re-election campaign in 1984.""Back then, he had no competition in the caucus, but he made it a statement that he's not taking Iowa for granted,"" Mr. Kaufmann said. ""For all practical purposes, this is the beginning of the general election.""PhotographHousing Secretary Ben Carson is one of the former presidential candidates who will travel to Iowa to support President Trump.

| Jump to first hitPrimary elections are being pushed back. The Olympics are officially in 2021. The election-year calendar seemed set in stone and now it is up in the air.There is a rhythm to it all, in happier times, a procession of dates and checkpoints to spread the politics and patriotism neatly across the calendar.The presidential primaries tick past, Tuesday by Tuesday, through the spring. Former rivals hug it out at their party conventions in the summer. The Olympics bring the sides together, briefly, in merry distraction and shared cause before the fall. And then comes November, when half of the country is disappointed again.So, what happens when immovable dates become negotiable -- when everything does -- in the throes of a pandemic? What must hold firm when nothing seems to?Primaries are postponed. Hugs are postponed. The Olympics are postponed.The November election, everyone appears to agree, cannot be.""We voted in the middle of a Civil War,"" Joseph R. Biden Jr., the heavy favorite for the Democratic nomination, told supporters at a tele-fund-raiser on Sunday. ""We voted in the middle of World War I and II. And so, the idea of postponing the electoral process is just -- seems to me, out of the question.""And yet for weeks, the moment has delivered one reminder after the next of all that the crisis has made wobbly, all that seemed certain before certainty went into quarantine.Dates exist in stone until they don't. Younger people are spared the worst of the virus's ravages until they aren't. American ideals, in 2020, leave no room for the concession of mass death, surely. But then here is a White House now suggesting that the cure (stifling business for a period to encourage social distancing) cannot become worse than the disease (the disease).The result is as disorienting as the messaging. What does progress look like when the healthiest course is collective stasis? What is there to drive toward, to look forward to, when the common benchmarks of the year -- weddings, athletic seasons, state elections -- seem to be punted further from reach?""We're not that familiar with a sense of tribulation as a part of daily life,"" said Jill Lepore, a professor of history at Harvard University and author of ""These Truths: A History of the United States."" ""The basic American middle-class is not used to the idea that time could be moving backwards. And at the moment, what it feels like for most people is almost that time is standing still.""Already, meaningful electoral proceedings have been delayed or recast. Many states have pushed their primaries into June in the hopes of waiting out the worst of the virus. Pennsylvania, slated for April 28, is likely to be next. Senator Bernie Sanders, Mr. Biden's chief rival, has effectively converted his campaign into a pandemic policy shop and vessel for progressive activism as he confronts a significant delegate deficit. Planners for the Democratic National Convention said this week that they were assessing ""contingency options"" in case the July gathering cannot go on as planned.But the general election is another matter. No one in a position of relevant authority has proposed moving it, though the subject has instantly become a cause of angst for President Trump's critics. These fears seem to owe more to Mr. Trump's attacks on democratic norms and institutions during his time in office than anything the president has said of late.So far, Mr. Trump has appeared inclined to defy the guidance of public health experts by suggesting Americans return to their workplaces and public engagements well before the coronavirus has been tamed.Even if he wished to delay the November election, the decision would appear to be out of his hands. Any change to the date would require federal legislation, passed by Congress, to say nothing of challenges in the court system.The prospect of that kind of bipartisan collaboration on an issue of this magnitude is exceedingly slim.Still, some academics have processed the official coronavirus response with alarm, warning that the present blend of institutional distrust and health-minded limits on personal liberties could prove dangerous.""In the next months, defenders of democracy need to sustain this very careful balancing act between overreacting to justified emergency measures on the one side and not easily going along with real attacks on our democratic institutions on the other,"" said Yascha Mounk, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University who has written extensively about threats to liberal democracy. ""That's going to be incredibly difficult.""Of heightened concern to some Democrats is the specter of state leaders citing the virus to impose voting constraints that might disproportionately affect left-leaning cities. ""They will find a way to make it hard,"" said Amanda Litman, the executive director of Run for Something, an organization that helps Democrats run for local office. ""And we have to find a way to mitigate that as much as possible -- at home, without a lot of funds.""Even absent any cynical application of voting restrictions, some lawmakers worry that lingering civic confusion and uncertainty might hamper turnout with key constituencies.On Tuesday, a group of House Democrats addressed a letter to the White House requesting a shelter-in-place order of at least two weeks for the entire country, arguing that such an approach made sense on both public safety and long-term economic grounds.The note's lead author, Representative Ro Khanna of California, said that part of the urgency flowed from a need to head off as many disruptions and complications as possible before November.""Getting a shelter-in-place now for two to three weeks would mitigate the risk of having a catastrophe or re-emergence closer to November,"" Mr. Khanna, a national campaign co-chair for Mr. Sanders, said in an interview.He added that officials should be exploring alternatives to traditional voting like vote-by-mail wherever possible.In the interim, Ms. Lepore, the historian, said it was dislocating enough merely fumbling through the unknown. ""We keep saying around here in my household: 'If we knew it was two weeks, we could pace ourselves,""' she said. ""'If we knew it was a month, we could pace ourselves.""'But then, what about six months?What about November?PhotographAaron Sellers cleaned a machine at the Franklin County Board of Elections in Columbus, Ohio, before the state decided to push its primary to June 2 from March 17.

| Jump to first hitWith solid support from liberals, Mr. Sanders appears to be peaking just as the caucuses approach. But many Iowa voters said they could still change their mind.DES MOINES -- Senator Bernie Sanders has opened up a lead in Iowa just over a week before the Democratic caucuses, consolidating support from liberals and benefiting from divisions among more moderate presidential candidates who are clustered behind him, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers.Mr. Sanders has gained six points since the last Times-Siena survey, in late October, and is now capturing 25 percent of the vote in Iowa. Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. have remained stagnant since the fall, with Mr. Buttigieg capturing 18 percent and Mr. Biden 17 percent.The rise of Mr. Sanders has come at the expense of his fellow progressive, Senator Elizabeth Warren: she dropped from 22 percent in the October poll, enough to lead the field, to 15 percent in this survey. Senator Amy Klobuchar, who is garnering 8 percent, is the only other candidate approaching double digits.The changing fortunes of the leading candidates underscores the volatile nature of the primary after more than a year of campaigning, as voters wrestle with which candidate can defeat President Trump. Despite the ascent of Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, the poll also highlighted the combined appeal of the centrists: 55 percent of those surveyed said they preferred a standard-bearer who is ""more moderate than most Democrats."" Just 38 percent said they wanted one who is ""more liberal than most Democrats.""As the strength of the other leading candidates has ebbed and flowed, Mr. Sanders, making his second run for the White House, appears to be peaking at the right time. This month was the first time he has finished atop a poll in Iowa, after also leading a Des Moines Register-CNN survey two weeks ago. The Times-Siena poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4.8 percentage points.A victory by Mr. Sanders in Iowa, where he suffered a narrow loss to Hillary Clinton four years ago, would represent a remarkable comeback for a 78-year-old candidate whose heart attack in October threatened to upend his candidacy. It would also create a moment of high anxiety for establishment-aligned Democrats who are deeply alarmed about a potential Sanders nomination.Should he prevail in Iowa and face a similarly fractured field of mainstream rivals in New Hampshire, where he also currently leads in the polls, Mr. Sanders could be difficult to slow.Several voters who backed Mr. Sanders cited the consistency of his positions over the course of his career, and their ideological alignment with his views.""Bernie's authentic,"" said Austin Sturch, 25, of Evansdale, adding, ""Pretty much everything he's saying -- I can't put it better than he can.""Still, much here remains uncertain. Iowa voters are famous for settling on a candidate late, and this year is no different; Mr. Sanders, along with the other senators in the race, is pinned down in Washington during Mr. Trump's impeachment trial and unable to campaign here on weekdays.And the final results could turn on two factors that will not be known until caucus night: the size and composition of the electorate, and the preferences of voters whose first choices are eliminated because of the arcane caucus rules.If the other leading candidates finish bunched together on caucus night on Feb. 3, it is unlikely any of them will drop out of the race after Iowa. Each of the three top hopefuls trailing Mr. Sanders has the money to compete in New Hampshire, which is just a week later.And should no clear moderate alternative to Mr. Sanders emerge from the early nominating states, the self-financing Michael R. Bloomberg, who has already spent more than $260 million on advertising and hired more than 1,000 staff members, is awaiting the field on Super Tuesday in early March.But first is Iowa, where the race remains up for grabs to an unusual degree so late in the race: In the Times poll, nearly 40 percent of voters said they could still be persuaded to caucus for a different candidate.Mr. Sanders, however, has some of the most committed supporters in the race and, significantly, his advantage with Iowa Democrats does not ebb when the field is narrowed to only the top four candidates. The Vermont senator still leads by seven points in that scenario, according to the survey, capturing 30 percent of the vote while Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg both win 23 percent and Ms. Warren garners 19 percent.These results are important because of how the caucuses work in Iowa. Candidates must receive 15 percent support in a precinct to reach what is called viability, meaning they are eligible to win delegates. If a candidate falls short of that number, his or her supporters can either leave the caucus or support better-performing contenders for the second and final vote of the evening. So voters' second choices can prove crucial.Ms. Warren, according to the poll, is the top second-choice preference of caucusgoers, which could lift her candidacy after the initial vote. But that is in part because she is the preferred alternative for those who support Mr. Sanders, who will most likely meet the viability threshold in nearly all of the caucuses.Ms. Warren received a boost Saturday night, however, when she won the endorsement of Iowa's largest and most influential newspaper, the Des Moines Register.Ms. Klobuchar's supporters could play the most crucial role, though, should she fail to achieve 15 percent in most precincts. When voters were asked whom they would support if they were left with only four choices -- Mr. Sanders, Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren -- Mr. Biden was the overwhelming favorite of Ms. Klobuchar's backers. He received 55 percent of them in this scenario while Ms. Warren received 18 percent.One troubling sign for Mr. Sanders came in an ideological matchup with Mr. Trump. In The Times/Siena poll, 56 percent of caucusgoers said they thought a democratic socialist would have a harder rather than an easier time defeating the president -- a higher number than those who said the same about a woman, a gay candidate or one over 75.In fact, among general election voters in Iowa, a state he carried by nearly 10 points four years ago, Mr. Trump defeated all of the top five candidates as well as Mr. Bloomberg in head-to-head matchups. He bested Mr. Sanders, 48 percent to 42 percent.More broadly, the survey of Iowa Democrats showcases the same generational and ideological divisions that the party is grappling with nationally -- and helps illuminate why voters are so deeply divided over whom to support.Mr. Sanders leads with Iowa voters under 30, taking 40 percent of that bloc, which is more than double his nearest competitor in the demographic. But he is winning only 9 percent among voters 65 and older. At the same time, Mr. Biden is capturing 32 percent of the vote among those over 65 but receiving just 10 among the youngest Iowa caucusgoers.Mr. Sanders's advantage owes largely to voters who align with his progressive agenda: 43 percent of caucusgoers who call themselves ""very liberal"" are supporting his bid, well above the next closest candidate.At the same time, those voters who are closer to the political center are split. Among moderate or conservative caucusgoers, 25 percent are backing Mr. Biden, 21 percent are for Mr. Buttigieg and 12 percent are with Ms. Klobuchar. Among those who say they are ""somewhat conservative,"" Ms. Klobuchar garners 28 percent, Mr. Buttigieg 17 percent and Mr. Biden 15 percent.

Of course, voters here do not always fall neatly along ideological lines. Shawn Reynolds, a 68-year-old retired art teacher from Des Moines, said she supported Ms. Warren but Mr. Biden was her second choice.

""I'm really on the fence I guess between the two of them,"" said Ms. Reynolds, adding that she planned to caucus for Ms. Warren and had even volunteered to help set up the Warren corner at her precinct on caucus night despite her ambivalence.

There were several signs in the poll illustrating why Ms. Warren has fallen in Iowa since her peak last fall.

Many voters in Iowa are fixated on elevating a candidate who can beat Mr. Trump, but 38 percent of likely caucusgoers said they thought a female candidate would have a harder time beating Mr. Trump. And only 51 percent of those who indicated Ms. Warren was their first choice said she would be the best at beating Mr. Trump.And while Ms. Warren's support fell across nearly all groups in the poll, her decline was particularly pronounced among young voters. Just 16 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds supported her in the poll, down from 38 percent in October.Ms. Warren has also been trying to quell concerns about her sweeping agenda -- particularly ""Medicare for all"" -- and its impact on the general election. Those efforts appear to have hurt her with some voters here. The poll showed that only 18 percent of likely caucusgoers think she would be best at improving health care -- compared to 32 percent for Mr. Sanders.Those findings bode well for Mr. Sanders. If Ms. Warren does not regain her footing, he can continue to solidify the backing of progressive voters who say they want fundamental change.Another advantage for Mr. Sanders is that he has retained many of his supporters from 2016, when his near-victory against Mrs. Clinton turned him into a credible threat for the Democratic nomination: 48 percent of likely caucusgoers who said Mr. Sanders was their first choice said they had caucused for him last time, too.Among those voters was Deborah Marlin, a 54-year-old small business owner from Clarinda, who said her top issues were Medicare for all and student debt.""He gives people a voice who have not had a voice before,"" she said. ""He sees the unseen such as people with disabilities, low-income workers, people with medical conditions. He sees the younger people in financial distress.""Asked whether she had a second-choice candidate, she said she did not. ""I'm a 'Bernie-or-Bust,""' she said.Nate Cohn and Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting.The New York Times/Siena College Research Institute survey of 1,689 registered voters in Iowa, including 584 Democratic caucusgoers, was conducted from Jan. 20 to Jan. 23. The margin of error due to sampling is plus or minus 4.8 percentage points for the Democratic caucus electorate and plus or minus 2.8 percentage points for registered voters.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders gained six points, landing atop an Iowa poll for the second time this month.

| Jump to first hitAs President Trump appears at daily briefings, the Democratic front-runner faces the challenge of raising his profile in a presidential race that has moved almost entirely into the digital realm.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the likely Democratic nominee against President Trump in this year's general election, was asked a question during a virtual fund-raiser on Sunday that reflected a challenge looming over his campaign as the coronavirus outbreak intensifies.""What I'm concerned about is that we see Donald Trump every day with this crisis giving his press report,"" said one donor, according to a pool report from the fund-raiser, which was conducted by telephone. ""And I would just love to see you more. Like, how do we get more of you and less of him on our airwaves?""Mr. Biden has been taunted by online critics over his relatively low profile since the coronavirus forced him off the campaign trail, with Trump campaign officials and others needling him with the hashtag #WhereIsJoe. The former vice president has not made an appearance on camera in front of the public since he gave a brief live-streamed address from his home on Tuesday, when primaries were held in Florida, Illinois and Arizona.At Sunday's fund-raiser, Mr. Biden said that a recreation room in his home in Delaware had been turned into a television studio, and that he planned to give remarks on Monday. On a conference call with reporters on Friday, Mr. Biden said his campaign was working to increase his ability to speak to the public.""I want to be in daily or at least, you know, significant contact with the American people and communicate what I would be doing, what I think we should be doing and how we should be doing it,"" Mr. Biden said.Mr. Biden's campaign got off to a rocky start with its efforts at virtual campaigning, as a ""virtual town hall"" with Illinois voters this month was marred by technical problems.At Sunday's virtual fund-raiser, Mr. Biden addressed speculation about whether Mr. Trump would try to postpone the general election because of the coronavirus. (The president does not have that authority.)""The idea of postponing the electoral process is just, seems to me, out of the question,"" Mr. Biden said. ""I know there's a lot of rumors and speculation as to, 'Is the other guy going to try to postpone the election in November?' and all that. There's no need to do that.""Mr. Biden also indicated that he was giving serious thought to his potential future running mate, saying that he must ""start that vetting process relatively soon, meaning in a matter of weeks.""""There will be a group that is in excess of six or seven people that I look at, because those background checks matter,"" said Mr. Biden, who has gone through the process himself. He expressed hope that ""once I pick someone, God willing if I'm the nominee, that there's not going to be any snafu.""Mr. Biden's remaining opponent in the primary race, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, has also shifted to campaigning virtually. Mr. Sanders held a live-streamed event on the coronavirus from Burlington, Vt., on Sunday, one of several such events he has done in recent days.Since in-person campaigning came to a halt, Mr. Biden and his team have weighed in repeatedly about the coronavirus, sharply criticizing Mr. Trump's handling of the crisis. But he has struggled to break through given the flood of news about the outbreak, and he lacks the kind of platform that is available to Mr. Trump, who has appeared daily at White House briefings on the virus.Mr. Biden gave a speech about the coronavirus this month and released a plan for responding to the outbreak, and on Friday's conference call with reporters, he urged the president to ""stop saying false things."" But in the past week, he has been largely out of sight even as his campaign presses its case against Mr. Trump over his handling of the crisis.Mr. Biden's team has issued a number of written statements and has posted repeatedly on social media about the subject. His campaign released a video in which Ronald Klain, a former chief of staff to Mr. Biden who served as the Ebola response coordinator in the Obama White House, stands in front of a white board and discusses Mr. Trump's handling of the virus and how Mr. Biden would respond. The video has now been seen four million times on Twitter.Another video from the Biden campaign alternates between playing footage of Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden speaking about the coronavirus. ""This moment calls for a president,"" the video says at the end. ""In November, you can elect one.""A spokesman for the Trump campaign, Matt Wolking, on Sunday accused Mr. Biden of seeking to use the coronavirus for ""political gain at the exact moment the country needs optimism and unity.""""It's also cowardly -- because instead of showing his own face, Biden is having his advisers and allies do most of his dirty work for him,"" he said.Sydney Ember and Katie Glueck contributed reporting.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Wilmington, Del., this month. The coronavirus outbreak has forced him, Senator Bernie Sanders and President Trump to cancel in-person events in the presidential race.

| Jump to first hitThe Vermont senator's announcement came as the Biden, Buttigieg and Warren campaigns are showing signs of financial strain.Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont raised $25 million in January, his campaign said on Thursday, a staggering sum that gives him an enviable financial advantage at a crucial moment in the Democratic primary race.He plans to use the windfall to immediately buy $5.5 million in television and digital ads across 10 states, at a time when some of his rivals are shifting or cutting their existing ad reservations.The $25 million haul is more money than any other candidate raised in any full quarter during 2019, including several presidential hopefuls who hold the big-dollar fund-raisers that Mr. Sanders forgoes. The announcement is the latest sign of an epochal change in money in politics, with candidates now able to finance a top-tier national campaign fueled by masses of donors giving a steady stream of small amounts.For Mr. Sanders's top rivals, the news is likely to be unsettling: Their campaigns are all showing signs of financial strain. Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., has briefly left the campaign trail to raise money, and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is taking time next week for a new batch of fund-raisers.Mr. Sanders can now plan past the New Hampshire primary on Tuesday with greater financial confidence, an important development given the possibility of an extended Democratic primary with multiple candidates including Michael R. Bloomberg, a self-financing billionaire whose full influence will not be felt until March because he is skipping the first four contests.The Sanders campaign also announced that it had received 1.3 million donations in January, and that more than 1.5 million different individuals had donated over the course of the campaign.""Working-class Americans giving $18 at a time are putting our campaign in a strong position to compete in states all over the map,"" said Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, in a statement.The Sanders ad buy includes California and Texas, where the campaign has already been advertising, as well as eight additional states it had not targeted: Arkansas, Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah.Mr. Sanders's show of financial might came as the Democratic candidates are still awaiting final results from Monday's Iowa caucuses, a delay that has had a dampening effect on any one contender developing momentum heading into New Hampshire. Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders are now all but tied in the Iowa delegate race, with 99 percent of precincts reporting, but the lack of an official winner makes it easier for Mr. Sanders to seize the spotlight with his good fund-raising news.Both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg are competing aggressively, along with other candidates, for a victory in New Hampshire, where Mr. Sanders hopes to establish himself as the liberal front-runner ahead of Ms. Warren (who finished third in Iowa) with a repeat of his big win in the state four years ago against Hillary Clinton. His January fund-raising total outpaced the $21.1 million he raised in January 2016 against Mrs. Clinton.Despite only having a few days left to campaign before the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Buttigieg spent Wednesday night holding an evening fund-raiser in New York, with another one scheduled for Thursday morning.A top adviser to Mr. Buttigieg, Michael Halle, wrote a thinly veiled post on Twitter suggesting where a Buttigieg-backing super PAC might best spend its funds, and even alluded to a message that the campaign would appreciate seeing put on television. ""Pete's military experience and closing message from Iowa work everywhere especially in Nevada where it's critical they see this on the air through the caucus,"" Mr. Halle wrote.Ms. Warren's campaign manager, Roger Lau, responded by pointing out what he called a ""fun fact about how some campaigns exploit our broken campaign finance laws,"" suggesting that if Mr. Halle had written that message in private to a super PAC, it could constitute illegal coordination with an outside group.For her part, Ms. Warren has cut nearly $500,000 in future ad reservations in Nevada and South Carolina over the last two days, according to the media tracking firm Advertising Analytics. Those are the two states that follow New Hampshire in voting in February.""I just always want to be careful about how we spend our money,"" Ms. Warren told reporters in New Hampshire on Wednesday.Ms. Warren's campaign told supporters in an email on Tuesday that the Iowa Democratic Party's inability to announce any results on Monday night had muted whatever financial boost she could have received from the caucuses. ""We didn't get a big night of exciting news coverage about them (or the late-night boost in fund-raising that usually comes with it),"" her campaign wrote.As for Mr. Biden, he began 2020 with the least cash on hand of any of the four top candidates -- less than $9 million -- and his apparent fourth-place finish in Iowa already had some in the Democratic establishment skittish about his prospects.His campaign had said ahead of the caucuses that January was his ""strongest month of fund-raising since launch."" An analysis of Federal Election Commission records indicates that his January total was somewhere between about $8 million (his previous high in October 2019) and $9.7 million (his April total).On Wednesday, Mr. Biden was also moving around his ad reservations, with about $150,000 cut from South Carolina and reinvested in Nevada, according to Advertising Analytics. Nevada will hold its caucuses on Feb. 22, and South Carolina has its primary on Feb. 29.The need for cash is apparent from Mr. Biden's schedule: In the days after the New Hampshire primary next week, he has no less than four fund-raisers, including two in New York, one in Denver and one in Reno, Nev.A pro-Biden super PAC, Unite the Country, announced a $900,000 ad campaign in New Hampshire the day after the Iowa caucuses. That would be a sizable share of its remaining funds, according to previous announcements from the group.Steve Schale, its executive director, had said the super PAC was on pace to spend about $6 million in Iowa, and the group announced on Jan. 31 that it had raised $7.6 million ""to date.""As Mr. Biden and other candidates rush to refill coffers after spending millions in Iowa, Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City who is self-financing his 2020 run, awaits the whole field in March.Mr. Bloomberg's presence has acted as something of a potential safe harbor for more moderate donors concerned about both Mr. Sanders's strong showing in Iowa and Mr. Biden's weak one.Reid J. Epstein contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographSen. Bernie Sanders in Derry, N.H., on Wednesday. His campaign said it had received 1.3 million donations in January.

| Jump to first hitOnly a handful of states and territories will try to pick the Democratic nominee with similar practices as Iowa, where officials faced delays and problems reporting results.As Iowa grapples with the aftermath of a Democratic caucus that one party leader called a ""systemwide disaster,"" American voters and election officials are already looking ahead at the handful of other states and American territories that will be picking -- or trying to pick -- the Democratic nominee in similar ways.The number of states that hold caucuses has been dwindling for years, in part at the encouragement of the Democratic National Committee to use a government-run primary. Kansas, Maine and Hawaii are among the latest states to opt for a primary system, which often allows more people to participate than caucuses.In Iowa and elsewhere, caucuses have been criticized for typically taking place only for a few hours of the day and in venues away from a voter's usual precinct. There were more than 1,600 precincts in Iowa on Monday, at schools, libraries, gymnasiums and other venues. There, Democrats gathered in groups to declare their support for one candidate or another -- and to compete for undecided voters.But, because state parties decide the rules of each system, not all caucuses work like Iowa's. Some of the states that have kept their caucuses have made major changes to try to make them more inclusive.Next up, NevadaOn Feb. 22, Nevada Democrats will hold their caucus, capping off four days of early voting that will start on Feb. 15.Democrats in Iowa have been criticized for holding the caucuses at night, a time that makes it harder for parents or people who work in the evenings to participate. They responded by setting up satellite caucuses.In Nevada, the Democratic Party has added caucus sites to the back of casinos so casino employees working that day can participate. Republicans canceled their caucus in Nevada this year.Democrats in the state are also providing caucus materials in Tagalog, in addition to English and Spanish, and are allowing people to vote early instead of having to participate in person.But there is concern that Nevada, which has 48 delegates, could face some of the same problems Iowa faced Monday night, specifically trouble with an app that was supposed to tally and report results.Democrats in Iowa used an app built by Shadow Inc., a for-profit technology company that was also used by the party in Nevada. On Tuesday, the state party chairman William McCurdy II said it would not use the app or vendor.Nevada Democrats, he said, ""can confidently say that what happened in the Iowa caucus last night will not happen in Nevada.""American SamoaAmerican Samoa, a United States territory since 1900, has 11 delegates and will hold its caucus on March 3, which is Super Tuesday -- when more than a dozen states vote in primaries.A cluster of small islands that sit between Hawaii and New Zealand, American Samoa does not participate in the general election. In 2016, Democrats there picked Hillary Clinton, the eventual party nominee.Republicans on the islands, who picked Donald Trump in 2016, will hold their caucus on March 24.North DakotaThe state Democratic Party on March 10 will hold a traditional ""firehouse"" style of caucus, where voting takes place in an open area rather than in a closed polling booth.But the party will also offer voters the chance to cast their ballots by mail as long as they are postmarked by March 3. The party picked Senator Bernie Sanders in 2016.Mr. Trump will be the only presidential candidate on the ballot for Republicans during the party's caucus on March 10.The state Republican Party chairman, Rick Berg, told The Bismarck Tribune he expects the caucus to be ""an evening of getting together with Republicans across the state.""WyomingDemocrats will hold their caucus in Wyoming on April 4, when, for the first time, voters will be able to rank their choices.Voters will be allowed to rank up to five candidates instead of having to choose only one.It is a system being piloted in Alaska, Hawaii and Kansas, and was first tried in Maine in 2018.Like Nevada Democrats, registered voters do not have to show up to caucus sites to be counted. They can drop off their completed ballot or fill it out on March 28. A total of 18 delegates are up for grabs in the primary.Nina Sanchez Hebert, a spokeswoman for the Wyoming Democratic Party, said each caucus location would have a secure computer and Wi-Fi connection to transmit encrypted files, like ballots.Paper ballots would be ""securely retained"" by county officials in case a hand count became necessary, she said. And officials would not employ the app created by Shadow Inc. to tally or report results.""We are not using the same, or any, app to tabulate or transmit results,"" Ms. Hebert said.The majority of caucus voters picked Mr. Sanders as the Democratic nominee in 2016 and Mr. Trump as the Republican nominee. Republicans will pick their nominee by holding conventions.GuamGuam, an American territory in the Pacific Ocean about 128 miles south of the Northern Mariana Islands, will hold its Democratic caucus on May 2.Democrats in the territory, which has 12 delegates, picked Mrs. Clinton in 2016. Guam also cannot participate in the general election.Virgin IslandsDemocrats in this United States territory will hold their caucus on June 6. The territory has a total of 13 delegates and picked Mrs. Clinton in 2016.American citizens living on the Virgin Islands cannot vote in the general election.PhotographDemocratic caucusgoers in Nevada in 2016.

| Jump to first hitThe sharp exchanges in the Nevada debate reflected the urgency of the moment as Michael Bloomberg, in his first presidential debate, was repeatedly criticized in personal terms.LAS VEGAS -- The Democratic presidential candidates turned on one another in scorching and personal terms in a debate on Wednesday night, with two of the leading candidates, Senator Bernie Sanders and Michael R. Bloomberg, forced onto the defensive repeatedly throughout the evening.In his first appearance in a presidential debate, Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, struggled from the start to address his past support for stop-and-frisk policing and the allegations he has faced over the years of crude and disrespectful behavior toward women. Time and again, Mr. Bloomberg had obvious difficulty countering criticism that could threaten him in a Democratic Party that counts women and African-Americans among its most important constituencies.Two candidates who have shied away from direct conflict in past debates, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., mounted something of a tag-team onslaught against Mr. Bloomberg, several times leaving him visibly irked and straining to respond.From the first seconds, when Mr. Sanders used the initial question to attack what he called Mr. Bloomberg's ""outrageous"" policing record, it was clear that this debate would be far more heated than any of the previous forums. The unrelenting attacks reflected the urgency of the moment, as Mr. Sanders gains strength and those hoping to slow his candidacy are increasingly crowded out by Mr. Bloomberg and his unprecedented spending spree.Ms. Warren landed the most stinging blows against Mr. Bloomberg throughout the debate, starting with an opening broadside that likened him to the figure most reviled among Democrats: President Trump.""I'd like to talk about who we're running against: a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians,"" Ms. Warren said. ""And no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump. I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg.""It was not only Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bloomberg who were subjected to withering criticism: Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., also engaged in a bitter and lengthy colloquy about foreign policy and their qualifications for the presidency, culminating in a sharp exchange in which Ms. Klobuchar asked Mr. Buttigieg if he was calling her ""dumb.""There was little in the debate to suggest that Mr. Sanders, the national front-runner and the favorite to win Nevada's caucuses on Saturday, had been knocked off balance, and the pile-on against Mr. Bloomberg had the potential to work in Mr. Sanders's favor by keeping the focus of hostilities elsewhere.But Mr. Sanders, too, was pressed to address some of the persistent questions about his candidacy, including whether he would release a fuller version of his medical records and why his candidacy appears to inspire uniquely vitriolic behavior by some of his supporters on the internet. Mr. Sanders, Vermont's junior senator, insisted that nearly all of his online fans were good and decent people, but said he would ""disown those people"" who behave in deplorable ways.Nobody acted with more urgency than Ms. Warren, who finished a distant fourth in New Hampshire after doing little to stand out in the debate there. She repeatedly inserted herself into main currents of the conversation. The challenge for her, though, is that her newfound vigor came after tens of thousands of Nevadans had already cast their ballots in early voting.It was Ms. Warren who initiated the exchange that may have damaged Mr. Bloomberg the most when she repeatedly demanded to know whether he would be willing to release some of the former female employees at his news media organization from the nondisclosure agreements they had signed. He declined to do so, calling the agreements ""consensual,"" and minimized the underlying complaints by suggesting that the women merely ""didn't like a joke I told.""After pressing Mr. Bloomberg and leaving him flustered, but unable to coax him into releasing the women she said he had ""muzzled,"" Ms. Warren then broadened her attack.""We are not going to beat Donald Trump with a man who has who-knows-how-many nondisclosure agreements and the drip, drip, drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against,"" she said.Before Mr. Bloomberg could even try to defend himself, Mr. Biden, who has seen the former New York mayor claim some of his support, gladly stepped in. ""All the mayor has to say is, You are released from the N.D.A., period,"" Mr. Biden said, his voice rising.In what became, for both of them, their most energetic debate in months, Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren teamed up to confront Mr. Bloomberg about his record on policing, challenging his expressions of contrition about his years of strong support for invasive searches that disproportionately targeted black and Hispanic men. The unlikely duo wielded the same combination of indignation and inquisition that framed their argument about sexual harassment.""It's not whether he apologized or not, it's the policy,"" Mr. Biden said, accusing Mr. Bloomberg of discounting concerns raised by the Obama administration.As in most of the tough exchanges of the night, Mr. Bloomberg defended himself only up to a point: He explained that he was focused on protecting New Yorkers' ""right to live,"" and in the process embraced a policing strategy he later came to regret. Looking back on his time as mayor, Mr. Bloomberg said, ""the one thing I'm really worried about, embarrassed about, was how it turned out with stop and frisk.""Ms. Warren jumped in to dissect that answer. ""This isn't about how it turned out,"" she said. ""This is about what it was designed to do, to begin with. It targeted communities of color.""Mr. Bloomberg has risen in the polls thanks to spending more than $400 million in advertising, nearly all of it on next month's Super Tuesday contests, but he had largely avoided engaging with voters, let alone his Democratic rivals. His decision to participate in the debate before those March 3 states was a gamble -- and one his own campaign all but conceded they didn't win.They acknowledged his lackluster performance, at least in the first hour of the two-hour forum, even as they boasted about how all of the attacks on him demonstrated the threat he poses. ""It took him just 45 minutes in his first debate in 10 years to get his legs on the stage,"" Kevin Sheekey, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager, said in a statement after the debate.If Mr. Sanders appeared relatively unbruised Wednesday night, it was not clear that he did anything to put to rest the persistent reservations in the party about his prospects in a contest against Mr. Trump. He dismissed a moderator's question about polling that found Americans deeply wary of socialism as a political label, noting that the same polling found him leading Mr. Trump in a general election.Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Bloomberg picked away at Mr. Sanders, with Mr. Bloomberg declaring that he would be a surefire loser in the general election and Mr. Buttigieg warning that it would be dangerous to nominate someone who ""wants to burn the house down.""After intraparty politesse prevailed in the first eight debates, when the harshest remarks onstage were usually reserved for Mr. Trump, the evident contempt some of these six candidates have for one another rang out like a jackpot in a slot machine on Wednesday. At no time was that more clear than when Ms. Klobuchar, who split the support of many moderate voters in New Hampshire with Mr. Buttigieg, was reminded by the former South Bend mayor that in a recent interview she had been unable to name the president of Mexico.""You're staking your candidacy on Washington experience,"" Mr. Buttigieg said, pointing out that all of the committees she serves on involve Mexico.""Are you trying to say I'm dumb -- are you mocking me, Pete?"" Ms. Klobuchar shot back, clearly stung. She then noted she had won all of her campaigns, while he had lost his sole statewide bid ""by over 20 points.""Later, Ms. Klobuchar said Mr. Buttigieg had simply ""memorized a bunch of talking points"" and had never been ""in the arena.""Both flashed sharp irritation, as Mr. Buttigieg criticized Ms. Klobuchar's support for certain Trump appointees and Ms. Klobuchar described his political accomplishments as minimal.""You don't have to be in Washington to matter,"" Mr. Buttigieg said, pointing to his tenure in the struggling city he sought to revive.At one point, Ms. Klobuchar answered Mr. Buttigieg with blunt sarcasm: ""I wish everyone was as perfect as you, Pete,"" she said.Yet the debate underscored the challenge facing candidates like Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar, who are hoping to ride a sense of momentum from Iowa and New Hampshire into stronger finishes elsewhere. But the two rivals spent much of the evening arguing with each other, and both were repeatedly upstaged by clashes involving the candidates better known at the national level.Both were at risk of emerging from the debate weaker than they entered it, and at the end of the evening they had not clearly strengthened their claims to leadership of moderate forces in the Democratic coalition.Just as contentious were the exchanges between Mr. Bloomberg, the proud billionaire, and Mr. Sanders, the democratic socialist who has said billionaires should not exist. Mr. Sanders, who had a heart attack in the fall, answered a question about his personal health records by noting that Mr. Bloomberg has ""two stents as well,"" prompting Mr. Bloomberg to say that his had been inserted two decades ago.And after Mr. Bloomberg said he made no apologies for his wealth because he had worked hard for his money, Mr. Sanders interjected: ""Maybe your workers played some role in that as well.""Mr. Bloomberg eventually confronted Mr. Sanders, saying it was ""ridiculous"" to suggest the country would ""throw out capitalism.""Turning even more personal, Mr. Bloomberg said, ""What a wonderful country we have -- the best known socialist in the country happens to be a millionaire with three houses.""After listing his residences, Mr. Sanders turned back to Mr. Bloomberg and asked: ""Which tax haven do you call home?""The sparring was hardly unanticipated. The rivalry between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Bloomberg has turned harshly personal this week, as their campaigns escalated a feud that both see as serving their political interests. On the morning of the debate, aides to Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Sanders were trading slashing criticism about the health of the two men, who are both 78 years old, and transparency about their medical histories.And in the days leading up to the debate, a number of the candidates denounced the personal attacks that Sanders supporters aimed at the female leaders of the influential union of Las Vegas's casino employees, the culinary workers' union, criticism that arose again at Wednesday's debate.If the other contenders are not able to slow Mr. Sanders in Nevada, he may gain enough momentum going into the Super Tuesday contests on March 3, when 15 states and territories will vote, to eventually claim the nomination. But if he falters here, it could throw the race open and create an opportunity for one or more of his rivals to assert themselves.Mr. Sanders's prominence in the race even drew a broadside from Ms. Warren, who has largely avoided tangling with him since entering the race.""His campaign relentlessly attacks everyone,"" she said, alluding to his supporters' scorn for those who do not support ""Medicare for all."" And then Ms. Warren made a reference to recent comments by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who said that Mr. Sanders might not be able to initially pass single-payer insurance. ""His own advisers say, 'Eh, probably won't happen, anyways,""' she said.Mr. Sanders, though, did not return fire. And at the end of the evening, it was clear he had a larger goal in mind: claiming the Democratic nomination, even if he has accrued a plurality, but not a majority of delegates, by the end of the primary season.""I think that the will of the people should prevail, yes,"" he said. ""The person who has the most votes should become the nominee.""PhotographMichael R.

| Jump to first hitEven the goal of defeating President Trump isn't enough for some voters to commit to backing the eventual Democratic nominee, expressing a clear aversion to a candidate who is too liberal or centrist for their tastes.FORT DODGE, Iowa -- Democrats have always represented a cacophonous array of individuals and interests, but the so-called big tent is now stretching over a constituency so unwieldy that it's easy to understand why voters remain torn this close to Iowa, where no clear front-runner has emerged.The party's voters are splintered across generational, racial and ideological lines, prompting some liberals to express reluctance about rallying behind a moderate presidential nominee, and those closer to the political middle to voice unease with a progressive standard-bearer.The lack of a united front has many party leaders anxious -- and for good reason. In over 50 interviews across three early-voting states -- Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina -- a number of Democratic primary voters expressed grave reservations about the current field of candidates, and in some cases a clear reluctance to vote for a nominee who was too liberal or too centrist for their tastes.As she walked out of a campaign event for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Fort Dodge this week, Barbara Birkett said she was leaning toward caucusing for Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, and dismissed the notion of even considering the two progressives in the race, Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.""No, I'm more of a Republican and that's just a little bit too far to the left for me,"" said Ms. Birkett, a retiree. She said that she'd like to support a Democrat this November because of her disdain for Mr. Trump but that Mr. Sanders would ""be a hard one.""Elsewhere on the increasingly broad Democratic spectrum, Pete Doyle, who attended a Sanders rally in Manchester, N.H., last weekend, had a ready answer when asked about voting for Mr. Biden: ""Never in a million years."" He said that if Mr. Biden won the nomination, he would either vote for a third-party nominee or sit out the general election.The uncertainty about party unity has been exacerbated in recent days by clashes among the Democratic candidates, as well as one involving a prominent party leader.Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have accused one another of lying about a private conversation in 2018 over whether a woman could become president; Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden have attacked each other over Social Security and corruption; and Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, has come off the sidelines to stoke her rivalry with Mr. Sanders, declaring that ""nobody likes him.""The lack of consensus among Democratic voters, 10 days before the presidential nominating primary begins with the Iowa caucuses, has led some party leaders to make unusually fervent and early pleas for unity. On Monday alone, a pair of influential Democratic congressmen issued strikingly similar warnings to very different audiences in very different states.""We get down to November, there's only going to be one nominee,"" Representative James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the third-ranking House Democrat, said at a ceremony for Martin Luther King's Birthday at the State House in Columbia. ""Nobody can afford to get so angry because your first choice did not win. If you stay home in November, you are going to get Trump back.""""No matter who our nominee is, we can't make the mistake that we made in '16,"" Representative Dave Loebsack of Iowa said that night in Cedar Rapids as he introduced his preferred 2020 candidate, former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., at a town hall meeting. ""We all got to get behind that person so we can get Donald Trump out of office,"" Mr. Loebsack added.In interviews, Democratic leaders say they believe the party's fights over such politically fraught issues as treasured entitlement programs, personal integrity, and gender and electability could hand Mr. Trump and foreign actors ammunition with which to depress turnout for their standard-bearer.""I am concerned about facing another disinformation campaign from the other side,"" said Representative Brendan Boyle of Pennsylvania, a Biden supporter who was uneasy enough that he recently sought out high-profile congressional backers of some of the other contenders to discuss an eventual détente. ""For those of us who are elected officials, we need to exercise real leadership to make sure all of the camps are immediately united after all this is over.""Most Democrats believe that the deep revulsion their party's voters and activists share for Mr. Trump will ultimately help heal primary season wounds and rally support behind whoever emerges as the nominee. ""If it means getting rid of Donald Trump, they would swallow Attila the Hun,"" State Representative Todd Rutherford, the Democratic leader of the South Carolina House, said of his party's rank-and-file.And some leading Democrats were less worried about recovering from the cut-and-thrust of the primary fights than figuring out how to address the deep fissures within their coalition that this race has exposed.""The Democrats cover everybody from Bernie to Bloomberg and that does present a real problem in terms of making a decision,"" said former Gov. Jerry Brown of California, himself a former presidential hopeful, referring to former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York. ""It's not blendable at this point. And if the division continues you're not going to get a first-ballot candidate.""The political and cultural distance between the two leading Democratic candidates, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, is easy enough to grasp from their events.A rally for Mr. Sanders in Exeter, N.H., last weekend featured the actor John Cusack, who introduced his candidate by invoking left-wing writers like Noam Chomsky and Howard Zinn and denouncing neoliberalism and imperialism.The event had few of the trappings of Mr. Biden's events, like the Pledge of Allegiance and a call for blessings upon the American military and the restoration of consensus and comity in Washington. The former vice president does not ask his audiences to raise their hands if they know anyone arrested for marijuana possession, as Mr. Sanders usually does.Vivid as the surface differences are between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden, what's even more revealing are the views that emerge in polling and conversations with their supporters.A new CNN survey showed that about as many Democrats under 50 would be upset or dissatisfied with Mr. Biden as the nominee as they would be enthusiastic. And among those older than 65, views were even starker about Mr. Sanders: just 23 percent said they'd be enthusiastic about him while 33 percent said they'd be upset or dissatisfied.Mr. Sanders has tried to bolster his standing with older voters, and lessen their ardor for Mr. Biden, by trumpeting his support for Social Security and highlighting the former vice president's past willingness to consider cuts to the program -- a contrast Sanders supporters believe is vital given Mr. Trump's suggestion this week that he'd pursue entitlement trims.Interviews with Sanders supporters at his events in New Hampshire and at the King Day gathering in South Carolina revealed a group of progressive activists who were as dedicated to him as they were in 2016 -- and who were uneasy about his rivals, especially Mr. Biden. That was borne out in a new poll of New Hampshire primary voters this week from Suffolk University, which indicated that nearly a quarter of the Vermont senator's supporters would not commit to backing the party's nominee if it was not Mr. Sanders.That number could drop by November if Mr. Sanders does not win the nomination: research shows that most of Mr. Sanders's supporters eventually rallied to Mrs. Clinton against Mr. Trump. Yet it would not necessarily happen easily, especially if Mr. Sanders's supporters believe he's been treated unfairly by the party.Many Sanders supporters who said they would grudgingly support one of his rivals against Mr. Trump quickly added that that's all they'd do, ruling out doing the volunteer work that is the lifeblood of all campaigns.""I just couldn't morally,"" Laura Satkowski said, explaining why she would not canvass or make phone calls on behalf of Mr. Biden. ""I don't like his policies.""Some pro-Sanders households are mixed.Michelle McKay and her partner, Bill Davis, came to the South Carolina State House from their home in Raleigh, N.C., she wearing a vest festooned with Sanders buttons, to show their support for their candidate.""Hell no,"" Ms. McKay said about the prospect of backing Mr. Biden. Reminded that North Carolina could be a pivotal state in the general election, she said: ""I don't care. My vote is not going to an establishment Democrat.""Mr. Davis, though, said that while he didn't want to vote for anybody besides Mr. Sanders, he'd cast a ballot for any Democrat against Mr. Trump. ""I think the party will come together,"" he said, as Ms. McKay looked on unconvinced.For many Democratic leaders, the hope for party unity rests on shared loathing of Mr. Trump. His divisive record and conduct in office helped propel Democrats to a new House majority in 2018 and a number of governorships in the last three years.Yet while his astonishing election and often demagogic politics have accelerated the rise of the left, energizing a new generation of progressives and socialists, Mr. Trump's presidency has also enlarged the moderate wing of the party, creating a slice of de facto Democrats among the Republicans and right-leaning independents who cannot abide him.Phil Richardson, a farmer who came to the Biden event in Fort Dodge with his wife, Christy, said he'd be happy to vote for Mr. Sanders.But Mr. Richardson said his worry is that others in his community would find it harder to support somebody so liberal.""I've had some of my farmer friends tell me they could probably live with Biden but he couldn't go for Bernie,"" he said.Over in Dubuque, Iowa, Ron Davis said flatly that he'd support Mr. Trump if Mr. Sanders was the nominee.An Ames, Iowa, native who now lives in suburban Detroit, Mr. Davis and his wife, Barbara Rom, are retirees traversing Iowa as political tourists this week -- ""candidate groupies,"" he called them -- and trying to decide who to support in Michigan's primary in March.On Wednesday they came to the University of Dubuque to see Mr. Buttigieg, who impressed Mr. Davis. Mr. Sanders, however, would be ""too radical a change,"" he said. Ms. Rom said she'd back Mr. Sanders if it meant defeating Mr. Trump.If it all seems messy, and the party hopelessly fragmented, that's for good reason, said Kathleen Sebelius, the former Kansas governor and health and human services secretary who grew up in Democratic politics as the daughter of a former Ohio governor.""This primary is a reflection of the politics of the country at large,"" Ms. Sebelius said. ""There are clearly differences among people who still feel incremental change is the best way of getting things done, and folks who say we need more to pursue more radical change.""She said she'd be more worried if Democrats didn't have Mr. Trump as ""a rallying cry,"" but conceded there was no candidate on the horizon who could fully unify the party's factions.""There is no savior who's going to rescue us from the current state of affairs,"" she said. ""We're all going to need to save each other.""PhotographDemocratic presidential candidates marching to the State House in Columbia, S.C., on Monday.

| Jump to first hitJoe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, facing increasing pressure to slow the Vermont senator's rise before Super Tuesday, criticized his record on gun control and his chances against President Trump.LAS VEGAS -- The day after a Democratic presidential debate brought out the candidates' outrage at Michael R. Bloomberg, the focus turned back toward Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who leads polls of Nevada, California and the nation.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. spent Thursday hammering Mr. Sanders for past positions that were friendly to the gun industry. Mr. Bloomberg warned that nominating Mr. Sanders would be ""a fatal error."" And former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., said he found it hard to imagine that Mr. Sanders could defeat President Trump in a general election.""It would be a very, very tough sell,"" Mr. Buttigieg told a crowd of students at a televised event at the University of Southern California. ""I think it would be a tough sell with Mike Bloomberg, too. I'm saying we don't have to choose between these two options. I'm saying there is another way.""The attacks came two days before Nevada's caucuses, the third contest of the Democratic presidential nominating calendar, and the day after a bitter debate that highlighted the dire situation that Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg face. With Mr. Sanders favored to win in Nevada, they have limited time to try to stop his rise before the delegate-rich Super Tuesday contests on March 3 -- when Mr. Bloomberg and his $300 million advertising campaign await.Mr. Bloomberg was in one of those Super Tuesday states, Utah, on Thursday, telling voters in Salt Lake City that Mr. Sanders could not appeal to a broad enough array of people to win the White House.""If we choose a candidate who appeals to a small base -- like Senator Sanders -- it will be a fatal error,"" Mr. Bloomberg said. ""We need Democrats and independents and Republicans to win.""Both explicitly and obliquely, Mr. Biden and his campaign criticized Mr. Sanders's record on gun control on Thursday, releasing a biting video of the Vermont senator saying in 2012, ""I don't know that you hold a gun manufacturer responsible for what obviously a deranged person does.""In a speech at a Las Vegas community center later in the day, Mr. Biden implicitly criticized that position again, and more overtly jabbed Mr. Sanders for his past opposition to the Brady bill, which required background checks for gun purchases.Yet after the event, a reporter asked whether Mr. Biden believed that Mr. Sanders had changed his views on guns.""I do think he's changed his views,"" Mr. Biden allowed, ""and I'm happy for that.""By Thursday evening, however, he was prepared to hit Mr. Sanders's record more directly.""It's not so much what you say you believe now,"" he said at a CNN town hall. ""It's, what did you do and when did you do it? And the fact is, Bernie has had a very different record than me for a long time.""Mr. Biden spelled it out: ""He voted to exempt gun manufacturers from any liability. Zero. They can't be sued.""While Mr. Sanders's rivals sought to chip away at his popularity, he laid low on Thursday. He appeared at no public events and conducted interviews with three local TV stations in Las Vegas and Reno, his campaign said.In a brief exchange aired on CNN from his campaign hotel in Las Vegas, Mr. Sanders criticized the wealth of Mr. Bloomberg, who is worth more than $60 billion.""Mr. Bloomberg himself is worth more, one person, than the bottom 125 million Americans,"" he said.The Sanders campaign was relieved on Thursday that he had emerged from Wednesday's debate unscathed, a result that it attributed to his resilience and supporters' loyalty.""Senator Sanders's opponents have thrown everything they can at him since the launch of his campaign and they've failed to stop his campaign to build a political revolution because of his consistent, lifelong record of standing with the working class,"" said Mike Casca, a campaign spokesman.The Democratic candidates' urgency to contrast themselves with Mr. Sanders came as expectations grew among rival campaigns and political operatives that he was likely to win Nevada's caucuses on Saturday.Perhaps in an acknowledgment that they are not likely to emerge on top, Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts all plan to be out of the state when the caucus results start to be announced on Saturday afternoon.""I think Nevada is unfathomable,"" said David Axelrod, the architect of Barack Obama's 2008 and 2012 presidential campaigns. ""Second place is anybody's guess. And second place is meaningful by the unwritten measuring sticks that the punditocracy creates. Everybody is going to be watching who finishes second.""More critical to the campaigns than Nevada are the 16 states and territories with contests on Super Tuesday. And reliable public polling data is available in just a few of those states.In Texas, a recent University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll found Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders in a dead heat. In Virginia, a Monmouth University poll released this week found Mr. Bloomberg joining Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden in a statistical tie for first place. Mr. Sanders has led recent public polls of California, the biggest Super Tuesday prize on the map.Mr. Buttigieg exhibited unusual urgency on Thursday, sending a fund-raising appeal that for the first time issued a target he said the campaign must meet to stay afloat.""We are the best shot at defeating Donald Trump,"" he wrote. ""But the reality is, if we can't raise $13 million before Super Tuesday, we might never get that shot.""Hours before that please-help-or-we're-sunk appeal, Mr. Buttigieg's campaign released an unsigned ""state of the race"" memo that warned Mr. Sanders was on the verge of building a ""seemingly insurmountable delegate lead.""Mr. Buttigieg, who has struggled for months to attract black and Latino voters, found himself facing a sometimes skeptical audience in Los Angeles.Valerie Gutierrez, a junior at the University of Southern California who attended Mr. Buttigieg's event, said she was undecided but leaning toward voting for him, despite fears about his limited appeal.""The fact that he's not able to get the diverse minority group under his coalition is a bit worrisome for me, because I'm someone from a minority background,"" she said.Michael Sutter, a U.S.C. senior who said he had already voted early for Mr. Buttigieg, echoed the former mayor's warning that Mr. Sanders could not defeat Mr. Trump.""Bernie is a little bit too far out there,"" he said. ""He's going to scare people away.""Sydney Ember contributed reporting from Las Vegas, Giovanni Russonello from New York and Louis Keene from Los Angeles.

| Jump to first hitThe story of the race right now, in Iowa and nationally, is the rise of Bernie Sanders. In our polling average at the national and state levels, Mr. Sanders appears to have gained substantial ground in recent weeks, overtaking Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Iowa, nipping at his national lead and raising huge sums of money online to power his insurgent candidacy. Should Mr. Sanders win the Iowa caucuses on Monday, it could be a major turning point in the race and the most serious test yet of Mr. Biden's political tenacity.A Sanders victory in Iowa is no foregone conclusion. Mr. Biden continues to hold a solid base of support, particularly among older voters; in some Iowa polls he still has an edge over Mr. Sanders. And beyond the earliest, whitest states on the primary calendar, Mr. Biden is still the clear favorite among minority voters, who are usually decisive in settling the Democratic Party's presidential nomination.But Mr. Biden's strength at the national level is also built on the perception -- among voters and political donors -- that he has the best chance against President Trump in the general election. Losing to Mr. Sanders in one or more of the early states could shake that perception and make it harder to replenish his campaign's bank account.Most polls in Iowa show a close race, between not just Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders but also Elizabeth Warren and Pete Buttigieg. Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg have fallen in the Iowa polls since the fall, and Mr. Buttigieg has taken an abrupt dip over the last month. But the Iowa caucuses also tend to reward candidates with strong field organizations, and both Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg are seen as having some of the most sophisticated turnout machinery in the state. With both of them polling in the mid-teens, either could be in a position to outperform those numbers.There are two other trends worth noting: First, Amy Klobuchar has finally shown real upward movement in Iowa. Her gains have been slow and perhaps too gradual to produce the upset she needs, but her movement is real enough to raise the hopes of her supporters.And second, Michael R. Bloomberg has overtaken Mr. Buttigieg in national polls, if only by one percentage point. It is the first time Mr. Bloomberg has been the fourth-place candidate in our polling average, a notable marker as he awaits the chance to exploit any early stumbles by Mr. Biden. Alexander BurnsIowa on the Ground: A Sprint to the FinishLast weekend brought a whirlwind of campaign events from Dubuque to Sioux City as Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota tried to cram a week's worth of campaigning into two days before all of them -- to paraphrase Ms. Klobuchar -- turned into impeachment pumpkins.Former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., moved from oblique to direct attacks, criticizing Mr. Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. by name and saying the two frontrunners' recent arguments -- over Social Security, for instance -- reflected an unwise focus on the past.Mr. Biden, on the other hand, campaigned as if he were already the nominee, focusing squarely on President Trump. On Tuesday, he seized on comments by Senator Joni Ernst, an Iowa Republican facing a tough election of her own, to argue that he is the Democrat the president fears most.Iowa in the Polls: The Rise of SandersA New York Times/Siena College poll of likely caucusgoers released last weekend showed Mr. Sanders ahead with 25 percent support, up six points since the last Times/Siena survey in October. He was followed by Mr. Buttigieg (18 percent) and Mr. Biden (17 percent).Ms. Warren dropped to 15 percent from 22 in October.A Suffolk University/USA Today poll released around the same time showed Mr. Biden leading and Mr. Sanders six points behind him.A Monmouth poll released Wednesday found Mr. Sanders just two points behind Mr. Biden, well within the margin of error.The entrepreneur Andrew Yang got four relatively strong ones -- two national, two in New Hampshire -- last weekend, qualifying him for the next debate, on Feb. 7 in Manchester, N.H.Iowa on Your Screens: A Spending BlitzThe 2020 Democrats have filled the airwaves with their closing arguments. Mr. Biden's message: ""Vote Biden. Beat Trump."" Mr. Buttigieg's: A ""bold vision for the next generation.""On Facebook, Ms. Warren is emphasizing ""combating corruption in Washington."" Ms. Klobuchar has sought to appeal to voters who feel ""stuck in the middle of the extremes in our politics.""Former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York has spent millions of dollars attacking Mr. Trump and will air a 60-second, $11 million Super Bowl ad focused on gun control. Mr. Trump's re-election campaign has also bought a minute of advertising during the game on Sunday.Mr. Sanders's campaign raised more than $1.3 million after an ad painted him as incapable of beating Mr. Trump.The Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest and most influential newspaper, endorsed Ms. Warren for the Democratic nomination last weekend, while Mr. Biden got an endorsement from The Sioux City Journal.Delaney Is Out After Two YearsJohn Delaney, a former representative from Maryland who announced his candidacy for president in July 2017, said Friday that he would end his campaign. He ran as a moderate, especially against ""Medicare for all.""Mr. Delaney said he had concluded that he would do just well enough in some places to keep other moderates below the 15 percent viability threshold. ""When I knew that I didn't have enough support to reach viability in a meaningful way, but I had enough support to pull off from other candidates,"" he told us, ""I said, well, that's not very productive.""Sanders Releases Disability PlanFor months, candidates have been trying to outdo one another on everything from taxes to gun policy, jostling to produce the boldest proposals. That dynamic has been especially visible in disability policy. And on Friday, Mr. Sanders released a sweeping plan that advocates said rivaled the one they had recently praised from Ms. Warren.Mr. Sanders is proposing several of the same things, including ending sub-minimum wages for workers with disabilities, fully funding the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act, eliminating Social Security rules that can prevent people from marrying, and protecting home- and community-based services.In Other Policy NewsAmid the growing coronavirus outbreak in China, Ms. Warren unveiled a plan to stop the spread of infectious diseases. She said she would increase funding for agencies that prevent and manage outbreaks, and establish a corps of doctors, scientists and aid workers who can enter conflict zones.She also released a plan on disinformation, pledging that her campaign would not ""knowingly use or spread false or manipulated information"" or ""tolerate the use of false information or false accounts to attack my opponents.""Mr. Bloomberg released an economic plan for Puerto Rico and endorsed statehood for the territory. He also outlined how he would support the L.G.B.T.Q. community; released a Latino agenda; and announced a housing affordability plan, promising to cut homelessness in half by 2025.Photograph(PHOTOGRAPH BY TODD HEISLER/THE NEW YORK TIMES)Word count: 1176Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitCan a woman win in 2020? Answering the electability question with election results.DES MOINES -- After nearly an hour, the question that progressives had been fearing finally arrived. Senator Bernie Sanders laughed. Senator Elizabeth Warren did not.""I didn't say it,"" Mr. Sanders insisted, with Ms. Warren turning his way, as he denied her explosive account that he told her privately in 2018 that a woman could not win the presidency.""Bernie is my friend,"" Ms. Warren replied firmly, disputing his memory, ""and I am not here to try and fight with Bernie. But, look, this question about whether or not a woman can be president has been raised and it's time for us to attack it head-on.""All through this Democratic primary, voters have worried aloud about the thorny subject of electability, wondering if a woman -- even a woman they might support -- would be able to defeat President Trump.In her exchange with Mr. Sanders on Tuesday, Ms. Warren hoped to turn the issue on its head, noting that of all those onstage, only the women, Ms. Warren and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, had won all of their major elections and later observing that the party's success in the 2018 midterms was powered largely by female candidates and voters.She also made it known that no one else here had defeated a Republican incumbent in the last three decades, a statistic Mr. Sanders moved to rebut, citing his House victory in 1990.""Wasn't that 30 years ago?"" she asked, turning to the crowd like an actor breaking the fourth wall in a sitcom.""I beat an incumbent Republican congressman,"" Mr. Sanders repeated, emphasizing that 1990 was indeed 30 years ago.""I don't know if that's the major issue of the day,"" he concluded.But the context was.In seeking to defuse any concerns about a potential female nominee, Ms. Warren appeared to see no option but to extend, if not expand, a feud her advisers claim she never wanted.Since the beginning of the primary campaign, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have proceeded with a patina of comity, focusing on their mostly shared policy goals and reminding anyone who would listen about their ostensibly genuine mutual admiration.""Bernie and I have been friends for a long, long time,"" Ms. Warren said last month in Ottumwa.""Elizabeth Warren is a very good friend of mine,"" Mr. Sanders told reporters last weekend in Iowa City.But competitive campaigns tend to test the definition of the word.Perhaps this moment, or something like it, was always going to come -- the natural consequence of a contest with these stakes, of two candidates fighting for so many of the same voters.It was easy enough to project friendship and allegiance all last year as dual progressive dreamers, tag-teaming to make the case against the more incremental politics of a front-runner like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. It is quite another thing to see the current state of the primary -- with wide-open races in Iowa and New Hampshire and, in theory, room enough for only one liberal standard-bearer as the calendar turns -- and maintain a fully united front.Sunday was fraught: Ms. Warren said she was ""disappointed"" in Mr. Sanders amid reports that his campaign had distributed a script to volunteers instructing them to depict Ms. Warren as out of touch.Monday was worse: CNN reported that Mr. Sanders told Ms. Warren during a private meeting in 2018 that a woman could not win the presidency. Mr. Sanders forcefully denied having made the remarks. Ms. Warren said that Mr. Sanders had in fact raised doubts about a woman's electoral viability.""I thought a woman could win; he disagreed,"" she said in a statement on Monday. ""I have no interest in discussing this private meeting any further because Bernie and I have far more in common than our differences on punditry.""Entering Tuesday's debate, progressive groups had spent the preceding 48 hours in something approaching full-scale panic, alarmed that a skirmish between two largely like-minded candidates would serve only to benefit more moderate alternatives like Mr. Biden and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.The question of whether a woman can defeat Mr. Trump has been the long-whispered soundtrack of much of this Democratic primary, invoked constantly in voter interviews among even supporters of candidates like Ms. Warren and Ms. Klobuchar.Ms. Warren had not directly addressed gender as forcefully as she did Tuesday night, when she vowed, in her closing statement, to become ""the first woman president of the United States of America.""She has more frequently talked about Aunt Bea -- a wonder woman in her life -- who made an appearance in an exchange about child care.It was a story she has told many times before, but the circumstances on Tuesday made it newly resonant.""If I hadn't been saved by my Aunt Bea, I was ready to quit my job,"" Ms. Warren said. ""And I think about how many women of my generation just got knocked off the track and never got back on.""As late as last week, it seemed as if the debate was shaping up primarily as a clash between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden. Since an American airstrike killed Iran's top military commander, the two men have been sparring over foreign policy. Mr. Biden has seized on the escalating tension to highlight his experience while Mr. Sanders has used it as grounds to promote his longtime focus on international diplomacy. Mr. Sanders, a vocal opponent of the war in Iraq, has also repeatedly and aggressively hit Mr. Biden on his vote to authorize it.The sparring over foreign policy has delighted Mr. Sanders's advisers, who have long ached for direct conflict with Mr. Biden: Not only is he a moderate foil to Mr. Sanders's democratic socialism, but he also in many ways represents the establishment Washington that Mr. Sanders loathes.Mr. Biden was bracing for the fight. But when it came time for Mr. Sanders to go on offense, he settled occasionally for jokes.""I would not meet with -- absent preconditions -- I would not meet with the, quote, 'supreme leader,' who said 'Joe Biden is a rabid dog, he should be beaten to death with a stick,"" Mr. Biden said about the leader of North Korea.Mr. Sanders butted in: ""Other than that, you like him?""""Other than that, I like him,"" Mr. Biden confirmed.As ever on Tuesday, Mr. Biden presented himself as the candidate Mr. Trump fears most. ""I've been the object of his affection now more than anybody else in this stage,"" he said.While Mr. Biden is not an enviable debater on his best day, he seemed to largely survive the evening without a significant misstep -- no small thing as he continues to lead most national polls and edges into contention in surveys of Iowa and New Hampshire, where he has long struggled.That no candidate has yet emerged as a decisive front-runner in Iowa has made voters' decisions here all the more complicated as they strain to identify someone who can defeat Mr. Trump. Only 40 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers have made up their minds, according to a Des Moines Register poll released last week; nearly half said they could be persuaded to support another candidate, and 13 percent said they did not have a first choice.Of course, the locals have also found excitement in the stress, making the proceedings on Tuesday the hottest ticket in a cold town. Leaving a restaurant on Sunday, several Iowans asked a Buttigieg campaign official if he could help them get into the event hall. The official demurred.The debate on Tuesday went forward against the relentless din of Washington news, from the Iran affair to a looming Senate impeachment trial that could sideline half of the candidates onstage. (The forum also excluded the Democrat most ubiquitous in television advertising: Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor who is not competing in the early-voting states.)The candidates and moderators did not wind toward Mr. Trump's congressional fate until nearly the end. There was talk of the Constitution. There was talk about duty. ""Some things,"" Ms. Warren said, ""are more important than politics.""And some seemingly unimportant actions can appear politically meaningful.At the end of the evening, as the candidates wrapped up more than two hours of televised talking with several minutes of televised farewells, Mr. Sanders extended his hand to Ms. Warren. She did not reciprocate, beginning a brief conversation that ended without a handshake. Mr. Sanders raised two open palms -- as if to say: enough of this -- and walked off.Sydney Ember reported from Des Moines, and Matt Flegenheimer from New York.Sydney Ember reported from Des Moines, and Matt Flegenheimer from New York.PhotographElizabeth Warren, second from left, and Bernie Sanders, fourth from left, sparred over the issue of electability on Tuesday night.

| Jump to first hitUncertainty, verging on anxiety and even panic for some Iowa Democrats, reflects the responsibility they feel as they seek a nominee who can beat the president in the general election.NEWTON, Iowa -- Lois Grier knows she has to make a decision about the Democratic primary soon.She and her husband, Ted, traveled from their home in Otley to hear Bernie Sanders on Saturday and hoped to see Pete Buttigieg, too. But though Ms. Grier, 62, cares about issues like health care, what she is yearning to find above all is a White House hopeful she believes can defeat President Trump.She hasn't found one yet.""It's important to narrow it in to somebody that can beat Trump,"" she said, adding that she would be watching the debate on Tuesday in Des Moines closely for telltale signs.""A lot of the candidates are saying the right things,"" she added. ""But are they strong enough?""For a year now, Iowans have been analyzing Democratic candidates for president, weighing their policies and personalities with the knowledge that the choices they make on caucus night on Feb. 3 could determine the trajectory of the primary. But with the first-in-the-nation caucuses three weeks away, many people in the state are still trying to make their decisions: A Des Moines Register poll last week showed that only 40 percent of likely Democratic caucusgoers had made up their minds. Nearly half said they could be persuaded to support another candidate as their top choice, and 13 percent said they did not have a first choice.This level of uncertainty, verging on anxiety and even panic for some caucusgoers, reflects the stakes for Democrats as they seek a nominee who can do effective battle with Mr. Trump. Many Iowans worry that none of the top contenders have clearly proved themselves able to defeat the president.""It's a mess,"" said Laura Hubka, the chairwoman of the Howard County Democrats. ""Everyone is so all over the place.""The current level of indecisiveness is striking, even for Iowans known to make up their minds late. At the same point in 2016, only 14 percent were undecided in the Des Moines Register poll, for a race that featured just two top contenders, Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton. In 2004, a more comparable election year when the field was nearly as crowded as it is today, 70 percent had not picked a candidate a month from the caucuses. Forty-two percent made up their minds in the last two weeks, according to an entrance poll.""They're worried about the country and they don't want to make a mistake -- they're feeling the pressure,"" said Penny Rosfjord, a party activist who has not settled on a preference.Iowans are acutely aware of their responsibility in holding the first presidential nominating contests, and the state's Democrats do not want to set the party on a path to a weak nominee. Making it more difficult this year is the fierce argument over how far left the Democratic Party should tilt.Such ambiguity raises the possibility that no one will emerge from the caucuses with a clean victory, potentially undermining Iowa's claim to acting as a springboard to the nomination by muddling Democrats' choice.In interviews at campaign events in recent days, many Iowans were still wavering, often listing several candidates they liked but also reasons that each candidate could be perceived as weak. They worried Joseph R. Biden Jr. might be too old, thought Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., might be too inexperienced and were apprehensive that Mr. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren could be too far left.And at a time when Iowans are confronting questions about whether their overwhelmingly white state should retain its pre-eminent position in the primary process, voters want more than ever to elevate a coalition-building candidate who can win elsewhere.The fact that all the other candidates have failed so far to catch on has given Iowans pause about them, too.Bob Wymore, a retired truck driver from Ottumwa, said after a Sanders event recently that he was still undecided even though there were several candidates he liked, including Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren. But, he said, ""I'm kind of leaning toward Biden because he's more moderate and that's probably what we need, like a lot of people think.""Complicating matters, several of the state's best-known Democratic officials have withheld their endorsements, opting instead to see how the race unfolds on its own. Those who have not backed a candidate so far include Representative Cindy Axne, who flipped her district in 2018; Rob Sand, the state auditor; and J.D. Scholten, who is running for Congress in Representative Steve King's district.Mr. Scholten, who could be a kingmaker in the Iowa caucuses and often appears with 2020 candidates at forums on rural issues, said in an interview that he had expected to make an endorsement this month.But as the calendar flipped over, he was nowhere near to making up his mind.""I thought I'd have a clearer picture,"" he said. ""The lanes aren't as clear as what I think people thought they would be.""Voters sound like cable news pundits as they mull the candidates, wondering aloud if progressives like Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren can carry crucial swing states, and if moderates like Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg will excite the party's young and diverse base.""Of paramount importance is beating Trump, of course,"" Gary Mansheim, a family practice physician from Burlington, Iowa, said at a Warren event in December. ""Warren and Sanders speak to the Democratic heart, but the brain says you need someone that is more moderate to beat Trump. So that brings us back to the more moderates -- Biden, Buttigieg and Klobuchar.""Randy Farnum, 49, an elementary school principal from Dubuque, said that he was trying to decide between Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren and that it would come down to their ""final plans.""""It's coming down to the amount of decisions we have to make very rapidly in the next year for the world,"" he said.The surges and retreats in the Iowa polls -- all the candidates in the top tier taking a turn at the top -- reflect how scrutiny of whoever is in the lead brings attacks in the debates and, for voters, second thoughts. The debate on Tuesday in Des Moines is likely to be fierce as candidates seek momentum going into the final weeks before the caucuses.""The number of undecideds truly has as much to do with the stakes as with anything else,"" said Sue Dvorsky, a former chairwoman of the Iowa Democratic Party. Ms. Dvorsky and her husband, Bob, a former state senator, don't expect to settle on a candidate until caucus night.""Very honestly, our decision will be made based on what is happening in the room that night,"" she said, adding that ""we are center-left people,"" favoring the candidate leading in that lane. ""This year there is great uncertainty,"" she said. ""I don't know if Biden's going to be viable that night.""Mr. Biden's ads in Iowa call the Trump presidency ""the most dangerous moment in a generation.""A poll of the state by Monmouth University on Monday showed Mr. Biden leading among likely caucusgoers with 25 percent, followed by Mr. Sanders at 18 percent, Mr. Buttigieg at 17 percent and Ms. Warren with 15 percent. Three days earlier, the Des Moines Register/CNN poll also showed a tightly bunched, four-way field at the top, with Mr. Sanders in first with 20 percent.Asked how important it was to choose a candidate capable of defeating Mr. Trump, three in four supporters of Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg named this as a crucial factor in the Register poll. But only 54 percent of Sanders supporters and 53 percent of Warren supporters did so.Angela Woodhouse, 56, of Muscatine, said Democrats were ""super fortunate because we have so many great candidates."" But she, too, had not made a decision.""I would be happy with anyone, honestly,"" she said. ""Trump is so bad.""The persistent, hand-wringing indecision among Iowans has unnerved elected officials, county chairs and campaigns alike, many of whom have adopted an anything-can-happen approach to the caucuses while at the same time continuing to await a still-elusive sign that the race is shaking out. And it could snarl the already complex caucus process that favors visible momentum and live persuasion.""From the people that I've talked to, there's just still this sense of, it's just all up in the air,"" said Sandy Dockendorff, a Democratic activist in southeastern Iowa who has endorsed Ms. Warren.

| Jump to first hitHENDERSON, Nev. -- The signs of Nevada's resurgent economy are everywhere in this community outside Las Vegas, the fastest-growing city in one of the country's fastest-growing states.New housing developments are spilling up the mountainsides, filled with families and retirees fleeing California and the East Coast for sunshine, cheaper land and lower taxes. Warehouses are sprouting beside a huge new practice facility for the Las Vegas Raiders football team -- another set of California transplants. Even the names on new apartments and Spanish-tiled subdivisions mirror the optimism of a state on a hot streak after years of a plodding economic recovery: Elysian. Inspirada.""It's a boomtown,"" said Ivonne Hernandez, 28, who was in high school when her family lost their home in the housing crash.But Ms. Hernandez and other middle-class voters say they are not sharing in Nevada's jackpot. As the state handed out millions in tax incentives to lure businesses here, working-class voters say they are struggling to keep up with rising rents and still feel economically vulnerable more than a decade after the recession plunged Las Vegas's tourism and construction-dependent economy into disarray.Today, Ms. Hernandez has a good-paying job at a gas company, but said she has been unable to afford an apartment of her own. She has already voted early for Senator Bernie Sanders ahead of Saturday's Democratic caucuses. ""There's just not opportunity out here for me.""Nikki Peters, who markets time shares in Henderson, said that despite the booming economy, her family struggles. She and her husband voted early for Mr. Sanders this weekend because they feel he cares about people like them.""It's not better,"" said Ms. Peters. ""We can't afford to take vacations. We can only pay bills.""Nevada lagged in recovering from the chasm of the recession, but it is now growing at a faster clip than much of the country. In southern Nevada, median home prices have increased by 40 percent to $305,000, according to the Las Vegas Realtors group, and builders now complain they cannot find enough workers.As new neighborhoods sprawl into the creosote desert, local officials here in Clark County have begun warning they are running out of space, and have proposed opening new federal lands to development. In Reno, a flood of newcomers from the Bay Area and companies including the electric-car maker Tesla have set off a runaway spree of growth.To President Trump's supporters, Nevada's growth has become the strongest argument for his re-election. Housing prices have rebounded. Marquee projects like a $4 billion Resorts World development and the Raiders' onyx-black stadium are reshaping the Vegas skyline.Victoria Seaman, a Republican Las Vegas councilwoman, lauds the president for it all. She recently wrote an op-ed declaring that Nevada was the beneficiary of a ""blue-collar boom"" driven by Mr. Trump's tax cuts and trade policies. Over the past six months, 500 new businesses have opened in her ward on the west side of the city.""I don't think he gets enough credit,"" Ms. Seaman said in her seventh-floor city offices overlooking a jumble of half-built buildings, shortly before she dashed off for a security screening to meet Mr. Trump as he made a campaign swing through Las Vegas.Henderson, the second-largest city in Nevada, with 316,000 residents, cultivates an image as Vegas's genial kid sibling, a spread of subdivisions, golf courses and master-planned communities knit together by the decidedly un-Sin City slogan, ""A Place to Call Home.""It is whiter than the rest of Nevada, which is nearly 30 percent Latino and 10 percent black, but local officials and demographers say waves of new arrivals are transforming it into a more diverse suburb with an increasing number of foreign-born residents.""There was a lot of empty real estate here for many years after the recession,"" said Scott Muelrath, chief executive of Henderson's Chamber of Commerce, as he drove down St. Rose Parkway. And now, ""You can go two weeks and come down this street, and there'll be something new going on.""He passed just-opened big-box stores and bulldozers leveling the rocky ground for new shipping and distribution warehouses. Henderson, like the rest of Nevada, has tried to diversify its economy since the crash to make it less vulnerable to Nevada's boom-and-bust cycles. Google has opened a data center, and plans are underway to build a machine-tool plant and a huge Amazon fulfillment center.Of the more than 141,000 people who moved to Nevada in 2018, about 50,000 of them were from California, The Las Vegas Review-Journal reported, amplifying an eastward flow that goes back decades. Today, nearly a third of the eligible voters in Clark County, which contains about 70 percent of Nevada's population, were born in California, said Robert Lang, the executive director of Brookings Mountain West. Only one in 10 is from Nevada.Political analysts argue the recent surge in migration has helped Democrats solidify their control in Nevada. Democrats have about 110,000 more registered voters than Republicans, and have a powerful turnout machine in the unions that represent thousands of casino and hotel workers.The culinary union, for instance, is particularly powerful because it represents many of the workers in Las Vegas's casinos. Leaders of the group, which is over half Latino, have said they are opposed to Mr. Sanders's single-payer plan.""This is a very difficult state for any Republican to win statewide,"" said Jon Ralston, the editor of The Nevada Independent.But Nevada is also drawing people fed up with blue-state liberalism. Tamra West, 42, a real estate office manager, and her husband decided on a whim to sell their house in Riverside, Calif., and move to a rental in Henderson. Ms. West said Nevada's low taxes hewed more to her conservative economic values.Though Ms. West's husband is a registered Democrat, she said they are both solidly behind Mr. Trump's re-election. As the Democratic candidates debated this week at the Paris resort, Ms. West said she worried that their economic policies would torpedo the housing market by raising interest rates and taxes.""Democrats are not pro-business,"" she said.Nevada's growth is at the heart of Ms. Hernandez's job. She coordinates natural-gas hookups for the new businesses that have helped lift job growth here to an annual rate of 2.5 percent since the end of 2016, a full percentage point higher than the national average, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.After working as a contractor for two years, she celebrated getting hired full time last year by renting her first apartment. It was more than a milestone: Her parents lost their home and declared bankruptcy during the crash. She lost her college scholarship in Nevada after she and her family relocated to Utah looking for construction work for her stepfather.Ms. Hernandez loved the one-bedroom apartment she found in Henderson, but said she could not cope with the $1,468 she paid on rent, utilities and internet. Rents across Nevada have increased about 15 percent since 2016, about double the national average, according to Zillow. Ms. Hernandez moved out a month ago and is now living with her boyfriend's mother.""It feels like you can't catch up,"" she said.With the national economy growing and unemployment at 3.6 percent -- slightly lower than Nevada's rate of 3.8 percent -- the fight to frame the economy is an election-year battlefield.Mr. Trump boasts about a ""great American comeback"" while the Democratic candidates hoping to replace him focus on slow wage growth, soaring student debt and a chasm between the rich and everybody else.Adjusted for inflation, Nevada's median household income of $61,864 is still about $4,000 less than families earned before the recession. The lagging pace of wage growth has sharpened debates about whether Nevada's boom-and-bust economy is growing sustainably this time, or building another bubble that will hurt the poorest when it bursts.When Rita Story, 61, lost her telecom job in 2018, she said that family and the promise of a fresh start in a growing economy pulled her to move from Indiana to Las Vegas with her 24-year-old daughter.There is plenty of work, but Ms. Story said they have struggled to find anything full time. She is earning $13 an hour doing tax-season work at an accounting office, and her daughter works part-time retail shifts. They are sleeping on a rollout bed and couch in her sister's home, and hoping that a Democratic president will lift their wages and lower their $500 monthly health care costs.""That's my No. 1 -- jobs that pay you enough,"" Ms. Story said as she waited in line to vote early for the California businessman Tom Steyer in the caucuses this week. ""I'm starting over. I thought it might have been better.""Nelson D. Schwartz contributed reporting from New York.PhotographA new complex for the N.F.L.'s Raiders.

| Jump to first hitAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez. An Olympic curling coach. A host of 'Queer Eye.' At house parties and rallies, stand-ins for the candidates hit the trail in Iowa.WEST DES MOINES, Iowa -- Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the filmmaker Michael Moore held a rally in Iowa City for Bernie Sanders. Amy Klobuchar's daughter, Abigail Bessler, hosted a ""Hotdish House Party"" in West Des Moines. And Julián Castro, a former presidential candidate himself, hit the campaign trail for Elizabeth Warren.Political surrogates have always played a role in presidential elections, by turns lending campaigns credibility, enthusiasm and star power. Beyoncé, Jay-Z and Chance the Rapper held a concert in Cleveland for Hillary Clinton in 2016. The actor Jon Voight and the singer Kid Rock campaigned with Mitt Romney in 2012. Oprah Winfrey stumped for Barack Obama in 2007.Yet with President Trump's impeachment trial suddenly forcing the senators in the Democratic race off the campaign trail for the second week in a row, their stand-ins have become something else: the main attraction.Three leading candidates who are hoping for strong performances in Iowa and other early states are stuck in Washington -- Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Ms. Klobuchar. So voters are instead attending meet-and-greets, house parties and canvass kickoffs with actors, politicians and celebrities, as well as candidates' family members.All three senators were back in Iowa for the weekend. But as they returned their chamber seats for the second week of the trial Monday, their surrogates were again preparing to blanket early states.For some candidates, ceding the spotlight has not been easy. Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, has bristled at the opportunity he is missing to deliver his closing argument himself.""To be very honest with you, a month ago -- a couple of weeks ago -- I would not have told you that I would be spending the last week of the campaign in Washington, D.C.,"" Mr. Sanders said at a stop in Perry on Sunday, during a frenzied Iowa swing between impeachment trial sessions. His campaign had hoped to hold 20 to 30 events in the last week before the caucuses, but, he rued, ""That is not going to be the case.""Many of the surrogates, on the other hand, have relished their elevated roles.Ms. Bessler, Ms. Klobuchar's 24-year-old daughter, hosted a house party on Thursday for supporters at a private home. Standing in a carpeted living room, she relayed many of Ms. Klobuchar's talking points, including that her mother had visited all 99 counties in the state -- a particular point of pride.""If you've been following any of the national news, you'll know that my mom has a bit of a scheduling conflict,"" Ms. Bessler said. ""So she's there but I'm here.""In a brief interview afterward, as guests ate hot dish cooked using Ms. Klobuchar's recipe, Ms. Bessler said she was ""equipped as I'll ever be"" to give her mother's closing Iowa pitch. The feedback from voters had also been encouraging.""A lot of people have said that my gestures are very similar to my mom's when I talk, so that's always good,"" she said.Mr. Castro, who along with his twin brother, Representative Joaquin Castro, campaigned for Ms. Warren in Iowa last week, said he had met ""a lot of people that I didn't necessarily get to meet when I was running.""He acknowledged that some of the people who came to hear him speak would have preferred to see Ms. Warren there, too. But he said he was ""having a good time"" and marveled at the energy and enthusiasm he had observed. He will continue campaigning for the Massachusetts senator in Iowa this week.There are celebrity surrogates, too. Jonathan Van Ness, a host of ""Queer Eye,"" campaigned for Ms. Warren in Iowa City then joined her for selfies at a town hall in Cedar Rapids. Ashley Judd, the actress and activist, held meet and greets for Ms. Warren in New Hampshire. Phill Drobnick, a Minnesotan who coached the Olympic gold medal-winning men's curling team in 2018, visited with the Des Moines Curling Club on Friday on behalf of Ms. Klobuchar.Candidates who aren't confined to Washington have deployed surrogates on the trail as well. The actress Mandy Moore recently campaigned with Pete Buttigieg. Joseph R. Biden Jr. has a cast of political proxies, including Tom Vilsack, the former governor of Iowa, and Representatives Abby Finkenauer and Cindy Axne, both of whom flipped their districts in 2018.The flurry of surrogate activity has made candidate schedules at times read more like listings for ""Celebrity Deathmatch"" than the final days of an intense campaign.It has also led to some good-natured surrogate-to-surrogate heckling.""Hey @AOC, see ya on the trail in Iowa!,"" Mr. Drobnick tweeted last Wednesday. ""If we cross paths I'd be happy to explain to ya why #AmyForAmerica is the best candidate to beat the POTUS in November.""Several voters seemed to have embraced these substitute campaigners.""We all get to see all the candidates a ton, so seeing how many people show up for this when Amy's not here is a very good sign,"" said JB Conlin, 51, of West Des Moines, who came to the hot dish event hosted by Ms. Klobuchar's daughter.With the senators back in Washington, proxies prepared to pick up the slack again. Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, the founders of Ben & Jerry's ice cream, hit the trail for Mr. Sanders for a series of ice cream socials in Iowa. Jane Sanders, Mr. Sanders's wife, is also expected to campaign for him in Iowa this week. Ms. Judd will be back in New Hampshire for Ms. Warren on Tuesday. Bruce Mann, Ms. Warren's husband, and her golden retriever, Bailey, will swing through Iowa for her on Wednesday.Still, surrogates don't bring the same thrill as seeing a candidate in person, and Mr. Buttigieg and Mr. Biden -- unbound from the duties of the Senate -- have been working hard to press their advantage in Iowa. Mr. Buttigieg has already scheduled more than 20 events in the state before caucus day. Mr. Biden has embarked on a ""Soul of the Nation"" Iowa bus tour. Andrew Yang, a former business executive who is polling lower, is on his own 17-day bus tour.In Iowa over the weekend, senators expressed gratitude for their surrogates -- but also urged them to continue.Mr. Sanders said he was depending on his surrogates to ""carry the ball forward over the finish line.""Ms. Klobuchar went further: She enlisted her supporters.""One of the messages to the people here in Ames,"" she said at an event on Sunday, ""is that I need them to run for me -- I can't be in every town like I thought I was going to be.""Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting from Ames.PhotographRepresentative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has campaigned for Bernie Sanders, and Jonathan Van Ness, a host of ""Queer Eye,"" has stumped for Elizabeth Warren. Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Amy Klobuchar have been pulled off the trail for the impeachment trial.

| Jump to first hit1. When does primary season begin? How long is it?Voting begins Feb. 3 with the Iowa caucuses. The last states vote in early June.So, four months. Like a college semester, except in the end all but one person will flunk out.2. Who will I be voting for in the primaries?The main event: candidates for the Democratic and Republican 2020 presidential nominations.But voters will find all manner of down-ballot elections to consider on primary day, including House and Senate races and seats on the state legislature. You might be voting for the presidents of tomorrow in those contests.3. What's the difference between primaries and caucuses?Primaries are reasonably straightforward: Voters vote, and their votes go to candidates who hope to receive more votes than the other candidates.Caucuses are like this in spirit, but with a dash of municipal sausage-making and D.M.V.-style chaos.Generally, supporters for various candidates sit or stand together in groups. A head count is conducted. And if a candidate doesn't reach a certain threshold of support -- say, 15 percent of attendees at a caucus site -- the group is deemed ""nonviable,"" and its members realign with other clusters before a final count is made.Democracy!4. So when do I vote?Three possibilities:Early voting. Enjoy responsibly! And check out the rules and dates for your state.Election Day voting. The classic! Also varies by state, of course.Your primary was canceled. Better luck next time!5. Can states actually cancel their primaries?They can, and they did!While President Trump would be an overwhelming favorite to win a Republican primary in any state, some of them have decided to scrap the exercise altogether. Trump critics called the moves antidemocratic, but there is bipartisan precedent for such cancellations when a party's incumbent is seeking re-election.6. Is there a Republican presidential primary, officially?Yes, in most states.Mr. Trump's opponents include Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman, and William F. Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts. At present, they are approximately as likely to win as any person reading this sentence. #SentenceReaders20207. Can I vote in both the Democratic primary and the Republican primary?One vote per person, folks.And in some states with so-called closed primaries, you'll need to be registered with a given party to participate.8. Will impeachment affect the campaign?As a practical matter, the impeachment trial in the Senate will keep several Democratic candidates in Washington during crucial would-be campaign days.As an issue for voters, impeachment is not necessarily front of mind. The top Democrats tend to agree that Mr. Trump should be removed from office -- and they also expect the Republican-led Senate to clear him.In recent weeks, voters have pressed candidates much more often on issues like health care and climate than on any allegations of executive high crimes and misdemeanors.9. Could Trump get elected president again, even after being impeached by the House?That's his plan.Mr. Trump is the first impeached president ever to seek re-election. He would like to be the first impeached president to win again.10. I keep hearing this is the largest Democratic field. How big is it, actually?At present, it's 12 deep -- enough to fill a baseball lineup and accommodate a few benchwarmers, too.At its peak, the field swelled well into the 20s, exceeding even the unwieldy 2016 Republican roster and requiring two nights of 10-person debates that nonetheless barred a handful of candidates from the stage.11. Who's likely to win the Democratic nomination?Where's the suspense in telling you now?Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has often led in national polls, but the state-level surveys are more of a muddle. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has raised the most money and retains a loyal core of support from his 2016 run.Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend., Ind., have shown strength in Iowa at various points. Betting markets appraise Mr. Biden as the likeliest nominee. They also liked Jeb Bush's chances in 2016.12. Which Democrat has the best chance of beating Trump?For months, Democratic voters have talked constantly about electability.They have had a harder time agreeing on what it means -- or at least, who best embodies it.Biden supporters say the party needs someone who can appeal to white working-class voters who gravitated to Mr. Trump.Some Warren supporters consider this to be a sexist euphemism for an older male nominee, arguing that Ms. Warren's raft of liberal plans can better inspire the masses.Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have suggested that a Midwestern sensibility is best.And Mr. Sanders, whose admirers insist he would have defeated Mr. Trump in 2016 if given the chance, has been perhaps the least subtle at times. A campaign swing planned last year was billed as the ""Bernie Beats Trump"" tour.13. Why do I keep hearing that Iowa is so important?Because Iowa goes first and has since the 1970s.Why? There's no great reason (though the tumultuous 1968 Democratic convention set the stage to an extent), and inertia is a powerful thing. It's sort of like a teacher giving extra credit to the student who comes first alphabetically, except instead of extra credit, it's kind words from national politicians about the good people of Sioux City.Strictly speaking, Iowa awards a relatively small share of delegates (more on that shortly). But winning the state, or even exceeding expectations as a non-winner, can propel a campaign through the rest of the early calendar.14. What's Super Tuesday?Super Tuesday, March 3, is perhaps the most important single date on the primary calendar because of how many major states will be holding their elections, including California and Texas.About 40 percent of all pledged Democratic delegates will be awarded in these states.15. How does someone win the Democratic nomination?A candidate hoping to win on the first ballot at the convention must secure a majority of pledged delegates, as dictated by the outcomes in state primaries and caucuses.In total, there are just under 4,000 pledged delegates up for grabs (as well as hundreds of superdelegates, though the party prefers to call them automatic delegates). The official nomination will take place at the party's convention in Milwaukee this summer.16. What are delegates?Delegates (the people) are political figures like activists and local leaders chosen to represent their states at the party convention.Delegates (the numbers) are the all-purpose metric of primary success, allocated proportionally according to state voting results.Generally, a candidate must exceed 15 percent of the vote in a congressional district or statewide to win delegates.17. What are superdelegates? Didn't they get rid of those?Democratic superdelegates are the political insiders, from sitting lawmakers to former senior party officials, whose primary choices can be divorced entirely from the preferences of workaday voters.Superdelegates can vote as they choose, and their very existence in 2016 became a source of major tension in the race between Hillary Clinton and Mr. Sanders. While Mrs. Clinton bested Mr. Sanders among pledged delegates in 2016, Mr. Sanders and his supporters saw the superdelegate system as an affront to the democratic process.In response, the Democratic National Committee has sharply reduced the influence of superdelegates, effectively preventing them from participating substantively in the first ballot of the presidential nominating process. But in the event of a deadlock at the convention, superdelegates could come into play.18. Are there any history makers in the presidential election?Ms. Warren or Ms. Klobuchar (or Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii) would be the first woman elected president. Mr. Buttigieg would be the first openly gay person to hold the office.But for all the initial excitement within the party about a deep bench of candidates of color, several -- including Senators Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey and Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary -- have dropped out. The remaining low-polling nonwhite candidates include Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, and Andrew Yang, a former technology executive.Then there is this bit of potential history: Mr. Sanders (78), Mr. Biden (77), Michael R. Bloomberg (77) and Ms. Warren (70) and would each be the oldest president ever inaugurated for a first term.19. Is there still a chance that a new longshot will emerge?Sure. Just not a great one.There's a cliché in politics: ""The only poll that matters is on Election Day."" But some other things that matter -- staffing, fund-raising, a workable delegate strategy -- are built well in advance.And many of the lower-tier candidates have been running for many, many months without catching on.A former Maryland congressman named John Delaney has been campaigning for president since the middle of 2017. He has not measurably improved his standing. But perhaps the final weeks will uncover a surge of Delan-iacs who had been keeping their feelings to themselves.20. What's Michael Bloomberg up to?Spending a nine-figure fortune on a possibly quixotic candidacy.But he does have a plan, albeit an unusual one. Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, is effectively skipping the early nominating contests to focus on delegate-rich states that vote in March and beyond. He is already ubiquitous in television ads and has amassed a small army of staff members to sustain his bid for as long as he chooses.Yet he is lagging much of the field in the often-relevant category of ""interactions with actual primary voters."" And if any candidate emerges from the February states as a clear front-runner, Mr. Bloomberg's time-biding approach could backfire.21. Which party has done better in fund-raising so far?Mr. Trump entered 2020 with more than $100 million in cash on hand and outpaced every Democrat with $46 million in the fourth quarter of 2019.But contenders for the Democratic nomination have cumulatively surpassed Mr. Trump's total, suggesting intense enthusiasm. Safe to say that neither party's nominee will go hungry this fall.22. Which voters are Democrats targeting?Mr. Biden generally does best with older voters and African-Americans. Ms. Warren is most popular with highly educated Democrats. Mr. Sanders, despite his age, rules the young. And Mr. Buttigieg, 38, despite his age, draws much of his support from a very different demographic.Particularly after Iowa and New Hampshire, which are overwhelmingly white, candidates will be pitching themselves to a much more diverse party electorate. Several candidates, particularly Mr. Buttigieg, have struggled in polls of voters of color. But many campaigns are hopeful that strong showings in the early states will earn them a longer look.23. What issues have dominated the race this year?Health care policy has probably been the most conspicuous, with divisions over the relative virtues of ""Medicare For all"" (one of Mr. Sanders's signature issues) or a more incremental approach.Gun control has come up some, especially after the El Paso massacre last summer.Ms. Warren was often the pacesetter in attention-grabbing proposals, like her bid to break up tech giants such as Amazon and Facebook.Some candidates, like Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg, have turned their attention to the more amorphous issue of national unity: They frame the election as a moment for healing, though no Democrat has identified as anti-healing, exactly.24. Does my vote in the primaries matter?Sure, why not? Nihilism is for Nietzscheans and Knicks fans.And while the piecemeal nature of the state-by-state calendar might make the process seem less exciting than the all-in-one-day general election, the primaries do resolve the nontrivial matter of choosing major party nominees.25. Is it O.K. for me to skip voting in the primaries and just vote in the general election?It's allowed.Of course, candidates tend to call every election ""the most important of our lifetime."" By definition, that can't always be true. But don't forget the down-ballot primaries, which will be of significant consequence locally in many states.26. Can I vote in the primaries in one state and then the general election in another state?Potentially, if you time it right and change your registration by the fall.And if you happen to be that rare voter moving from an early-voting primary state like New Hampshire to a November swing state like Pennsylvania, well, enjoy the attention.27. Do I need to be registered to vote in the primaries?Forty-nine states require voter registration. (North Dakota, you incorrigible contrarians.)Deadlines can be found here.28. Do I need a government-issued ID?Requirements vary by state. Here's a detailed rundown.29. What if I was removed in a voter purge?Those worried about their status can check here.30. Can I vote over the Internet?Generally, no.Some states allow it in certain (often narrowly defined) circumstances.31. Are Russians going to interfere again?The intelligence community is certainly bracing for it.Despite the president's longstanding doubts about the intelligence consensus on Russian interference in 2016, officials have warned that a sequel of sorts is in the works. After detecting evidence of Russian influence efforts in 2018, Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, said last year that he viewed the attempts as ""kind of a dress rehearsal for the big show in 2020.""32. How can I tell this year if Trump's chances of winning re-election are increasing?Historically, the health of the economy is a useful indicator. So are approval ratings.But consulting precedent can be complicated where Mr. Trump is concerned.On the one hand, his party suffered steep midterm losses in 2018 despite low unemployment and many positive economic trends. On the other, Mr. Trump won in 2016 despite often dismal favorability scores.Whether he can repeat the feat might come down to this: Was Mrs. Clinton a uniquely unpopular nominee? Or will any Democrat eventually look beatable once the president and his allies have a single opponent to attack every day?33. Should I trust the polls after 2016?Yes and no.Imperfect polls (which is to say, all of them) are still far more instructive than none at all, if contextualized with care. And while Mr. Trump's 2016 success in states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan was a surprise, the popular vote margin -- Mrs. Clinton by a couple of points -- was consistent with much of the late-stage national polling.But of course, the only bulletproof prediction through political history is that people who make political predictions will keep getting things wrong sometimes.34. Are we going to be O.K.?Were we ever, really?35. When is this all over?It's probably best not to think about that. More than 280 days left until general election.Sources: The campaigns (campaign finance); The Green Papers (election calendar and delegate numbers); Ballotpedia (canceled primaries).

| Jump to first hitJoseph R. Biden Jr. is no longer the Democratic front-runner.Against the backdrop of his defeats in Iowa and New Hampshire, Mr. Biden has fallen sharply in our national polling average. For the first time, he is behind Bernie Sanders, who has climbed to his highest point in the race yet. While the gap between them is just one percentage point, the trajectory of the last month is more decisive: Mr. Sanders has been rising steadily, while Mr. Biden has taken a sudden dive.At the moment, only two other candidates are gaining in the polls, and by decidedly modest margins: Michael R. Bloomberg and Pete Buttigieg. But none of the polls in our current average was taken after the New Hampshire primary, so the trend lines may not fully capture the latest movement in the race. If Amy Klobuchar made national gains after her surprise third-place finish in New Hampshire, or if Mr. Buttigieg has vacuumed up much more of Mr. Biden's support in the last few days, we would not see that reflected here.If the race is in a moment of turmoil, the big picture seems more or less clear. Mr. Sanders is consolidating support on the left of the party, though Elizabeth Warren has held steady so far in the double digits, while Mr. Biden struggles and no other moderate has risen rapidly to take his place. Unless Mr. Biden recovers his footing, or one of the other center-left Democrats picks up support quickly, Mr. Sanders could develop a convincing lead over a fractured group of rivals.This state of play could get confirmed or shaken up next week in Nevada, when the candidates will debate on Feb. 19 before the state's nominating caucuses on Feb. 22. Mr. Biden had been the favorite there, but Mr. Sanders and several other candidates -- most notably Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren -- have strong operations in the state. And as we saw in New Hampshire, the race is fluid enough for large numbers of voters to change their minds at the very end.The Nevada debate has the makings of a major moment in the campaign, with the potential to anoint someone as the strongest moderate in the race and to put Mr. Bloomberg's candidacy to a strenuous test. He is one poll away from qualifying for the debate, and if he makes it onstage, it will be the first time he is in an adversarial situation with a group of more practiced opponents eager to take him on.

| Jump to first hitNew figures show just how big a financial hole the former vice president was in before he pulled off a remarkable turnaround in the Democratic race.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has taken command of the Democratic primary for president despite running on a shoestring budget in a contest where Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont raised more money in February alone, $47.6 million, than Mr. Biden had spent in his previous five months combined, new federal records show.The latest disclosures from the Federal Election Commission reveal in stark detail just how badly Mr. Biden was outspent by his rivals before a decisive victory in South Carolina on Feb. 29 turned around his candidacy. Days later, Mr. Biden routed Mr. Sanders and others on Super Tuesday, and he has since built a nearly insurmountable delegate lead.""These races tend to have a moment where the thing just breaks,"" said Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist and executive director of a pro-Biden super PAC.Outgunned on the airwaves and out-organized on the ground, Mr. Biden's campaign succeeded in large part because of the overwhelming focus of Democratic voters on beating President Trump and the firm belief among many that Mr. Biden would be the party's strongest challenger.For months, Biden advisers had said they just needed enough cash to compete, and all the way through the end of February, Mr. Biden was racing to conserve that cash.He spent only $13.1 million last month -- less than the billionaire Michael R. Bloomberg was spending on average per day. During the same period, Mr. Sanders spent more than twice as much on digital and television ads alone as Mr. Biden spent on his entire campaign operation -- his payroll, his ads, his consultants, his events.In fact, Mr. Biden spent the least money in February of the seven candidates who had qualified to be on the debate stage. For the duration of the campaign, Mr. Biden ranks as only the sixth-biggest spender in the Democratic field as of the end of February. The weak fund-raising in Mr. Biden's first 10 months as a candidate -- he had only $12.1 million in the bank entering March -- could be a concern for Democrats headed into a general election against President Trump's campaign operation, which has steadily banked money for the last three years.Mr. Trump's campaign alone -- not counting his joint operations with the Republican National Committee -- reported more than $94 million still in his treasury at the end of February, more than Mr. Biden had raised in total since he entered the race in April 2019.In addition, the coronavirus pandemic has put on hold indefinitely Mr. Biden's ability to host in-person fund-raisers and is widely expected to sharply slow the pace of small online donations, as well.In the Democratic race, Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, had spent the most, a record-setting $907 million, including accrued bills. Mr. Bloomberg's sum -- in only 100 days -- is more than what President Barack Obama spent on his entire 2012 re-election campaign.Mr. Bloomberg spent more than double the billionaire Tom Steyer ($338 million), who spent more than double Mr. Sanders ($163 million), who spent more than double Mr. Biden ($76 million).Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts ($111 million) and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind. ($91 million), also both had spent more than Mr. Biden by the end of February, records show.All but Mr. Sanders have since dropped out.Advisers to Mr. Sanders have said he is assessing the future of his campaign after lopsided losses last Tuesday in Florida, Arizona and Illinois. Mr. Sanders has since ceased advertising on Facebook and stopped directly asking supporters to give money to his campaign. He instead raised $2 million from his supporters for charities helping those affected by the coronavirus.There are a seemingly endless number of ways to measure Mr. Biden's financial disadvantages in a Democratic primary he is now the prohibitive favorite to win.Mr. Biden's fund-raising was so bad in February that he fell behind Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota that month, as well. She had raised $18.7 million before dropping out ahead of Super Tuesday; Mr. Biden had raised $18.1 million.Mr. Biden had begun last month with a disappointing fourth-place finish in Iowa, dropped to fifth place in New Hampshire and nudged upward to second in Nevada. Big donors sat on the sidelines, drawn to the idea of the self-funding Mr. Bloomberg, at least until his own disastrous debate performance. Small contributors were filling the coffers of Mr. Biden's rivals.Mr. Biden had been on a trajectory for an even worse fund-raising showing in February until a surge following his South Carolina win. He said that he had raised $5 million in the 24 hours around that Feb. 29 election, lifting his fund-raising total substantially.His advisers say that his financial fortunes have shifted since South Carolina. Mr. Biden said last Sunday that he had raised $33 million in the first 15 days of March -- far more than he had raised in any full previous month.""A lot of the people who always gave us money didn't because they were doubters,"" said Steve Cozen, a friend of Mr. Biden's for decades and a fund-raiser for both his campaign and super PAC. ""They were doubters until South Carolina and Super Tuesday. Now they've opened their pocketbooks, and we're doing great.""Still, the severity of the economic impact of the coronavirus could significantly affect campaigns going forward.Mr. Biden's campaign has made one notable shift this week: He has begun to actively raise general election funds, allowing all the donors who had previously contributed the maximum $2,800 for the primary to give another $2,800 for the general election.Mr. Biden received relatively little assistance from the super PAC Unite the Country during the crucial month of February. The group spent about $3.8 million and raised $4.2 million that month, with about half of that money coming on Feb. 28 in the form of two $1 million checks, one from Reid Hoffman, the Silicon Valley entrepreneur who is a co-founder of LinkedIn, and one from Yaron Minsky, a programmer at the stock-trading firm Jane Street.The biggest super PAC donations in February went to Ms. Warren, who had been one of the party's most outspoken critics of the influence of big money. Just ahead of the Nevada caucuses, a mysterious super PAC spent more than $15 million on her behalf.The donors to that group were unmasked late Friday, and almost all the money -- $14.6 million of it -- came from a single donor: Karla Jurvetson, a Silicon Valley contributor who is a board member of Emily's List, the group that supports Democratic women.PhotographWord count: 1108Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitBoth men have seemed energized by a renewed debate on war and peace, but no two candidates better illustrate the divisions among Democrats about what American leadership abroad should look like.DECORAH, Iowa -- Hours after an American drone strike killed Iran's top military commander, Joseph R. Biden Jr. stood in a barnlike building in Independence, Iowa, thundering about the importance of electing an experienced president as America faces tumult abroad -- and ""maybe, God forbid,"" war.About 70 miles away, Senator Bernie Sanders was just as passionate as he denounced military spending and encouraged international diplomacy.""Maybe what we should be doing is figuring out how as a planet we work together instead of going to war with each other,"" Mr. Sanders told the crowd on Friday inside a building on the Winneshiek County fairgrounds. Earlier in the day, he emphasized the need to ""get our priorities right"" by investing in issues at home rather than on military action abroad.Amid signs that both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have found their footing in Iowa after months of being overshadowed here, they are now aggressively seizing on the escalating tensions with Iran to press their starkly divergent cases for the presidency as they compete for an overlapping slice of the electorate.Both men seemed newly energized on the campaign trail, treating the Iran confrontation as a clarifying political moment, as well as a tailor-made opportunity to showcase their long records on international affairs. And yet no two candidates better illustrate the sharp divisions in the Democratic Party about what American leadership abroad should look like.Mr. Biden, the former vice president, has focused on highlighting his decades-long résumé in foreign policy and his relationships overseas, casting himself as the candidate best prepared to assume the commander-in-chief title ""on Day 1.""In contrast, Mr. Sanders is emphasizing his long-held aversion to war while steadfastly promoting a domestic political agenda for America's working class.The rising tensions with Iran have also afforded Mr. Sanders a fresh opportunity to highlight his diplomacy-centered vision for foreign policy -- and in particular his opposition to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, a stance that underscores his contrast with Mr. Biden, who voted to authorize that war.""Joe Biden has prided himself on foreign policy experience for the last several decades,"" said Sean Bagniewski, the Democratic chairman in Polk County. ""I've heard Iowans say they think this election may focus more on foreign policy than many of us expected and that he's now their guy.""He added, ""On the flip side, Bernie was one of the few Democrats to vote against the war in Iraq. I've heard folks say that reinforces their decision to support someone who they think had been right all along.""The competition to gain the upper hand on national security played out in vivid relief on the campaign trail over the weekend, as tensions escalated between the two candidates over their judgment on matters of war and peace. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders both delivered forceful remarks in several of the same towns and cities in eastern Iowa, offering sharpened messages about America's role in the world and their visions of presidential leadership.In temperament, ideology and style on the campaign trail, the gregarious, gaffe-prone, relatively moderate Mr. Biden and the disciplined, democratic socialist Mr. Sanders could not be more different. Yet polling and interviews on the ground demonstrate that they have some overlapping appeal here, especially with the white, working-class voters who are skeptical of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., the other two front-runners in Iowa who have done well with college-educated voters.Less than one month before the caucuses, as Ms. Warren struggles to regain her momentum in the state, Mr. Biden is drawing notably more energized crowds -- even if they are often smaller than those of his chief rivals -- and attendees at his events frequently say that he makes them feel safe. Mr. Sanders, lifted by his loyal supporters, has displayed enduring political strength despite having a heart attack in October.Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders both appear to be ""doing fairly well"" in Dubuque, a heavily Catholic, blue-collar city along the Mississippi River where they campaigned this past week, said Steven Drahozal, the Democratic chairman of Dubuque County.""This is the type of community, I think, that actually, interestingly, plays well to both of them,"" Mr. Drahozal said. Mr. Biden, a Catholic, has longstanding relationships in the city, but Mr. Drahozal added that Dubuque also had a ""very vocal, very active, very progressive community that is very supportive of Senator Sanders.""Mr. Sanders views his consistent diplomacy-over-conflict stance -- dating to his opposition to the Vietnam War and his anti-interventionist foreign policy as mayor of Burlington, Vt. -- as an advantage with working-class Americans who are frustrated with the country's involvement in costly and distant wars.""I know that it is rarely the children of the billionaire class who face the agony of reckless foreign policy -- it is the children of working families,"" he said on Friday, reading from prepared remarks at an event in Anamosa.Aides to Mr. Sanders view him as well positioned against Mr. Biden -- who in many ways embodies the centrist Washington establishment Mr. Sanders dislikes -- and they have urged him for months to go after the former vice president more directly. With foreign affairs, Mr. Sanders's campaign sees an opportunity not just to call attention to the senator's consistent resistance to war but also to draw an easy-to-grasp contrast between the two candidates.Even before the airstrike in Iraq last week, Mr. Sanders's aides had been eager to highlight his foreign policy views. But though he speaks on the trail about his opposition to America's support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, foreign policy has so far taken a back seat in his campaign to domestic policy proposals like ""Medicare for all"" and tuition-free public college.At an event in Dubuque on Saturday, however, Mr. Sanders called on Congress to ""take immediate steps to restrain President Trump from plunging our nation into yet another endless war.""His foreign policy views have struck a chord with voters in Iowa like Peggy Ross, 67, a bookseller from Decorah. ""I think he has the right idea,"" she said after seeing Mr. Sanders speak. ""No one likes war.""Yet Mr. Sanders's dovish stances and his emphasis on domestic matters could also prove to be liabilities with voters who want a firmer response to foreign aggression than he appears to promote. They could also weaken his standing among Americans who are clamoring for an experienced hand in the international arena at a moment of global turmoil.A CNN poll from late November found that 48 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters thought Mr. Biden was best equipped to handle foreign policy; Mr. Sanders was a distant second at 14 percent.Mr. Biden, who chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when he represented Delaware, is perhaps at his most fluent and comfortable when discussing international affairs, and he has made that issue a centerpiece of his message in a race that has been largely limited to domestic debates.His campaign has run ads emphasizing his national security experience, and on Friday posted some of them on Twitter after news broke of the drone strike. On Sunday, the campaign announced endorsements from three Democratic members of Congress, all of whom are military veterans.Mr. Biden's allies say that renewed national focus on foreign policy allows him to strike a clear contrast with both Mr. Trump and his Democratic rivals, and injects fresh urgency into the question of who is the most electable candidate.The gravity of the moment ""propels deep interest among people in seeing the strongest candidate against Trump,"" said Thomas E. Donilon, who was former President Barack Obama's national security adviser and is supporting Mr. Biden.And Mr. Biden, he said, was ""a natural person to look to as a steady, experienced hand to deal with these issues on Day 1."" (Mr. Donilon's brother, Mike Donilon, is Mr. Biden's chief strategist.)Throughout his latest Iowa bus tour, Mr. Biden frequently emphasized his relationships abroad and depth of experience as he warned against war in the Middle East. The next president, he said, will ""inherit a country that is divided, and a world that's in disarray.""He added, ""There can be no time for on-the-job training"" -- a message that could apply, he has suggested, to any of his leading rivals.""With all due respect, I think I'm best prepared"" on leadership matters compared to ""anybody running,"" Mr. Biden told an applauding crowd of about 700 on Saturday night in Des Moines.It was not always a message delivered crisply, or accurately; on several occasions he suggested that Iran had a population of around 40 million people even though it is a nation of more than 80 million people. He also cited Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, when he intended to refer to Osama bin Laden, the Al Qaeda leader.In Des Moines, when Mr. Biden was pressed by an attendee on his foreign policy record, he noted, as he often does, that he had quickly grown disillusioned with the Bush administration's handling of Iraq and that he had become a vocal opponent of the war. A CNN fact-check published Monday found his remarks about when his opposition to the war began to be misleading.He was also questioned on his view of the raid that killed bin Laden; Mr. Biden's answer on that issue has changed over the years.""It's not to suggest I haven't made mistakes in my career, but I will put my record against anyone in public life in terms of foreign policy,"" Mr. Biden said.At weekend events for both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, attendees viewed the unfolding developments in Iran with anxiety, if not grave apprehension.""We don't need to waste any more time,"" said Korlu P. Jallah, 22, who attended an event for Mr. Biden in Waterloo on Saturday morning and said she was supporting him because of his experience. ""We're in a huge mess given the fact that we could possibly go to war with Iran.""Still, she said, Mr. Sanders is her second choice.PhotographJoseph R. Biden Jr. in Independence, Iowa.

| Jump to first hitTheir tech employees are a different story.SAN FRANCISCO -- The Silicon Valley venture capitalist Keith Rabois, onstage in January at a tech conference, said his first choice for president was a Democrat, Pete Buttigieg.And, sure, it would be a close call for Joseph R. Biden Jr. over President Trump. But Bernie Sanders?At that, Mr. Rabois, who has been a top executive at or invested in LinkedIn, Square, Yelp and PayPal, balked. Speaking to the crowd, he drew the line at democratic socialism. (Mr. Buttigieg ended his campaign on Sunday night.)""I would certainly vote for Trump over Sanders,"" Mr. Rabois declared.When it comes to the 2020 Democratic primaries, with California poised to allocate hundreds of delegates this week on Super Tuesday, many tech leaders in Silicon Valley have a plea: Anyone but Sanders.From venture capitalists to chief executives, the tech elite are favoring moderates like Mr. Buttigieg and Michael R. Bloomberg. And with Mr. Sanders, the independent senator from Vermont, leading the field in California and looking like the front-runner for the nomination, the tone among the leadership is growing more urgent. Few tech executives want to end up stuck choosing between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump. Meanwhile, tech company workers are gathering en masse for Mr. Sanders.While Silicon Valley has long leaned blue, the chasm between centrist Democrats and an animated left wing has created uncertainty. And now two other things are happening. California Republicans see an opportunity. And a new moderate party in the state -- the Common Sense Party -- is rising.""I'm trying to balance what socialism means versus four more years of Trump, and honestly it feels like which is the worse of two evils?"" said Venky Ganesan, a partner at the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, whose disaffection with the presidential field has led him toward the Common Sense Party.He said the vast majority of his venture capital industry colleagues had the same dilemma. ""Eighty percent are thinking the same thing, but many do not speak out,"" Mr. Ganesan said.It is not a huge surprise that the big winners of the tech boom would be wary of Mr. Sanders and his rival Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, who have both taunted Silicon Valley's elite. But the technorati are training their animus on Mr. Sanders as he has surged in the early states that have voted.Mr. Sanders has said broadly that ""billionaires should not exist"" -- and in Silicon Valley, there are a lot of billionaires. He has also called for Google to be split up and criticized it for being antiworker. He has told Apple that it does not pay enough in taxes, and he has tapped Amazon employees to appear in a video criticizing the company's environmental record.Mr. Sanders also wants to raise the corporate tax to 35 percent. And in perhaps his most aggressive attack on the tech industry, he has proposed earlier taxation on stock options, the equity that has fueled the wealth of many in Silicon Valley.""If your goal was to destroy the Silicon Valley ecosystem of creating new companies, this would be an effective way to do it,"" Adam Nash, a tech investor and former executive at Dropbox, wrote on Twitter last week, referring to Mr. Sanders's stock options proposal.Ramesh Srinivasan, who is part of Mr. Sanders's campaign and is focused on tech issues, said the senator was ""not the foe of tech entrepreneurs."" He said that the policies would encourage job growth and support small businesses and that the campaign was about ""just restoring balance.""But Silicon Valley's leadership suspects a coming war.Among the donors to Mr. Buttigieg's campaign in the last year were Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix; Ben Silbermann, the chief executive of Pinterest; Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn; and John Doerr, a prominent venture capitalist, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Mr. Hoffman also donated to Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. And Eric Schmidt, Google's former chief executive, donated to Mr. Biden.Not only are Silicon Valley's leaders giving money to Mr. Sanders's competitors, they are lending their muscle to the campaigns.Mr. Buttigieg's national investment chair was Swati Mylavarapu, a former partner at the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. The Bloomberg campaign's digital ad firm, Hawkfish, is being run by a former chief marketing officer of Facebook, Gary Briggs.Chamath Palihapitiya, a former Facebook executive who is now a venture capitalist, said he would like to see Mr. Bloomberg at the top of the ticket, paired with Ms. Klobuchar or Ms. Warren.""Bernie is validation of an important wing in the party, but at the top of the ticket he would probably be McGovern 2.0 and Trump will win in a landslide,"" he said, referring to the liberal 1972 Democratic nominee, George McGovern.How Silicon Valley votes matters because it leans overwhelmingly Democratic and there is a tremendous amount of capital. What is striking about this primary cycle is the schism between the people who run the companies and their workers.Consider that employees of Alphabet gave $499,309 to Mr. Sanders for the 2020 cycle, his second-largest total donations from one employer after University of California employees, according to data compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics. By comparison, Mr. Buttigieg's 2020 run had raised $294,860 from Alphabet employees.""There's a massive split between leadership and rank and file,"" said Luis Zamora, a co-president of the San Francisco Young Democrats. ""Bernie wants employees to be able to take over some of the ownership of the company, and that's not going to fly.""A party for a moderate partyFor a group of California technologists dismayed by what they see as the populist turn of both national parties, the solution -- albeit only a statewide one -- is to ditch the two-party system altogether.On a cool evening in Palo Alto, at the Stanford University Faculty Club in September, those technologists and activists launched the Common Sense Party.It was a response, they said, to what they call the one-party monopoly in the state. They hoped to carve out Democrats who feel isolated from their party's leftward lurch.""One party is the puppet of the public unions and wants government to run everything, and the other party is the puppet of the religious autocrats who want us all to act in a certain manner,"" said Tim Draper, a venture capitalist and a Common Sense supporter. ""No party is supporting a moderate agenda of someone who wants freedom to prosper and freedom to act.""The Faculty Club is a low-slung building, popular for weddings on the manicured Stanford campus.""Many C.E.O.s are a little off-put by some of the current crop of candidates for president,"" said Julie Meier Wright, one of the Common Sense Party organizers and formerly California's first secretary of trade and commerce.Common Sense has close to 20,000 signatures. To qualify as a new party on the ballot, they hope to get 67,000 by the summer.California Republicans see a rare opportunityRepublicans see a different way through this morass -- turning the disaffected moderates into full-fledged members of the G.O.P.""California Democrats just really haven't been good friends to Silicon Valley,"" said Jessica Millan Patterson, chairwoman of the California Republican Party.For a long time, she said, many local conservatives felt despondent about the state's politics. Now they find themselves surprisingly optimistic.The state party raised more money online in 2019 than it did in 2017 and 2018 combined, rising from a few thousand dollars a month in 2018 to tens of thousands of dollars a month in 2019, Ms. Millan Patterson said.""Darkness has turned into hope,"" she said.Republicans are making inroads in the tech world, Ms. Millan Patterson added. She cited state laws like A.B. 5, which went into effect on Jan. 1 and put strong regulations on freelancers, as another reason Republicans are gathering momentum. The goal behind the legislation was to push employers to hire full-time workers instead of contractors, but many freelancers have lost work.Peter Thiel, the venture capitalist, has long been the tech industry's dissident Republican voice. He spoke at the 2016 Republican National Convention to support Mr. Trump, but few tech executives held high-profile fund-raisers for the president in the last election cycle.That may be changing. In February, Larry Ellison, Oracle's chief executive, hosted a fund-raiser for Mr. Trump in Palm Springs, Calif. Some Oracle employees wrote a petition, which garnered nearly 10,000 signatures online, asking Mr. Ellison to cancel the event. When he did not, about 300 walked out of the office or logged off from work, a protest organized by the Oracle group Employees for Ethics.Tech workers gather for SandersSome tech employees are getting ready to be at odds with their bosses. In a crowded piano bar in San Francisco's Tenderloin neighborhood recently, a few dozen young Democrats gathered to watch the candidates debate. Organizers tried to think if anyone in the room that night or in their group more broadly supported the two tech leader favorites at the time, Mr. Buttigieg or Mr. Bloomberg. It was hard.""I'm hard pressed to even think of a young person who I know who is supporting one of those,"" said Zhihan Zou, 25, executive director of the San Francisco Democratic Party. ""I'm struggling seriously.""""I know -- me, too,"" said Adam Miller, 28, who recently left a job at LinkedIn to run a start-up to sell tech tools to political campaigns. ""Can't think of one.""The tech workers cited a geographic divide: Many employees live in San Francisco, while industry leaders tend to live in extremely wealthy enclaves like Los Gatos and Atherton, where homes often have gates and long driveways.""They're physically removed,"" Mr. Zou said of the bosses.Alek Chakroff, 35, a user-experience researcher at Google, said it came down to who has the most to lose from a wealth tax, which both Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren support.He brought up Alphabet's top boss, Sundar Pichai. He does not know how Mr. Pichai plans to vote, but guessed it would not be Mr. Sanders.""How much stock did Sundar just sell? $500 million?"" he said.The group said they were excited about Mr. Sanders's odds for winning the majority of California's delegates on Tuesday.Mr. Zamora was greeting people at the door of the piano club.""It's very much a young folks versus the old folks,"" he said.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Sunday in San Jose, Calif. Tech companies' rank-and-file workers, unlike many of their bosses, are backing his Democratic candidacy for president.

| Jump to first hitThe Biden campaign and a long list of surrogates are striving to engage progressive Democrats who have so far been cool to Mr. Biden's presidential bid.Through conversations on Capitol Hill, engagement with local activists and policy nods toward Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s campaign and its allies are ramping up overtures to progressives, aiming to improve Mr. Biden's standing with a key part of the Democratic coalition in an effort to unite the party around his potential nomination.Mr. Biden has assembled a broad base of support from black and suburban white voters as he has racked up a string of victories over the last month. But many younger and left-wing Democrats remain deeply skeptical of Mr. Biden, who continues to battle Mr. Sanders for the nomination, and some are strenuously resistant to his candidacy.Aware of the importance of Democratic unity after Hillary Clinton suffered from a divisive primary contest in 2016, and hopeful of extending his delegate lead after primary elections in three states on Tuesday, the Biden campaign and a long list of surrogates are striving to engage some of those Democrats who have so far rejected Mr. Biden's presidential bid.""We're going to go talk to them and we're going to reach out to them,"" said Representative Cedric L. Richmond, Democrat of Louisiana and one of the Biden campaign's national co-chairs. ""They can help chart their future. They don't have to be bystanders as other people do. It means going and talking to them, inviting them to the table. I will absolutely be involved. It's already started.""Mr. Richmond has spoken on a regular basis, including recently, with Representative Ro Khanna of California, a national co-chair of Mr. Sanders's campaign. Mr. Richmond has made it clear that ""he would make every effort to make sure that Biden's campaign was very inclusive"" if Mr. Biden becomes the Democratic nominee, Mr. Khanna said in an interview.Both Mr. Biden, 77, the former vice president, and Mr. Sanders, 78, the Vermont senator, have pledged to actively support whoever becomes the Democratic nominee, and they have a better personal relationship than Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders had during their contentious 2016 primary matchup. There is also little appetite among many voters for the kind of infighting that characterized earlier chapters of this cycle's primary contest, as the nation grapples with the coronavirus crisis.Against that backdrop, Mr. Biden's allies argue -- even as they have been careful not to pressure Mr. Sanders to drop out -- that it is time to unify more quickly around Mr. Biden's candidacy in order to focus fully on defeating President Trump, a view many Sanders supporters strongly reject. To that end, Mr. Biden has made overt public gestures to the left in recent days.On the debate stage on Sunday night, where he promised to select a female running mate if nominated, Mr. Biden also said that he had recently spoken to Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts senator. He has endorsed a proposal she offered during her campaign to overhaul the consumer bankruptcy system -- a striking policy shift because Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren had clashed over bankruptcy legislation more than a decade ago when he was a senator from Delaware and she was a Harvard law professor.Hours before the debate, his campaign also announced that he had decided to support making public colleges and universities tuition-free for many students, adopting a proposal that Mr. Sanders put forward a few years ago. While a nod to the left, Mr. Biden's move was hardly a display of progressive boldness: Mrs. Clinton offered a similar proposal in 2016 after her primary fight with Mr. Sanders, and the proposal Mr. Biden endorsed is more limited than what Mr. Sanders is advocating in the 2020 campaign.""For Vice President Biden it's about a lack of consistency,"" Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan and a Sanders supporter, said in a recent interview. Personal engagement has to be coupled with the embrace of bold policy, she said.Some activists say the personal outreach could be improved, too.""We've heard from them some but not nearly as much as we'd like to,"" said María Urbina, the national political director at Indivisible, a major grass-roots progressive organization. ""I think they've done a handful of outreach but there are some pretty substantive conversations we'd love to have.""Still, if he is the nominee, she said, ""We will do everything we can to get him elected.""Mr. Biden is undeniably more moderate than Mr. Sanders, who is a democratic socialist. But Mr. Biden's allies argue that the former vice president does embrace relatively bold policy -- if at a more incremental pace, and on a less sweeping scale, than Mr. Sanders does. Their focus now is on promoting some of those proposals, from gun control to combating climate change, and on learning more about what supporters of other current and former candidates need to hear from Mr. Biden.""No. 1 is making it clear that we have great respect for Senator Sanders and Senator Warren,"" said Mayor Darrell Steinberg of Sacramento, a Biden endorser. ""It is important we recognize and understand why young people, many young people, have been driven to that message.""Internally, the Biden campaign has staff working on outreach to students, young professionals and young elected officials. Many of those officials are then engaging in their own progressive outreach in their cities and states, sounding out local liberal activists, for example, or talking with their fellow elected leaders.Behind the scenes, a number of Mr. Biden's congressional allies have also been contacting officials who supported Ms. Warren in particular, both in Congress and around the country.""I've certainly been reaching out to a lot of the progressives"" who supported Ms. Warren, said Representative Ruben Gallego, Democrat of Arizona, ""asking them to keep their minds and hearts open, and also just to see if they have any suggestions about policies or topics they want to see in the campaign.""Mr. Gallego has made overtures both to congressional colleagues and to progressive leaders in Arizona with an additional focus on Latino leaders. Mr. Sanders has shown strength with Latino voters in the primary, though he faced challenges with Cuban-Americans in particular in Florida.The goal, Mr. Gallego said, is ""having a more welcoming approach to, definitely, the Bernie camp.""Yet seeking to build relationships with elected officials is not the same thing as generating the kind of organic grass-roots support Mr. Sanders enjoys. And the limits of more explicit outreach to the Sanders campaign were on vivid display at the debate on Sunday night, as Mr. Sanders continued to wage his own vigorous primary battle.Some Biden officials and allies suggested that they were surprised when Mr. Sanders repeatedly ripped Mr. Biden's Senate record, even as both men avoided the kind of personal attacks that had defined matchups with other candidates. Allies of Mr. Sanders, however, said it was legitimate for Mr. Sanders to sharply contrast Mr. Biden's views with his own, while continuing to pitch liberal policies that he believes are vital to the nation's interests.Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, which endorsed Ms. Warren and is now supporting Mr. Sanders, said Mr. Biden's embrace of the bankruptcy overhaul and tuition-free college were steps in the right direction. But he suggested that Mr. Biden should more robustly address a number of other policy issues that are important to progressives, such as climate change and a wealth tax.""I think him signaling the fact that he is open to taking good ideas from progressives is a start,"" Mr. Mitchell said. ""But unless, for example, he adopts a real climate plan that actually is at the scale of the problem, I don't think he'll ever attract the young people who are fired up.""And there are many progressives who say that while they will support the eventual nominee, they do not feel the need to pick a side right now, even as the Biden campaign rushes to consolidate support.Representative Andy Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who supported Ms. Warren in the primary, said he was ""still in mourning"" over her exit from the race, though he praised Mr. Biden's embrace of her bankruptcy plan. He said that former Gov. James J. Blanchard of Michigan has been in touch, urging him to support Mr. Biden, but he is in no hurry.""I'm not sitting around waiting for Joe or somebody to call me,"" Mr. Levin said. ""If Joe Biden is the nominee, my job becomes to unify him and progressives, and at the same time try to pin him down to govern as progressively as possible because that's the way that progressives are going to authentically get excited about him.""Some of Mr. Biden's supporters are aware of the delicacy required in engaging Democrats who backed other candidates, and say that outreach to Sanders supporters in particular can only accelerate in earnest once the primary is effectively concluded.""The way to do it is to go right to the organizations that have supported the other candidates and to show them the respect that they deserve,"" Mr. Steinberg, the Sacramento mayor, said. ""Understand the underlying motivations and issues that drove the candidacies of their candidates, and connect and meet with them, and listen.""Astead W. Herndon contributed reporting.Astead W.

| Jump to first hitDemocrats increasingly regard winning the Senate as their last remaining check on President Trump, should he win re-election, while Republicans fight to maintain power in Congress.WASHINGTON -- The 2020 battle for control of the Senate gets underway in earnest Tuesday, with both parties increasingly seeing the chamber as a must-win prize to guard against uncertainty over who will wind up in the White House.Republicans, seeing little chance of reclaiming the House and facing prospective Senate losses, are working to hold their majority to maintain their alliance with President Trump should he win re-election or serve as a firewall against a Democrat in the Oval Office. Democrats, who detect some opportunities against Republican incumbents struggling with home-state voters, regard control of the Senate as their only hope of reining in Mr. Trump if he wins, and a crucial perch to support a new presidential ally should Mr. Trump fall short.""I always thought that as we got closer to the election, more and more people would focus on the Senate, and that is what is happening,"" Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in an interview.With the vice president empowered to cast tiebreaking votes in the Senate, Democrats need a net gain of three seats to take the majority if the party captures the White House; four if not. Republicans can afford to lose up to three seats and hold their majority as long as Mr. Trump is re-elected. Both sides acknowledge the majority is up for grabs in a chamber paralyzed by dysfunction and intense partisanship, whose reputation for independence and reasoned debate has been tarnished. A photo finish is not out of the question.""The Senate majority is in play,"" said Nathan L. Gonzales, a nonpartisan handicapper and editor of Inside Elections. ""The races are close enough that a 50-50 Senate is a real possibility.""Voters in Alabama, North Carolina and Texas will make the first crucial Senate candidate selections on Super Tuesday. The environment is volatile, unsettled by the bitter Democratic presidential primary, the potential fallout from the failed effort to remove Mr. Trump from office, and now the rising threat of the coronavirus and its economic and health implications. Some Democrats in Congress have begun to sound the alarm about potential down-ballot damage if Senator Bernie Sanders, the independent from Vermont and self-described democratic socialist, is the party's presidential nominee.But Republicans have news for Democratic contenders for the Senate: They will be branded socialists whether Mr. Sanders is at the top of the ticket or not.""Bernie will be on the ballot regardless, because every Democrat has gone there and we will spend whatever it takes to make sure voters knows it,"" said Kevin McLaughlin, the executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, referring to expansive social programs embraced by Democratic presidential candidates during the raucous primary campaign.The strategy is already apparent. In Arizona, Senator Martha McSally, a Republican who has trailed in polls against her Democratic challenger Mark Kelly, a former astronaut, hit Mr. Kelly as ""too liberal"" for the state in a recent ad entitled ""Bernie Bro."" In Georgia, Senator Kelly Loeffler, a newly appointed Republican who will be on the ballot in November, declared in an ad that ""socialism risks everything that makes us great.""Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, underscored the coming approach in his own comments last week. ""If you look at what the various candidates for president on the Democratic ticket are saying, there's not a whole lot of difference between any of them,"" he told reporters. ""They all look pretty much the same to me, and pretty much the same is very, very far to the left.""Democrats say they are ready to counter that argument and have carefully selected candidates who have carved out their own distinct political ground to match their state. Most Senate Democratic challengers have already disavowed ""Medicare for all,"" a centerpiece of Mr. Sanders's agenda, saying instead that Congress should focus on improving the Affordable Care Act.""Our candidates chose to run independent of what was happening at the top of the ticket,"" Mr. Schumer said.The first test for Democrats and how well they have gauged the field will be on Tuesday, when all eyes are on the presidential race but voters will make pivotal decisions that will shape the race for control of Congress. In North Carolina, where Democrats hope to defeat Senator Thom Tillis, a Republican who polls show is strikingly unpopular, Senate Democrats are supporting Cal Cunningham, a military veteran and former state lawmaker, over the state senator Erica D. Smith. Ms. Smith received unusual advertising support during the primary from a group with ties to Mr. McConnell in a Republican effort to help pick Mr. Tillis's opponent.A loss by Mr. Cunningham would be a setback for national Democrats who see him as the strongest challenger to Mr. Tillis, a top target. In another Tuesday primary, Senate Democrats have endorsed M.J. Hegar, a former Air Force helicopter pilot who is running in a crowded field in Texas to take on the Republican senator John Cornyn.Republicans have a high-profile primary of their own on Tuesday in Alabama, where the incumbent Doug Jones is the most endangered Senate Democrat to face re-election this year. The contest is among Jeff Sessions, the former senator trying to regain his seat after a rocky tenure as Mr. Trump's attorney general; Tommy Tuberville, a former football coach of Auburn University; and Representative Bradley Byrne. With Mr. Sessions and Mr. Tuberville the favorites in recent polling, it is likely headed to a runoff on March 31.At the moment, Republicans consider their biggest problem to be a nasty intraparty fight in Georgia, where Ms. Loeffler is being challenged by Representative Doug Collins, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee who was a steadfast defender of Mr. Trump during the impeachment inquiry. Despite intense pressure from Senate Republican leadership -- and a hint from Mr. Trump that he could be named national intelligence director -- Mr. Collins has refused to bow out, and the two Republicans are in an escalating feud.Since it is a special election to fill a vacancy, candidates from all parties will be on the Nov. 3 ballot, and Republican strategists fear that the internal battle will allow Democrats to slip in and take control of the race -- even potentially imperiling Georgia's other Senate seat held by the Republican David Perdue, who is facing re-election.Republicans also have concerns in Kansas, where Mr. McConnell tried unsuccessfully to entice Secretary of State Mike Pompeo into running. Now another well-known but polarizing candidate, Kris Kobach, who lost a run for governor in 2018 to a Democrat, is leading in the polls. Republicans are concerned Mr. Kobach could cost them a seat in what should be a reliably Republican state. Democrats see as formidable their preferred candidate, Barbara Bollier, a state senator who left the Republican Party to become a Democrat in 2018.Democrats and their allies are already pouring tens of millions of dollars into defeating the Republican incumbents Cory Gardner in Colorado, Susan Collins in Maine, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Mr. Tillis and Ms. McSally while taking a run at seats in Georgia, Kansas and perhaps Texas. Republicans hope to take back the Alabama seat, protect their incumbents and try to steal another seat away from Democrats, with Michigan -- now represented by Senator Gary Peters -- considered their best prospect.Adding to the uncertainty, Georgia has set a date of Jan. 5 for a runoff should no candidate in the special election there win a majority, meaning that control of the Senate could be in doubt into early next year.Republicans note that even if they lost a few incumbents, they could retain a narrow majority. Democrats believe they can seize the majority irrespective of who wins the presidency.Electoral patterns over the last decade have shown that presidential and Senate voting is much more closely correlated than it had been in the past, with fewer ticket splitters. Both parties may need to defy that trend if they hope to end up controlling the Senate gavel in 2021.PhotographSusan Collins of Maine is one of the G.O.P. senators the Democrats are targeting. Several key primaries will be held on Tuesday.

| Jump to first hit""Unfortunately, this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,"" Mr. Biden said. In his own address, Mr. Sanders said the coronavirus crisis was ""on the scale of major war.""WILMINGTON, Del. -- Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Thursday delivered a forceful rebuke of President Trump's leadership amid the coronavirus crisis, seeking to project steadiness and resolve from his perch as the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.In his own speech about the pandemic, Senator Bernie Sanders, Mr. Biden's main rival, also flamed the president's response. He provided a long list of policy proposals aimed in particular at helping low-income and working-class families, providing a glimpse of the extraordinary measures he might take if he were president.""The crisis we face from the coronavirus is on a scale of a major war,"" he said at a news conference in Burlington, Vt. ""And we must act accordingly.""Taken together, the candidates' blistering denunciations of the president's handling of the outbreak signaled that the coronavirus has fully overtaken the 2020 race, forcing the candidates to cancel events and propose new ways of campaigning, putting fresh political pressure on Mr. Trump, and placing matters of public health and trust at the forefront of the contest.Mr. Biden, the former vice president, spoke Thursday afternoon from the Hotel du Pont in Wilmington, Del., about the grave challenges the country faces, and he detailed his ideas for managing the outbreak. He also aimed to draw sharp contrasts with Mr. Trump a day after the president addressed the nation from the Oval Office, establishing a preview of what Mr. Biden hopes will be a general election matchup.""Unfortunately, this virus laid bare the severe shortcomings of the current administration,"" Mr. Biden said, speaking from the hotel where he announced his 1972 bid for the Senate. ""Public fears are being compounded by pervasive lack of trust in this president fueled by adversarial relationship with the truth that he continues to have.""This moment of national anxiety, some of Mr. Biden's allies believe, throws into sharp relief the choice Americans would face in a general-election matchup between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump, and the stakes of that contest. Mr. Biden has been seeking to frame the race as a two-person contest against the president, in ways overt and subtle, even as he continues a primary battle with Mr. Sanders.In his remarks, Mr. Biden offered his own plan for combating the virus, with proposals that included rapidly and vastly expanding testing -- tests, he said, should be available at no charge -- moving aggressively to boost hospital capacity and supporting an accelerated push for a vaccine that he said should be ""again, free of charge."" And he argued that ""the administration's failure on testing is colossal.""""We are not ready yet, and the clock is ticking,"" he warned.He also described plans to help those who are struggling financially at a time of economic peril, appeared dismissive of corporate tax subsidies and said it was a ""national disgrace that millions of our fellow citizens don't have a single day of paid sick leave.""Mr. Sanders, for his part, urged the president to declare the pandemic a national emergency, and encouraged the public and private sectors to work together to combat the virus and its effects. Like Mr. Biden, he outlined a list of recommendations to deal with the pandemic, including establishing national and state information hotlines, making all treatment ""free of charge,"" providing ""emergency unemployment assistance"" to those who lose their jobs, and expanding the Meals on Wheels and school lunch programs and SNAP ""so that no one goes hungry during this crisis."" He also urged a ""moratorium on evictions, on foreclosures and on utility shut offs.""Perhaps above all, he used the health crisis as another opportunity to call for his signature health care plan, ""Medicare for all.""""Our country is at a severe disadvantage compared to every other major country on earth because we do not guarantee health care to all people as a right,"" he said.His remarks amounted to a vigorous critique of Mr. Trump, cloaked in the kind of sweeping, uncompromising proposals that have long defined his democratic socialist agenda. He left the news conference without taking questions.Mr. Biden's appearance here in Delaware came as his campaign underwent another shake-up after an initial shuffling last month. He brought on a new campaign manager as his team works to build out what has been an underfunded operation with major organizational challenges -- despite a flurry of primary victories over the past two weeks.Amid those successes, Mr. Biden has further intensified his focus on Mr. Trump, acting as if the general election were already underway. On Wednesday, his team announced the formation of a ""Public Health Advisory Committee"" studded with prominent health leaders and alumni of former President Barack Obama's administration -- a rollout that seemed intended to conjure the actions a president might take.Members included Vivek Murthy, a former surgeon general; Ezekiel J. Emanuel, a prominent oncologist and a vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania; and Lisa Monaco, who served as a homeland security and counterterrorism adviser to Mr. Obama. And when he spoke on Thursday, he did so against a backdrop of American flags, reading from teleprompters to the click of cameras and beginning with a nod to his ""fellow Americans,"" a setting reminiscent of a White House address.""No president can promise to prevent future outbreaks,"" he said. ""But I can promise you this. When I'm president, we will be better prepared, respond better and recover better. We'll lead with science. We'll listen to the experts. We'll heed their advice. And we'll build American leadership and rebuild it to rally the world to meet the global threats.""Throughout his remarks, Mr. Biden nodded -- as he often does -- to what he cast as the resiliency and potential of the American people.Mr. Biden, who is 77, did not stop to take shouted questions about his own health.He has previously expressed shock and frustration at Mr. Trump's past skeptical remarks about the severity of the virus, and has sketched out other steps he would take as president to fight it, noting his work as vice president in combating Ebola. Ron Klain, who was Mr. Obama's Ebola ""czar,"" is a top Biden adviser.Mr. Trump's own somber address Wednesday night, in which he announced he was blocking most travel from continental Europe and promised new aid for workers and businesses, was a break from his previous efforts to play down the effects of the outbreak. But he also mischaracterized some of his administration's new travel policies and described the threat as a ""foreign virus,"" though Americans are infected along with many in other countries.The Trump campaign quickly issued a response to Mr. Biden's remarks on Thursday. ""In times like this, America needs leadership and Biden has shown none,"" said Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman. ""President Trump acted early and decisively and has put the United States on stronger footing than other nations. His every move has been aimed at keeping Americans safe, while Joe Biden has sought to capitalize politically and stoke citizens' fears.""As for Mr. Sanders, Mr. Murtaugh said in another statement, ""He's just another Democrat candidate for president trying to score political points by recklessly provoking anxiety and fear."" He also argued that the proposal from Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator -- who supports a sweeping single-payer system -- would ""drive doctors and other medical workers away from the profession, leaving America woefully unprepared for public health emergencies.""Even as the candidates sought to project images of leadership, they are still politicians who face another debate and another round of primary elections in the coming days, and they are scrambling to adjust to a presidential contest now unfolding amid a pandemic.In one sign of the major changes the virus is forcing on the presidential race, Mr. Biden's team on Wednesday announced that previously scheduled campaign events in Chicago and Miami would be transformed into ""virtual events"" ahead of next Tuesday's primaries in Illinois, Florida and several other large, delegate-rich states. And Mr. Biden -- whose famously tactile campaigning style is off-putting to some and delights others -- acknowledged the need for ""radical changes in our personal behaviors"" that could affect ""deeply ingrained behavior like handshakes and hugs.""An internal campaign memo released Thursday instructed all staff members to begin working from home starting on Saturday, announced the closing of all offices to the public and said that the campaign would ""hold smaller events like roundtables, house parties, and press statements, as well as virtual events."" Fund-raisers, the memo said, would ""become virtual fund-raisers indefinitely.""Mr. Sanders likewise canceled a rally in Cleveland on Tuesday, and his campaign has not scheduled any new public events. Jane Sanders, Mr. Sanders's wife, told reporters on Thursday after he concluded his remarks that he would return to the Senate after the debate, and that he would stay in Washington.Still, surrogates are continuing to make the rounds in key upcoming contests, and volunteers may be encouraged to head to states like Illinois and Georgia to help with activities like door-knocking, according to Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina state senator and a Biden supporter who has been in touch with the campaign.The remarks on Thursday were not the first time Mr. Biden has sought to assume the mantle of a sober, statesmanlike leader through a highly produced speech: In January, he delivered a sharp rebuke of Mr. Trump's stewardship of tensions with Iran against a backdrop that appeared reminiscent of the White House briefing room.Yet that issue faded from the national forefront, and Mr. Biden went on to a fourth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses a few weeks later as he competed against what was, at the time, a crowded and competitive Democratic field.He entered this speech, however, having amassed a big delegate advantage, and facing just one Democratic opponent, Mr. Sanders.Katie Glueck reported from Wilmington, Del., and Sydney Ember from Burlington, Vt.PhotographFormer Vice President Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitJoseph R. Biden Jr.'s team is eager to tap into the enormous pool of Democratic talent now available. Some support could come from Michael Bloomberg's vast resources.Joseph R. Biden Jr., emboldened by his unexpectedly strong Super Tuesday performance and flush with cash, is moving to hire new aides who he hopes can quickly help him secure the Democratic presidential nomination and then guide him through the general election.Mr. Biden is looking to broaden his communications and political teams and reorder some of the senior-most roles in the operation, according to multiple people familiar with the campaign's outreach.Most significantly, Mr. Biden's advisers are in discussions with Jennifer O'Malley Dillon, who last year managed Beto O'Rourke's presidential bid, to take a senior role alongside Anita Dunn, the chief strategist.A top aide in former President Barack Obama's 2012 re-election campaign, Ms. O'Malley Dillon helped Mr. Biden in the run-up to the Nevada caucuses and worked to arrange Mr. O'Rourke's endorsement of Mr. Biden on the eve of the Texas primary on Tuesday.She declined to comment, as did an aide to Mr. Biden.Presidential campaigns often build out larger organizations as primaries go on and when the general election nears. Mr. Biden has been particularly understaffed, holding off on hiring because of financial constraints and day-to-day uncertainty about his prospects until this week. Nowhere was that more clear than in the states he competed in on Tuesday, when he won 10 contests with little to no on-the-ground infrastructure.But with his leading moderate rivals all exiting the race and endorsing him, Mr. Biden, the former vice president, is enjoying a financial windfall as he wages a head-to-head contest with Senator Bernie Sanders. Since his victory in South Carolina on Saturday, Mr. Biden has raised over $20 million. His super PAC has also raised millions of dollars and is going on the air in Michigan and Missouri, the largest states to vote next week.Mr. Biden received a new burst of support this week when Michael R. Bloomberg, the wealthy former mayor of New York City, endorsed him and conveyed in a private phone call that he intended to be helpful to Mr. Biden's campaign.But advisers to Mr. Bloomberg cautioned that they were still at an early stage of determining how he would redeploy elements of his campaign apparatus now that he is no longer a candidate. While they intended to target President Trump for defeat in a number of swing states, it could be a while before the details of those plans come into focus.Mr. Biden has already shaken up his campaign operation, installing Ms. Dunn, a longtime adviser, at the top of his organization shortly before the New Hampshire primary last month. Aides to the former vice president had previously sought out Ms. O'Malley Dillon for a senior role and in fact made her an offer even before Iowa, according to a Democratic official familiar with the conversations.Her role has not been finalized, in part because she is weighing family considerations, but it is expected to be arranged in the coming days, according to Democrats familiar with the discussions.Mr. Biden has long had a sort of bullpen-by-committee approach to his senior staff, and longtime advisers like Mike Donilon, Steve Ricchetti and his sister, Valerie Biden Owens, are expected to continue playing important roles along with his original campaign manager, Greg Schultz, and deputy manager, Kate Bedingfield.Addisu Demissie, who managed Senator Cory Booker's campaign, said the timeline of a presidential contest required any major candidate at this point to start building out the staff and making plans for the general election. A veteran of Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, Mr. Demissie said that it was too late for Mr. Biden to develop a robust operation in big March primary states like Florida, but that there was still time to strengthen his campaign in later-voting states and lay the groundwork for a national race against Mr. Trump.""You cannot scale up a presidential campaign in any less than five months,"" Mr. Demissie said. He suggested that a candidate in Mr. Biden's position should be ""bringing in as much talent as they can and, I assume, not taking the primary for granted but also realizing that the real battle is coming in November and it's coming pretty damn quick.""In some regards, Mr. Biden and his top aides have been overwhelmed by his sudden, and unexpectedly broad, success. They are attempting to be sensitive to the staff members who, with little money at their disposal, helped resurrect his candidacy but are also eager to tap into the enormous pool of Democratic talent now available, people close to the campaign said. Hundreds of aides to Senators Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren, Pete Buttigieg and Mr. Bloomberg are now available for hire.A day after Mr. Bloomberg's exit, his top advisers were beginning to map out how to repurpose his sprawling campaign organization to support Mr. Biden and other Democrats in the general election. The former New York City mayor has pledged for months to use his personal wealth to fund efforts against Mr. Trump even if someone else became the Democratic nominee.Talking to Mr. Biden on the phone Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg made clear that he would be supportive, but the two did not get into details, according to a Democratic official familiar with the conversation.Indeed, the mechanics of Mr. Bloomberg's plans are partly in the hands of lawyers who are weighing how best to convert different aspects of a political campaign into something that could be legally deployed on behalf of other Democrats. Several people close to Mr. Bloomberg said there was nothing resembling a grand plan in place.While wealthy candidates like Mr. Bloomberg are permitted to spend unlimited sums of money on their own campaigns, there are strict limits on how much they can directly contribute to other candidates. As a result, Mr. Bloomberg cannot simply continue paying his campaign staff and direct them to work on Mr. Biden's behalf instead.An email sent out to Mr. Bloomberg's campaign aides on Wednesday assured people that everyone would receive pay and benefits at least until the end of March.Mr. Bloomberg's senior advisers told Democrats for months that they intended to keep field operations in half a dozen battleground states regardless of whether Mr. Bloomberg became the nominee, and people close to Mr. Bloomberg said on Thursday those plans were still in effect. The targeted states included five traditional swing states -- Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida and North Carolina -- and the emerging battleground of Arizona.Dan Kanninen, a senior aide on Mr. Bloomberg's campaign, was planning to travel to Michigan and Wisconsin next week to talk to the staff members there about the best path forward, according to a former campaign official.While Democrats speculated hopefully about how much Mr. Bloomberg might spend for the party in the presidential race and other elections, people close to him said no budget had been drafted. One person briefed on Mr. Bloomberg's plans said there would be a detailed review of the tactics employed by his campaign, which spent more than half a billion dollars on advertising.Some prominent Democrats outside Mr. Bloomberg's orbit have lobbied his top aides to move swiftly, arguing that he can more quickly erase memories about his expensive campaign flop if he makes clear he will help the party up and down the ballot.But there appeared to be some debate among Mr. Bloomberg's advisers about whether to back Mr. Biden in the primary contest against Mr. Sanders, with one faction emphatically contending that an intervention against Mr. Sanders by one of the wealthiest men on the planet could backfire badly at a moment when Mr. Biden does not appear to need urgent assistance.Mr. Bloomberg does, however, have an arsenal of anti-Sanders material at his disposal: Before Mr. Bloomberg dropped out of the race, his advisers produced a number of negative advertisements targeting Mr. Sanders, as they did for several other candidates. Mr. Bloomberg declined to run the ads.PhotographTricky legal limits may dictate how Michael R. Bloomberg can spend to help other Democrats.

| Jump to first hitMrs. Clinton's sharp criticism of her former rival in an upcoming documentary series ricocheted across the Democratic Party on Tuesday, threatening to reopen the barely healed wounds of 2016.WASHINGTON -- For three years, Hillary Clinton has watched the Democratic Party search for a path forward in the Trump era.She's watched as liberals and moderates clashed on how best to fight President Trump and a White House that was almost hers. She's watched as some voters questioned the ""electability"" of the six women running for president, doubts that she once faced. She's watched as Senator Bernie Sanders has risen, after his withering opposition to her in the 2016 presidential primary, to become the dominant liberal force in the 2020 race.And she'd largely refrained from weighing in -- until Tuesday morning, when The Hollywood Reporter published an interview with Mrs. Clinton promoting a new documentary about her that will premiere on Saturday at the Sundance Film Festival. In the documentary, she rips into Mr. Sanders and declines to say if she would endorse him and campaign on his behalf if he were to win the Democratic nomination.""Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done. He was a career politician,"" she said. ""It's all just baloney and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it."" Asked by The Reporter recently if that assessment still held, she replied, ""Yes, it does.""Her remarks ricocheted across the Democratic Party on Tuesday, threatening to reopen the barely healed wounds of the 2016 primary, a race that quickly turned from a near-coronation of Mrs. Clinton as the party's first female nominee into a bitter battle that exposed a deep ideological rift among Democrats.That split over what direction the party should take is now a major issue in the current primary, with Mr. Sanders arguing for the full-throated leftist agenda and others counseling moderation. At the same time, he is engaged in a standoff with his liberal ally in the 2020 race, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, that has divided some on the left, over her accusation that he told her in 2018 that a woman could not win the presidency.Mr. Sanders has denied that remark. Mrs. Clinton, for her part, seized on it and said it was ""part of a pattern,"" noting that he said in 2016 that Mrs. Clinton was unqualified to be president.Some Democrats fear that Mrs. Clinton is adding fuel to the tensions within the party, whose leaders have spent years trying to overcome the lingering hostilities of the 2016 campaign, hoping to unify Democrats around the singular mission of defeating Mr. Trump.""I just don't think it's appropriate for Democrats to be criticizing other Democrats, especially with personal attacks like that,"" said Gilberto Hinojosa, the chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, who supported both of Mrs. Clinton's primary bids. ""I understand why there can be bitterness out there. I believe we just need to leave that behind us.""Representatives of both Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton moved quickly to try to quell the furor on Tuesday. Fresh off recent battles with not only Ms. Warren but also former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Mr. Sanders's campaign was eager to avoid another fight that would distract from his closing message less than two weeks before the Iowa presidential caucuses. Mr. Sanders apologized on Monday to Mr. Biden after a Sanders campaign surrogate wrote an opinion article accusing the former vice president of having ""a big corruption problem.""Speaking to reporters on Tuesday in Washington, Mr. Sanders said: ""Secretary Clinton is entitled to her point of view. My job today is to focus on the impeachment trial.""When asked for his response to Mrs. Clinton's assertion that no one liked him, he joked that ""on a good day, my wife likes me, so let's clear the air on that one.""Mrs. Clinton tried to clarify her remarks on Tuesday evening. ""I thought everyone wanted my authentic, unvarnished views!"" she wrote on Twitter. ""But to be serious, the number one priority for our country and world is retiring Trump, and, as I always have, I will do whatever I can to support our nominee.""Those who have spoken to Mrs. Clinton recently confirm that she has every intention of supporting the Democratic nominee -- even if Mr. Sanders ends up winning the primary. Still, even some longtime allies were shocked that she voiced such criticisms of Mr. Sanders in an election year, so close to the start of primary voting.They were far less surprised by the content of her remarks.Mr. Sanders's denial in his dispute with Ms. Warren over whether he had told her a woman could not defeat Mr. Trump infuriated Mrs. Clinton, according to people close to her. Mr. Sanders's subsequent refusal to chastise his supporters for attacking Ms. Warren and her team online only added to her concern.""It's not only him, it's the culture around him. It's his leadership team. It's his prominent supporters. It's his online Bernie Bros,"" Mrs. Clinton told The Reporter. ""It should be worrisome that he has permitted this culture -- not only permitted, seems to really be very much supporting it.""People close to Mrs. Clinton say she has grown worried that attacks from Mr. Sanders's campaign could hurt the future Democratic nominee in much the same way that she believes they did lasting damage to her. She worries he will not drop out of the race even if it becomes clear he cannot win the nomination, a situation that could exacerbate divisions in the party.Mrs. Clinton also does not believe Mr. Sanders could beat Mr. Trump, telling friends for months that he has never sustained harsh attacks from fellow Democrats on his record and self-described democratic socialism.Since Mr. Sanders endorsed Mrs. Clinton in July 2016, the acrimony between the two camps has lingered. Mrs. Clinton and her former aides maintain that his endorsement came too late and was too lukewarm to truly unify the party. Some supporters of Mr. Sanders still argue that the Democratic National Committee ""rigged"" the rules to help her secure the nomination.Unlike nearly all of the other two dozen Democratic candidates this primary cycle, Mr. Sanders did not call Mrs. Clinton before he entered the race.Jane Kleeb, the Nebraska Democratic Party chairwoman, said that she understood Mrs. Clinton's concerns but that voicing frustrations was unproductive for the party.""She has obviously a very different vantage than any of us ever will. She worked her entire career and she was taken down by forces out of her control,"" said Ms. Kleeb, who backed Mr. Sanders in the 2016 primary but recalled crying as she listened to Mrs. Clinton's audiobook about her campaign. ""I understand why she's frustrated with Senator Sanders but I also think this is time to go after Trump.""Though Mrs. Clinton's presidential defeat still weighs heavily on her, friends say she is busy with a variety of other projects, traveling to accept awards and honorary degrees. An avid theatergoer, she attends Broadway shows and has been spotted at several concerts, including Fleetwood Mac, Earth Wind and Fire and Billy Joel. She spends a lot of time with her three grandchildren and, this fall, released a book profiling ""gutsy women"" with her daughter, Chelsea.Still, at times, Mrs. Clinton's pique about 2016 has come out.In December, she participated in a two-and-a-half-hour interview with the radio host Howard Stern, during which she argued that Mr. Sanders ""hurt"" her during the 2016 campaign.Among some in Mr. Sanders's campaign, there was hope that Mrs. Clinton's remarks would lead to a bump in fund-raising.On Twitter, the hashtag #ILikeBernie became a top trending topic. Many supporters pounced on Mrs. Clinton's remarks, arguing that she remained out of touch with the working-class Americans who back Mr. Sanders.""No apologies, no backing down, the scorn and hatred that all of official Washington D.C. and the Democratic Party has for him and his supporters is his closing case,"" Will Menaker, a host of the progressive podcast Chapo Trap House, wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. ""They are corrupt and evil, they hate him and they hate you because you are not.""Alexandra Rojas, the executive director of the progressive group Justice Democrats, called Mrs. Clinton's statement ""unacceptable, out of touch and dangerous.""Though some of his supporters and staff members have been itching for confrontation, Mr. Sanders has rejected recent traps to get him to relitigate 2016. Last week, after Mr. Trump tried to goad Mr. Sanders by saying the Democratic Party was rigging the 2020 election against him again, he refused to bite and instead issued a statement attacking Mr. Trump.Yet the furor over Mrs. Clinton's remarks is unlikely to die down anytime soon, as she continues promoting the new documentary, ""Hillary,"" which is set to be released on Hulu a few days after Super Tuesday.""She obviously has deeply held feelings about what happened in 2016 and is hellbent on stopping Sanders now,"" said David Axelrod, who served as a top strategist on Barack Obama's primary bid against Mrs. Clinton in 2008. ""If the goal of Democrats is to win, I'm not sure that interventions like this are likely to help unify and mobilize all elements of the party in the fall. She, of all people, should know that.""Lisa Lerer reported from Washington, and Sydney Ember from Des Moines. Matt Stevens contributed reporting from New York.PhotographHillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders campaigned together after the 2016 primaries, but some acrimony has lingered.

| Jump to first hitOur reporters followed all of the exchanges and fact-checked the candidates, providing context and explanation.Six of the candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination took the stage on Wednesday night in Las Vegas for their last debate before Nevada's caucuses on Saturday.Here is how the candidates' remarks stacked up against the truth.Senator Elizabeth Warren highlighted past comments by Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, that derided women.""I'd like to talk about who we're running against, a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians. And no, I'm not talking about Donald Trump. I'm talking about Mayor Bloomberg.""This is mostly true. In 1990, Mr. Bloomberg's colleagues at his financial data company compiled a book of one-liners purportedly uttered by their boss, including a number of bawdy and sexist comments. Among the quotations was a quip about the British royals, in which Mr. Bloomberg used the terms ""horsey-faced lesbian"" and ""fat broad"" to refer to two women in the royal family.In 2001, Mr. Bloomberg dismissed the book as ""Borscht Belt jokes."" He has never explicitly acknowledged having said the quotations cited in the book. Last year, though, a Bloomberg spokesman, Stu Loeser, issued a general comment about Mr. Bloomberg's history of misogynist remarks, saying: ""Mike has come to see that some of what he has said is disrespectful and wrong. He believes his words have not always aligned with his values and the way he has led his life.""Ms. Warren said Mr. Bloomberg had blamed the 2008 financial crisis on African-Americans and Latinos.""When Mayor Bloomberg was busy blaming African-Americans and Latinos for the housing crash of 2008, I was right here in Las Vegas literally just a few blocks down the street holding hearings on the banks that were taking away homes from millions of families.""This is exaggerated. Mr. Bloomberg's comments were made in 2008 as the subprime mortgage crisis was pulling the country into the biggest economic slowdown since the Great Depression. Asked to explain the origins of the crisis in an appearance at Georgetown University, Mr. Bloomberg linked it to federal interference in the mortgage lending business and a wide variety of other factors like ""very cheap money"" in the form of low Federal Reserve interest rates, a failure by banks to consider that home prices could fall and developers that built more houses than the market could absorb.Where his critics have focused, however, is on the first part of his eight-minute answer. He started by saying the present economic woes began when ""there was a lot of pressure on banks to make loans to everyone."" He then pointed to legislation passed by Congress to end the practice known as ""redlining,"" in which banks declared entire neighborhoods off limits to lending. These were usually poor, heavily minority communities.""Once you started pushing in that direction,"" he added, ""banks started making more and more loans where the credit of the person buying the house wasn't as good as you would like.""Adding more unpredictability to the situation, he said, were bankers and Wall Street executives who had created such complex instruments to profit from mortgages that they did not, in essence, understand what they were selling.Mr. Bloomberg and Senator Bernie Sanders came under fire for being extreme opposites whose views are not representative of the Democratic Party.""Let's put forward somebody who's actually a Democrat.""This is exaggerated. Mr. Sanders is formally running for president as a Democrat, according to his Federal Election Commission filing. However, as a senator he is an independent who caucuses with the Democrats. His F.E.C. filing for his 2024 senate re-election campaign lists his party affiliation as ""independent"" and his Senate website continues to have an ""I"" next to his name.As for Mr. Bloomberg, he was a lifelong Democrat before running for mayor of New York City as a Republican in 2001. In 2007, he changed parties and became an independent. In 2018, as he prepared to run for president, Mr. Bloomberg once again became a Democrat.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. claimed undue credit for being the ""first"" candidate to introduce a public option.""I notice what everybody's talking about is the plan that I first introduced.""This is exaggerated. Four candidates -- Mr. Biden, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and Mr. Bloomberg -- support a public option, which anyone can buy into but retains private insurance. The concept has been around for many years.Mr. Biden first released his health care plan in July and Mr. Buttigieg delivered his in September. Ms. Klobuchar released hers in May, though it did not detail its enforcement to the same degree as the other plans did. Mr. Bloomberg entered the race in November and released his plan in December.Mr. Biden's and Mr. Buttigieg's plans do share many facets -- but that is not especially surprising or a sign of Mr. Biden's particular leadership on the issue. (Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, who has since dropped out of the race, has argued that Mr. Biden actually copied his 2017 health care plan, which Ms. Klobuchar supported.)""It's not unusual to see presidential candidates have health care reform proposals that are very similar,"" said Larry Levitt, the president of the nonprofit Kaiser Health Foundation. ""Many of the ideas in the Biden and Buttigieg plans have been circulating in health policy circles for several years. Candidates rarely create these policy proposals from scratch.""What their plans represent, Mr. Levitt said, ""is an emerging consensus among Democrats of what a health care reform plan might look like in 2021 other than Medicare for all, if the party wins in 2020.""Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden both charged that a Bloomberg policy in New York City went after African-American and Latino people.""Mr. Bloomberg had policies in New York City of stop and frisk, which went after African-American and Latino people in an outrageous way.""This is true. A judge ruled in 2013 that the tactics underlying stop and frisk as practiced in New York disproportionately stopped blacks and Latinos.""He had stop and frisk, throwing close to five million young black men up against a wall.""He later added: ""The reason that stop and frisk changed is because Barack Obama sent moderators to see what was going on. When we sent them there to say this practice has to stop, the mayor thought it was a terrible idea we send them there, a terrible idea.""This is mostly false. New York's wholesale stop-and-frisk policy began its death spiral with a report in May 2012 from the New York Civil Liberties Union that revealed more than 685,000 stops had been made the year before. The next month, Mr. Bloomberg announced that the program was going to be overhauled, and over the next year, the number of stops plummeted. Lawsuits were also underway or about to be filed. In August 2013, as Mr. Bloomberg approached his final months in office, a judge ruled against the city and as part of the remedies, appointed a monitor. Mr. Bloomberg strongly objected to the monitor, to no avail. By then, the number of monthly stops had declined by more than 90 percent from its peak.Mr. Bloomberg accurately cited his record on coal plant closings.""Well, already we've closed 304 out of the 530 coal-fired power plants in the United States.""This is true. Mr. Bloomberg was referring to his more than $100 million contribution to the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal campaign since 2011. According to the Sierra Club, 304 coal-fired power plants have since either retired or have announced plans to close. They estimate that 40 percent of those closings would have not happened had it not been for the campaign. Over all, he has donated about $278.2 million to environmental and climate change causes, according to a recent tally by The New York Times, and as a mayor of New York City, had a strong record on climate change.Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg misrepresented the possibility that their proposals could raises taxes on small businesses.Asked if their plans would raise taxes on small businesses,Mr. Biden said, ""No, taxes on small businesses won't go up.""Mr. Buttigieg said, ""Not if they are small businesses.""This is misleading. Both Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg would raise the corporate rate from its current level of 21 percent -- to 28 percent for Mr. Biden and to 35 percent for Mr. Buttigieg. That rate applies to all corporations, regardless of size. Though it is rare for small businesses to organize themselves as corporations, some small businesses do so, and they would face higher taxes under Mr. Biden's and Mr. Buttigieg's plans.For business owners who earn more than $250,000 per year. Mr. Buttigieg would also eliminate a tax break that is used by businesses organized as so-called pass-through entities like limited liability corporations. That elimination could raise taxes on some small businesses, albeit those owned by high-income Americans.Ms. Warren said Mr. Biden had hoped Senator Mitch McConnell would prevail in his re-election campaign.Ms. Warren: ""According to The New York Times, the last time that Mitch McConnell was on the ballot, the vice president stood in the Oval Office and said, I hope that Mitch gets re-elected so I can keep working with him.""Mr. Biden: ""That's totally out of context.""Ms. Warren was likely referring to a September 2019 report in The Times about Mr. Biden's working relationship with Mr. McConnell, the Republican majority leader who during the Obama administration thwarted many Democratic legislative priorities and judicial appointments.Harry Reid, the former Nevada senator and Democratic leader, told The Times that President Barack Obama had pressed Mr. McConnell to work on a budget package before the 2014 midterm elections, when Mr. McConnell was up for re-election.Mr. McConnell rejected the offer and said that it would present an obstacle for Republicans in their primaries.Mr. Biden responded by saying, ""Mitch, we want to see you come back,"" according to Mr. Reid.Mr. Bloomberg referred incorrectly to the relative greenhouse gas emissions of China and India.""In all fairness, the Chinese have slowed down. It's India that is an even bigger problem. But it is an enormous problem. Nobody's doing anything about it.""This is false. China's emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, rose last year from 2018, according to the International Energy Agency. In fact, emissions have risen each year since 2017, after having declined in 2015 and 2016. Experts say China had been stimulating its economy to try to keep up growth rates. Industrial coal burning is the largest source of greenhouse gases in China, which remains the world's largest emitter.Mr. Buttigieg pointed to Ms. Klobuchar's votes on immigration and judges.""You voted to make English the national language.""He also said: ""You have been unusual among Democrats. I think the Democrat among all of the senators running for president most likely to vote for Donald Trump's judges.""This is mostly true. During a 2007 debate on an immigration bill, Ms. Klobuchar was one of 17 Democrats to support an amendment that would have reversed an executive order issued by President Bill Clinton requiring federal agencies to provide materials in language other than English. It passed, but the underlying bill failed.Ms. Klobuchar has since disavowed that vote. In an interview on Sunday on the CBS program ""Face The Nation,"" she described it as ""an early vote on English as the official language."" She added: ""A number of other Democrats voted the same way, and actually nearly all Democrats eventually voted for it. It was in the base bill. I know that's not a good idea because it would be hard to translate brochures and voting materials and the like. And I was glad after working on the latest version, the 2013 immigration bill, that that wasn't in there. It shouldn't be in there.""As to judges, Ms. Klobuchar, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was a forceful critic of Justices Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh after Mr. Trump nominated them to the Supreme Court. But according to a recent analysis by the progressive group Think Progress, Ms. Klobuchar voted in favor of more than 56 percent of the Trump judicial nominees who were eventually confirmed, while the other senators running for president have each voted to confirm fewer than half of Mr. Trump's judicial nominees.Fact checks and explainers by Michael M.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump appeared eager to bask in the warm reception of a conservative audience, who spent the conference listening to speakers road-testing messages for his re-election campaign.WASHINGTON -- President Trump crouched underneath his microphone on Saturday, mimicking the height of Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City who is running for president.Mr. Trump pointed at the ceiling above him, marveling at all of his own success. ""Maybe it's right there, right?"" he said. ""Thank you. Thank you, God.""Throughout an animated 90-minute speech in front of conservative activists at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, a confident Mr. Trump attacked his rivals in nasty terms while gloating about and inflating his own achievements.He even exited the stage by embracing the American flag in both of his arms, mouthing the words ""I love you"" and planting a kiss on the stars and stripes.Mr. Trump talked up what he said were his administration's successes: the appointment of conservative judges, the killing of terrorists, tax cuts and the passage of trade deals. But he appeared most animated when riffing about the Democratic presidential field, on the same day that voters in South Carolina headed to the polls to vote in the first primary where a majority-black electorate is set to weigh in.Mr. Bloomberg, whose mammoth spending has privately concerned Mr. Trump, ""writes checks like a drunken sailor,"" the president said, ribbing the former mayor for spending more than half a billion dollars on a presidential bid that Mr. Trump predicted would not make it past Super Tuesday on March 3.""That was probably the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates,"" he said of Mr. Bloomberg's debut this month on the debate stage, which was widely viewed as a bubble-bursting showing for a potential dark horse candidate. ""It just shows you, you can't buy an election. You got to bring the goods a little bit, too.""Handicapping the Democratic primary, Mr. Trump said that he expected to face off against Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, or former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.""Everyone knows he's not a communist,"" he said of Mr. Biden. ""With Bernie, there's a real question about that."" But Mr. Trump said his concern about Mr. Biden was his mental acuity.""The difference is Joe's not going to be running the government,"" he said. ""He's just going to be sitting in a home some place.""Mr. Trump, who arrived late at CPAC after holding a last-minute news conference at the White House to announce expanded travel restrictions related to the spread of the coronavirus, mentioned the outbreak only in passing.Congratulating himself on his administration's response, Mr. Trump said the decision to impose early travel restrictions ""has been now given very good grades, like an A +++."" And he promised a nonpartisan response to the coronavirus, even as he attacked Democrats.""The extreme fringes called us racists,"" he said. ""They wanted to let infected people pour into our country.""On Friday, Mr. Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, addressed the same audience at CPAC, and accused journalists of hyping the coronavirus because ""they think this will bring down the president -- that's what this is all about.""On Saturday afternoon, however, Mr. Trump appeared less interested in discussing the outbreak that has been the first public health crisis of his presidency. Instead, he was eager to bask in the warm reception of the conservative audience, who spent the past four days listening to a procession of speakers road-testing messages for Mr. Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.He lauded his decision to fire James B. Comey as the F.B.I. director. ""That was a great firing,"" he said.He claimed that even Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, the lone Republican to vote to impeach Mr. Trump on one article, abuse of power, had split the baby. ""Even him, I got half a vote,"" he said. ""He couldn't do it all. He wanted to get nice free publicity for himself.""Mr. Trump also falsely characterized the 2017 tax cut as the ""largest"" in history (several others outrank it), and claimed that he had eliminated the estate tax. In reality, the 2017 law increased the threshold but the tax still exists.Mr. Trump has been a regular speaker at CPAC for years, and has credited the organization for giving him a platform long before he officially declared his run for president. In 2015, however, when he was still a New York businessman, the crowd booed him when he proposed fighting ISIS with troops on the ground in the Middle East.But for the past four years, he has been the main attraction and headliner of the conference, which has been molded in his image. Last year, Mr. Trump delivered the longest speech of his presidency from the CPAC stage, clocking in at two hours five minutes. (That year, he opened, rather than closed, with a flag hug.)In an election year, his address was more in line with the staple speeches he has been giving at campaign rallies, and it set no records for length.But he appeared particularly awed by his own abilities to keep the spotlight on himself.""I can get elected twice over the wall, can you believe this,"" he told the crowd, while claiming, falsely, that Mexico was paying for the construction of a wall along the southern border.""Yes they are, they are paying for it,"" he said, adding, without explaining himself, ""oh, they're going to die when I put in what I'm going to do.""Mr. Trump also claimed he was not bothered that Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist whom Time named its person of the year, occupied a magazine cover he has long coveted, even though he chose to bring up an issue that was published over two months ago. ""The whole world revolves around this person,"" he said, referring to himself. ""Every story is Trump or Trump-related.""Linda Qiu contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographThose at CPAC have spent four days listening to speakers road-testing messages for President Trump's re-election campaign.

| Jump to first hitMany black voters rallied around Joe Biden in Saturday's primary, eager to send a message that their views of electability are not shaped by predominantly white states like Iowa.NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. -- In 2008 and 2016, black voters in South Carolina's presidential primary set the last two Democratic nominees on their way, backing Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton by huge margins. Rival candidates never managed to catch up in the race for delegates to clinch the nomination.Black Democrats played a far different role in this year's primary vote, coming to the aid of a candidate who is struggling, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. They were the decisive factor in Mr. Biden's victory in South Carolina on Saturday night, but it was far from clear if that support would catapult him to victory in other states in the ways that Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton enjoyed.Early exit polls indicated that, more than in 2008 and 2016, black voters spread their support across several candidates and split along generational and ideological lines. Senator Bernie Sanders edged ahead of Mr. Biden among black voters who were 29 and younger, and Mr. Sanders, the race's current front-runner, appears formidable in the polls in many upcoming primaries.For many black voters, the South Carolina primary took on significant meaning in another way, too. In interviews across the state in recent days, many said they were eager to send a message to the national Democratic Party: that their views on electability -- which candidate is best suited to beat President Trump -- would not be shaped by outcomes in the predominantly white states Iowa and New Hampshire, which backed former Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders in contests earlier in February.""We're the base, and we're yet to express ourselves,"" said David Cakley, a church deacon from Goose Creek, S.C, referring to black voters. ""Biden needs a boost and we're going to give it to him.""Mayor Stephen K. Benjamin of Columbia, S.C., who has endorsed the former New York City mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, summed up the urgency for black voters in this primary by quoting a line from the Atlanta rapper André 3000: ""The South got something to say.""South Carolina signifies a turning point in the campaign: Candidates have been courting black voters in the state for more than a year, and now the Democratic hopefuls will see if their personal appeals and policy plans catch fire with the first predominantly black electorate to vote in the race.Mr. Biden, who lost badly in Iowa and New Hampshire but improved in last weekend's Nevada caucuses, appeared on track to win a majority of black Democrats in South Carolina, with voters citing his familiarity with their concerns and his potential to appeal to moderate Republicans in a general election. But the final margins may reveal fault lines around gender, age, regions and viewpoints.Other Democratic hopefuls from across the ideological spectrum -- liberals like Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren, as well as the billionaire Tom Steyer and moderates like Mr. Buttigieg -- were aiming to demonstrate that African-Americans are not a monolithic voting bloc.Many black Democrats made that point over the last year, as some favored white candidates like Mr. Biden over black contenders like Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, and others embraced a wide variety of political and ideological positions.Mr. Biden led in South Carolina polls all year, but Mr. Sanders and Mr. Steyer gained ground recently, and Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg were seeking to show that they have black support in the primary.""I don't know that anybody's going to walk away with it. And I think there might be some surprises,"" said the Rev. Joseph Darby, a pastor who leads Nichols Chapel A.M.E. Church in Charleston. ""But I don't pay attention to the polls because they never call me.""At a ministers' breakfast in North Charleston on Wednesday hosted by National Action Network, the civil rights organization led by the Rev. Al Sharpton, several voters echoed his point -- stating that the question of ""what Democratic candidate is most electable"" in the primary could not be settled until black voters throughout the South weighed in on the nominee.Chris Richardson, 39, said he was not surprised that many black voters in South Carolina were unfazed by Mr. Biden's poor results in Iowa and New Hampshire. He flipped the question around: Why would anyone assume they'd care?""Black voters know white voters better than white voters know themselves,"" Mr. Richardson said. ""So yeah, we'll back Biden, because we know who white America will vote for in the general election in a way they may not tell a pollster or the media.""Among the most important results in South Carolina is the margin of victory in different parts of the state, which will help determine the awarding of delegates. Mr. Sanders currently leads in delegates, followed by Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren.The final margin of victory for Mr. Biden will also determine if he can argue that he has a ""firewall"" of black support in the highly competitive race; a big victory would also help him make his case in other racially diverse primaries, including the big ones in North Carolina and Virginia on Super Tuesday next week.One major factor in the race that won't be settled in South Carolina is the electoral might of Mr. Bloomberg, who is not competing in the state but will be on the primary ballots on Super Tuesday. Mr. Bloomberg has spent hundreds of millions of dollars courting voters, with particular attention to black and Latino voters in delegate-rich states such as Texas and California, which vote Tuesday.Aides to Mr. Biden have begun openly complaining that Mr. Bloomberg might siphon some black voters from the former vice president and effectively deliver the nomination to Mr. Sanders.Akunna Cook, a former executive director of the Black Economic Alliance, said Mr. Bloomberg ""could become a spoiler"" for Mr. Biden even with a win in South Carolina, because some moderate voters might still decide to back Mr. Bloomberg on Super Tuesday.""My nephew is 21 and is voting in the presidential for the first time. And he's deciding between Bloomberg and Warren,"" Ms. Cook said. ""He sees those Bloomberg ads everywhere. And if you only know him through those ads, he seems like a good candidate. He's taking on Trump, and he's talking like the base.""In South Carolina, the campaign of another self-funding billionaire -- Mr. Steyer -- gave Mr. Biden's team a miniature preview of what it is up against. Mr. Steyer dominated the state's airwaves and invested millions in organizing to chip away at Mr. Biden's black support with some success.""I've had three Steyer people knock on my door this week,"" said Lacy Washington, a 33-year-old from North Charleston. ""This whole thing is a hot mess, and I can't wait for it to be over.""But this past week, Mr. Biden got a clear lift: The state's most powerful Democrat, Representative James F. Clyburn, endorsed him in an impassioned speech Wednesday that cited Mr. Biden's intimate understanding of the state.In a Friday appearance on CNN, Mr. Clyburn said he hoped Mr. Biden would win South Carolina by ""15 or 16"" points, setting the bar at a clear victory -- but far less than the 47.5-point margin of victory for Mrs. Clinton in 2016 (over Mr. Sanders) or the 29-point win by Mr. Obama in 2008 (over Mrs. Clinton).No matter who wins South Carolina, the yearlong primary campaign in the state has shown the power -- and diversity -- among black voters within the Democratic Party.The large field of two dozen candidates provided opportunities for black activist groups to pressure hopefuls on issues that seemed secondary to many past Democratic candidates, including robust criminal justice proposals, economic agendas that target the racial wealth gap and the possibility of reparations for the descendants of slaves.The campaign has also exposed cracks along age, college education level, geography and gender, leading black voters to split across candidates more than they have in previous cycles.There are churchgoing supporters of Mr. Biden and others drawn to the business acumen of Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Steyer. Younger black voters -- drawn to the promise of a ""political revolution"" -- seem likely to boost Mr. Sanders, and policy-focused voters looking for a candidate pitching unity can back Mr. Buttigieg or Ms. Warren.""I see the momentum of Bernie, I see the number of black people for Biden, but I'll be with Elizabeth Warren till she drops out,"" said Herbert Bodison, a 65-year-old resident of North Charleston.Shareef Boddie, a 23-year-old from Goose Creek, said he was torn among three candidates: Mr. Sanders, Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg. He planned to make his decision on the way to the polls.""I may go for Bernie Sanders, because he plans on relieving college debt from students. And that's a big thing,"" Mr. Boddie said.The range of opinion is the electoral manifestation of the oft-repeated mantra ""black voters are not monolithic."" But it could also curb the determinative power of black voters in the Democratic nomination process, considering that they have historically rallied around a single candidate, helping that contender grab all-important delegates in key congressional districts and providing an inside track to the nomination.Rashad Robinson, president of the racial justice organization Color of Change, said black Democrats in this primary had done more than choose the winner: They forced the field of candidates to reshape how they discuss the black community.""We've had a campaign season where people are calling out structural racism and saying 'white supremacy' on the debate stage,"" Mr. Robinson said. ""The fact that black people are being talked about in more nuanced ways -- like black youth vote versus black baby boomers vote -- it speaks to how much the movement building has been translated to electoral power.""Mr. Darby, the Charleston minister, said he believed the whiteness of the Iowa and New Hampshire electorates affects how they view the primary's central question of electability.He contended that many white voters in those states could ""afford"" to base voting decisions solely on policy outlines and ideological promises, while many black voters were conditioned by history to assume the worst about politicians. He said he was not surprised that Mr. Biden was beaten by popular candidates in those states but was favored in South Carolina.He compared Mr. Trump's presidency to a house fire, and said black voters were better at recognizing the urgency.""If your house is on fire, you don't bring the decorators in to redecorate while the flames are still raging,"" Mr. Darby said. ""You put out the fire first -- and then you redecorate.""PhotographVoters selecting presidential candidates at their firehouse on Primary Day in Columbia, S.C.

| Jump to first hitMr. Sanders edged out his competitors in The Des Moines Register/CNN poll released on Friday, the first significant survey from Iowa in nearly two months.DES MOINES -- Bernie Sanders edged ahead of his Democratic rivals in Iowa, affirming his resurgence less than four weeks before next month's caucuses, according to a new poll from The Des Moines Register and CNN.The poll showed that Mr. Sanders was the first choice for 20 percent of would-be caucusgoers, an increase of five percentage points from November, when The Register last polled the state. He was followed closely by Elizabeth Warren at 17 percent, Pete Buttigieg at 16 percent and Joseph R. Biden Jr. at 15.The results are the latest sign that Mr. Sanders -- lifted by his loyal supporters and an unchanging message -- has strong campaign momentum heading into the Feb. 3 Iowa caucuses and has rebounded politically after having a heart attack in October. It is the first time he has led a Register poll this cycle. In 2016, Mr. Sanders battled Hillary Clinton to a virtual tie in Iowa, transforming him into a threat for the Democratic nomination.The poll was less kind to Mr. Buttigieg, who held a dominant lead in the last Register poll, with 25 percent support. That poll also showed Ms. Warren at 16 percent and Mr. Biden at 15 percent.To say the poll was highly anticipated is an understatement. The poll is the first significant survey from Iowa in nearly two months, a drought that has left a murky picture of the Democratic primary race in a state that conducts its first-in-the-nation caucuses. Iowans famously break late, sometimes making their final decision in the weeks and days before the caucuses occur, and every campaign will be scrutinizing the results for signs that their candidate is strengthening -- and that their rivals are weakening -- heading into the final stretch.The poll numbers are the latest evidence that the race in Iowa remains fluid and winnable for the top four candidates, who have all crisscrossed the state in recent weeks to try to persuade supporters to come out for them on caucus night. Only 40 percent of respondents said their minds were made up, a reflection of the indecision on the ground, where conversations with Iowans often reveal that they still favor multiple candidates.Of paramount importance to many Democrats in Iowa is beating President Trump in the general election in November. But the absence of a clear front-runner, along with no indication that any one candidate will break away from the pack in the remaining weeks, has left many voters unsure where to align their preferences.Amy Klobuchar, who has attracted more interest in recent weeks but has yet to convert that into an increase in actual support, held steady at 6 percent, good for a distant fifth place in the poll. Cory Booker, who is hoping for a lucky break, also remained unchanged at 3 percent, behind the entrepreneur Andrew Yang, who was at 5 percent.The poll of 701 likely Democratic caucusgoers was conducted Jan. 2-8 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.Political officials here widely believe that there are five tickets out of Iowa this year, instead of the typical three.Much has changed since The Register last released its poll on Nov. 16. Kamala Harris, who was once considered a top-tier candidate but had seen her standing severely slip, dropped out of the race, leaving her supporters scrambling to find an alternative candidate to back. The House of Representatives voted to impeach President Trump. And escalating tension with Iran has pushed foreign policy to the forefront of a primary race that had so far focused more squarely on domestic issues.The deadline to qualify for Tuesday's Democratic debate was 11:59 p.m. on Friday, and normally, an Iowa poll released hours before such a deadline could bolster candidates on the cusp of qualifying.

| Jump to first hitJoseph R. Biden Jr. widened his advantage over Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary race, capturing Mississippi and Missouri as well as Michigan, with support from both black and white voters.Joseph R. Biden Jr. took command of the Democratic presidential race in decisive fashion on Tuesday, marshaling a powerful multiracial coalition in the South and the Midwest that swept aside Senator Bernie Sanders and completed Mr. Biden's rapid transformation from a sometimes-fumbling underdog into his party's likely nominee.Replicating the combination of voters that delivered him broad victories a week ago on Super Tuesday, Mr. Biden won Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi with overwhelming support from African-Americans and with large margins among suburban and rural white voters.Mr. Sanders was more evenly matched with Mr. Biden in the West, where Idaho and Washington were too close to call. But there was little doubt by the end of the night that Mr. Sanders had lost his recent status as the progressive front-runner in a race defined for months by feuding and factionalism on the moderate wing of the Democratic Party.By besting Mr. Sanders for a second consecutive week, Mr. Biden, the former vice president, demonstrated that his successes on Super Tuesday reflected more than fleeting good fortune, and that many Democratic voters had rallied behind his candidacy in a lasting enough way to erase his embarrassing setbacks last month in Iowa and New Hampshire.Addressing supporters Tuesday night in Philadelphia, in a tone that was more sober than celebratory, Mr. Biden said voters had put him ""a step closer to restoring decency, dignity and honor to the White House"" and moved to unify the party with an appeal to supporters of Mr. Sanders. ""We share a common goal,"" Mr. Biden said, ""and together we'll defeat Donald Trump.""In Tuesday's primaries, Mr. Biden assembled a strong electoral coalition that combined his party's most loyal constituencies -- including African-Americans, women and union members -- with a new wave of moderate white voters who have aligned themselves with the Democrats as refugees from President Trump's Republican Party.Even in his moment of triumph, however, Mr. Biden made little headway with the youngest and most liberal primary voters, who remained steadfastly behind Mr. Sanders even as his national prospects have dimmed. Mr. Biden appeared mindful of his deficit with these voters, using his election-night remarks to acknowledge the ""tireless energy"" of Mr. Sanders's followers.Mr. Sanders, a Vermont liberal, did not address supporters on Tuesday night, leaving an unusual void in the space his thunderous persona has typically occupied on election nights.Mr. Sanders suffered the most grievous blow in Michigan, the biggest delegate prize of the night. After absorbing a series of unexpected losses last week, the senator had raced to revive his candidacy in Michigan, a state that four years ago helped power his insurgent challenge to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination.But even after holding several events across Michigan and mounting some of his most pointed attacks against Mr. Biden, most of all for his record on trade, Mr. Sanders was routed.The contest in Michigan held great symbolic significance for both candidates, each of whom has presented himself as uniquely capable of reclaiming the Midwest for Democrats in 2020. Mr. Biden has long boasted of his bond with working-class voters there, while Mr. Sanders has enjoyed a lasting political glow from his surprise win in the Michigan primary four years ago. His inability to repeat that feat against a more popular opponent, Mr. Biden, further undercuts his argument that only a candidate who trumpets far-reaching change can energize voters there.The losses in Michigan and Missouri were especially ominous for Mr. Sanders, because they suggested his strength among rural Midwestern voters in 2016 largely owed to their opposition to Mrs. Clinton. Against Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders was trounced across the countryside of both states and saw working-class white voters, a pillar of his campaign four years ago, shift markedly away from him.More important on Tuesday was the scope of Mr. Biden's victories: With 365 delegates up for grabs, the former vice president was poised to build what could become an insurmountable advantage. If he wins with similarly large margins next week in delegate-rich Florida, where Mr. Sanders trails badly in polls, he may make it all but impossible for the senator to catch up.Mr. Biden's victories came against a backdrop of unexpected instability in the economy and widespread fear about the coronavirus as a growing threat to public health -- forces that may have further bolstered the former vice president's message of steady leadership against Mr. Sanders's promises of social transformation. The market-rattling outbreak, along with the White House's uncertain response, has both underscored Mr. Trump's political vulnerability and added to the mood of urgency among Democrats bent on defeating him.The spread of the coronavirus across the United States also raised the specter that political activities could soon be curtailed or restructured for reasons of public health. Just hours before the polls closed, both candidates canceled planned rallies in Ohio, citing concerns related to the virus. And in his subdued remarks at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Mr. Biden said there was a climate of fear and danger that demanded presidential leadership.Mr. Sanders now faces the unenviable task of mapping a path forward in a race that has exposed the apparent limits of his campaign tactics and political message. He retains a strong base of support among young and very liberal voters, and he has expanded his popularity with many Latinos. But Mr. Sanders has struggled to make headway with the most important constituencies that resisted his campaign four years ago, and the senator has lost ground with some groups that backed him as the only alternative to Mrs. Clinton.In Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi, Mr. Biden won black voters by colossal margins, including by more than 70 points in Mississippi, where African-Americans made up nearly two-thirds of the primary electorate, according to exit polls. But Mr. Biden also won white voters by double digits in all three states, and carried white voters without college degrees -- a friendly constituency for Mr. Sanders in 2016 -- by a narrower margin.In a sign that Mr. Sanders may struggle to compete with Mr. Biden across the Midwest, the exit polls from Missouri showed that Mr. Biden carried union households by a 25-point margin over Mr. Sanders. That advantage suggests that Mr. Sanders's populist message and hard-edge criticism of Mr. Biden's record on trade had failed to dent the former vice president's popularity with a key constituency that made up about a quarter of the Missouri electorate.Mark Brewer, a former chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said Mr. Sanders had confronted circumstances this time that made the state a tougher battlefield for him. Mr. Brewer, who was a supporter of Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, said that voters appeared to have made a straightforward assessment of the two candidates' electability and that ""at least for tonight, in Michigan, Biden won that argument.""""It's difficult to compare tonight to four years ago: There is an incumbent president, who Democrats are just focused on replacing, and that was not the case four years ago,"" Mr. Brewer said. ""Sanders was the underdog four years ago, and frankly Hillary Clinton took the state for granted and did not campaign here vigorously, and so forth. It's really apples and oranges.""Perhaps nothing better illustrated the direction of this nominating contest, though, than the surge in voter turnout. A centerpiece of Mr. Sanders's campaign has been his promise to win by inspiring a wave of new voters in the primary race and the general election.But for the second consecutive week it was Mr. Biden who was the beneficiary of an increase in turnout compared with that of the 2016 race, often in the sort of suburban jurisdictions that powered the Democrats' big gains in the midterm elections. In Oakland County, Mich., the Detroit suburb where Representative Haley Stevens picked up a Republican-held seat in 2018, Mr. Biden was winning by nearly 30 points and turnout was on track to be about twice what it was four years ago.The next few rounds of primaries are focused on big, diverse states where Mr. Biden is seen as having a solid advantage, including Florida and Georgia. And a number of states where Mr. Sanders won caucuses four years ago have since switched to hold primary elections, which tend to be less controlled by ideological activists, leaving Mr. Sanders without an obvious place to make a comeback.The contests on Tuesday included four states that Mr. Sanders carried against Mrs. Clinton in 2016: Michigan, Idaho, North Dakota and Washington. But there has been no indication that many Democrats have been having second thoughts about embracing Mr. Biden, to whom the party's voters turned abruptly last week as a safe option after a chaotic and confusing primary season. With the race effectively down to just Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, many Democratic leaders have clambered aboard the former vice president's campaign.
After Mr. Biden carried South Carolina on Feb. 29, rivals like former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota quickly dropped out of the race and endorsed him. Once the Super Tuesday results were known, Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, did the same. By contrast, Mr. Sanders has not managed to unify support even on the left; Ms. Warren, a fellow progressive, has declined to issue an endorsement since leaving the race last week.Mr. Biden, 77, and Mr. Sanders, 78, have both faced questions about their ages in recent days, as the race has narrowed to two men who would turn 80 within the space of a first presidential term -- and as fears of a viral epidemic have rippled through the campaign trail. And supporters of Mr. Sanders have been sharply critical of Mr. Biden for his halting public manner and comparatively brief remarks at campaign events, with some suggesting that the former vice president lacked the physical vigor required to win and hold the presidency.Mr. Sanders himself has not gone that far, though in a Fox News forum on Monday he criticized Mr. Biden for speaking for only a few minutes at one of his campaign rallies over the weekend.A day later, Mr. Sanders used a Fox News forum to deliver a critique of Mr. Biden's record, but emphasized he had no interest in ""making personal attacks on Joe.""The two men are slated to meet on a debate stage in Phoenix this weekend, before the Arizona primary on Tuesday, in what would be their first one-on-one encounter in the race. Mr. Sanders could face pressure on Sunday to inflict real damage on Mr. Biden, but doing so could prompt a backlash if by then he is seen as a kind of nuisance challenger with no obvious path to victory.Many Democrats are eager to turn to the task of challenging Mr. Trump: Polls show that both Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders will be competitive against the president, and will probably start the general election with something of an advantage. By a wide margin, however, Democratic voters say they view Mr. Biden as having the best chance of winning in November.PhotographJoseph R.

| Jump to first hitMr. Sanders had mostly avoided going on the offensive in 2019, but with his standing in the polls rising, he saw an opening to criticize Mr. Biden on the Iraq war and Social Security -- and he took it.DES MOINES -- When Joseph R. Biden Jr. released a video on Tuesday night suggesting that Bernie Sanders's campaign was engaging in ""dishonest attacks"" over Mr. Biden's record on Social Security, it created an opportunity that some Sanders advisers had hoped for months would come.The Sanders campaign's in-house advertising team had already created a video attacking Mr. Biden's record on Social Security but had not released it, waiting for the right moment, aides said. Internally, some feared it might be perceived as negative campaigning. But after watching Mr. Biden's video, Mr. Sanders and his advisers agreed: It was go time.The decision to release the video, which used Mr. Biden's own words from years ago about freezing Social Security, constituted part of a striking shift for Mr. Sanders. Through much of 2019, he had resisted mounting forceful attacks on Mr. Biden, seeing it as a risky tactic and counter to Mr. Sanders's policy-focused brand. Though some of Mr. Sanders's aides have been in attack mode for months, firing salvos on social media at Mr. Biden and Senator Elizabeth Warren, Mr. Sanders has largely avoided going on offense himself, dodging questions from reporters meant to instigate and distancing himself from supporters' negative comments.Yet as the Iowa caucuses approach, with his advisers urging him to be more aggressive, a resurgent Mr. Sanders has been more assertive against Mr. Biden, infusing his campaign with a harder edge.""When people want to attack, we will counterpunch, and we will counterpunch very aggressively,"" Faiz Shakir, Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, said in an interview Wednesday.Social Security, he added, ""was one of the areas that we had always planned on having a distinction that never fully got an opportunity to air itself.""""Now,"" he said, ""we're having that opportunity.""Using the airstrike that killed one of Iran's top military commanders as an opening, Mr. Sanders has ramped up his criticism of Mr. Biden's vote to authorize the war in Iraq. And he has begun highlighting Mr. Biden's record on Social Security, a new line of attack that Mr. Sanders's advisers believe will help him appeal to older voters, particularly African-Americans -- Mr. Biden's most devoted constituency -- and women.The intensifying attacks have coincided with strong showings for Mr. Sanders in several recent polls. A national poll conducted for CNN that was released on Wednesday showed Mr. Sanders with a narrow lead ahead of Mr. Biden. It was the first time Mr. Sanders has led nationally since Mr. Biden entered the race last April, though his lead was within the poll's margin of error. (A second national survey conducted by a different pollster shows Mr. Biden in front.)Mr. Sanders's offensive has also led to more frequent sparring, and heightened tensions, between the campaigns.Over the weekend, Mr. Biden accused the Sanders campaign of deliberately distorting his record on Social Security, prompting Mr. Shakir to issue a scathing attack on Mr. Biden. On Monday, Mr. Sanders apologized to Mr. Biden after a top surrogate for the Sanders campaign published an op-ed that claimed the former vice president had ""a big corruption problem.""Mr. Biden later thanked Mr. Sanders on Twitter for the apology, adding: ""These kinds of attacks have no place in this primary. Let's all keep our focus on making Donald Trump a one-term president.""The truce was short-lived. Mr. Biden continued to fund-raise off the candidates' clashes.And on Tuesday night, there were the dueling videos over Social Security. ""Bernie's campaign is not telling the truth,"" Mr. Biden's video said.Mr. Sanders's video, which he quickly tweeted out on Tuesday night in response, features Mr. Biden saying in the past that he wanted to freeze federal spending including Social Security. ""When I argued if we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well,"" Mr. Biden says. The video then cuts to Mr. Sanders declaring: ""We are not going to cut Social Security, we're going to expand benefits.""In his decades serving as a senator from Delaware, Mr. Biden at times supported freezes and proposals that worried some Social Security advocates. He has also released a plan that calls for strengthening Social Security and expanding certain benefits.On Wednesday morning, in an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe,"" Mr. Biden demurred when asked if the attacks from the Sanders campaign were dishonest. But in suggesting that his past statements on Social Security were being taken out of context, he invoked Mr. Sanders's record on gun control, an area that has previously drawn scrutiny for the senator from Vermont.""It's like my going back and pointing out how Bernie voted against the Brady Bill five times while I was trying to get it passed when he was in the House, or how he voted to, you know, protect gun manufacturers,"" Mr. Biden said. ""It's the only group in America you can't sue. I mean, he's made up for that. He's indicated that was past.""Mr. Biden was referring to Mr. Sanders's opposition in the 1990s to a bill that required background checks for gun purchases, as well as his 2005 vote for a bill that shielded gun manufacturers and dealers from liability lawsuits.As a group of reporters congregated around Mr. Biden at a campaign event in Mason City, Iowa, on Wednesday, Ed O'Keefe of CBS News pressed Mr. Biden on why his campaign had continued to criticize Mr. Sanders, even after Mr. Sanders had apologized for his surrogate's op-ed. ""Why wasn't his apology enough?"" Mr. O'Keefe asked.Mr. Biden responded sharply.""Why why why why!"" Mr. Biden repeated, briefly grabbing Mr. O'Keefe's lapels. ""You're getting nervous, man! Calm down. It's O.K. He apologized for saying that I was corrupt. He didn't say anything about whether or not I was telling the truth about Social Security.""Mr. Sanders's newly combative posture has been met with some relief inside his campaign: With the two men competing for an overlapping slice of working-class voters, some top aides have been quietly urging Mr. Sanders to draw more explicit contrasts with the former vice president. Not only would such an offensive help Mr. Sanders whittle away at Mr. Biden's support, some advisers believe, but it would also satisfy supporters and donors to Mr. Sanders who crave a fight. Some also think he pulled punches against Hillary Clinton in 2016, to his detriment.Since the fall, they have encouraged him to go after Mr. Biden aggressively on the debate stage, a strategy Mr. Sanders followed tepidly. During the debate last week in Des Moines, some advisers had prodded Mr. Sanders to confront Mr. Biden on Social Security and were frustrated the topic did not come up.Mr. Sanders seemed to telegraph his willingness to engage in rougher campaigning during a question-and-answer session with reporters this month in Iowa City.""We will contrast records -- nothing wrong with that,"" he said. ""That is what a serious campaign is about.""Aides say Mr. Sanders has been true to his word, highlighting differences in his record while adhering to his longstanding opposition to personal attacks.""Senator Sanders's career has been one of saying, 'I can win on the merits of our positive argument and the values and the vision that we have for this country,""' Mr. Shakir said, adding that to the extent the campaign has gone after other candidates, ""we have done so on record and on the issues.""""What he has always felt very strongly is, we don't do negative character attacks,"" Mr. Shakir said.There have been other instances of sniping between the two campaigns. Earlier in the race, with the Iowa caucuses a distant date on the horizon, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden took aim at each other over health care, with both arguing that their position was the only one that made sense. Mr. Sanders backs ""Medicare for all,"" a single-payer program that would eliminate private insurance, while Mr. Biden views such a proposal as too costly and complex and instead favors fixes to the existing health care system and the addition of a public option.Mr. Sanders has also criticized Mr. Biden over his support for the North American Free Trade Agreement from almost the moment Mr. Biden jumped into the race.But unlike those clashes, which played out before many voters had tuned into the race, their recent fights have taken place in the caldron of primary season, with media attention at a high point and their fate in the Iowa caucuses at stake.On Wednesday, Sanders officials marveled that Mr. Biden was perpetuating an argument they believe only favors them. Protecting Social Security is a perennial issue in general election campaigns because it affects so many voters and polls as a top priority, especially with the sort of older caucusgoers Mr. Biden is counting on in Iowa. But it has scarcely come up in this contest, in part because so much of the Democratic debate has centered on health care.Mr. Sanders's aides had all but given up hope that their relentless baiting of Mr. Biden on the topic would draw a response. Then a voter raised the issue with Mr. Biden over the weekend, prompting him to accuse the Sanders campaign of doctoring a video against him, which revived the issue.Still, it was unclear whether the former vice president's campaign wanted to fully engage on the fight -- until Tuesday, when it released the video condemning Mr. Sanders's attacks. That spurred Mr. Shakir to pronounce it the first negative commercial of the primary.And it was all the prompting Mr. Sanders needed to return fire.Reporting was contributed by Katie Glueck from Mason City, Iowa; Jonathan Martin from Dubuque, Iowa; Thomas Kaplan from Washington; and Matt Stevens from New York.PhotographA CNN poll that was released on Wednesday showed Senator Bernie Sanders with a narrow lead over former Vice President Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitThe presidential candidates worked to sell their pitches to the state's caucusgoers on Sunday, but also ripped into the billionaire they will soon face in the Super Tuesday contests on March 3.LAS VEGAS -- The Democratic presidential candidates raced on Sunday to make the most of their final weekend day before the Nevada caucuses, selling their messages and tearing into their opponents.But the rival they focused on most intently was one who isn't even competing in the state.""I got news for Mr. Bloomberg,"" Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont said at an event in Carson City, Nev., taking aim at the former New York City mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, within five minutes of opening his remarks. ""The American people are sick and tired of billionaires buying elections.""In a rarity, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. echoed his progressive counterpart. ""Sixty billion dollars can buy you a lot of advertising, but it can't erase your record,"" he said of Mr. Bloomberg in an interview on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that aired on Sunday.Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, another moderate, had similar thoughts. ""I'm here getting votes,"" Ms. Klobuchar said in an interview on Sunday. ""It's not something where I can just -- what would be the word -- transport in a bunch of ads."" She called on Mr. Bloomberg to ""go on the shows that every other candidate goes on, on the Sunday shows and the like.""She added: ""I don't think I'm going to beat him on the airwaves, but I can beat him on the debate stage."" At a forum on Sunday focused on infrastructure, Ms. Klobuchar, who won the endorsement of The Las Vegas Sun last week, mentioned Mr. Bloomberg early on, referring to President Trump's comments about his height as she stood to speak. ""I am the only candidate that is 5-foot-4,"" she joked. ""I want that out there now.""The fixation on Mr. Bloomberg, the free-spending multibillionaire, reflected his rising prominence in the Democratic race, even though he is skipping the first four nominating contests and focusing on the 14 Super Tuesday states that will vote on March 3.As early voting continued in Nevada on Sunday, some of the criticism seemed to be sticking.""Bloomberg just has bad connotations that come along with him,"" Leah Garwood said as she waited in line with her husband on Sunday in Las Vegas for roughly 45 minutes to vote for a different billionaire, Tom Steyer of California. ""It's just at the back of my mind. It makes me uncomfortable, uneasy.""Kelly Mays, an English professor who said she favored Ms. Klobuchar and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, called it ""a little frightening that you can buy your way in at this late date."" Standing in line to vote on Sunday afternoon, she said she thought Ms. Warren's chances in Nevada were ""probably not great, but I also think people are counting her out way too early.""Nevada, which will hold its caucuses on Saturday, is more diverse than either of the two states that have held presidential nominating contests so far. The state is determined to shrug off the conventional wisdom that any momentum gained -- or hopes cruelly dashed -- in the wintry, rural expanses of Iowa and New Hampshire will decide what comes after.""I don't think either Iowa or New Hampshire reflect America,"" said Jonathan Quitt, who works for a casino on the Las Vegas Strip and volunteers for Mr. Biden. ""I think they're small, white-bread communities without diversity.""The presidential race's shift into states with more diverse electorates brings with it the potential for an increased focus on racial issues, and opportunities for candidates like Mr. Biden as well as challenges for Ms. Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., who so far have shown little traction with nonwhite voters.At a Clark County Democratic Party dinner gala at the Tropicana Las Vegas on Saturday night -- filled by an establishment crowd willing to pay $150 for dinner and dress up in suits and cocktail dresses -- six top presidential candidates spoke, and Mr. Biden seemed to own the room. He gave a raise-the-roof speech about the accomplishments of the Obama administration while criticizing Mr. Sanders's health care plan for ending the private insurance that unions have fought hard for.On ""Meet the Press,"" Mr. Biden more explicitly went after Mr. Sanders, the winner of the popular votes in Iowa and New Hampshire, citing the cost of his ""Medicare for all"" proposal.""He's never gotten anything done,"" Mr. Biden said of his rival.""I mean, he's been talking about health care, Medicare for all, universal health care, for 35 years,"" Mr. Biden said. ""Nothing's happened. I helped get passed Obamacare. I helped move it forward. I got the votes.""Mr. Sanders devoted a sizable portion of his dinner remarks in Clark County, home to 75 percent of the state's population, to attacking Mr. Bloomberg for his positions on minimum wage laws, taxes, the financial crisis and ""racist policies like stop-and-frisk,"" the policing tactic that has been criticized for disproportionately affecting people of color and for which Mr. Bloomberg has apologized.At an event on Sunday in Carson City, Nev., Mr. Sanders denounced ""the power of big money interests and the greed and corruption of the corporate elite,"" and singled out Mr. Bloomberg.""Now, Mike Bloomberg is struggling -- he's down to his last $60 billion,"" Mr. Sanders said mockingly. ""Hey, life is hard, you know -- food prices going up, housing going up. How are you going to make it on $60 billion? Mike is trying.""Later on Sunday, speaking to to thousands of supporters at a rally at the Colorado Convention Center in Denver, Mr. Sanders renewed his jabs at Mr. Bloomberg.""Democracy, to me, means 'one person, one vote,""' said Mr. Sanders, who dominated the Democratic caucuses four years ago in Colorado, which has switched to a primary and will vote on Super Tuesday. ""Not Bloomberg or anybody else spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to buy an election.""As Mr. Sanders's supporters waited for him to speak, head-bopping to the band DeVotchKa, Mr. Bloomberg's name rankled several. They said they disliked Mr. Bloomberg's record on policing in New York and the fortune he was spending on his campaign, and said they might not support him if he won the Democratic nomination.""I could justify Biden; Bloomberg, no,"" said Will Mulligan, 20, a student at Colorado State University. ""He's Trump, but just more competent.""His friend Kylie VonEiff, 19, a community college student, agreed. ""I can't get behind anyone who is using his own wealth to fund an election,"" she said.Mr. Bloomberg's rising presence as a wild-card candidate around whom center-left voters might coalesce reflects Mr. Biden's diminished stature, after he finished fifth in New Hampshire and fourth in Iowa.But the former vice president and his supporters remain hopeful. Mr. Quitt, when asked if he was discouraged, was adamant: ""Not. At. All.""Public polling has been scarce in Nevada. But there are some signs that Mr. Biden could find at least the partial firewall he needs here for his campaign in Saturday's caucuses. ""There can be no Democratic nominee, none, without the voice of Latinos and African-Americans being heard, and heard loudly,"" he said on Saturday night. The state is nearly 30 percent Latino and 10 percent black and has a fast-growing Asian-American population.In addition to Nevada's greater diversity, its residents have witnessed fewer candidate visits, and they have not been the focus of national news for a year in the way that those in Iowa and New Hampshire were.The state's more transient population, with many residents disconnected from neighbors and focused on jobs, makes for less obsessive following of political news.Thirty minutes into waiting in line to vote on Sunday, Bob Ahern still had not decided whom he liked best. ""I like Buttigieg. I like Klobuchar. And, actually, I like Tom Steyer,"" Mr. Ahern said. He paused with an afterthought, adding: ""And I do like Biden, too. Biden is good, too.""Just as Mr. Biden's name recognition kept him aloft in national polls for months, he still seems to enjoy that edge in the state.At the same time, the base of support that Mr. Sanders established with a close-fought second-place finish in the state's 2016 caucuses is much intact.Jessica Slovak, a nurse who caucused for Mr. Sanders four years ago, was still with him as she waited in a long line over the weekend at a site for early caucusgoers in Las Vegas, where other Sanders supporters strummed an electric guitar and sang along to ""The Bernie Necessities.""Her husband, Chase Slovak, who also supports Mr. Sanders, said he was not as extreme as rivals and the news media portrayed him. But Ms. Slovak disagreed.""I personally think he's as far left as you can go,"" she said. ""It's for the greater good.""The Nevada Democratic Party reported that 18,538 people had voted on Saturday alone, nearly a quarter of the total number of votes cast in 2016.Darla Mayfield, 67, waited in line with her sister to vote for the first time in her life on Sunday. ""I like Amy, and then Elizabeth,"" Ms. Mayfield said. ""I finally did my research. I'm not going to vote just because.""Jack Healy contributed reporting from Denver.PhotographJoseph R.

| Jump to first hitOn the eve of Super Tuesday, the president traveled to North Carolina to once again stage a rally in a state about to hold a Democratic nominating contest and eagerly mocked the candidates.CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- President Trump inserted himself on Monday into the Democratic presidential nomination contest on the eve of its biggest day, belittling the resurgent Joseph R. Biden Jr. as a feebleminded has-been while fanning resentment among supporters of Bernie Sanders.Traveling to one of the larger states holding a Democratic primary on Super Tuesday, Mr. Trump eagerly sought to undercut Mr. Biden at the very moment the former vice president revived his flagging campaign, taunting him for verbal gaffes and memory lapses and portraying him as an old man who even if elected would not govern but instead be committed to a retirement home.As he has for weeks, the president likewise sought to encourage disenchantment on the left by promoting the notion that the Democratic Party establishment was trying to somehow illegitimately take away the nomination from Mr. Sanders. But Mr. Trump did not neglect the rest of the shrinking Democratic field, firing off barbs at the other candidates still in contention and even those who dropped out in the past 48 hours and threw their support to Mr. Biden.""The Democrat party has gone crazy,"" Mr. Trump said to a stadium full of cheering supporters.The president wrapped up his rally not long before Mr. Biden's own election-eve rally in Dallas got underway, and Mr. Trump seemed especially focused on the former vice president as a potential opponent in the fall.He gleefully repeated recent misstatements by Mr. Biden, including his confusion over names and states, his statement that he was a candidate for the Senate, his reference to Tuesday's primaries as ""Super Thursday"" and his head-spinning comment that 150 million Americans have been killed by guns since 2007.""That means 50 percent of our country!"" Mr. Trump said of the gun comment. ""That's a big story!""""Sleepy Joe,"" Mr. Trump continued, ""he doesn't even know where he is or what he's doing or what office he's running for. Honestly, I don't think he knows what office he's running for.""If Mr. Biden won the presidency, Mr. Trump said, his staff would actually do the governing. ""They're going to put him into a home, and other people are going to be running the country,"" the president said, ""and they're going to be super-left, radical crazies. And Joe's going to be in a home and he'll be watching television.""A revival of Mr. Biden's candidacy could scramble the election dynamics, giving Mr. Trump as much at stake on Tuesday as the Democrats. The president and his staff have been excited by the rise of Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator who calls himself a democratic socialist, seeing the contrast as a favorable one in the November general election. But Mr. Trump made clear he would happily go after Mr. Biden if he emerges, too.The rally in North Carolina was the fifth time in a row that the president has flown to a state holding a Democratic contest just before voting opened to force his way into the news cycle and try to shape the conversation. ""We like to troll,"" he boasted to the crowd in Charlotte.As is often the case, the Monday night rally was more of a Trumpian stream of consciousness than a recitation of the official text sitting on the teleprompter in front of him. He accused Democrats of ""trying to politicize the coronavirus"" even as he focused on the politics of coronavirus and asserted that ""fringe globalists"" wanted to keep the borders open to infected visitors.Mr. Trump peppered his speech with a string of false or misleading statements. ""Mexico's paying for the wall,"" he insisted, even though it is not. ""Yes, they are. You'll see. You'll see. You understand."" He boasted of preserving protections for pre-existing conditions even though his administration went to court to overturn the law guaranteeing such protections and supported legislation that would have weakened them.As he sometimes does in these off-the-cuff riffs, he trailed off into comments that raised eyebrows. Twice at different points in his speech, he noted that he knew many parents who ""don't love their children very much."" At another point, he summoned Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, to the stage and gushed over him as if he were a younger brother.""We all have your back,"" declared Mr. Graham, who lost the Republican presidential nomination to Mr. Trump in 2016, when the senator called the eventual winner a ""kook"" who was unfit for office. ""Mr. President, you're going to kick their ass in November.""""Oh, my Lindsey, my Lindsey,"" Mr. Trump said.The president ridiculed the other Democratic candidates, calling former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York ""a disaster waiting to happen"" and ""a mess,"" while again mocking his would-be challenger's height. He recalled how Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whom he once again mocked with a racial slur, ""Pocahontas,"" eviscerated Mr. Bloomberg at a recent debate. ""She's mean, she's very mean,"" he said. ""She came after him and he started choking.""Two candidates who just left the race likewise came under fire: former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Without any evidence, Mr. Trump contended that they made an illicit pact with Mr. Biden for their support.""Sounds like they made a deal,"" he said. ""They both supported Sleepy Joe. You know why? They made a deal. You know why? Quid pro quo. That's why."" Alluding to his own impeachment for using the power of his office to coerce campaign aid from Ukraine, Mr. Trump shouted: ""Impeach them! They should be impeached! They should be impeached! Quid pro quo!""He seemed particularly keen on fomenting discord within the Democratic Party by suggesting that the gathering support for Mr. Biden constituted a conspiracy to deny Mr. Sanders the nomination for a second election cycle in a row.""It's being rigged against Crazy Bernie,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Crazy Bernie's going to go crazy, crazy.""Maggie Haberman reported from Charlotte, and Peter Baker from Washington.PhotographPresident Trump, speaking in Charlotte, N.C., mocked Joseph R. Biden Jr. over recent gaffes. (PHOTOGRAPH BY DOUG MILLS/THE NEW YORK TIMES)Word count: 1030Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitThe dispute has led to negative attacks and doubts about party unity, exactly what Democratic leaders do not want to happen, for fear of handing an advantage to President Trump.WASHINGTON -- For a year they offered almost nothing but praise for each other in public, he paying tribute to her populism, she initially adopting his health care plan, and each supporting the other against moderates in the Democratic presidential debates and rebuking reporters who sought to stoke any suppressed rivalry.The alliance between Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders was an extension of their rapport in the Capitol, which was more about mutual interest than personal friendship, but it remained largely intact through 2019 despite highs and lows for each candidate -- even as they competed for the same set of voters.But that relationship has now ruptured in extraordinary fashion, over whether he told her in a private meeting in 2018 that a woman couldn't defeat President Trump. The breach runs a real risk of damaging liberal hopes of ultimately uniting Democratic Party factions around a progressive nominee in 2020.A sizable, loud swath of left-wing activists are now furious at Ms. Warren for criticizing and challenging Mr. Sanders over gender and for employing hardball campaign tactics this week. Meanwhile, some progressive women and backers of Ms. Warren are angry at Mr. Sanders for disputing her and for not denouncing the #NeverWarren campaign by some of his online supporters.Both candidates and their advisers have come to believe that the other camp is fighting dirty, according to interviews with campaign officials and surrogates. They have not spoken since their post-debate confrontation in Iowa on Tuesday night, and many liberals are starting to feel a painful sense that they've been here before.""We can't relive 2016,"" said Randi Weingarten, the head of the American Federation of Teachers, referring to the split between pro-Sanders liberals and other Democrats who wanted the party to unite behind his onetime rival, Hillary Clinton. ""Misinformation miscreants will have a field day with this.""Ill will between Sanders and Warren supporters is now exploding on social media, with angry memes, conspiracy theories and harassing commentary mostly aimed at Ms. Warren. Negative attacks and doubts about party unity are exactly what Democratic leaders do not want to happen in 2020, for fear of handing ammunition to Mr. Trump, as the heated contest between the Vermont senator and Mrs. Clinton did four years ago.Many Warren advisers and allies think the Sanders camp has long tolerated public attacks on her from his surrogates, and believe he is not reining in divisive and in some cases sexist attacks against her among Sanders supporters on Twitter.And the Sanders camp is even more frustrated over what they see as an orchestrated, dayslong campaign by Ms. Warren to revive her bid by suggesting Mr. Sanders is a misogynist.Sanders advisers believe Ms. Warren has hurt herself with the accusations but also put them in a no-win situation, in which they are unable to fully strike back for fear of appearing insensitive but risk incurring damage of their own without rebutting her claims.Ms. Warren's decisions at Tuesday's debate to openly challenge Mr. Sanders's denial of that remark, and then to confront him after the debate and refuse to shake his hand before the cameras, have also led Sanders supporters to believe that she is acting underhandedly.On Thursday, a handful of progressive groups, distraught over the tensions between the two leading liberal candidates, scrambled to tamp down the tensions, issuing a statement urging the two senators to halt their ""crossfire"" lest a moderate benefit from the hostilities.But even if one of them claims the nomination, the rupture between the two senators could be difficult to repair because of the nature of their two coalitions: If Mr. Sanders emerges as the nominee, he may find it difficult to energize the female Democrats who were already uneasy with him because of the 2016 race. And should Ms. Warren become the party's standard-bearer, she could find it hard to win back the most fervent Sanders backers, who hardly needed any further evidence to claim that the nominating process is stacked against him.

Mr. Sanders's closest adviser, Jeff Weaver, described the two candidates as ""senatorial friends, as that term is understood in Washington,"" and portrayed their recent squabble as a blip. ""It's not the height of their relationship, but I'm sure it will be fine,"" Mr. Weaver said.Describing what Mr. Sanders had told him about the 2018 conversation, Mr. Weaver said they discussed the ""challenges of women running in the era of Trump."" And he said it was Ms. Warren who broached the subject of whether a woman could run against Mr. Trump when the two met in private in December 2018.""She brought it up,"" Mr. Weaver said.Yet this week's report about that gathering, and Ms. Warren's assertion that Mr. Sanders had indeed told her a woman couldn't win, was only the match that sparked a conflagration that had been slowly building.The confrontation at the debate in Des Moines may have crystallized into a few tense moments on camera, but it had been simmering for more than a year. It can be traced to the weeks after a dinner at Ms. Warren's condominium in December 2018, when a decade-long alliance between New England progressives with a shared contempt for political artifice first became strained by their mutual ambition.Ms. Warren and her top advisers believed that Mr. Sanders might not run for president, according to people familiar with the discussions at the time, and that there was at least a chance the then-77-year-old Vermont senator would accept political emeritus status and crown Ms. Warren as the new leader of the left.At the same time, Mr. Sanders's supporters viewed Ms. Warren as politically damaged, perhaps beyond repair, by her decision to take a DNA test to prove her Native American ancestry.Yet both of those assumptions, which could have doubled as hopes, turned out to be misguided. By the end of 2019, it was clear that these two liberals were both blocking the other from consolidating the left in the Democratic primary -- and that their fragile peace could not last long.""This was their frustration boiling over,"" said former Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who has known both senators for years. ""She's frustrated by his rigidity and being attacked by his people for her effort to make what they both agree on politically more sellable. And he's understandably resentful that she comes along and becomes the darling of some on the left for advocating ideas he's been advocating since long before her.""Now, after months of Mr. Sanders instructing his aides not to be critical of Ms. Warren and Ms. Warren steadfastly refusing to utter anything negative about Mr. Sanders, the two are feeling upset and betrayed, allies said.A handful of progressive groups -- some supporting Mr. Sanders, some Ms. Warren and others neutral -- expressed their anxiety in an unusual joint statement Thursday that reflected the degree of alarm on the left.""Sanders and Warren, as well as their campaigns and supporters, will need to find ways to cooperate,"" wrote the leaders of eight liberal-leaning organizations. ""The crossfire amplified by the media is unhelpful and does not reflect the relationship between two Senate colleagues who broadly worked well together for most of the last year.""In fact, their working relationship dates to well before 2019.The two bonded when Ms. Warren, then a Harvard law professor and bankruptcy expert, came to Vermont for a town hall event in 2008 with Mr. Sanders, who two years earlier had been elected to the Senate. He called her ""one of the most knowledgeable and articulate writers in America in terms of what is going on in the middle class.""In 2012 it was Mr. Sanders's turn to cross the state line, and he stumped for Ms. Warren's Senate bid in western Massachusetts.They never became personally close, but their shared worldview brought them together in a Senate light on populists.When it became clear after 2016 that both harbored presidential ambitions, Ms. Warren was particularly careful to cultivate Mr. Sanders.She endorsed Keith Ellison, a top Sanders surrogate who was then a congressman, for Democratic National Committee chair, telling an adviser that she felt she owed it to Mr. Sanders, according to a Democrat familiar with the conversation. And before long she was appearing on Mr. Sanders's podcast and anecdotes were springing up in articles about how they shared meals in airports.Ms. Warren has also taken Mr. Sanders's side in his grievance about the 2016 election. In an interview with CNN in November 2017, when she was asked whether she agreed that the primary had been tilted in Mrs. Clinton's favor, Ms. Warren replied, ""Yes.""But tensions between the two have slowly grown since they entered the White House race, as they both pursue progressive voters and endorsements from left-wing leaders and groups.

It was not until Ms. Warren stopped saying ""I'm with Bernie"" on ""Medicare for all"" and devised her own plan that their relationship began to sour. Ms. Warren laid out a transition to a single-payer system, while Mr. Sanders repeatedly said he would do it ""in my first week of office.""""She tries to be a little flexible, says she wouldn't do it until her third year, and she gets attacked by him,"" said Mr. Frank, who has not endorsed a candidate but is friends with Ms. Warren.Now, after a head-spinning week, it's clear both campaigns would like to move on.Responding to a reporter who tweeted about trying unsuccessfully to get Mr. Sanders to comment on the post-debate argument, a Sanders adviser, David Sirota, sought to stoke a different story line.""I have a crazy idea: perhaps you should ask him about Joe Biden's 40 year crusade to cut Social Security and Bernie's own efforts to protect Social Security,"" Mr. Sirota wrote.Jonathan Martin reported from Washington, and Sydney Ember from Des Moines. Nick Corasaniti contributed reporting from New York.PhotographSenators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, above in July, have not spoken since a confrontation after Tuesday night's debate.

| Jump to first hitAs the 2020 candidates vie for support in South Carolina, Mr. Steyer has been criticized for hiring black lawmakers or their companies. Records show the Sanders campaign has done the same.COLUMBIA, S.C. -- Last April, just as the 2020 presidential campaign was getting underway, Senator Bernie Sanders trumpeted a breakthrough in his campaign's quest for black voters' support in South Carolina.Mr. Sanders was honored to have been endorsed for the Democratic nomination by seven black members of the South Carolina legislature, he announced in a tweet.One of the lawmakers, records show, owned a company that was already being paid by the Sanders campaign. Another would soon be added to the payroll as a vendor.By the end of 2019, consulting companies operated by the two lawmakers, Representative Wendell Gilliard of Charleston and Representative Terry Alexander of Florence, had collected a combined total of almost $150,000 from Mr. Sanders's presidential effort, according to federal campaign records.Campaigns regularly enter into financial dealings with companies and business owners as they build out operations in primary states; they also seek the endorsements of popular lawmakers of all races, some of whom also work in public relations, consulting or similar fields where payments can be routed.This practice takes place in both political parties and, while many leaders find it unseemly, it continues unabated.Even legal and fully disclosed payments, however, can raise questions about whether endorsements are heartfelt or driven by financial considerations.That dynamic is evident in South Carolina, where presidential candidates will compete in the primary Feb. 29, the first test in a Southern state. Black voters may make up more than 60 percent of the Democratic electorate there.Payments to endorsers in the state became an issue last week when a supporter of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. made thinly veiled suggestions that a rival candidate, Tom Steyer, had traded cash for endorsements by making payments to State Representative Jerry Govan, the head of the South Carolina Legislative Black Caucus.Federal Election Commission records showed that the Steyer campaign had paid Mr. Govan more than $40,000 since September, when Mr. Govan endorsed Mr. Steyer. The payments to a company associated with Mr. Govan, Govan Agency L.L.C., were for ""community building services.""The disclosures about Mr. Steyer's payments also prompted a disdainful tweet from Bakari Sellers, a former state legislator and one of the state's most sought-after surrogates. ""Confused, so we're OK with Steyer paying $10K a month for endorsements?"" Mr. Sellers wrote on Friday, adding, ""Presidential candidates shouldn't be paying legislators for their endorsements.""Mr. Steyer, however, was hardly chastened: On Wednesday his campaign said he had hired Gilda Cobb-Hunter, the longest-serving member of South Carolina's House and an influential African-American leader who rarely endorses in presidential races. Ms. Cobb-Hunter will be a senior adviser to the campaign, a move that was first reported by The Associated Press.A longtime ethics advocate in South Carolina, John Crangle, questioned whether such arrangements posed a real problem, noting that such work does not influence bills pending before the legislature and is not prohibited by state law. Mr. Crangle is a lobbyist for the South Carolina Progressive Caucus, which does not endorse candidates.""If legislators were banned from taking consulting fees or legal retainers, I would guess that 75 percent would resign,"" Mr. Crangle said.Ms. Cobb-Hunter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The arrangements by Mr. Sanders's campaign -- as well as recent history -- reveal that such consulting deals are fairly commonplace in South Carolina.In 2007, Hillary Clinton defended her South Carolina presidential campaign against allegations of endorsement-buying after her campaign entered a $10,000-a-month consulting contract with state Senator Darrell Jackson, a Columbia lawmaker and pastor who also operated a consulting company.""Senator Jackson was someone who was involved in my husband's campaigns,"" Mrs. Clinton said at the time. ""He was someone we turned to for political advice and counsel and I'm proud to have him on my team.""At times the practice can cross legal boundaries: A former Iowa state senator was sent to prison in 2017 after a federal investigation revealed he had taken more than $70,000 from Ron Paul's presidential campaign and that the money had been paid to an audio-visual production company to hide the payment from public view. Three former aides to Mr. Paul were also convicted of public corruption charges.Mr. Sanders's campaign said it was pleased with its connection to the two South Carolina lawmakers. ""We're proud that two leaders who endorsed in 2016 are not only supporting the senator again in 2020 but also working hard to help us win,"" said a statement issued on behalf of the campaign by Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator and a campaign co-chair.Several current and former black elected officials expressed concern, though, that payments to officials who also endorse candidates, however legal, could create the impression that their support can be bought.""I'm 75 years of age, and all my life you've had candidates come into the predominantly black community and dropping out a few dollars or a lot of dollars to a few people,"" said Bernice Scott, a former member of the Richland County, S.C., council who supports Mr. Biden. ""Call it consulting or whatever they want to call it, I wouldn't do it. It puts a bad taste in everybody's mouth.""Mr. Steyer, a billionaire who is largely self-funding his campaign, has spent lavishly in South Carolina on advertising and staff and has also retained Harold Mitchell, an environmental activist and former state senator from Spartanburg who starred in an ad for Mr. Steyer, endorsing the former hedge fund manager.The payments by Mr. Steyer to Mr. Govan prompted a series of charges and countercharges in South Carolina last week. State Senator Dick Harpootlian, a longtime Biden supporter, called Mr. Steyer ""Mr. Moneybags"" in a tweet last week, hinting that the arrangement with Mr. Govan was a cash-for-endorsement trade-off and alleging that Mr. Govan had previously intended to support Mr. Biden.Mr. Govan, of Orangeburg, accused Mr. Harpootlian of ""throwing mud,"" and so did members of the black caucus, who organized an impromptu news conference at the South Carolina State House to demand that the Biden campaign disavow Mr. Harpootlian's statement.Extending the controversy, Mr. Steyer raised the issue during the Democratic primary debate on Friday night. ""Joe, I'm asking you to come with me and the legislative black caucus and disavow Dick Harpootlian and what he had to say,"" Mr. Steyer said. ""It was wrong. And I'm asking you to join us. Be on the right side.""Mr. Biden retorted: ""I'm asking you to join me and join in the support I have from the overwhelming number of the members of the black caucus. I have more support in South Carolina in the black caucus and the black community than anyone else, double what you have or what anyone else has.""Mr. Sanders interjected: ""I don't think that's quite right.""In its statement, the Sanders campaign emphasized its efforts to reach out to black voters in South Carolina by hiring black staff members, holding events in black-owned venues and paying black vendors, such as caterers.Payments by the Sanders campaign to the two lawmakers were contained in 2019 campaign records filed with the Federal Election Commission. They show that Mr. Sanders's campaign began paying TA Network, Mr. Alexander's company, for political consulting in the second quarter of last year, with total payments of $90,000 for the year.""I've been an elected official 28 years and I've worked on state, local and federal campaigns for those 28 years,"" said Mr. Alexander, whose primary job is as pastor of Wayside Chapel Baptist Church in Florence. He added that elected officials in South Carolina, white and black, had been performing such consulting work for a long time.""It becomes an issue now, questionable, when black folks are part of the game,"" he said.The records show that Mr. Sanders's campaign also hired WGG Consulting early last year for ""event planning"" and ""consulting/political strategy,"" with disbursements to WGG reaching $56,500 by year's end.WGG is operated by Mr. Gilliard, a former union activist who said he had been a passionate supporter of Mr. Sanders since Mr. Sanders endorsed Jesse Jackson for president.""As a young black man back in the 1980s, I read that a white man from a predominantly white state like Vermont had actually endorsed a black man for president,"" Mr. Gilliard said, adding that his consulting agreement with Mr. Sanders was above board.""No more pat on the back and given a bale of cotton and saying thanks for your services. Those days are gone,"" Mr. Gilliard said.Stephanie Saul reported from Columbia, and Jonathan Martin from Manchester, N.H.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders, left, and Tom Steyer, below left, at events in Columbia, S.C.

| Jump to first hitThe specter of the divisive Democratic battles of 2016 cast a shadow over the final days of the 2020 contest for Iowa as several candidates questioned the ability of Bernie Sanders to unite the party.ANAMOSA, Iowa -- The specter of the divisive Democratic battles of 2016 cast a shadow over the final days of the 2020 contest for Iowa, as several leading presidential candidates questioned the ability of Senator Bernie Sanders to unite the party as its nominee while the Sanders camp sparred with allies of Hillary Clinton, his rival in the race four years ago.The negativity and doubts aimed at Mr. Sanders on Saturday reflected a widespread belief among the other Democratic campaigns that he has perhaps the most political momentum heading into Monday night's caucuses, which he narrowly lost in 2016 to Mrs. Clinton. While the political jousting was not ferocious, it echoed private anxieties among some moderate party officials that an Iowa win could propel Mr. Sanders, a staunch liberal, to more primary season victories and make him harder to beat in the long run.The Sanders campaign was also facing some blowback on Saturday after one of its most high-profile supporters, Representative Rashida Tlaib, urged a crowd to boo Mrs. Clinton on Friday after she was critical of Mr. Sanders in a podcast. Ms. Tlaib apologized on Saturday, only to receive words of support from Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, who was then quickly called out by Mrs. Clinton's spokesman.Mr. Sanders made no mention of the rumpus during his campaign stops, largely sticking to his standard message and exuding confidence that he would have a strong caucus night. At times, he even seemed to be enjoying himself, sprinkling his remarks with wry jokes.The rekindling of fights from 2016 -- when many Sanders supporters were reluctant to unify around Mrs. Clinton, the party nominee -- provided an opening for a line of attack on Saturday from Pete Buttigieg, one of the leading moderate opponents to Mr. Sanders.""Reliving the 2016 primary, I did not much care for that experience the first time around, I definitely don't want 2020 to resemble 2016 in any way,"" Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., said while campaigning at an elementary school in Anamosa, a rural stop in eastern Iowa. ""The best way to win is the best way to govern, to leave the politics of the past behind.""Earlier, in Waterloo, Mr. Buttigieg questioned whether Mr. Sanders's calls for a ""political revolution"" would lead to a winning coalition in November.""Senator Sanders is offering an approach that suggests that it's either revolution or it's the status quo and there's nothing in between,"" Mr. Buttigieg said. ""I'm here to remind us that we have an American majority, more than we have seen even 10 years ago when President Obama was making change, we have a bigger American majority today around what we are for than what we are against.""Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, returning to Iowa after a week attending the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump, took an implicit jab at Mr. Sanders during an event in Cedar Rapids as she made the case that she could appeal to a broad range of voters.""I've been building a campaign that's not a campaign that's narrow -- that's not a campaign that says it's us and nobody else,"" Ms. Warren told voters at an event in Cedar Rapids. ""But a campaign that says come on in because we are all in this fight together."" Ms. Warren did not refer to Mr. Sanders by name, but her language echoed an ongoing Democratic line of attack about Mr. Sanders, a democratic socialist, being an us vs. everyone else candidate.In another attempt to project unity, Ms. Warren hailed candidates who had left the race, and said she was proud that some of their staff members had decided to join her campaign. Ms. Warren's internal numbers, according to a person familiar with the data, show that half of her 2020 support comes from people who caucused for Mr. Sanders in 2016, and the other half comes from people who caucused for Mrs. Clinton.Similarly, Senator Amy Klobuchar knocked Mr. Sanders's plan for ""Medicare for all"" within minutes of returning to the campaign trail after being tethered to Washington for impeachment. Though she too did not mention Mr. Sanders by name, Ms. Klobuchar pointed to the Affordable Care Act as a way to rebuild the ""blue wall"" of Midwest states that she said would bring Democrats victory in 2020.""I don't think we should be blowing it up,"" she said of the A.C.A., in front of a crowd of roughly 500 in Bettendorf. ""I think we should be making it better.""Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden took swipes at both Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg as he spoke to an undecided voter, Jaimee Warbasse, at an event in Cedar Rapids.""Everything I say, I've done, and everything I talk about is authentic,"" Mr. Biden told Ms. Warbasse. ""Now, if you don't like what I'm talking about, I understand. You can be for somebody else. But ask yourself, who is going to be able to unite the country? How can Pete do that? How can Bernie do that? And so ask yourself that question.""Mr. Sanders seemed to take the jabs in stride on Saturday, focusing instead on making the case for his own electability against Mr. Trump.At a stop in Indianola, he presented his most forceful argument yet, saying would beat Mr. Trump because he would excite voters, speak to the working class and expose Mr. Trump's populist ""hypocrisy.""""I believe very strongly -- and no disrespect to my Democratic colleagues who are competing for the nomination, they are friends of mine -- but I believe that we are the strongest campaign to defeat Trump, and I'll tell you why,"" he said, vowing to express himself ""bluntly.""Later, at a stop in Iowa City, he suggested that he would run a stronger kind of general election campaign than his rivals.""I honestly do not believe that a traditional same old, same old type of campaign is going to generate the excitement and the energy that we need to bring new voters into the process,"" Mr. Sanders said.An ongoing back-and-forth over the 2016 presidential race has been one of the side narratives unfolding in recent days, with a particular focus on the lack of Democratic unity that followed the fierce primary battle between Mr. Sanders and Mrs. Clinton. Mrs. Clinton has recently belittled Mr. Sanders, saying ""nobody likes him,"" and on Friday she was sharply critical of how his 2016 campaign and supporters did not unite strongly around her after she won the nomination.Hours after The Times reported Mrs. Clinton's latest remarks, a crowd of Sanders supporters booed at the mention of Mrs. Clinton's name at a campaign event, and Ms. Tlaib at one point encouraged them to keep booing. On Saturday, she wrote on Twitter, ""I allowed my disappointment with Secretary Clinton's latest comments about Senator Sanders and his supporters to get the best of me. You all, my sisters-in-service on stage, and our movement deserve better. I will continue to strive to come from a place of love and not react in the same way of those who are against what we are building in this country.""But Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, tweeted out support for Ms. Tlaib, writing ""you're all good"" and ""don't change,"" which drew a retort from the Clinton spokesman, Nick Merrill.""Unbelievable,"" Mr. Merrill wrote. ""If Sanders got the nomination, he'd need the same 66 million votes. His campaign may not know that that's how you beat Trump, but voters do.""With polls showing a highly competitive Iowa race, no Democrat has shown an effective way to take on Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator who is now in his second presidential run and is leading in some recent Iowa polls. Sanders aides view any clash with Mrs. Clinton as an opportunity to rally supporters, who bristle at any reminder of the 2016 campaign and who view her as the embodiment of the establishment they despise.Sydney Ember reported from Indianola, Grinnell and Iowa City; Reid J. Epstein from Waterloo and Anamosa; and Katie Glueck from North Liberty and Cedar Rapids. Astead W. Herndon contributed reporting from Cedar Rapids and Nick Corasaniti from Bettendorf.PhotographRepresentative Rashida Tlaib apologized on Saturday for booing Hillary Clinton at a Sanders event in Clive, Iowa, on Friday.

| Jump to first hitAfter more than a year of campaigning, this is how the Iowa caucuses end: At more than 1,600 precincts in schools, libraries and the largest sports arena in the state, Democrats will gather Monday night to stand in groups and make their choice for the Democratic nominee for president of the United States.Iowa's caucus night is unlike any other political event in America, a two-hour public political declaration in front of one's neighbors, with the sort of cajoling usually left to professional organizers, being done instead by rank-and-file supporters.Unlike political contests in virtually every other state, there is no secret ballot and no absentee participation -- Democrats must appear in person at either their neighborhood precinct or one of 87 satellite caucus locations.In Johnston, two precincts will gather at the Johnston Middle School. Tom Leffler, a 72-year-old retiree who worked in information technology at the Pioneer seed company, will serve as the caucus chairman for one of the precincts, known as Johnston 2.Mr. Leffler, who has been active in presidential politics since he was a volunteer for Eugene J. McCarthy's 1968 campaign, has run caucuses since the 1990s. He has a team of about 20 volunteers who will help him. Some will sit at check-in tables and ensure everyone is both registered to vote and a registered Democrat.""You want to get them all signed in and get the meeting started a little after 7, so you have to have a machine to make that work,"" Mr. Leffler said. ""Otherwise, you have to have a song and dance to kill time and people lose patience.""Before anyone arrives, Mr. Leffler will have already arranged the gym to designate places for each candidate's supporters to gather, with areas on the bleachers reserved for the four leading candidates and chairs on the basketball floor for supporters of other candidates.Each campaign has a designated precinct captain, who is responsible for herding supporters into his or her respective group.""My main job is to get things set up and greet people at the door,"" said Gregory Davis, a 69-year-old retired Lutheran minister who is the Johnston 2 precinct captain for Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. ""People can identify me as an 'Amy person,' and I'll try to persuade people to come to my side.""Once everyone is signed in -- 295 people caucused at Johnston 2 in 2016, and 350 in 2008 -- the proceedings begin.If a candidate or an elected official is in attendance, Mr. Leffler will give them a few minutes to speak. But nobody else gets a chance to campaign.The counting of votes in the first alignment is perhaps the most important moment on caucus night. The difference between 14 percent and 16 percent might just be a handful of supporters, but falling below the viability threshold could mean a candidate risks winning no delegates from the precinct.Mr. Leffler will announce the results and then give caucusgoers 15 minutes to do something that makes Iowa's process truly unique: Supporters of candidates below the 15 percent threshold must join a new group or combine with supporters of another candidate below the threshold in order to get above 15 percent.(Iowa Democrats are able to caucus as uncommitted, though an uncommitted group would be required to meet the 15 percent threshold.)The 15-minute interval is also critical -- it's when the politics of big rallies and millions of dollars in TV advertising gives way to neighbors talking to neighbors.""For the ones that I do know -- and obviously if I'm friends with them or we're neighbors -- I'll remind them that we share a value system that is important to us,"" said Penny Schempp, a 76-year-old retired community college counselor who is the precinct captain for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ""Our values system in Iowa, especially among my neighbors, got Obama elected. And we were really proud of that.""Rhonda Gooding, a 70-year-old retired administrative assistant who is the precinct captain for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, said the Warren team has assigned a persuasion captain, a sign-in-captain, a math captain and an alignment captain to make sure no Warren supporters defect.Winning support in the realignment is more about understanding what other candidates' supporters care about than it is talking about what your candidate can do.""You listen to what their concerns are,"" said Lara McAdams, 52, an account executive for the Vizient health care company who is the precinct captain for Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind. ""Find out why they weren't in our camp and try to provide them the answers.""Caleb Short, a 33-year-old bartender who is the precinct captain for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, said he has learned tricks during the last 10 months of soliciting support about what works and what does not in trying to persuade people.""We'll just try to find common ground,"" Mr. Short said. ""A lot of candidates have adopted a lot of Bernie's original ideas.""The precinct captain for the entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Reid Mickunas, a 26-year-old who works at Bone-a-Patreat, a holistic pet supply store in Des Moines, said if the candidate failed to reach the 15 percent threshold, he would be inclined to move to back Mr. Sanders if there was not a way to make Mr. Yang viable on the second alignment. But he suggested that campaign staff members may want to strategize about splitting Mr. Yang's supporters among a number of other candidates.Twelve people will be elected from among the supporters of the viable candidates. They will become delegates to the Polk County Democratic Convention, the first step in the process by which delegates are chosen for the Democratic National Convention in July.The precinct will also divide its state delegate equivalents, a formula that allocates Iowa's 41 national convention delegates based on the number of Democratic votes in the 2016 and 2018 general elections.This is the number that will be displayed on cable news screens as the results come in. Johnston 2 has 3.36 state delegate equivalents out of 392 in Polk County, the state's largest county.The Iowa Democratic Party has traditionally reported only the delegate results, but under pressure from Mr. Sanders and his allies, the Democratic National Committee for the first time is requiring caucus states to also produce the raw number of people who support each candidate, from both the first and second alignments.The goal, Mr. Leffler said, is to be done with the evening within two hours.""It really needs to be done by 9 because people lose their patience,"" he said. ""You lose control if you don't keep things moving.""PhotographTwo precincts will gather at Johnston Middle School in Johnston for the Iowa caucus on Monday. The precinct captains are, clockwise from top left: Penny Schempp (for Joseph R. Biden Jr.); Lara McAdams (for Pete Buttigieg); Rhonda Gooding (for Elizabeth Warren); Gregory Davis (for Amy Klobuchar); Reid Mickunas (for Andrew Yang); and Caleb Short (for Bernie Sanders).

| Jump to first hitIn October 2015, Senator Bernie Sanders was whisked into Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s residence at the Naval Observatory for a breakfast of yogurt parfaits and caffeinated campaign advice from a vice president who had just announced his (temporary) retirement from presidential politics.The meeting, according to aides, lasted longer than expected, nearly two hours, with Mr. Biden discoursing on campaign strategy and a range of policy issues, and expressing admiration for a Sanders political operation that was waging an unexpectedly tough fight against Hillary Clinton.When Mr. Biden walked Mr. Sanders to his car, he clapped a hand on his shoulder and declared, ""Good luck, buddy!""The two septuagenarians will meet again Sunday night under much different circumstances for the first, and possibly final, one-on-one Democratic primary debate of 2020, in a near-empty CNN studio in Washington selected to replace an Arizona venue because of the coronavirus crisis. Depending on how the night goes, the confrontation could be either a swan song for Mr. Sanders, who has suffered a string of crushing primary defeats this month, or a chance for the onetime front-runner to reassert his rationale for extending the contest.Mr. Sanders, speaking after last week's losses in Michigan and three other states, telegraphed his intention to press Mr. Biden hard on health care, climate change and income inequality. Yet the actions of both men in the aftermath of Tuesday's primaries -- Mr. Biden set out a welcome mat for his rival rather than pressuring him to quit, and Mr. Sanders outlined tough terms for an eventual détente -- also shed light on a personal relationship that has remained sturdy, amicable and functional, a far cry from the acrimony that defined Mr. Sanders's relationship with Mrs. Clinton after their bitter duel four years ago.This no-frills personal connection, aides to both men say, could become an important factor in quickly uniting the party to confront President Trump, despite the wide policy gulf between the moderate Mr. Biden and the progressive Mr. Sanders.""I think both men know where this is likely going, and they both know how to approach one another,"" said David Axelrod, a longtime adviser to President Barack Obama who worked closely with Mr. Biden in the White House. ""Sanders, it seems to me, is a guy who wants to land the plane, and is asking Biden to show him some lights from the ground. There's nothing personal standing in the way of them getting together.""Mr. Sanders overlapped with Mr. Biden in the Senate for just two years, from January 2007, after his election, until Mr. Biden's ascent to the vice presidency in 2009. Mr. Biden was not around all that much. Then a senator from Delaware and chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he spent much of 2007 prepping for his unsuccessful presidential campaign, the latter part of 2008 running with Mr. Obama and the rest of the time focusing on committee work.""They basically had zero interaction, but I can't recall Bernie ever saying a bad word about Biden, or vice versa,"" said David Krone, chief of staff to Harry Reid, the former Democratic Senate majority leader from Nevada, who was close to Mr. Sanders.The two men have sparred, but not savaged each other, in previous debates. Mr. Biden recently told a person in his orbit that he thinks Mr. Sanders, while lacking an understanding of foreign policy, ""is basically a good guy."" One longtime Biden staff member summed up the former vice president's view in Baby Boomer cultural terms: In the mid-1960s, when both men were in college, Mr. Biden was a square, striving, law-school-bound ex-jock who would have seen Mr. Sanders as a noisy, strident, scraggly but basically benign campus archetype -- ""the hippie.""Mr. Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, has privately praised Mr. Biden as one of the few establishment senators to make him feel at home during his first few months in the Senate. (Mr. Obama, by contrast, later suggested in a memoir that Mr. Biden behaved a little arrogantly when he first arrived in 2005).But Mr. Sanders has not been shy about highlighting their policy differences over the years, especially his opposition to the Biden-backed bailout of financial firms during the 2008 financial crisis and Mr. Biden's initial support for the war in Iraq.In brief remarks after his Super Tuesday defeats, Mr. Sanders slammed Mr. Biden on Iraq and on his support for ""disastrous trade agreements"" that he said had cost millions of jobs. ""You cannot beat Trump with the same old, same old kind of politics,"" he added. In subsequent days, he attacked Mr. Biden's record on abortion, same-sex marriage and the former ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy.Mr. Sanders's aggressive approach has, at times, angered Mr. Biden, who felt that Mr. Sanders had not acted quickly enough to muzzle supporters who posted racist and sexist attacks on two female officials of a Nevada union for opposing Mr. Sanders's signature ""Medicare for All"" plan in February. ""Disown them, flat disown them,"" Mr. Biden told an interviewer at the time. ""It's outrageous.""But Mr. Sanders, ever the ideology-impelled candidate, has taken pains not to personalize the fight.He has reiterated his belief that Mr. Biden can beat Mr. Trump and tempered his criticism on the trail, saying that ""Joe is a decent guy"" and referring to the former vice president as ""my friend.""Privately, he has vented his disgust over Mr. Trump's attempts to make a campaign issue of the business activities of Mr. Biden's son Hunter. Mr. Sanders has expressed his sympathy to the former vice president directly during joint appearances and to his own staff, people close to both men said.He has also pushed back on the perception, leveled by many former opponents, that he has tacitly encouraged supporters to scorch them by proxy. In January, he sought to distance himself from Zephyr Teachout, an ally from New York, who published an op-ed during the impeachment proceedings that accused Mr. Biden of contributing to a ""transactional, grossly corrupt"" political culture by not blocking Hunter Biden from joining the board of an energy company in Ukraine.""It is absolutely not my view that Joe is corrupt in any way,"" Mr. Sanders said, and then offered a fuller apology to Mr. Biden directly when the two marched in a Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. commemoration in South Carolina, according to a Biden aide.""Thanks for acknowledging this, Bernie,"" Mr. Biden replied on Twitter. ""Let's all keep our focus on making Donald Trump a one-term president.""The subtext of the Biden-Sanders relationship is the former vice president's belief that he could have limited Mr. Trump to zero terms had he, and not Mrs. Clinton, been the Democratic nominee in 2016.In that regard, Mr. Biden -- who waited for Mr. Obama to endorse Mrs. Clinton in June 2016 before following suit -- viewed Mr. Sanders as something of a stand-in for himself, according to a half-dozen people in his orbit. As the primaries dragged on, that feeling grew, and Mr. Biden became increasingly resentful of the full-court pressure to sit out the race that had been applied by Mr. Obama's top advisers, at the president's behest, according to several current and former advisers to Mr. Biden and Mr. Obama.That lingering sense of grievance is one of the things that this time around motivate Mr. Biden, whose once avuncular, now grand-avuncular, demeanor masks a fierce competitive streak. He is also known to have a hair-trigger temper -- which was on four-letter display last week when a construction worker in Michigan accused him of trying to confiscate his guns.And while Mr. Sanders is widely expected to be the aggressor at the debate, it is just as likely that Mr. Biden, who is feeling confident, will be the candidate who raises his voice the loudest on Sunday night, according to people who have worked with him over the years.""Bernie, I think, knows that he has to strike a balance,"" added Mr. Axelrod, who helped prepare Mr. Biden for his high-stakes vice-presidential debate with Paul D. Ryan in 2012. ""But Biden is the one who really needs to shorten his horns to keep the tone of this thing positive.""Sydney Ember contributed reporting.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitThe endorsement by the longtime civil rights activist and former presidential candidate came as Mr. Sanders hopes to rally black voters in Michigan's crucial primary election.GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for president on Sunday, offering support that the senator and his team hope will rally black voters to their side ahead of a make-or-break Democratic primary race in Michigan.""With the exception of Native Americans, African-Americans are the people who are most behind socially and economically in the United States, and our needs are not moderate,"" Mr. Jackson, a longtime civil rights activist and presidential candidate in 1984 and 1988, said in a statement. ""A people far behind cannot catch up choosing the most moderate path.""""The Biden campaign has not reached out to me or asked for my support,"" he added. ""The Sanders campaign has, and they responded to the issues I raised.""Speaking before thousand of voters gathered in this Western Michigan city, Mr. Sanders lavished praise on Mr. Jackson, citing his insurgent bid for the White House in 1988, when he became a leading candidate before ultimately losing to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts.""It is one of the honors of my life to be supported by a man who has put his life on the line for the last 50 years fighting for justice,"" he told a largely white crowd of thousands gathered for an outdoor rally. ""Everything that Jesse Jackson said is what this campaign is about.""Mr. Sanders has cast his two presidential campaigns in the lineage of Mr. Jackson's 1988 presidential bid, telling advisers in 2015 that he hoped to model his 2016 operation after that effort. Political contemporaries, the two septuagenarian liberal activists are longtime allies: In 1988, Mr. Sanders, then the mayor of Burlington, Vt., was slapped by an ""irate citizen"" after supporting Mr. Jackson in the state's caucuses.Michigan's caucuses that year marked a high point for Mr. Jackson's campaign. He beat Mr. Dukakis in the state by building support among black voters and liberal white caucusgoers -- a similar coalition to the one Mr. Sanders hopes to rally when the state votes in its primary on Tuesday.Mr. Sanders hopes that by beating former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in this Midwestern state, he can reclaim ground in the presidential race after losing a majority of states on Super Tuesday largely on the weakness of his support among black voters. Michigan has emerged as a pivotal moment for his campaign, as the race moves into a series of delegate-rich primaries in Southern and Rust Belt states that are expected to be less favorable ground for Mr. Sanders.Yet as he has campaigned across the state, he has drawn overwhelmingly white audiences, raising questions about whether his effort is breaking through with black voters who make up a significant share of the primary electorate. At a Saturday night town-hall-style event in Flint, Mr. Sanders largely ceded the stage to African-American activists who attacked Mr. Biden's record on criminal justice and on housing policies that they argue devastated communities of color in places like that predominantly black city.""We are going to do everything humanly possible to wipe out all forms of discrimination in the country,"" said Mr. Sanders, painting his campaign as a continuation of the ""rainbow coalition"" coined by Mr. Jackson. ""We are sick and tired of systemic racism in America.""In Ann Arbor on Sunday evening, Mr. Sanders was introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who said voters on Tuesday must vote to continue the liberal movement started by Mr. Jackson in 1984.""A rainbow coalition to fight for racial justice, for economic justice, for human rights and politics like that has always been deemed unelectable in this country,"" she told more than 10,000 people gathered on the campus of the University of Michigan. ""Michigan and Ann Arbor, on Tuesday this is our moment.""Mr. Sanders said the young, liberal congresswoman represented the ""arc of justice"" along with Mr. Jackson.As Mr. Sanders traveled across Michigan, Mr. Biden was also picking up support from prominent black officials. Senator Kamala Harris of California endorsed him on Sunday morning, becoming the latest of his former rivals for the Democratic nomination to get behind his presidential bid.Mr. Biden campaigned on Sunday in Mississippi, which will also vote on Tuesday. In the morning, he attended services at New Hope Baptist Church, a black church in Jackson. The state's only Democrat in Congress, Representative Bennie Thompson, who endorsed Mr. Biden last week, introduced him as ""the comeback kid.""Speaking to churchgoers, Mr. Biden gave credit to black voters, who powered him to victory in South Carolina and were a key source of support for him on Super Tuesday as well. ""If I'm the comeback kid,"" he said, ""there's only one reason I've come back: the African-American community all around the country.""Later, Mr. Biden held a rally in a gym at Tougaloo College, a historically black school in Jackson. He was joined by a onetime rival for the Democratic nomination, former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, who endorsed him on Friday, as well as the actress Vivica A. Fox.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from Jackson, Miss.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting from Jackson, Miss.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders of Vermont with the Rev.

| Jump to first hitIt has to do with the 2016 presidential contest between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, and Democrats' concerns about transparency.DES MOINES -- You're probably wondering how we ended up in this situation. It's the morning after the Iowa caucuses. We were promised four sets of results, and we didn't even get one.Blame 2016.A lot of reasons contributed to the fiasco on Monday, chiefly a breakdown of the process by which caucus leaders were supposed to report results to the Iowa Democratic Party.But one factor was baked into that process from almost the moment the caucuses ended four years ago.Historically, the party had focused on highlighting only one caucus result: the number of delegates each candidate had earned for the state convention. The winner of the Iowa caucuses was the person who earned the most state delegates, which translate into national delegates, which determine the nomination. This year, however, the state party chose to release four results from the caucuses.That's because in 2016, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton edged out Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the state delegate count by a quarter of a percentage point, earning roughly 700 to Mr. Sanders's 697. That meant 23 national delegates for Mrs. Clinton and 21 for Mr. Sanders -- an inconsequential difference between the two rivals.Mr. Sanders's 2016 campaign fought for an audit in Iowa -- comparing the reported results with the papers on which caucus leaders had recorded voters' preferences -- and accused the state Democratic Party of a lack of transparency.Largely because of Mr. Sanders's objections, the party decided to release additional numbers in 2020 that it had always logged but never made public: the number of supporters each candidate had in the first round of voting and the number he or she had in the second round, after nonviable candidates were eliminated and caucusgoers realigned.The idea was that all this data would provide a fuller picture of each candidate's strength.Under the old reporting system, for instance, a candidate who received 14 percent support -- just below the threshold for earning delegates -- would be indistinguishable from a candidate who received 1 percent support. But in the raw vote totals, they could get credit for the support they had in the first round -- and in a state where perceptions of strength and political momentum matter much more than delegates, that sort of credit can be crucial.So the caucuses go: They have always been more about creating momentum (or the perception of it) for candidates than about the number of delegates they award. Iowa's contribution to a candidate's total number of delegates is trivial. But the state's contribution to popular conceptions of political viability is immense.What matters most is how voters across the country view the outcome in Iowa. Having four sets of results from the 2020 caucuses, as opposed to one set of results in 2016, was widely seen as possibly providing more opportunities for candidates to cite the most favorable set of data as evidence of political momentum.Another consideration for Mr. Sanders in 2016 was that, because of the realignment process and the arcane rules by which delegates are allocated, it was possible that he might have actually received more support than Mrs. Clinton in the first round's raw vote. But because only the delegate count was released, there was no way to know.Once the results from Monday night are confirmed and released, we will indeed have a more complete map of how the candidates did than we have in any previous election cycle. But the need to report four sets of results instead of just one was a major factor in the debacle, as the state party struggled with what it called ""inconsistencies"" in all that data.PhotographPeople arrived to caucus at Johnston Middle School in the suburbs of Des Moines on Monday.

| Jump to first hit""As we enter the moment in this campaign where we come down to a two-person race, I think it important for us to differentiate our records, and I intend to do that,"" Mr. Sanders said.DETROIT -- Calibrating his approach for a tough head-to-head primary matchup in a year when many Democratic voters want to put up a united front, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Friday renewed his attacks on former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s record on trade while also conceding that Mr. Biden could defeat President Trump.In Michigan, where the Sanders campaign is running a TV ad featuring an autoworker who says his community has been ""decimated"" by free trade deals, Mr. Sanders attacked Mr. Biden for his support of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s.""Joe Biden and I have a very serious disagreement with regards to NAFTA,"" Mr. Sanders said at a round table he convened of workers, union leaders and economists in Detroit before a rally attended by thousands. ""Just last year -- I'm not talking about 20 years ago -- Joe said that voting for NAFTA, quote, was not a mistake, end of quote, and a few years before that he called NAFTA a success,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""Joe, you're wrong. NAFTA was not a success. Voting for it was a big, big mistake.""As a long line of mostly young supporters filed into a downtown convention center, organizers called out for any union members to identify themselves. After major disappointments on Super Tuesday, Mr. Sanders is hoping for a comeback next Tuesday as six states go to the polls, none more crucial for him than Michigan, the first of several Midwestern industrial states to vote in the next two weeks. Four years ago, he pulled off one of the biggest surprises of his first presidential campaign when he upset Hillary Clinton in Michigan.""We are in the midst of a very, very difficult primary process,"" Mr. Sanders told reporters before taking the stage at his rally. ""Come Tuesday, maybe Michigan is the most important state.""Asked about Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's endorsement of Mr. Biden on Thursday, Mr. Sanders sounded miffed. ""Well, that wasn't her thoughts when I came here to help her get elected, as a matter of fact,"" he said.Speaking earlier on Friday with reporters in Phoenix, Mr. Sanders also condemned Mr. Biden's votes as a senator on trade agreements, while brandishing new attacks over Mr. Biden's record on federal funding for abortions, same-sex marriage and the former ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy.But in a sign of the careful approach both candidates are taking while seeking to draw distinctions between their campaigns, Mr. Sanders reiterated multiple times that he would support Mr. Biden if he eventually won the presidential nomination, and, pressed by a reporter, said he believed Mr. Biden could beat Mr. Trump in November.""I think we are the stronger campaign to defeat Donald Trump, but you have not heard me say that I think that Biden cannot defeat Trump,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""I will certainly do everything I can if he is the nominee.""Speaking by phone to attendees at a fund-raiser in Bethesda, Md., on Friday night, Mr. Biden said: ""What we can't let happen is let this primary become a negative blood bath. I know I'm going to get a lot of suggestions on how to respond to what I suspect will be an increasingly negative campaign that the Bernie Brothers will run. But we can't tear this party apart and re-elect Trump.""The Biden campaign sent one of its most high-profile new surrogates to Michigan, Senator Amy Klobuchar, but she was far less visible than Mr. Sanders. She toured the backstage areas of an MGM Grand hotel and casino with union leaders, but the event was off-limits to out-of-town reporters.Mr. Biden plans to visit Michigan on Monday, but Mr. Sanders -- who canceled an appearance in Mississippi -- intends to campaign intensely in the state, visiting Dearborn, Flint, Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor.After other major candidates quit the Democratic primary race this week, Mr. Sanders has relentlessly and repeatedly contrasted himself with Mr. Biden.""As we enter the moment in this campaign where we come down to a two-person race, I think it important for us to differentiate our records, and I intend to do that,"" Mr. Sanders said in Phoenix.""Joe has been around for a long time; so have I. And I think people would want to take a look at those records,"" he added. ""All I can tell you, whether it's Iraq, whether it's DOMA, whether it's 'don't ask, don't tell' -- those were difficult votes. I was there, on the right side of history, and my friend Joe Biden was not.""He was referring to the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage as a union between a man and a woman, and the policy that prohibited openly gay people from serving in the military.As a senator, Mr. Biden supported a broad defense bill in 1993 that included the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy, but also voted for a failed amendment that would have removed the policy from that bill. He also voted for the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996.But as vice president, he said in an interview on ""Meet the Press"" in 2012 that he was ""absolutely comfortable"" with same-sex marriage, a stance that was ahead of the Obama White House's policy at the time.Mr. Sanders also offered a fresh critique on Friday of Mr. Biden's record on the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for most abortions. Until June of last year, Mr. Biden had supported the measure, which critics say disproportionately affects poor women and women of color. He reversed his position after sustaining attacks early in his campaign.""At a time when women are under severe political assault,"" Mr. Sanders said, ""I think people all over this country -- women and men -- are going to look at the record of which candidate has been consistent and strong in terms of defending a woman's right to choose. On this issue, Joe Biden repeatedly voted for the Hyde Amendment.""Mr. Sanders has watched his delegate lead evaporate after the first three nominating contests as Mr. Biden racked up wins in South Carolina and several Super Tuesday states, including some that Mr. Sanders had hoped would wind up in his column.Moving forward, the two candidates will essentially go head-to-head next week in six states including Michigan, which will present one of their first tests in a major general-election swing state.On Friday, Mr. Sanders, who is Jewish, also addressed an episode at a rally for his campaign in Phoenix on Thursday, when a man in the crowd unfurled a flag bearing a swastika before he was removed.""It is horrific,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""It is beyond disgusting to see that in the United States of America there are people who would show the emblem of Hitler and Nazism. And I was shocked to learn about that.""Separately, Mr. Sanders acknowledged that his team had communicated with the federal authorities about the possibility of Secret Service protection for him. Some Democratic lawmakers have called for added security after Mr. Biden's Super Tuesday address was disrupted by protesters who were able to gain access to the stage.Trip Gabriel reported from Detroit, and Matt Stevens from New York.

| Jump to first hitIn a triumph for progressives, Ms. Newman defeated longtime Representative Dan Lipinski, a conservative Democrat, in an Illinois primary.After a tough few months for left-wing Democrats, a bright spot emerged in Tuesday night's primary in Illinois. Marie Newman, a progressive challenger backed by activist groups, defeated Representative Dan Lipinski in a House primary, putting her on the path to be the latest ""Justice Democrat"" in Congress, along with household names like Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.Mr. Lipinski, an eight-term incumbent who represents Illinois' Third Congressional District, has long held views that enraged the party's left. He vocally opposed abortion access, voted against the Affordable Care Act, and refused to endorse President Barack Obama in his 2012 re-election bid.In an interview with The New York Times, Ms. Newman described how she overcame Mr. Lipinski after narrowly losing to him in 2018; how the coronavirus pandemic affected the race, and why she believes she was successful in Illinois when Senator Bernie Sanders was not.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Could you give our national audience a sense of the contours of this race? It was often described as progressive vs. moderate, insider vs. outsider. Is that how you saw it?You know, this is the beginning of a new era in Illinois-3. For the last 38 years, the representative seat has been occupied by a member of the Lipinski family -- Dan's dad had it for 22 years and Dan's had it for the last 16 years. So nearly 40 years of the Lipinski family in that seat. And they're members of the Chicago machine.So what this does is put the district in alignment with its representatives. For many years, Dan was one of the most conservative members of the Democratic Party bar none -- if not the most. Our district is a deeply blue Democratic district, so I ran on the platform that I'm a real Democrat with a real plan. And it's kind of that simple.I believe in working families, health care for all, and making sure that we have a livable wage.What does that mean, ""the Chicago machine""? And also, if he was so out of touch with voters, why did it take so long to change? Obviously you ran last time and were unsuccessful.The Chicago machine is just like any other big political machine, and has been around on the Southwest Side of the city for decades, if not a century. And it's a protective, small group of politicians that protects incumbents.My campaign really values the work of each of the communities. We've had 318 meet and greets since we started our campaign a year ago. And we've successfully built a full platform based on what they want: transforming immigration policy, health care for all, making sure that the economy works for everybody with higher wages, paid leave, universal child care.Your opponent was famously anti-abortion and against Obamacare. Was your victory an embrace of your progressive agenda, or is this a case of a kind of out-of-step Democrat just losing?From most people's perspective, yes, he was not a Democrat. He voted against overtime. He voted against Obamacare. He voted against the Dream Act in 2010. It just was clear: He was not only out of step with the district, but really out of step with the Democratic platform.So that is really kind of the No. 1 reason that I ran, and why I won.Bernie Sanders endorsed you. How do you compare your results with his throughout the state? He ran far behind you. What did you do that the progressive on the national ticket did not?You know, I've been endorsed by Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren, Jan Schakowsky, six other members of Congress, a governor, and then 40 local politicians. I think that I'm a blend of the entire party.Everyone likes to talk about the party in terms of two or three wings. I think there's probably 50 wings, if we're all being honest with one another. We've always been a mosaic and where we all connect is around working families and workers.For me, everything is about alignment. You have to be in alignment with your district. That's the only reason you should run, and that's the only reason you should be elected. If you're in alignment with your district, it really doesn't matter what is happening nationally.But you were backed by Justice Democrats, the national group that has been playing up that distinction between progressives and moderates. You did seem to benefit from your association with that national fight.I think we benefited from it because there are people in the district that appreciate that I have a strong environmental record. I want to address the climate crisis. I believe in the objectives of the Green New Deal. I believe in ""Medicare for all."" I believe in universal child care, and making sure that we protect workers' rights and that we protect and empower unions.The media loves a bucket and a label, but in reality it's about what the district wants and needs. And if it happens to be that all of the perspectives in the party are embracing my platform, I am thrilled!But how would you define yourself? Ideologically.Again, I don't think it's super important, but I certainly have progressive values. I put the people in my district first. And so, I would probably say that I'm a progressive.How did the coronavirus pandemic affect the last couple of weeks in the campaign?It became very clear to me and my team that we needed to immediately change the campaign. And inside of 12 hours, we took a full on, get-out-the-vote canvassing program, brought it in-house, and brought it to a virtual capacity. They took 1,200 volunteer shifts and moved them to phones, texting and online.Illinois faced some criticism for going through with its election as other states are opting to move theirs. What did you think of that decision? Were folks safe yesterday?I saw people being absolutely vigilant, making sure not only that everything was wiped down, but everybody was safe distancing. I think everyone did the best we could.The governor and the mayor of Chicago made that decision in combination with amazing health experts that are world renowned. So I defer to the governor and the mayor on their decisions.PhotographMarie Newman's team in Illinois' Third Congressional District switched to a virtual get-out-the-vote program before the primary.

| Jump to first hitMr. Sanders said he was not dropping out, but aides said he recognized time was running short. He listed a series of policy items in what could be seen as a wish list of concessions he would want.BURLINGTON, Vt. -- Senator Bernie Sanders on Wednesday made a defiant case for his liberal policy agenda despite suffering big losses in the Democratic primaries this week, saying he planned to continue his bid for the presidency. But he acknowledged that he was ""losing the debate over electability"" to his rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.Mr. Sanders vowed to participate in the scheduled debate on Sunday, and asserted that ""a strong majority"" of Democrats supported his progressive causes, even as his path to the nomination looks increasingly narrow. Still, as he addressed reporters at an afternoon news conference in Burlington, he did not directly attack Mr. Biden or vow to carry his fight to the end, instead signaling he was ready for a de-escalation in their rivalry.In one striking sequence that highlighted his ideological resolve, Mr. Sanders ticked off a list of policy issues and challenged Mr. Biden to explain to the American people how he would address them -- a series of questions that could be seen as an opening gambit for a list of concessions he would seek from Mr. Biden if he were to drop out of the race.""He's pivoting to ensure that the issues that he has built his political career around continue to be front and center in the political dialogue,"" said Nick Carter, who served as political outreach director for the 2016 Sanders campaign. ""I also think he has top of mind ensuring his supporters and those unenthusiastic about a Biden candidacy -- 'don't call it a day.""'Mr. Sanders's decision to continue thrusts the race into a delicate new phase, with Mr. Biden, a moderate, holding a clear path to the nomination but Mr. Sanders wielding the support of the party's liberal wing. How they navigate their differences to try to unite the competing factions will go a long way toward determining whether Democrats assemble a coalition powerful enough to dethrone President Trump in the fall.The race has already been upended by the crisis surrounding the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced both candidates to curtail appearances before big crowds and to plan for a debate on Sunday without a live audience. The Biden campaign announced Wednesday it was canceling two upcoming events in Illinois and Florida. Mr. Sanders has yet to officially announce any public events, but his campaign is planning virtual events such as tele-town halls and live-streamed addresses.Mr. Sanders did not consider dropping out after Tuesday's losses, according to people familiar with his thinking, but he was stunned by how severe they were and now recognizes he needs to reassess his path forward. Mr. Biden scored victories in four states, including Michigan, where Mr. Sanders had counted on a victory to revive his candidacy.In recent days, Mr. Sanders has told people that the campaign is running out of time to recapture its momentum or maintain sufficient leverage to demand the kinds of sweeping progressive policy concessions from Mr. Biden he outlined on Wednesday.Nine times during his remarks, Mr. Sanders cited an issue central to his progressive agenda and asked Mr. Biden, ""What are you going to do?"" -- listing systemic problems related to topics like health care and income inequality.Mr. Sanders is also still fighting to win, some of his aides said, insisting there were more opportunities to accumulate delegates in states like Oregon and Wisconsin, which would require Mr. Sanders to stay in the race into late April and May.But one longtime Sanders confidant, Larry Cohen, also acknowledged the challenges ahead in states like Florida and Ohio, which vote next week, and the daunting coalition of white and African-American voters Mr. Biden has put together. Mr. Cohen, the chairman of Our Revolution, the Sanders-aligned political organization, said the goal was now as much about accruing delegates to use as leverage in negotiations with Mr. Biden as it was an effort to win the nomination.""Every delegate is critical to our agenda and discussions with Joe Biden,"" Mr. Cohen said from Florida, where he met Wednesday with Our Revolution members who are seeking delegate slots at the Democratic National Convention to help Mr. Sanders. Of Mr. Sanders's supporters, Mr. Cohen said, ""Their only voice is to be elected delegate.""Mr. Sanders now finds himself in an awkward position, pressing on despite long odds even as he insists he wants above all for a Democrat to beat Mr. Trump in November. For months, he has been reluctant to attack Mr. Biden directly, which resulted in inconsistent messaging: At times, he and his campaign would attack Mr. Biden, only to pull back and return to his central policy message of transformational change.After Super Tuesday and into this week, some allies expressed frustration, anxious that even if Mr. Sanders were to mount a comeback, it would be too late. On Tuesday night, his most prominent surrogate, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, told viewers on her Instagram live stream that the election results were a setback for the progressive movement.Mr. Sanders has also made it clear that he is aware he cannot continue to campaign indefinitely and defiantly, as he did against Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to former aides and people currently in his orbit.And for all of the criticism he has leveled at Mr. Biden recently, Mr. Sanders feels far more positively in a personal way toward Mr. Biden than he did toward Mrs. Clinton, which could make a reconciliation less contentious, according to a veteran of the last campaign. This person and others briefed on Mr. Sanders's campaign plans insisted on anonymity in order to discuss internal deliberations.Over the past several months, Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, has opened up a line of communication with one of Mr. Biden's top political aides, Anita Dunn. Although the back-channel setup has mostly been used to arrange logistics -- they hashed out an agreement this week to bar a live audience from Sunday's debate -- it is likely to be the main conduit for talks about political matters, according to people on both campaigns.With over half the delegates still to be allocated, aides to Mr. Sanders said they saw more fertile terrain in the coming weeks. They point out that Mr. Sanders narrowly lost Illinois four years ago and see strength in Wisconsin and Puerto Rico. Georgia, with its heavily black electorate, will most likely go to Mr. Biden, who currently leads Mr. Sanders in delegates, 864 to 710, with delegates still to be counted.Mr. Sanders also has about $9 million worth of ads booked through March 17, including a $2 million buy this week.Aides say Mr. Sanders is particularly motivated to participate in the debate on Sunday in Phoenix because he views it as his first and possibly last opportunity to face Mr. Biden one on one and hold him accountable for his record, while trumpeting his own record in contrast.""Donald Trump must be defeated, and I will do everything in my power to make that happen,"" Mr. Sanders said on Wednesday. ""On Sunday night, in the first one-on-one debate of this campaign, the American people will have the opportunity to see which candidate is best positioned to accomplish that goal.""But the rest of his path forward is murky, especially as concerns about the coronavirus threaten to upend a signature facet of his campaign: Mr. Sanders's enormous rallies, where the enthusiasm and passion of his loyal base are on vivid display. It is unclear how he will marshal the energy he boasts about from behind a computer screen or over a telephone line.In his address Wednesday, Mr. Sanders spoke soberly about the signals voters had sent about Mr. Biden being more electable.""I cannot tell you how many people our campaign has spoken to who have said -- and I quote -- 'I like what your campaign stands for. I agree with what your campaign stands for. But I'm going to vote for Joe Biden because I think Joe is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump,""' he said.""Needless to say, I strongly disagree with that assertion, but that is what millions of Democrats and independents today believe.""Mr. Sanders watched the results come in on Tuesday night at his home with his wife, Jane, while aides gathered elsewhere. He did not make any public comments then.On Wednesday at his news conference, Mr. Sanders was cleareyed about the challenges ahead but also resolute about his strengths.""Last night obviously was not a good night for our campaign from a delegate point of view,"" Mr. Sanders said, as his wife looked on. But he asserted that he was ""winning the generational debate,"" saying that while Mr. Biden was appealing to older voters, he was drawing younger Americans, and that the party needed to build around the leaders of the future.""Today, I say to the Democratic establishment, in order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country, and you must speak to the issues of concern to them.""Sydney Ember and Reid Epstein reported from Burlington, Vt., and Glenn Thrush from Washington. Lisa Lerer contributed reporting from Washington and Nick Corasaniti and Alexander Burns from New York.PhotographPHOTO (A1); Senator Bernie Sanders in Burlington, Vt., on Wednesday.

| Jump to first hitIn tweets and an interview with Sean Hannity, the president mocked the former New York mayor who seems to be on his mind.WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- On many levels, President Trump's weekend -- full of golf, catered salmon and plenty of patriotic-themed evening wear -- could have been devised to offer relief and a sense of triumph to a president who spent the first month of an election year watching from the sidelines as the Senate debated his future.With his acquittal all but final, the president passed from table to table in the dining room of his golf club on Saturday quizzing his buddies on the 2020 election, at times lingering long enough to complain about his impeachment ordeal.""What a waste,"" the president told a group of supporters, according to one guest who had such an exchange with him. ""What a waste of time.""By Saturday night, the president was in a more celebratory mood when he greeted the band of supporters gathered at Mar-a-Lago, his private club.Under a large illustration that depicted him dressed as a football player, Mr. Trump regaled them with his latest approval ratings -- ""We just had our best poll numbers that we've ever had,"" he said to the group -- and walked into the dining room to Lee Greenwood's ""God Bless the U.S.A."" The song is played every time Mr. Trump takes the stage at one of his rallies, and Mr. Greenwood was performing it live for the special occasion.""As usual, our president scored another victory,"" Toni Kramer, the supporter who organized the party for him, said in an interview. ""He won the Super Bowl of Washington.""But that sense of celebration appeared to be fleeting as the evening went on and Mr. Trump's anger over impeachment, and his antipathy toward his possible 2020 election opponents -- in particular, Michael R. Bloomberg -- spilled into public view. There were more pressing matters at hand, including the global spread of the coronavirus and his State of the Union address on Tuesday, but he made little mention of them.Sunday night the president and Mr. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and a latecomer to the Democratic race who is not on the ballot in the Iowa caucuses on Monday, would face off in costly Super Bowl ads. But Mr. Trump, who seems to be increasingly fixated on Mr. Bloomberg and the fortune he is vowing to spend on the election, apparently could not wait.In a tweet sent just after midnight, Mr. Trump tried to implicate Mr. Bloomberg in a conspiracy theory he has used in an apparent attempt to sow divisions in the Democratic presidential field.""Many of the ads you are watching were paid for by Mini Mike Bloomberg,"" Mr. Trump said. ""He is going nowhere, just wasting his money, but he is getting the DNC to rig the election against Crazy Bernie, something they wouldn't do for @CoryBooker and others. They are doing it to Bernie again, 2016.""More tweets about Mr. Bloomberg followed, culminating in an interview with Sean Hannity, the Fox News personality and presidential confidant, that was taped on Saturday but aired three hours before the game.In the interview, the president reiterated a false claim he had sent in a late-night tweet: that Mr. Bloomberg had demanded a box to stand on should he participate in a Democratic candidates' debate.""You know, now he wants a box for the debates to stand on. O.K., it's O.K., there's nothing wrong,"" Mr. Trump said. ""You can be short. Why should he get a box to stand on, O.K.? He wants a box for the debates. Why should he be entitled to that? Really. Does that mean everyone else gets a box?""Mr. Bloomberg's campaign spokeswoman, Julie Wood, did not hold anything back in her response. ""The president is lying,"" she said. ""He is a pathological liar who lies about everything: his fake hair, his obesity and his spray-on tan.""While he focused on Mr. Bloomberg, the president did not spare any of his Democratic rivals. He and Mr. Hannity played a lightning round where Mr. Hannity invited the president to say whatever came to mind about Democratic presidential candidates, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Mr. Trump falsely called Mr. Sanders a ""communist"" and claimed that he had been married in Russia.""I think of communism when I think of Bernie,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Didn't he get married in Moscow?""Mr. Sanders was married in Burlington, Vt., before traveling to the Soviet Union soon after, and the trip has been used as fodder by his critics as evidence that he has communist leanings.During his Fox sit-down, both Mr. Trump and his interviewer seemed more interested in allowing the president to focus on his grievances over impeachment and his re-election effort rather than elaborate on a global public health crisis.""It's been very unfair from the day I won,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Mostly it was unfair to my family.""He gave a comparatively cursory amount of attention to the spread of the coronavirus, which caused his administration to bar foreign nationals and Americans who had traveled to China recently from entering the United States.""We pretty much shut it down coming in from China,"" Mr. Trump said of the coronavirus. ""But we can't have thousands of people coming in who may have this problem, the coronavirus.""Mr. Trump summed it up this way: ""So we're going to see what happens. But we did shut it down, yes.""Mr. Trump was even less expansive when Mr. Hannity asked whether he had considered moving his State of the Union address, which is scheduled to take place before the Senate impeachment trial officially concludes on Wednesday. The president replied: ""No, I'm going to have it. It's going to be done. We're going to talk about the achievements that we've made.""""Nobody has made achievements like we've made,"" Mr. Trump said of his speech, ""so many different things.""As the game drew closer, the president appeared to once again redirect his focus -- this time to attend the annual Super Bowl watch party he holds at his West Palm Beach golf club. Mr. Trump watched a marching band play ""Born to Be Wild"" on the club's lawn, then went inside to watch the night's competitors -- and perhaps some football -- before departing to Washington.PhotographThe president boarding Air Force One to fly to Florida on Friday.

| Jump to first hitAn effort to encourage conservatives to participate in the state's open primary for Democrats is meant to show the process's flaws. Chaos, organizers said, would be a side benefit.By canceling this year's presidential primary, the Republican Party of South Carolina essentially endorsed a second term for President Trump, who handily won the state's electoral votes in 2016.But some conservative activists, eager to unearth any political advantage, are encouraging Republicans to vote this weekend anyway -- for a Democrat.If they can stomach it, backers said, Republicans should take advantage of South Carolina's open primary system, which allows voters to cast a ballot without registering with a party. Multiple organized efforts are underway, with one going so far as to quote-unquote endorse Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who state polls show is closely trailing former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.""We'd like to have a hand in helping the President by giving him an avowed socialist to face in November!"" the organizers of one of the groups, Trump 2-29, a reference to the date of Saturday's primary, wrote on its Facebook page. ""Haven't you waited a VERY long time to DO SOMETHING for President Trump??? Here ya go.""The organizers conceded that they relished the chance to roil Democrats, especially during a moment in the campaign when friction between the party's candidates has become especially acute.But they said they were motivated by a larger mission: For years, conservative activists have sought to close South Carolina's open primaries, and this election offered ideal circumstances for creating a live demonstration of the flaws they see in the system.""We were also looking for a way to get Democrats to support the cause of closing the primary,"" said Christopher Sullivan, a longtime critic of the open primary and leader of the Conservative Defense Fund, a small advocacy outfit in South Carolina. ""And this is a way of showing them what's good for the goose is good for the gander.""Charges of ""party raiding,"" as the tactic is known, have been leveled repeatedly over the years from both parties, in presidential races as well as down-ballot statewide legislative contests. Still, experts said, evidence of these efforts achieving any sort of significant influence is hard to find.Organizers acknowledged on Tuesday that it was impossible to tell whether this go-round would be any different. ""We're just three volunteers with a Facebook page,"" said Karen Martin, an organizer of the Trump 2-29 group. ""It's hard to gauge the impact other than anecdotally.""Even so, one Democratic lawmaker has proposed legislation meant to curtail party raiding.Standing on the floor of the State Senate this month, Marlon E. Kimpson, a Democrat from Charleston who has endorsed Mr. Biden, read from an article published by The Post and Courier, the newspaper in Charleston, S.C., that described a scheme by ""a group of prominent Upstate Republicans"" to help Mr. Sanders in the primary.""I want to send a message to all Republicans seeking to interfere with the Democratic presidential primary,"" Mr. Kimpson said as he introduced legislation that would force those who cast ballots in this year's presidential primary to do so again for the same party in four years. ""If you vote in the Democratic primary, you're stuck with the Democratic Party until the next presidential election. You'll be with us for a while.""South Carolina is one of 15 states with an open primary, allowing people to vote regardless of party affiliation. In other states, there have been efforts have been underway in other states to persuade officials to switch to an open primary, arguing that they encourage participation, particularly with independent voters.Today, those looking to close the system contend that the open primary has stood in the way of lawmakers pursuing an even more conservative agenda; they believe that Democrats have interfered and thwarted the more right-wing candidates. (Experts said they have found little documented evidence of this, noting that, in many legislative races, candidates often do not face primary opposition.)""It is hammering at changing the way we conduct our elections in order for parties to pick their own nominees without interference,"" said Mr. Sullivan, who is leading an effort called Operation Chaos 2020, its name borrowed from a campaign led by the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh to sway the Democratic primary race between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in 2008 in states like South Carolina and Pennsylvania.Accusations of party raiding were also raised in the G.O.P. primary in Michigan in 2012 and in the Republican race in South Carolina in 2000.Ms. Martin said a closed primary was a way of ""infusing integrity back into the political process,"" arguing that including those not aligned with the party would taint it. Stacy Shea, another organizer of Trump 2-29, added, ""Our focus, quite frankly, was to give Democrats a taste of their own medicine when it comes to crossing over.""The election in South Carolina this year -- without a G.O.P. primary for Republicans to participate in and amid the growing Democratic angst -- created an opening for conservative activists like Ms. Martin. ""There is so much pressure on them,"" she said of the Democrats. ""It was the perfect time to apply a little more pressure.""Republican officials in South Carolina have kept their distance from the effort. Hope Walker, the executive director of the South Carolina G.O.P., said in a statement that the party had ""no official stand on this matter.""""We do not like Democrats meddling in our primaries,"" she said, ""and we certainly do not encourage the same thing from Republican voters.""Trav Robertson Jr., the chairman of the state's Democratic Party, has expressed little concern. ""As a state with an open primary system, anyone is free to take part in the democratic process that we champion,"" Mr. Robertson said.Yet some conservatives worried what a vote for the opposition party might mean. One of the queries posed on the frequently asked questions page of Operation Chaos's website is ""Won't I be tarred forever as a Democrat?""The reply: ""No. Operation Chaos 2020 is a certified conservative program and since there is no corresponding Republican primary, you are excused.""Operation Chaos has not called for voting for Mr. Sanders. In fact, Mr. Sullivan said he might vote for Mr. Biden. But the Trump 2-29 effort has encouraged Republicans to support Mr. Sanders because of his increased strength in the polls.""We didn't pick Bernie because he's Bernie, because he's the weakest or because he's a socialist,"" Ms. Martin said. ""We picked him because of the math.""Ms. Shea acknowledged the worries she has heard from some unsettled by the prospect of a Sanders presidency and any effort their voting this weekend might contribute to his ascendance.""I know there's a healthy dose of fear -- 'if Bernie wins, it's your fault,""' Ms. Shea said, but she has tried to assuage that anxiety. ""Heavens to Betsy, we're not that powerful.""PhotographVoters in rural South Carolina in 2016. The state has an open primary that some Republicans plan to take advantage of on Saturday.

| Jump to first hitA handful of rogue electoral votes, if allowed, could tip the next presidential election.The Supreme Court agreed Friday to decide whether members of the Electoral College may cast their votes for presidential candidates other than the ones they had pledged to support.The court's decision to settle the question in its current term, which ends in June, allows it to act without knowing which candidate in the 2020 election could benefit from its ruling.Every four years, weeks after Election Day, the members of the Electoral College cast the actual votes for president. Many states have laws requiring electors to pledge that they will support the winner of the state's popular vote, but electors occasionally go rogue.The votes of only 10 ""faithless electors"" could have changed the outcomes in five of the previous 58 presidential elections. In the 2000 election, for instance, George W. Bush beat Al Gore by five electoral votes.Recent court decisions have come to opposite conclusions about whether electors may disregard their pledges.In May, the Washington State Supreme Court upheld fines of $1,000 on three Democratic electors who had cast their electoral votes in 2016 for Colin L. Powell rather than for Hillary Clinton. The majority said the Constitution allows states to insist that electors vote for their parties' candidates.In dissent, Justice Steven C. González disagreed. ""The Constitution provides the state only with the power to appoint,"" he wrote, ""leaving the electors with the discretion to vote their conscience.""The electors in the Washington case urged the United States Supreme Court to act quickly to hear their appeal, Chiafalo v. Washington, No. 19-465. ""This case permits the court to issue a decision outside of the white-hot scrutiny of a contested presidential election,"" their petition said.In August, the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, rejected the Washington State Supreme Court's reasoning. It said that Colorado had been wrong to discard a vote from a Democratic elector who had wanted to cast a ballot for Gov. John Kasich of Ohio.""Electors, once appointed, are free to vote as they choose,"" Judge Carolyn B. McHugh wrote for the majority of a divided three-judge panel. ""While the Constitution grants the states plenary power to appoint their electors, it does not provide the states the power to interfere once voting begins, to remove an elector, to direct the other electors to disregard the removed elector's vote or to appoint a new elector to cast a replacement vote.""In a petition seeking Supreme Court review in the case, Colorado Department of State v. Baca, No. 19-518, lawyers for Colorado wrote that ""states may require electors to vote consistent with the state's popular vote."" The appeals court's decision, the petition said, threatens ""to undermine the democratic principles underpinning over two centuries of electing United States presidents.""The framers of the Constitution seemed to contemplate that electors would use independent judgment, the Supreme Court has said. ""Doubtless it was supposed that the electors would exercise a reasonable independence and fair judgment in the selection of the chief executive,"" Chief Justice Melville Fuller wrote in an 1892 Supreme Court decision. Over time, he added, ""the original expectation may be said to have been frustrated.""Alexander Hamilton described the original expectation in the Federalist Papers. ""Men chosen by the people for the special purpose"" of selecting the president, he wrote, ""will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations.""Judge McHugh of the 10th Circuit said the text of the Constitution also supports elector independence. The words of the relevant provisions, including ""elector,"" ""vote"" and ""ballot,"" she wrote, ""have a common theme: They all imply the right to make a choice or voice an individual opinion.""On election night in 2016, the electoral vote was expected to be 306 for Donald J. Trump and 232 for Mrs. Clinton. In the end, though, it was 304 to 227.Seven electors succeeded in voting for other candidates. A fourth Democratic elector in Washington State voted for Faith Spotted Eagle, a Native American tribal leader and prominent opponent of the Keystone XL pipeline, and a Democratic elector in Hawaii voted for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. Republican electors in Texas voted for Mr. Kasich and Ron Paul, a former representative of Texas.Three more Democratic electors -- in Colorado, Maine and Minnesota -- tried to vote for candidates other than Mrs. Clinton. Two were replaced, and a third eventually chose her.The number of faithless votes was the largest in history, but the phenomenon was not particularly unusual. ""Congress has accepted the vote of every vote contrary to a pledge or expectation in the nation's history that has been transmitted to it -- a total of more than 150 votes across 20 different elections from 1796 to 2016,"" the petition in the Washington State case said, citing data from FairVote, a nonpartisan voting rights advocacy group.Congress has only once debated the question, when some lawmakers objected in 1969 to counting a Republican elector's vote for George C. Wallace after Richard M. Nixon won the popular vote in the elector's state. Both houses rejected the objection, and the vote stood.PhotographHillary Clinton won Colorado in the 2016 election, but afterward one of the state's electors wanted to vote for John Kasich.

Will it work?LAS VEGAS -- On Monday morning, Senator Bernie Sanders hosted a soccer tournament at Eldorado High School in East Las Vegas, a heavily Latino area. Elotes were served and music was playing, but most important were the vans to take players and their families to and from early voting sites.That evening, Senator Elizabeth Warren appeared with Julián Castro, the former housing secretary and presidential candidate, at Cardenas Market for Prioridades 2020, a presidential forum hosted by the Latino engagement group Mi Familia Vota Nevada. Earlier in the day, she'd announced Latinas en La Lucha, a program designed to highlight the political power of Latinas. A baile folklórico Mexicano performance kicked off the night and energized people.Saturday's caucuses in Nevada, where nearly 30 percent of residents are Latino, will be the first true test of whom Latinos are supporting in the 2020 Democratic primary. Recent polls have shown Mr. Sanders attracting significant Latino support in the state, including a Univision poll that found that one-third of Latino Democrats who were registered to vote backed him.Grass-roots organizations in Nevada and several of the Democratic campaigns have worked particularly hard to engage these voters, and some residents said that they had been contacted by campaigns for the first time in their lives this year.Alicia Lozano, 75, moved to Las Vegas four years ago after spending 20 years in El Paso. She has voted in numerous elections, but a campaign recently reached out to her for the first time ever, when canvassers for Tom Steyer knocked on her door.""This is the first time I've ever seen any candidate take an interest in me,"" she said, adding that a candidate who reached out to her was someone worth voting for, and that she would be supporting Mr. Steyer in the caucuses.Marco García, 59, who has lived in East Las Vegas for 20 years, also said that this was the first year that campaigns had tried to contact him. Canvassers for Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., had all stopped by to ask for his support.""I think Democrats want Latinos to come out and vote because it's such a close-fought race,"" he said. ""Campaigns need every little bit of support that they can get, so now they take an interest in us to come out and vote.""Advocacy groups like Mi Familia Vota and Make the Road Nevada have hosted their own forums and trainings to inspire Latinos, who typically turn out at lower rates than other people of color, to caucus.""We've found that when we educate Latinos, they're more civically engaged than most voting groups,"" said Héctor Sánchez Barba, the executive director of Mi Familia Vota. ""This is an investment in the long run.""These groups are also trying to make the case to campaigns and outsiders that engaging Latino voters is worth the effort.The Latino Vote Project, a turnout analysis conducted by the polling firm Latino Decisions and other groups, found last year that Latinos had been crucial to turning elections in four states -- Arizona, Florida, Nevada and Texas -- that were competitive for Democrats in the 2018 midterms.The same study found that the largest increases in voter turnout in these states were in predominantly Latino precincts, thanks largely to grass-roots organizations' spending millions of dollars on civic engagement and outreach.In Nevada, these groups have mostly reached out to Latinos who are not traditionally targeted by campaigns or political parties.Make the Road came to Ruth Mantilla's door 11 months ago as part of the group's effort to contact so-called low-propensity voters, or people who were considered unlikely to vote. Ms. Mantilla has lived in Las Vegas for a decade but only recently became a citizen, and this is the first primary that she will be able to vote in.""Before, when I didn't have the chance to vote, I never really realized if candidates were getting involved in our communities, but this year I have seen that the Democratic Party is trying to get us to me more engaged to change our current government,"" she said, adding that she felt a sense of urgency around getting President Trump out of office.Natalia Salgado, the national political director and chief of civic engagement for the Center for Popular Democracy, said recent organizing efforts had been driven by a desire for a party that Latinos could trust and work with. (Make the Road Nevada is a local partner of the Center for Popular Democracy.)""If the Democratic Party was going to be the electoral vehicle, either we were going to have to revamp it or we're going to have to create something new,"" she said.She didn't like how the party would sometimes parachute into Latino communities and tell voters which candidates to back no matter what, including some who backed policies and agendas that wouldn't improve Latinos' quality of life.""I believe that long-term organization and human-to-human relationships are the cornerstones of being able to undo all the sort of damage that the Democratic Party has done,"" Ms. Salgado said.For Mi Familia Vota, that often means an emphasis on families.""We're never forgetting the youth, because we feel like if we are able to target them and they are being informed about it, they can also inform their families and their parents,"" said Alma Delia Romo, the group's state coordinator in Nevada. ""Getting students involved is very important because they're going to shape our future representation.""Ms. Romo said that the key to getting Latinos, especially young ones, involved was showing them how accessible voting can be.""Being able to have these spaces like Cardenas, like the East Las Vegas Library -- places they are familiar with and can go vote -- definitely makes an impact,"" she said.She added that this year's addition of early voting made turning out easier for Latinos, who might not have the time to caucus on a Saturday because of work or family obligations. More than 70,000 Nevadans participated in early voting, the state Democratic Party said on Wednesday.Many early voting sites were located on the Strip, at hotels and casinos, to make them accessible for workers. Such locations will be open on caucus night as well.""It feels like we're being supported by someone other than ourselves, and that's important,"" Ms. Romo said.PhotographAttendees gathered at Elizabeth Warren's town hall with the Latino engagement group Mi Familia Vota in Las Vegas on Monday.; A Bernie Sanders rally on Tuesday. A Univision poll showed 33 percent of Latinos support him.

| Jump to first hitThe groups supporting the president's re-election bid also made 150 payments to Trump-owned entities and properties, Federal Election Commission filings show.WASHINGTON -- President Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee together spent more than $9 million on polling, digital ads and fees paid to Trump-owned properties in the last three months of 2019, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission released on Friday.The filings detail how the Trump campaign, the Trump Victory committee, a third entity called the Trump Make America Great Again Committee and the national party committee spent their cash from October through the end of December. Together, they previously reported raising $154 million over those months, and closed the year with $195 million in cash on hand.The Trump apparatus has raised an outsize sum, but it has faced questions about how, exactly, it is spending its reserves. Even though he is not funding his own bid this time around, Mr. Trump has repeatedly grilled his advisers about where and how they are spending money.According to a New York Times analysis, the biggest expenditure in the final three months of the year was on digital advertising. From October to December, the campaign spent more than $6 million on digital ads. The T-MAGA committee spent another $3.2 million on digital ads.The campaign also spent $525,000 on polling in that period. The Republican National Committee spent $2.2 million on polling.The Trump campaign spent about $194,000 at Trump-owned properties. The filings show that the groups supporting Mr. Trump's re-election together made 150 separate payments to Trump-owned entities and properties, totaling nearly $600,000 for the three-month period, and $1.7 million for the year.One of the biggest changes in the last quarter of 2019 was to the compensation of the campaign manager, Brad Parscale, whose company had been paid more than $16 million through the various Trump entities and the national committee last year, according to the filings. But in the past three months, his company made just over $200,000 from the four committees, a drastic scaling back that came after scrutiny of how much he was making, including questions raised by Mr. Trump himself.Campaign officials have said the money paid to Mr. Parscale's company in the past was for employee salaries, and they have insisted that Mr. Parscale is not pocketing a percentage of either donations or the ad buys. They also noted the sharp reduction to the amount of money his company was bringing in.""For as much transparency as possible, Brad Parscale has severely limited the pass-throughs going through his firm,"" Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman, said about the change. ""As has always been the case, he is paid a salary by the campaign and takes no percentages.""Among the top candidates vying for the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont raised the most money in the fourth quarter of 2019 ($34.4 million) and entered January with the most cash on hand ($18.2 million).Mr. Trump's spending demonstrates his advantage as an incumbent with no competitive primary race. The Trump campaign was vastly outspent by Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City who is self-financing a campaign. Mr. Bloomberg spent an eye-popping $188 million of his own money in the fourth quarter.The president also spent less in the last quarter then some of the top-tier Democratic candidates running more traditional races, who went on sprees as they tried to break out in a tight primary. Mr. Sanders, for example, spent $50 million last quarter. Over all, the Democratic candidates spent more than $500 million.Rachel Shorey and Annie Daniel contributed reporting from Washington, and Thomas Kaplan from Des Moines.PhotographPresident Trump and the Republican National Committee closed 2019 with $195 million on hand for his re-election campaign.

| Jump to first hitChris Malloy runs a small events business in New Hampshire. The week before the state's primary election, he has handled almost every campaign event.MILFORD, N.H. -- The better Chris Malloy does his job, the less people will notice him. In fact, they might only know he had been there if things had gone terribly wrong.Mr. Malloy runs a small events business in Rochester, N.H., near the seacoast. Most of the time, his business is busy producing corporate dinners in Nashua, weeknight fund-raisers in Manchester and the occasional wedding; the week before the New Hampshire primary was different.Mr. Malloy's business has all but cornered the market on producing political rallies here for Democratic presidential candidates. The eyes of the nation are on town halls and rallies predominantly produced by Mr. Malloy's company, Malloy Events.Anyone who followed the bungled Iowa caucuses would know that things in the early states could go south, and that when they did the consequences reverberated.""If the event goes flawlessly and it's on TV, it just kind of meets expectations,"" Mr. Malloy said. ""There's a lot of downside if something goes wrong.""From a town-hall-style meeting for Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts last Tuesday morning in Keene to several election night parties scheduled for Tuesday night, Malloy Events will have built stages and audience risers, set up chairs and lights, wired microphones and speakers and assembled press filing areas for more than 60 presidential campaign events featuring Ms. Warren, Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and the entrepreneur Andrew Yang (plus an election night party for the businessman Tom Steyer).Malloy Events produced dozens of events throughout the past 12 months for those candidates plus former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and former candidates Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey and Senator Kamala Harris of California.Few things better illustrate the distinctiveness -- advocates might call it charm and detractors, absurdity -- of the New Hampshire primary than the fact that this all-important contest is decided in a state so small that one determined small business can handle most of the events work during the busiest week in the year.Which is not to say this stretch is without challenges for Malloy Events. The company has roughly 15 full-time employees, Mr. Malloy said, but will have closer to 100 in the run-up to the primary, including temporary workers and daily union laborers.For Mr. Malloy, 39, a longtime New Hampshire resident and devout ""West Wing"" fan, these several days in the spotlight are not primarily about the bottom line.""I wouldn't do it if we weren't making money -- it's certainly business-related,"" he said in a north-of-Boston accent. ""But it's my personal favorite of all events.""Last Tuesday, a team led by Mr. Malloy had just a few hours, following morning tennis, to turn a cavernous field house at Hampshire Hills Athletic Club in Milford into a site for Mr. Sanders's first rally since the Iowa caucuses had concluded (so to speak) the night before.A stage, press and audience risers, tables, stanchions and bike racks (for creating a barrier between the stage and the crowd), speakers and subwoofers, 150 folding chairs and more were loaded off two 26-foot trucks, wheeled or carried through back hallways and, with the help of a campaign advance team, set up across three empty tennis courts.Working off the campaign's proposed layout, drapes were strategically hung. The campaign used its own podium; Mr. Malloy had two spares just in case.The breakneck assembly process culminated several hours later in a rally that the campaign said had attracted more than 1,300 -- its biggest crowd in the state to date.""Advance people want predictability, and they want to know that somebody is going to do a great job,"" said Doug Landry, the national advance lead for Hillary Clinton's 2016 primary campaign, who has largely stayed out of this cycle. (Advance people are campaign staffers who are generally responsible for planning and executing events.)This is Mr. Malloy's second primary cycle producing a plethora of presidential events, after working for both Mr. Sanders's and Hillary Clinton's campaigns leading up to the 2016 primary. The company is nonpartisan, but Mr. Malloy is a former Democratic state representative and has connections in the party.His experience creates a network effect in which the more events he does, the more he is trusted to have mastered the state and its venues. ""If you consistently perform well, they will call you over and over again,"" Mr. Landry said.Mr. Malloy knows which halls already have adequate lighting and which he will need to supplement, and which fire marshals are sticklers for neat rows of chairs.He packs chalk to get out stains; ibuprofen for headaches and portable cellphone chargers to prevent them; and a portable printer that has proved handy to candidates at the last minute. Malloy Events owns $25,000 worth of flags, Mr. Malloy estimated; a V.F.W. brochure on proper flag protocol sits on his pickup truck's dashboard. (""The blue unit has to be in the top left,"" he said.)Shannon Jackson, the Sanders campaign's state director, first hired Mr. Malloy to produce an opening for the previous Sanders campaign's Portsmouth office in September 2015. The campaign expected 25 people, but 150 showed.""I was so glad we had professional sound,"" Mr. Jackson said, as well as a stage for Mr. Sanders ""that was safer than having him stand on a park bench.""Amanda Kules, the Northeast regional advance lead for the Warren campaign, recalled an event at a Peterborough bowling alley where the campaign wanted a door where there was none. Malloy Events, which is subcontracted by a national company to do New Hampshire work for the Warren and Buttigieg campaigns, used a drape to build one.""They know the janitorial staff, the fire marshal -- every person we might need to put on an event successfully,"" Ms. Kules said. She also said that she appreciated that the Malloy Events team that produces Warren events was led by women, including Mr. Malloy's wife, Kate, a former wedding planner.Though Mr. Malloy was elected to a lone term as state representative of his hometown, Pelham, in 2002, he was bitten by the political-events bug about a decade later.He had a small events business in southern New Hampshire, and was the go-to audio-visual contractor for the Radisson Hotel in Nashua. One morning, in January 2012, he worked a chamber of commerce breakfast there featuring Mitt Romney. It changed Mr. Malloy's life -- and not because of Mr. Romney's infamous gaffe that day, when the former Massachusetts governor said, ""I like being able to fire people.""Mr. Malloy said: ""This was the day before the New Hampshire primary. There were a hundred members of the media there. To see how everyone managed that was eye-opening.""The biggest test for Malloy Events came Saturday night, with the Democratic Party's fund-raiser at the SNHU Arena in downtown Manchester featuring all the candidates and several thousand attendees.Mr. Malloy parked himself by the catwalk leading to the stage and gave the thumbs-up to each candidate when the house music was ready to be cut and the M.C. was prepared to introduce him or her.""All the candidates did well,"" he said, referring to their speeches.Mr. Malloy has been able to see an unusual amount of the candidates. He plans to vote on Tuesday. He declined to specify for whom.""I will say, they are my best choice to be president,"" he said, ""and they are a client.""PhotographLast Tuesday, the team at Malloy Events had just a few hours to turn a field house at Hampshire Hills Athletic Club in Milford, N.H., into a site for a Bernie Sanders rally. Clockwise from top left: A technician wires things up; barricades at the ready; workers assembling equipment; Chris Malloy, right, and his team putting on the finishing touches; an American flag; bringing in equipment.

| Jump to first hitIn October 2002, he was one of 77 senators who gave President George W. Bush the authority to use force in Iraq. He is still trying to explain that choice.Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. proposed a compromise.It was the fall of 2002 and the Bush administration was pushing for sweeping authority to act against Saddam Hussein, claiming he had weapons of mass destruction. Some Democrats questioned the stated threat posed by Iraq and bristled at President George W. Bush's broad request.Mr. Biden, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, had been scrambling to draft a bipartisan resolution that would grant Mr. Bush the authority to use military force against Iraq, but was more restrictive than the war authorization that the president had sought.As he often had in his long career, Mr. Biden sought bipartisan middle ground -- this time, between those opposed to potential war and the White House desire for more open-ended power. Some antiwar members of his committee resisted his effort, worried that it would still pave the way to conflict. ""We disagreed very strenuously,"" said former Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California.Mr. Biden's plan ultimately did not succeed, and he chose to focus on Mr. Bush's reassurances of a diplomacy-first approach.""At each pivotal moment,"" Mr. Biden said of Mr. Bush, ""he has chosen a course of moderation and deliberation, and I believe he will continue to do so. At least that is my fervent hope.""On Oct. 11, he was one of 77 senators to authorize the use of military force in Iraq. Twenty-three colleagues, some of whom harbored grave doubts about the danger Iraq posed at the time, refused to back the president's request.Nearly two decades later, Mr. Biden, who by 2005 was calling that vote a mistake, is running for president in part on his foreign policy experience, emphasizing his commander-in-chief credentials at a moment of heightened tensions between the United States and Iran.Yet the Iraq war vote is part of the extensive record he cites, and he has struggled to accurately account for it on the campaign trail, repeatedly suggesting he opposed the war and Mr. Bush's conduct from the beginning, claims that detailed fact checks have deemed wrong or misleading.The vote has exposed him to direct and implicit criticism from his chief presidential rivals, including Senator Elizabeth Warren and former Mayor Pete Buttigieg, a military veteran, and especially Senator Bernie Sanders, who voted against the war as a Vermont congressman and whose campaign has sharpened its criticism of Mr. Biden in recent days.Now, three weeks before the Iowa caucuses -- held in a state with a fierce antiwar streak -- the issue threatens to be a campaign liability for Mr. Biden as he seeks to assure voters of his ability to handle a foreign crisis even as he works to distance himself from a war that has had enormous costs for his own family, and for the nation.A review of how Mr. Biden operated in the fall of 2002, as he weighed the question of authorizing the use of military force, reveals core truths about how he has worked for decades: as a Senate dealmaker at heart, with a reverence for bipartisan compromise that his supporters admire -- and that critics say has colored his judgment during some of the most consequential moments of his career.The president's pushIn the summer of 2002, as the Bush administration sounded alarms about Iraq, Mr. Biden, too, was concerned about the perceived threat of Mr. Hussein and his ""relentless pursuit of weapons of mass destruction,"" as he put it in a New York Times Op-Ed he wrote with Senator Richard G. Lugar, Republican of Indiana.In the Dirksen Senate Office Building, Mr. Biden, a respected if long-winded chairman, convened two days of hearings about Iraq, soliciting testimony from a procession of experts.""These weapons must be dislodged from Saddam Hussein,"" Mr. Biden said, ""or Saddam Hussein must be dislodged from power.""But he also worried about the possible long-term consequences of confronting Mr. Hussein. ""It would be a tragedy if we removed a tyrant in Iraq, only to leave chaos in its wake,"" he said.After Mr. Bush asked Congress in September to authorize the use of military force in Iraq, Mr. Biden and his colleagues grappled with how to proceed. Some Democrats balked that fall at the pressure to grant the president sweeping power, unmoved by Bush administration warnings of national security considerations, which turned out to be based in part on faulty intelligence and distortions of available information.""Saddam Hussein is a threat, but the threat is not so great that we must be stampeded to provide such authority to this president just weeks before an election,"" admonished Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia.Mr. Biden was uneasy with the administration's broad language and worried about the precedent pre-emptive action could set, but he was also focused on showing unity behind the commander in chief as the nation reeled from the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. He hoped that, as he eventually said on the floor of the Senate, a ""strong"" congressional vote would ultimately give the United States a more forceful diplomatic position.""We didn't want to neuter the president because he's our president, he conducts foreign policy, but at the same time we didn't want to give him a blank check,"" said former Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, who worked closely with Mr. Biden.Ever focused on bipartisan consensus, Mr. Biden joined forces with Mr. Lugar to produce alternative language that would give Mr. Bush narrower authority. The resolution authorized military action specifically for the purpose of dismantling a weapons of mass destruction program, and it emphasized ""the importance of international support,"" Mr. Biden and Mr. Lugar said at the time.Some Democrats on Mr. Biden's committee, alarmed by divergent intelligence assessments, were skeptical of his compromise effort.""He tried hard to get us all together, he really did, he tried,"" recalled Ms. Boxer, who detailed her concerns about the intelligence in her book, ""The Art of Tough."" ""But if there's just a point where you feel the whole thing is based on false information, we couldn't come on in good conscience.""Their posture was deeply frustrating to Mr. Biden, a Senate institutionalist who was focused on vote counts.""Does anybody here think the White House doesn't have 55 votes for their resolution if we don't have an alternative?"" he railed at antiwar colleagues, according to his 2007 book, ""Promises to Keep."" He added in the book, ""I begged them to at least vote Biden-Lugar out of committee, but they made it clear they wouldn't do it -- on principle. They wanted purity.""Reluctant Senate colleagues represented only one challenge that Mr. Biden faced. In a late-night phone call to Mr. Biden's home, Mr. Lugar had informed him of a brewing counter-effort: The administration was working with Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House Democratic leader, on alternative language. Mr. Gephardt struck a deal with Mr. Bush and appeared with him and other lawmakers in the Rose Garden. (He was later critical of the Bush administration's handling of Iraq.)The deal had effectively torpedoed Mr. Biden's proposal -- and he seemed to know it.""I'm sure the argument will be, well, why are we nit-picking?"" he told reporters at the Capitol, clutching a coffee cup and, at one point, apparently exasperated, dismissing a reporter's line of inquiry as ""malarkey.""A country 'off balance'The debate in Washington unfolded in a nation gripped by fears about terrorism.""This country was really off balance and petrified and looking to the president to protect them,"" Mr. Hagel said. ""Members of Congress couldn't get too far out politically to push back on the president, to say, 'Well, I'm not sure that's that important, I'm not sure he has weapons of mass destruction.""'Politically ambitious Democrats were also leery of appearing weak on national security matters -- and in the November 2002 midterm elections, Republicans would regain control of the Senate.After his own proposal fell apart, Mr. Biden continued to meet with Bush administration officials. He found Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to be an influential and steady hand in the administration, and said publicly that the war resolution had been sufficiently improved from what the president had originally sought.Nearly two decades later, the faith that Mr. Biden put in Mr. Bush is now a target for criticism.""Many of his comments provided cover for proponents of the war -- the war that many have come to realize was a fatal mistake,"" said Jim Manley, who at the time was press secretary for Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and a leading opponent of the war authorization.On Saturday, the Sanders campaign released a blistering statement excoriating Mr. Biden for his Iraq war vote.""Bernie Sanders saw the same information and had the judgment to vote against the Iraq war,"" Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser to Mr. Sanders, said in the statement. Mr. Biden, he suggested, ""undermined Democratic opposition, enthusiastically supported a disastrous war, refuses to admit mistakes, and then tries to rewrite history.""Mr. Biden's allies argue that his vote was intended to support the strengthening of diplomatic efforts in the hopes of preventing military conflict.""For Biden and for a number of others who voted for the resolution, it was a vote for tough diplomacy,"" said Antony J. Blinken, a longtime Biden adviser who served as Democratic staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It is more likely that diplomacy will succeed, he argued, if the other side knows military action is possible.As Mr. Biden eventually acknowledged, that did not work as he had hoped.""It was a mistake to assume the president would use the authority we gave him properly,"" he said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" in 2005.But on the campaign trail this election cycle, he has suggested he opposed the war and Mr. Bush's conduct from the beginning, claims that do not match the historical record.""Immediately, the moment it started, I came out against the war at that moment,"" he told NPR in an interview in September. His campaign later said he had misspoken, according to a fact check from The Washington Post. At a campaign stop in Des Moines this month, Mr. Biden said, ""The president then went ahead with 'shock and awe,' and right after that, and from the very moment he did that, right after that, I opposed what he was doing,"" a misleading assertion at best, according to an assessment from CNN.Mr. Biden did ultimately become a vocal opponent of the Bush administration's stewardship of the war, and went on to serve as vice president to Barack Obama, a critic of the conflict. The war took a personal toll when his elder son, Beau Biden, deployed to Iraq in 2008 with the Delaware Army National Guard. Beau Biden died in 2015 from brain cancer, and his father has discussed the possibility of a link between the illness and exposure to pits of burning waste on military bases.Ms. Boxer attended a fund-raiser for Mr. Biden last week, though she said she was not yet formally endorsing him, and spoke warmly about her former Foreign Relations Committee colleague in an interview. She emphasized his record and all he had done in the nearly two decades since they clashed on Iraq.""They fought very hard to get us on board and we fought very hard to get them to stop,"" Ms. Boxer said. ""Once he saw that it was a mistake, he really stepped up to the plate to try and come up with a way out of this war.""Ahead of that 2002 vote, Mr. Biden stood on the Senate floor to explain his support for the war authorization. He followed Senator Hillary Clinton of New York -- who in her later presidential campaigns also faced scrutiny over her Iraq war vote -- and spoke for an hour.""I do not believe this is a rush to war,"" Mr. Biden said. ""I believe it's a march to peace and security.""Hours later, he cast his vote in the affirmative.Kitty Bennett contributed research.Kitty Bennett contributed research.PhotographAs chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 2002, Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitHow a series of turning points in mid-October explains the state of the race today and can serve as a cheat sheet for the casual 2020 primary observer.Month after month, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. led national polls in the Democratic presidential primary race. But in early October, someone else seemed to crack the code. Lifted by her bevy of policy plans and grass-roots momentum, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts joined Mr. Biden in a statistical tie atop the party's large field of candidates.It didn't last.What happened over the following days would reset the trajectory of the primary race: Mr. Biden stabilized; Ms. Warren and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont began experiencing a reversal of fortunes; Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., drew a bead on Ms. Warren; and Senator Kamala Harris of California looked less and less like a formidable candidate.That week in mid-October -- the run-up to the Oct. 15 Democratic debate and afterward -- encapsulated the fluid and uncertain nature of the biggest presidential field ever. And it can function as a cheat sheet for voters trying to understand the state of the race heading into 2020.""Candidates being under attack, facing scrutiny or going on offense themselves -- that week had all that going on and is a good explanation for how we've gotten to this point in the primary today,"" said Waleed Shahid of Justice Democrats, the progressive group supporting left-wing candidates in Congress and in the primary.Among the turning points was the debate itself: The surging Ms. Warren experienced significant pressure to clarify her position on ""Medicare for all,"" which culminated in her releasing financing and transition plans on health care that have since ignited some blowback. She has not recovered from her polling peak since.Mr. Sanders, who had suffered a heart attack at the beginning of the month, bounced back with a lauded debate performance, and his campaign announced endorsements from Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota on the night of the Oct. 15 debate. Ever since, the party's left wing has continued to rally around Mr. Sanders's candidacy.""Because there was so much chatter about how the Sanders campaign was over, they got to surprise everyone. And that doesn't happen all the time in politics,"" said Rebecca Katz, a progressive consultant in New York City. ""And he's been rolling since then.""Mr. Buttigieg, in turn, helped change the tone of a markedly cordial Democratic race. He first accused Ms. Warren of ""evasiveness"" on health care in September, but during a Wall Street Journal interview published Oct. 13, he ratcheted up the attack, addressing Ms. Warren directly.""I think you should be straightforward about what your plan is going to do,"" Mr. Buttigieg said, ""and we haven't seen that.""It was during this time that he crystallized a hard pivot to the party's ideological center, which ultimately helped him become a top-tier candidate in the early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire.It also enraged liberals, who continue to call Mr. Buttigieg inauthentic.""The biggest long-term impact of that past chapter of the campaign is that Pete permanently destroyed his brand,"" said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is supporting Ms. Warren. ""He went from being the authentic, unobjectionable, clean-cut guy to being seen as mean, dishonest, and in the pocket of Big Insurance and other big-money interests that attend his fund-raisers.""Mr. Biden escaped the October debate without sustained attacks from his opponents. It reflects a notable trend that has continued through the end of the year: Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have focused their attacks on each other, even as Mr. Biden continues to be the front-runner.""There is a reticence to attack him because it feels like there's something you'll have to pay for in the general,"" said Akunna Cook, the former executive director of the Black Economic Alliance. ""I think people have started to presume that he's the nominee, people are starting to think it's inevitable.""""The progressives are so focused on Bernie versus Elizabeth that they're not focused on Biden,"" she added.Mr. Shahid said that the former vice president has stayed away ""from the level of scrutiny he received during the first months of his campaign.""Mr. Biden's permanence is real -- his lead atop national polling averages has gone virtually unthreatened since Ms. Warren receded from her peak. It has defied the expectations of some party leaders who began the year boasting about the historic diversity of the Democratic field, which included several female candidates and black and Latino candidates. But in the December debate, six of the seven candidates onstage were white, and only one woman -- Ms. Warren -- remains in the top tier.The campaign will now enter the new year almost exactly where it began -- with Mr. Biden as the presumed front-runner and Mr. Sanders as his closest rival.In the days before the October debate, candidates also revealed their third-quarter fund-raising totals -- the first clear signs that the race was trending toward an all-white top tier. It highlighted the failure of the race's two leading black candidates at the time -- Ms. Harris and Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey -- to gain significant traction, hurt by their low poll numbers among black voters.In the run-up to the debate, Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg announced raising more than $19 million in the third quarter of fund-raising. Ms. Harris cracked double digits, but most other nonwhite candidates were far behind.On Oct. 12, Ms. Harris held a block party in Des Moines, part of her campaign's push to hold an event in Iowa every week in October. Her late focus on Iowa was one of a series of ill-fated strategic moves, which culminated in her surprise exit from the race in December.At the debate days later, Ms. Harris tried to goad Ms. Warren into an argument about whether to delete President Trump's Twitter account, which the Massachusetts senator laughed off. It was a sign of Ms. Harris's diminished standing that Ms. Warren and her campaign team did not feel the need to respond.Also in early October, the impeachment inquiry led by House Democrats began taking closed-door depositions. Their timeline set in motion dynamics that now threaten to upend the nomination process.Mr. Trump, for one, has already promised to make next year's re-election in part a referendum on House Democrats. And a Senate impeachment trial during the Democratic primaries and caucuses could complicate the campaign schedules for the crop of senators still in the race -- Mr. Sanders, Ms. Warren, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Booker and Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado.""I swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution,"" Mr. Booker has said. ""I didn't swear an oath to protect and defend the Constitution unless there's an election coming up.""Impeachment also influenced the Biden campaign. In late September and early October, Mr. Biden struggled to respond to Mr. Trump's attacks against his son, Hunter Biden, and his business dealings in Ukraine, even though there was no evidence to support Mr. Trump's claims. By mid-October, Mr. Biden had begun hitting back more effectively on Mr. Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. And on Oct. 15, ABC News broadcast an interview with Hunter Biden in which he admitted fault but also defended himself.""I gave a hook to some very unethical people to act in illegal ways to try to do some harm to my father. That's where I made the mistake,"" the younger Mr. Biden said. ""So I take full responsibility for that. Did I do anything improper? No, not in any way. Not in any way whatsoever.""Every race is fluid, of course, and the dynamics set in motion in mid-October could shift, particularly considering that the Iowa caucuses famously break late. In the Dec. 19 debate in Los Angeles, for example, Ms. Warren departed from her traditional refusal to criticize other candidates -- as did Ms. Klobuchar, who directly chided Mr. Buttigieg.One big unknown is fund-raising. On Oct. 16, Mr. Biden disclosed a cash-on-hand number so low -- $9 million -- that it startled many in the party's moderate wing and some supporters. His apparent vulnerability as a front-runner helped spur two new entrants in the race, former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts and Michael R. Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor and one of the richest people in the country.""When Biden showed, not that just that fund-raising was lackluster, but that they were spending more money than they were raising, it showed not just that the candidate was in trouble,"" Ms. Katz said. ""You had a campaign team that was committing malpractice.""One of the big questions of the Democratic race now is whether Mr. Bloomberg's self-funded candidacy can break through to moderate voters, or whether they will coalesce around Mr. Biden, Mr. Buttigieg or another contender. Mr. Biden's fund-raising and poll numbers largely stabilized through the fall, and he begins 2020 in arguably his strongest shape since things started turning around in that week in October.PhotographIn a week in October, the trajectory of the Democratic presidential race reset as Joseph R. Biden Jr. re-emerged as the front-runner after falling into a statistical tie atop the field; Senator Bernie Sanders bounced back with a strong debate weeks after having a heart attack; and Senator Elizabeth Warren faced blowback after releasing her health care plan.

| Jump to first hitThe Iowa caucus debacle proved that a 21st-century election requires 19th-century technology.After Monday's Iowa caucus debacle, I've decided that Americans should vote by etching our preferred candidate's name into a stone tablet with a hammer and chisel.Or maybe by dropping pebbles into a series of urns, as the ancient Greeks did.Or possibly just by voting the way we voted for much of the 20th century, on punch-card machines that spit out paper ballots to be hand-counted by election workers, with zero iPhones in sight.Basically, we should be begging for the most analog election technology possible. Because what happened on Monday night -- a long and confusing delay in vote counting, due in part to a mobile app that was hastily designed and inadequately tested before being deployed in one of America's most important elections -- was an inexcusable failure. It caused distress and confusion, set off innumerable conspiracy theories, and started the 2020 election season by undermining trust in the democratic process.And all because Iowa Democrats wanted a new app.The app, whose name was kept secret by Democratic officials, was compared to a ""fancy calculator"" that was supposed to help Iowa caucus chairs send their results to the state Democratic Party. But as my colleagues reported, it posed problems for caucus precinct chairs all day.Some chairs weren't able to use it at all. Others had connectivity issues, or simply didn't know how to work the app, and were forced to endure long hold times on a phone hotline instead.There is no indication that any of these technical issues changed the results of the caucuses, or that any systems were hacked or compromised. And there were nontechnical issues that may have added to the chaos, such as new rules and worksheets that were designed to simplify the caucus process but seemed mostly to have sown confusion.Regardless, the damage was done. The hours spent waiting for overdue results created an information vacuum, which was quickly filled by conspiracy theorists. By nightfall, liberals and conservatives alike were tossing around allegations of vote tampering and election rigging, and casting doubt over the legitimacy of the caucuses.Democrats quickly began blaming Shadow, the tech start-up that built the app, and Acronym, a Democratic digital strategy operation that invested in Shadow. These firms do deserve scrutiny, not least because it appears that they neglected to quickly respond when reports of user issues began surfacing on Monday.(Late Monday, Acronym put out a statement, saying that it did not provide technology to the Iowa Democratic Party and that it was merely an investor in Shadow.)But Democrats should also blame their party's leadership for entrusting such an important process to new technology in the first place -- not just in Iowa but in places like Nevada, where Democrats reportedly planned to use a similar mobile app to tally votes in that state's caucuses this month before changing their minds on Tuesday.It's enough to make you wonder: Have these party officials ever been to a polling site or a caucus venue? They are not pristine WeWorks with blazing fast internet connections and an army of Geek Squad workers on call. They are mostly high school gyms, nursing homes and church basements with cinder-block walls and horrible cellphone service. The people who work at them are volunteers, and many are -- how can I put this delicately? -- members of the generation that still refers to the TV remote as ""the clicker.""Using a proprietary app to report vote totals is the kind of thing that sounds simple on a start-up's whiteboard but utterly falls apart in a chaotic real-world environment, where connections drop, phones malfunction and poorly tested apps strain under a surge of traffic. Add an army of frenzied poll workers, impatient voters and twitchy news media, and you might as well have asked the caucus workers to whip up their own JavaScript.I'm not opposed to technology in political campaigning. Want to use Facebook ads to drum up donors? Go for it. Want to put your voter database on the blockchain? Be my guest.But when it comes to the actual business of registering and counting people's votes, many of the smartest tech experts I know fiercely oppose high-tech solutions, like ""paperless"" digital voting machines and mobile voting apps. After all, every piece of technology involved in the voting process is a possible point of failure. And the larger and more interconnected the technical system, the more vulnerable it is to an attack.""Many of the leading opponents of paperless voting machines were, and still are, computer scientists, because we understand the vulnerability of voting equipment in a way most election officials don't,"" said Barbara Simons, a computer scientist and board chair of Verified Voting, an election security nonprofit, in an interview with The Atlantic in 2017.In Iowa, there is a silver lining: The caucus system doesn't use voting machines at all, and its public, open-air nature means that it is less susceptible to tampering than a secret ballot. In addition, state officials this year required caucusgoers to fill out paper ""presidential preference cards,"" which could be used in case of a recount. So despite the delays, there is at least some certainty that the results will be accurate when they are finally announced.And it may be too close to November's elections to overhaul state election technology, or to institute the kind of much-needed election security reforms that have been repeatedly proposed by Democrats (and blocked by Republicans) since 2016.So unless something changes, get used to the era of the voting day software glitch. Because we've invited tech into our elections, whether or not it's up for the task.PhotographAn untested app wreaked chaos in Iowa, where people waited Monday for results at a Bernie Sanders watch party in Des Moines.

| Jump to first hitAfter Mr. Biden's big wins on Super Tuesday Mr. Bloomberg endorsed him and said that he planned to remain involved in the 2020 presidential campaign.Michael R. Bloomberg dropped out of the presidential race and backed Joseph R. Biden Jr. on Wednesday, throwing the financial might of the Democratic Party's biggest benefactor behind the former vice president's campaign as Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont vowed to wage a long battle for the nomination.Mr. Sanders, regarded a week ago as having a clear upper hand over Mr. Biden, sounded chagrined after losses in states from Maine to Texas where he was hoping for huge turnout. There was a surge in voter participation, but it lifted Mr. Biden instead.Mr. Sanders now faces pressure to show he can expand his political base, and he acknowledged that he had not yet managed to transform the electorate with a wave of young people.The sudden shift in political momentum has redefined the Democratic race at breakneck speed. Since Saturday night, when Mr. Biden won South Carolina in a landslide, much of the Democratic establishment has aligned behind him. Two rivals, Pete Buttigieg and Senator Amy Klobuchar, dropped out and endorsed Mr. Biden on Sunday and Monday; he won 10 states on Tuesday, including Texas and North Carolina; and Mr. Bloomberg backed him on Wednesday.Only Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts remains as a major candidate. Her campaign said on Wednesday that she was assessing her path forward in view of another night of dispiriting election returns, including a third-place finish in her home state, that left Ms. Warren without a single victory after a month of primaries and caucuses.Mr. Sanders said on Wednesday that he had spoken with Ms. Warren, who for months had been his most formidable rival from the Democrats' populist wing. But Mr. Sanders said he applied no public pressure on her to stand down and shared no knowledge of her intentions, if he had any.Some supporters have urged Ms. Warren to take her time, while others are pressing her to capitalize on her existing leverage by dropping out and endorsing Mr. Biden, according to Democrats who have spoken to her. But Ms. Warren made it clear to one supporter on Wednesday that she was not going to act hastily and that it may be at least another day before she makes up her mind.In a further boon to Mr. Biden, Mr. Bloomberg signaled in his concession speech that he intended to keep wielding his multibillion-dollar fortune against President Trump. The former New York City mayor had previously pledged to keep spending large sums of money to help Democrats in the general election, even if Mr. Bloomberg did not become the nominee. (The Sanders campaign has said it would not welcome that kind of help.)""I am cleareyed about our overriding objective, and that is victory in November,"" Mr. Bloomberg said, adding, ""I will not be our party's nominee, but I will not walk away from the most important political fight of my life.""Advisers to Mr. Bloomberg said on Wednesday that they had not yet settled on a detailed spending plan for the general election, but Mr. Bloomberg is said to be keenly interested not only in the presidential race but also in Democratic efforts to take full control of Congress. Members of his enormous campaign staff were told that it would take perhaps a week for final decisions about how Mr. Bloomberg might reorient his campaign machinery.Mr. Biden's campaign raced to harness his new momentum and Mr. Sanders sought to refocus his rattled political operation for a newly grueling fight. The Biden campaign has told allies that it is seeking to rapidly hire campaign staff to strengthen its presence in states where the former vice president has built little or no organized infrastructure because of his financial difficulties so far.Mr. Sanders's team is hoping that his more developed campaign apparatus might give him a chance to slow Mr. Biden's rise in the half-dozen states that vote next week, most significantly in the large swing state of Michigan. Addressing reporters in Burlington, Vt., on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Sanders described the Michigan primary as ""enormously important"" and said he had high hopes to win.Repeating a litany of criticism he leveled at Mr. Biden in his election-night speech Tuesday, Mr. Sanders indicated he would focus over the next week on attacking Mr. Biden's record of supporting what he described as ""disastrous trade agreements"" that had been particularly damaging to Midwestern states like Michigan. Mr. Sanders said several times that ""Joe is going to have to explain"" various other parts of his record, including his support for the 2003 invasion of Iraq and the 2008 bailout of the financial industry.Mr. Biden has not faced a sustained challenge in weeks, having been largely written off by his rivals after his embarrassing fifth-place finish in New Hampshire. It remains to be seen whether Mr. Biden will be able to fully extend the energy that has propelled his campaign over the last few days, and how deftly he might be able to grapple with a determined opponent like Mr. Sanders.But Mr. Sanders acknowledged that he was disappointed by the results from contests this week in 15 states and territories, two-thirds of which Mr. Biden won. And in a striking and uncharacteristic admission, Mr. Sanders conceded that his campaign had not managed to generate the soaring turnout among young people that he had been counting on to secure the nomination.""Have we been as successful as I would hope, in bringing young people in? And the answer is no,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""We're making some progress.""Campaigning in West Beverly Hills, Calif., on Wednesday, Mr. Biden brandished the breadth and diversity of his support to reject Mr. Sanders's accusations that he is an instrument of the political establishment.""The establishment are all those hard-working, middle-class people, those African-Americans, those single women,"" Mr. Biden said, referring to voters who turned out in force for him this week.Both Biden and Sanders supporters will be looking for victories next Tuesday in primaries and caucuses in Michigan, Missouri and four other states. Mr. Bloomberg's exit, and his immediate move to back Mr. Biden, had the potential to anger Sanders supporters, who have long regarded Mr. Bloomberg as a malignant force in the 2020 campaign, and stoke resentment among progressives that party power brokers were again taking aggressive steps to thwart Mr. Sanders.But Mr. Bloomberg's decision to leave the race came primarily from an unsparing assessment of his own feeble prospects.According to two people briefed on his deliberations, Mr. Bloomberg reached the decision to withdraw from the race on Wednesday morning, after meeting with his inner circle of advisers at the Upper East Side townhouse that is the headquarters of his political and philanthropic empire. Miles away was the Times Square campaign office where in just a few months he assembled an enormous team of aides in a late-starting bid for the presidency.Mr. Bloomberg's advisers had acknowledged to allies even on Tuesday evening that it was unlikely he would continue in the race, and by early Wednesday he was making calls to some of his top supporters to inform them of his decision. Appearing before supporters later in the day, Mr. Bloomberg said that the delegate math that would have earned him the nomination ""had become virtually impossible.""Mr. Bloomberg and Mr. Biden spoke by phone on Wednesday morning, a person briefed on the call said. Shortly after Mr. Bloomberg announced his exit, Mr. Biden posted an appreciative tweet saying he would be counting on Mr. Bloomberg's help to defeat President Trump.Mr. Bloomberg's candidacy was unprecedented in its financial firepower, amounting to a no-expenses-spared effort to take control of a presidential race. His Democratic rivals accused him of seeking to buy the presidency, and Mr. Bloomberg often came close to embracing that idea: In his speeches, he frequently made allusions to his vast personal fortune and presented himself to Democratic voters as the candidate with ""the record and the resources"" to win the general election.But Mr. Bloomberg never escaped a set of serious political vulnerabilities that his advisers identified from the outset, including his long record of supporting stop-and-frisk policing and numerous accusations made by women about harassment and gender-based discrimination by Mr. Bloomberg and his company.Both issues came to the fore in the Democratic debate in Las Vegas last month that signaled the beginning of Mr. Bloomberg's downfall, as Ms. Warren left him reeling with a barrage of criticism about his conduct toward women. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, too, harried Mr. Bloomberg for his policing strategies in New York, questioning his sensitivities on matters of race in a manner Mr. Bloomberg defended stiffly and in incomplete or misleading terms.The campaign cost Mr. Bloomberg more than half a billion dollars in advertising alone. He also spent lavishly on robust on-the-ground operations, with more than 200 field offices across the country and thousands of paid staff. His operation dwarfed those of Democratic rivals who ultimately won states in which he had installed many dozens of employees and spent heavily on radio, television and direct mail ads.It also enabled his campaign to produce a staggering volume of attention-grabbing -- and, to some Democrats, cringe-inducing -- commercials and other activities aimed at antagonizing Mr. Trump. The same week Mr. Bloomberg wilted in the Las Vegas debate, his campaign ran advertisements on the city's huge electronic billboards taunting Mr. Trump: ""Donald Trump eats burnt steak,"" read one of them.Mr. Bloomberg used his wealth to assemble an enormous campaign team of over 2,400 staff members. He concentrated more than 100 offices in Super Tuesday states, where his infrastructure quickly exceeded that of his opponents. For instance, in Ms. Warren's home state of Massachusetts -- where Mr. Bloomberg himself grew up -- he established six field offices across the state, four more than Ms. Warren and five more than Mr. Biden, who ultimately won there.But as a full picture of the results came into focus on Tuesday, Mr. Bloomberg had won only a single contest, in the territory of American Samoa.Reporting was contributed by Katie Glueck from West Beverly Hills, Calif.; Sydney Ember from Burlington, Vt.; Jonathan Martin, Jeremy W.

| Jump to first hitThe New York City mayor, who was briefly a presidential candidate himself, is scheduled to campaign with Mr. Sanders in Nevada ahead of the caucuses there next week.Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York, whose brief presidential campaign failed to get off the ground last year, endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the Democratic nomination on Friday.In a statement released by the Sanders campaign, Mr. de Blasio said he was supporting Mr. Sanders because he ""stands with working families"" and was the right candidate to take on President Trump.""I have called for a bold, progressive agenda, and that's exactly what Senator Sanders has championed for decades,"" Mr. de Blasio said.His choice is a reversal from four years ago, when he endorsed Hillary Clinton over Mr. Sanders, but it is not entirely unexpected. He said last summer that in retrospect, he believed Mr. Sanders would have won the 2016 election if nominated.It is also notable that Mr. de Blasio chose to make the endorsement only now, after Mr. Sanders's victory in New Hampshire and strong performance in Iowa have made him a clear front-runner for the nomination.Mr. de Blasio was expected to travel with Mr. Sanders on Sunday and Monday in Nevada, where they will appear together at canvassing events ahead of the caucuses there on Feb. 22.Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Sanders have spoken several times since the mayor ended his presidential campaign in September. The mayor also spent time at Mr. Sanders's vacation home in Vermont in 2018. And Mr. Sanders swore Mr. de Blasio in at the inauguration for his second term as mayor.Though Mr. de Blasio ran for mayor -- and, later, president -- on an unapologetically progressive platform, he has generally not endorsed progressive insurgents. He did not endorse Zephyr Teachout in 2014 or Cynthia Nixon in 2018 when they challenged Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo from the left. Nor did he endorse Tiffany Cabán in the Queens district attorney's race last year, as Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts both did.Mr. de Blasio's backing adds to Mr. Sanders's list of endorsements, which includes numerous unions and grass-roots organizations as well as Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.Mr. de Blasio was in the presidential race for only four months last year and never exceeded 1 percent in a debate-qualifying poll; even voters in New York did not support him. But in something of a twist, his predecessor as mayor, Michael R. Bloomberg, has reached double digits in recent national polls with a veritable tsunami of spending from his personal fortune.PhotographMayor Bill de Blasio of New York endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont for the Democratic presidential nomination.

| Jump to first hitOur reporters are following all of the exchanges and fact-checking the candidates, providing context and explanation.Seven of the candidates vying for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination took the stage Tuesday night in Charleston for their last debate before South Carolina's primary on Saturday.Here is how the candidates' remarks stacked up against the truth.Senator Elizabeth Warren said that Michael Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, told a pregnant employee that she should ""kill it.""Ms. Warren: ""At least I didn't have a boss who said to me, 'Kill it,' the way that Mayor Bloomberg is alleged to have said to one of his pregnant employees.""Mr. Bloomberg: ""I never said it, period. End of story.""This allegation was made by an employee of Bloomberg L.L.P. in a 1997 lawsuit that was eventually settled with no admission of guilt. Mr. Bloomberg has denied making the remark over the years, including at the debate. His aides said in 2001 that he had passed a lie-detector test, but the results were not released.Mr. Bloomberg left a voice message for the employee saying that he had heard she was upset about the remarks, according to The Associated Press, saying ""I didn't say it, but if I did, I didn't mean it.""The Washington Post recently quoted a former Bloomberg employee who said that he witnessed the conversation and that it was ""outrageous.""The businessman Tom Steyer attacked former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. for his role in legislation that led to high rates of incarceration among black and Latino people.""You wrote the crime bill,"" he said, prompting an angry response from Mr. Biden, ""to put hundreds of thousands of young black and Latino men in prison.""Mostly True. In the 1980s and 1990s, Mr. Biden, working with Senator Strom Thurmond, Republican of South Carolina, wrote a half-dozen crime bills, laying the groundwork for three of the most significant pieces of crime legislation of the 20th century: the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, establishing mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses; the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which dictated much harsher sentences for possession of crack than for powder cocaine; and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, a vast catchall tough-on-crime bill that also included money for prevention, including Mr. Biden's signature initiative, the Violence Against Women Act.The 1986 law, in particular, led to vast racial disparities in federal sentencing. The law specified a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in prison for possession of five grams of crack cocaine -- a drug prevalent in African-American communities -- or 500 grams of powder cocaine, more prevalent among white people.A 2002 report to Congress from the United States Sentencing Commission found that in 1992, 91.4 percent of federal crack cocaine offenders were black. In releasing a 2006 report on the 1986 measure, the American Civil Liberties Union called the law ""a tragic mistake.""Mr. Biden ultimately disavowed the measure. In 2007 -- more than two decades after it passed -- he called for undoing the crack-powder disparity, which he called ""arbitrary, unnecessary and unjust,"" while acknowledging his own role in creating it.""I am part of the problem that I have been trying to solve since then,"" he said in 2008, ""because I think the disparity is way out of line.""Senator Bernie Sanders mischaracterized studies of the costs of his health care plan, falsely stating that they all say it will save money.""What every study out there, conservative or progressive says: 'Medicare for all' will save money.""False. There have been several analyses of Mr. Sanders's Medicare for all health care proposal, which would provide every American with generous government-funded health insurance benefits. Those studies have shown a range of potential costs, including several that estimate that the plan would cost substantially more than what the country would otherwise spend on health care.Mr. Sanders is correct that a recent study published in the medical journal The Lancet showed that his plan would cost $450 billion less in a year than the current health care system. But that study made several assumptions that other economists who have examined the plan have considered unrealistic. Other studies have shown that spending would increase as the plan expands coverage to more Americans, and provides them with expensive new benefits, like long-term care, which few health insurance plans currently cover. This article provides an overview of a few of these studies.Mr. Biden wrongly said the Obama administration did not know about Russian involvement in subverting American elections until the end.""We didn't have all the information at that time until after the election was over.""Mostly false. The F.B.I. warned the Democratic National Committee in 2015 that a foreign intelligence agency -- it turned out to be Russia -- was inside their networks. President Obama was not fully briefed until June 2016, when CrowdStrike, a private firm, concluded that two Russian spy agencies had infiltrated the systems. By the end of July 2016, the C.I.A. concluded with medium to high confidence that the attack had been begun by Russia, and soon after that it had been approved by President Vladimir V. Putin.In short, there was plenty of evidence of Russian interferences. Mr. Obama chose not to respond until after the election, for fear that the Russians would try to affect the result. A Senate Intelligence Committee investigation concluded, with bipartisan agreement, that the Obama administration underreacted.Mr. Biden is right that only after the Obama administration left office did the extent of Russia's effort to influence social media become clear. But the hacking into the Democratic National Committee -- a crime -- was clearly understood, and the Obama administration reaction -- expelling 35 diplomats who were actually spies, and closing some Russian facilities inside the United States -- is today considered too little, too late.Mr. Sanders was asked how he could convince voters, at a time of low unemployment, that the economy would do better under a democratic socialist than under President Trump.""The economy is doing really great for people like Mr. Bloomberg and other billionaires. In the last three years, last three years, billionaires in this country saw an $850 billion increase in their wealth. But you know what? For the ordinary American, things are not so good. Last year, real wage increases for the average worker were less than 1 percent. Half of our people are living paycheck to paycheck.""The second claim is true. After adjusting for inflation, wages for production and nonsupervisory workers increased by 0.7 percent from January 2019 to January 2020, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The third claim is also true, according to several surveys of American families. In one such survey, the First National Bank of Omaha found 49 percent of Americans say they expect to live paycheck to paycheck this year.The first claim is more difficult to assess. Calculations by the economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman of the University of California, Berkeley, who have estimated wealth shares across the income distribution in the United States and scored Mr. Sanders's proposed wealth tax, suggest that the top 400 wealthiest Americans have collectively gained about $500 billion in wealth over the last three years. There are more than 400 billionaires in America, though -- and there is a debate among economists over how to properly measure the wealth they hold.Mr. Bloomberg highlighted rising life expectancy in New York City, where he pursued an aggressive public health agenda.""Before I left, life expectancy in New York City had grown by three years during our 12 years in office such that, when I left, it was three years greater than the national average.""Mostly true. Mr. Bloomberg is correct that life expectancy in New York City is higher than it is in the United States overall and that it rose disproportionately during his tenure as mayor. New York is in many ways a model city in improving the health and longevity of its low-income residents. By the end of his tenure, life expectancy in the city had improved by three years, according to a city health department analysis, though the gap between the city's and the nation's life expectancy at the end of his time in office was a bit lower than he claimed, more like 2.3 years.The degree to which Mr. Bloomberg should receive credit for this positive trend is somewhat contested among researchers. His administration pursued aggressive public health measures to reduce smoking, obesity and the consumption of trans fats. And, indeed, deaths from heart disease and smoking fell. But research has also suggested that New York's high rate of immigrants may also explain part of the trend: Poor immigrants, in general, tend to be healthier than native-born Americans of similar incomes.Mr. Biden promoted efforts to help black Americans with housing.""Right now if you live in a black neighborhood and have the same exact house as the guy across the street in a white neighborhood has, your house is valued significantly less than the white -- the same exact house.""This is true. In 2018, three researchers at the Brookings Institution -- Andre M. Perry, Jonathan Rothwell, and David Harshbarger -- found significant differences in home valuations between neighborhoods that were majority black and comparable areas with few or no black residents. ""Homes of similar quality in neighborhoods with similar amenities are worth 23 percent less ($48,000 per home on average, amounting to $156 billion in cumulative losses) in majority-black neighborhoods, compared to those with very few or no black residents,"" they reported.Mr. Bloomberg took outsize credit for New York State's legalization of same-sex marriage.""I got the Republican State Senate to vote for gay marriage virtually before anybody else in this country.""This is exaggerated. As mayor of New York City in May 2011, Mr. Bloomberg lobbied Republicans in the New York State Senate to support same-sex marriage, vowing to support their re-election efforts if they did so.The legislation to legalize gay marriage passed 33 votes to 29 in June -- the largest but not the first state to do so. (Vermont was the first.) Four of the 32 Senate Republicans voted in favor of the bill, so Mr. Bloomberg is overstating the support among party members.Mr. Bloomberg was also not the singular force in the efforts to legalize same-sex marriage. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, and gay rights activists played a large role.The New York Times reported in 2011 that ""Mr. Cuomo made same-sex marriage one of his top priorities for the year and deployed his top aide to coordinate the efforts of a half-dozen local gay-rights organizations whose feuding and disorganization had in part been blamed for the defeat two years ago.""Mr. Biden wrongly said that Mr. Sanders did not condemn the Cuban government and that Mr. Obama did not support authoritarian governments.""He, in fact, does not, did not, has never embraced an authoritarian regime and does not now. ... This man"" -- pointing to Mr. Sanders -- ""said that, in fact, he thought it was -- he did not condemn what they did.""False. Mr. Sanders has recently come under fire -- particularly among some Cuban-Americans in Florida -- for comments he made to CBS's ""60 Minutes"" praising facets of the Cuban government. Mr. Biden is wrong, though, that Mr. Sanders did not criticize the government.""We're very opposed to the authoritarian nature of Cuba but you know, it's unfair to simply say everything is bad,"" Mr. Sanders said during the interview. ""When Fidel Castro came into office, you know what he did? He had a massive literacy program. Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?""When Anderson Cooper, a correspondent for ""60 Minutes,"" pointed out that political dissidents remained imprisoned in Cuba, Mr. Sanders responded, ""That's right and we condemn that.""Mr. Sanders is right that Mr. Obama also praised Cuba's ""enormous achievements in education and in health care.""Mr. Biden's contention that Mr. Obama did not ""embrace"" an authoritarian regime also glosses over the support provided by the Obama administration and previous administrations of both parties for governments that could arguably be called authoritarian. Human Rights Watch, for example, faulted Mr. Obama for tolerating abuses by Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, all longstanding allies of the United States.Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., exaggerated criticism of Mr. Sanders's health care plan, saying the proposal to eliminate private health insurance is unprecedented among other big countries.""What is a radical idea is completely eliminating all private insurance and part of how you know it is, is that no industrialized country has gone that far.""This is exaggerated. Mr. Sanders's Medicare for all plan technically does not eliminate all private health insurance. It bans private health insurers from offering products with benefits that replicate those offered by the government plan. This provision is very closely modeled on the health insurance system in Canada, where private insurance that replicates government benefits is also banned.In practice, however, Mr. Sanders's plan does leave a much smaller role for private insurance than Canada does. That's because Mr. Sanders's Medicare for all would cover such a wide array of health care benefits, including things that Canada's plan does not cover, like dental care and prescription drugs. Mr. Sanders is fond of saying that private insurers would be welcome to offer coverage for elective cosmetic surgery, an opportunity that few insurers appear interested in covering now.Mr. Steyer wrongly promoted himself as the lone candidate supporting government reparations for African-Americans affected by slavery.""I believe I'm the only person on this stage who believes in reparations for slavery.""False. Ms. Warren also supports reparations for African-Americans, though she has not has been specific about what form those reparations should take, or whether they should include direct payments from the government.Both Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders support a bill introduced by Senator Cory Booker, who dropped out of the presidential race, to study the issue of government reparations and Mr. Sanders has said he would sign the bill should it reach his desk. But he has not explicitly expressed support for reparations.Mr. Biden accurately said that Mr. Sanders voted against a gun control bill five times.""Bernie voted five times against the Brady bill, and wanted a waiting period of 12 hours.""This is true. Mr. Sanders voted against the Brady bill, which mandated a five-day waiting period for gun purchases, five times as Congress considered various versions. Mr. Sanders did vote for an amendment to the bill that would have imposed an instant background check system, but the technology did not exist at the time.But over all, Mr. Sanders has a mixed record on guns and he has acknowledged that his position on guns has evolved, saying at a debate in February that ""the world has changed and my views have changed."" Since 1992, he has received grades ranging from a C- to an F from the National Rifle Association and an F in his most recent re-election campaign in 2018.He has also voted against funding for gun research (though he has since reversed his position), for increasing the burden of proof to prosecute lawbreaking gun dealers, and for allowing firearms on Amtrak trains and in national parks.But Mr. Sanders also fulfilled his pledge to vote in favor of banning assault weapons. He has also voted to regulate high-capacity magazines, expand background checks, prohibit the sale of firearms to people on the government's terrorist watchlist.Mr. Sanders did vote twice to prohibit lawsuits against firearms manufacturers for crimes committed with a gun in 2003. He has since reversed his position and was a co-sponsor of legislation in 2017 and 2019 to repeal the laws that shields gunmakers from liability.Ms. Warren said Mr. Bloomberg had supported Senator Lindsey Graham and other Republicans -- including her opponent in 2012.""Who funded Lindsey Graham's campaign for re-election last time? It was Mayor Bloomberg. And that's not the only right-wing senator that Mayor Bloomberg has funded.""She added, ""In 2012, he scooped in to try to defend another Republican senator against a woman challenger. That was me. It didn't work, but he tried hard.""This is mostly true. Federal records show that Mr. Bloomberg has contributed $86 million to political action committees since 2012. All but about $17 million went to Democrats. Mr. Bloomberg supported specific Republican candidates, including Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, who supported expanded background checks in gun purchases, a priority of Mr. Bloomberg's. He also gave $250,000 in 2014 to a committee supporting Mr. Graham.In 2012, Mr. Bloomberg backed Senator Scott Brown, Republican of Massachusetts, in his losing campaign against Ms. Warren. Mr. Bloomberg said at the time that his support was a result of Mr. Brown's backing of a gun-control measure.In addition, Mr. Bloomberg put $100 million into 24 Democratic campaigns for the House of Representatives in 2018, and 21 of those candidates were successful, helping flip the house to Democratic control.During his 12 years as mayor of New York, Mr. Bloomberg was the primary financial supporter of the Republican majority in the State Senate. He specifically promised support in 2011 to any Republican state senator who voted for marriage equality. The law passed, though Mr. Bloomberg's support was not the only factor.Ms. Warren drew a direct comparison between herself and Mr. Sanders, using her effort to rein in Wall Street as an example of her better record of getting things done.""I dug in, I fought the big banks, I built the coalitions and I won.""Mostly true. Ms. Warren, then a professor at Harvard Law School, pushed for the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the federal agency established by Congress in 2010 as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Mr. Obama called the agency ""Elizabeth's idea"" and applauded her ""sheer force of will, intelligence and a bottomless well of energy.""That said, Mr. Sanders has a long record of advocating an overhaul of Wall Street regulations and for breaking up the big banks -- a central theme of his 2016 campaign against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination.Mr. Buttigieg defended himself against a charge from Mr. Sanders that he had the support of dozens of billionaires.""In Charleston alone, just in Charleston, over 2,000 people have contributed to my campaign. That means the dollars that have come to my campaign, just from Charleston, is more than the dollars that have come from the 50 people that you mentioned.""Forbes magazine named 40 billionaires who have contributed to a total of more than $113,000 to Mr. Buttigieg's campaign as of December 2019. Mr. Buttigieg has a point that his campaign is not predominantly or even largely funded by billionaires. According to the campaign finance watchdog group Open Secrets, Mr. Buttigieg has raised over $35.8 million from individuals who have contributed less than $200 and another $46.6 million from large donations.It's unclear if his specific claim comparing individual donors in Charleston with the billionaire donors is accurate. According to The State, a newspaper in South Carolina, Mr. Buttigieg raised $74,000 from 117 donors in Charleston and $271,202 from all donors in South Carolina. Mr. Buttigieg's average donation was $34 in the fourth quarter of last year, according to his campaign. That's about $68,000 for the 2,000 people, assuming the average holds for South Carolina. Mr. Buttigieg's campaign has received donations from 741,000 people, behind only Mr. Sanders (1.4 million) and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (892,000).Fact checks and explainers by Linda Qiu, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Margot Sanger-Katz, Jim Tankersley and Jim Dwyer.Credit: By The New York TimesPhotographSeven candidates participated in the debate in Charleston, S.C., on Tuesday.

| Jump to first hitHow a day that was supposed to bring clarity to the 2020 race turned into a cliffhanger caucus.DES MOINES -- Every four years since the 1970s, the political gods have smiled upon Iowa, endowing its residents with uncommon power to set the course of national politics as the first nominating contest.For that privilege, Iowa has found itself -- more this year than ever -- in the position of defending its perch. Why should a state so disproportionately white take such a leading role, especially for a Democratic Party that prides itself on its diversity? Why is a hodgepodge of gatherings in school gymnasiums the pinnacle of American democracy?On Monday evening, as the byzantine system left results unreported well after state Democrats had predicted being able to lend some clarity, Iowa's precarious standing appeared to take another hit.""The integrity of the results is paramount,"" Mandy McClure, a spokeswoman for the Iowa Democratic Party, said in an initial statement as the wait persisted. ""We have experienced a delay in the results due to quality checks and the fact that the I.D.P. is reporting out three data sets for the first time.""Later, she added that the party had ""found inconsistencies"" in the reporting of results. ""This is not a hack or an intrusion,"" Ms. McClure said. ""The underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.""For a party that had worked for three years and three months to begin the process of trying to defeat President Trump, the caucus stumble seemed to register as another reason for angst in a season with many -- another surreal turn in a political moment defined by them.All year, Iowa Democrats had grown consumed with identifying the candidate best positioned to counter Mr. Trump this fall. They filled creaky school auditoriums and union halls and overstuffed coffee shops to weigh and measure a roster of contenders that exceeded 20 at its peak.Progressive or moderate? Veteran statesman or relative newcomer? Options abounded.Late Monday night, at least, the state's verdict remained sealed.The state party changed its rules for this year to accommodate concerns that the caucus process was not transparent. Instead of reporting just one number at the end of the night, it would report, on a rolling basis, three numbers per precinct -- a delegate count and the amount of support in both the first and second rounds. But instead of making things clearer, the new process seemed only to muddle matters early in the night.With no hard results to reckon with, several candidates were liberated to give the cheeriest version of their stump speech, hustling to the stage before any math could dampen the mood.""We're going to walk out of here with our share of delegates,"" former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. told supporters. ""We feel good about where we are.""The caucuses, like so much else these last three years, were proceeding in the outsize shadow of executive chaos in Washington -- an impeachment trial that at once consumed valuable news media oxygen ordinarily afforded to the presidential election and temporarily removed several candidates from the campaign trail altogether. The coming days, which are expected to include a State of the Union address and an acquittal for Mr. Trump in the Senate, should only be of a piece.Yet despite the recent competition for attention, perhaps no one has felt the burden of the primary calendar more than the Iowa caucusgoer, charged with setting Democrats on a path toward victory in November against a president viewed by the party as a singular threat. For some Iowans, the pressure proved paralyzing, freezing them in indecision. In interviews for months leading up to the caucuses, many struggled to reconcile the candidate they liked with the candidate they thought others would like -- neighbors, family members, friends in other states.Many were also cognizant that a murky result would weaken Iowa's claim that it acts as a springboard to the nomination. And now, with Monday evening unfolding unevenly, they know it is likely the rest of the country could inherit their anxiety, too.If Iowa did not supply answers on the timeline it usually does, the pre-primary campaign of the past year had already set the direction of the 2020 contest in lasting ways. After a midterm triumph premised often on the success of female and nonwhite candidates, the remaining roster of top contenders is older, whiter and more male-dominated than many Democrats had initially hoped, with front-runners like Senator Bernie Sanders and Mr. Biden.""Voters are just so terrified of Donald Trump being re-elected that they are bending over backwards to avoid anything that looks or feels like 2016,"" said Meredith Kelly, a top aide to the failed 2020 presidential campaign of Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. ""And one very obvious factor was that a woman ultimately lost to Donald Trump.""In her own bid, Senator Elizabeth Warren has appeared perpetually mindful of this mental hurdle for many voters, presenting herself as the candidate of ""unity"" and urging Iowans not to fear voting with their hearts.""I am not afraid,"" she said last year, setting off on a riff she would repeat often, ""and for Democrats to win, you can't be afraid, either.""If nothing else, Ms. Warren and Mr. Sanders have often succeeded in focusing the primary on the merits of progressive policy. With Mr. Biden and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., emphasizing a more consensus-minded pragmatism, the senators have argued for vast economic upheaval and turned a debate over a ""Medicare for all"" health-care system into the campaign's most substantive running dialogue.Warren supporters chanted the tagline of her wealth tax (""two cents!"") as if requesting a song at a concert. Sanders fans nodded with purpose through his signature swipes at the billionaire class -- particularly after two of its members, Michael R. Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, joined the race.The campaign of Mr. Bloomberg, who is not contesting the early states, spent the day merrily sending out news releases about contests scheduled for March or later, when his functionally bottomless resources are expected to sustain his bid. But despite Mr. Bloomberg's recent climb in some national polls, progressives insist they have tapped into a zeal that cannot be purchased.""The grass-roots energy is clearly in the progressive wing of the coalition,"" said Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, which endorsed Ms. Warren. ""Primaries are absolutely the place where you vote your heart, and you vote your values.""At the same time, there can be only one nominee. And as the nomination battle heads to New Hampshire and beyond, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren will be fighting for progressive supremacy, with both hoping to establish themselves as the left's liberal standard-bearer.For a year, the two smothered each other in praise, pulling back if any remark was construed as an attack. On the debate stage, they presented a unified front against the moderate candidates flanking them. But last month, their carefully cultivated unity ruptured after reports that Mr. Sanders had told Ms. Warren privately in 2018 that a woman could not win the presidency. He has denied saying this.Of perhaps greater concern to many Democrats is the incessant rehashing of 2016 slights, with supporters of Mr. Sanders and Hillary Clinton -- who recently insisted that ""nobody likes"" the man she bested in the primary four years ago -- squabbling anew in the days before the caucus.Last week, a top Sanders surrogate, Representative Rashida Tlaib, joined a crowd of Iowans in booing at the mention of Mrs. Clinton, who remains to many Sanders supporters an avatar of corporate centrism.""The haters,"" Ms. Tlaib vowed, ""will shut up on Monday when we win.""Ms. Tlaib apologized afterward for the booing -- an episode that reminded Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ms. Tlaib's congressional ally, about a regret of her own.""If I could have one wish,"" Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in an interview, ""I should have asked Santa to never have us relitigate 2016 ever again.""PhotographDavid Babbitt, 20, center, participating in his first caucus on Monday, cast his vote for Senator Bernie Sanders in Dubuque, Iowa.

| Jump to first hitLAS VEGAS -- Wednesday's debate here was the feistiest of the campaign, but its impact on Saturday's result will be limited. More than 75,000 Nevada Democrats had already cast early ballots before the debate began -- a figure that is close to the total caucus turnout in 2016. Nobody is sure how many more people will caucus in person.Reliable Nevada polling is scarce, but Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont -- a top performer in Iowa and New Hampshire -- is widely presumed to do well here, based on his strength among Latino voters and his organizational advantages in the state. More closely watched is the race for second place.Aides to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden said he needs a top-two finish. Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is coming off her strongest debate performance, and Pete Buttigieg's campaign is well organized in the state.Pete ButtigiegFormer mayor of South Bend, Ind., 38He got more delegates than anyone else in the race from the first two nominating states. That'll end Saturday if, as expected, Mr. Sanders wins Nevada. The test for Mr. Buttigieg is how he performs in the state's black and Latino neighborhoods. He has a robust on-the-ground political organization and hopes to exceed expectations again. But this is the first time that he has been exposed to a critical mass of voters of color, who polls have shown have been cool to his campaign. If he can't appeal to the Democratic Party's most loyal voting blocs, his days as a top-tier candidate may be coming to a close.Days spent in Nevada: 24Money spent on TV ads in Nevada: $1.26 millionNational polling average: 10%Delegates earned so far: 22Bernie SandersSenator from Vermont, 78Everyone says he's expected to win. Other campaigns openly admit they're playing for second. He's got the most money and the biggest organization in Nevada. So anything less than a commanding first-place finish for Mr. Sanders in Nevada would be a disappointment, and threatens to blunt his momentum after a virtual tie in Iowa and a narrow win in New Hampshire.Days spent in Nevada: 20Money spent on TV ads in Nevada: $1.54 millionNational polling average: 28%Delegates earned so far: 21Elizabeth WarrenSenator from Massachusetts, 70She finally had a breakout debate performance, but it was probably too late to matter in Nevada since early voting closed on Tuesday, the day before. The best-case scenario for Ms. Warren is she sneaks into second place and becomes the momentum candidate. Worst case means another fourth-place finish and another failure to break into the race's top tier.Days spent in Nevada: 19Money spent on TV ads in Nevada: $1.51 millionNational polling average: 13%Delegates earned so far: 8Amy KlobucharSenator from Minnesota, 59She ran a shoestring campaign in Nevada, importing staff from Iowa and New Hampshire just days before the caucuses. Like Mr. Buttigieg, she's shown limited appeal with voters of color. And she's been hammered for forgetting the name of the president of Mexico. In Iowa and New Hampshire, Ms. Klobuchar sold herself as a candidate on the rise, someone who beat expectations. Now with higher expectations, the question is whether she can live up to the hype.Days spent in Nevada: 19Money spent on TV ads in Nevada: $838,740National polling average: 7%Delegates earned so far: 7Joseph R. Biden Jr.Former vice president, 77His own team said he needs a second-place finish to regain momentum, after dispiriting performances in Iowa and New Hampshire. But like in those two states, Mr. Biden has an inferior organization in Nevada and has elicited limited excitement from local Democrats. He needs to finally cash in on loyalty and good feelings from Democrats who remember him from the Obama administration. If that doesn't happen in Nevada, South Carolina looms as the last shot for the former front-runner.Days spent in Nevada: 20Money spent on TV ads in Nevada: $1.16 millionNational polling average: 16%Delegates earned so far: 6Tom SteyerFormer hedge fund investor, 62The biggest consequence of Nevada's limited polling is nobody knows what to make of Mr. Steyer. Does all his money buy him a constituency? He's been an afterthought in the news media, though a Friday night concert with '90s R&B group TLC may buy him some attention on caucus eve. But will that turn out caucusgoers for a candidate who hasn't broken out of the low single digits despite also spending enormous sums in Iowa and New Hampshire?Days spent in Nevada: 27Money spent on TV ads in Nevada: $13.55 millionNational polling average: 2%Delegates earned so far: 0Michael R. BloombergFormer Mayor of New York City, 78Mr. Bloomberg is not campaigning in Nevada, but his team bought a billboard on the Las Vegas Strip with one target: President Trump. The rotating ad was attracting attention in Las Vegas on the same day as a rally for the president, who has owned casinos. Among the claims on the billboard is that Mr. Trump cheats at golf. Mr. Bloomberg might know -- they used to play together. Mr. Bloomberg's billboard also compares election records. The former mayor of New York City won the popular vote three times. Mr. Trump lost the popular vote in the general election. This enormous ad is another way for Mr. Bloomberg to show how much money he can throw at anti-Trump messaging.National polling average: 15%Delegates earned so far: 0Photograph(A12; A13)Word count: 877Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitA day after a deceptively edited video of him spread on social media, Joseph R. Biden Jr. cautioned that the Democratic nominee would be vulnerable to false information in the general election.ANAMOSA, Iowa -- As the Democratic presidential candidates fanned out across Iowa and New Hampshire on Thursday to address voters still scarred by President Trump's victory in the 2016 election, Joseph R. Biden Jr. argued that any Democratic nominee would be vulnerable to baseless criticism and disinformation in the general election.Mr. Biden's remarks in Iowa, at his first political event of the 2020 election year, came a day after a deceptive video of him circulated online, highlighting how campaigns are still struggling to combat false information on the internet.""You're going to see a lot more of not only my statements being taken out of context and lied about or altered, you're going to see whomever the Democratic nominee is, because that's how this guy operates,"" Mr. Biden said, adding that Democratic candidates would face unfair attacks from Mr. Trump ""if I were to drop out of the race tomorrow"" or ""if I were to drop dead tomorrow."" (There was no evidence that the video was connected to the president.)Mr. Biden's comment came in response to an event attendee who asked him about his ability to beat Mr. Trump, and also to clarify his remarks in the video, which had been misleadingly edited to wrongly suggest that Mr. Biden was making racist remarks. In fact he was emphasizing the need to change ""our culture"" around violence toward women.Still, the video spread rapidly on social media, amplified by many right-wing verified users on Twitter, including reporters at conservative news outlets, the former speaker of the Missouri House and Republican strategists, according to data compiled by Vinesight, a company that detects disinformation on social media. It is an online environment that alarms many Democratic voters who are gripped by anxiety over how best to defeat Mr. Trump.The president, who was impeached in the House of Representatives in connection with asking Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden, is comfortable only in a ""mosh pit,"" said Mr. Biden, who has faced months of false or exaggerated attacks from Mr. Trump and other Republicans.Still, he argued that the Democratic Party was in a far stronger position today to confront Mr. Trump than in 2016, noting support for the president's impeachment among some voters -- ""Hillary didn't have that advantage"" -- and saying that in the previous campaign, not everyone took Mr. Trump seriously.In response to the questioner, who also asked whether he was running a better campaign than Hillary Clinton had, Mr. Biden offered a wide-ranging answer and relitigated how Mrs. Clinton handled a debate after Mr. Trump was caught on tape bragging about making unsolicited sexual advances.He suggested that Mrs. Clinton could have changed the subject, pivoting to how she hoped to change voters' lives. Instead, Mr. Biden said, ""she did what every other candidate probably would have done"" by lacing into his character, yielding an ugly debate, and ""it all went down the drain."" Yet before that debate even started, Mr. Trump had invited several women who had made allegations against former President Bill Clinton to join him for a photo opportunity.Mr. Biden also noted sexism as he discussed the last campaign, which he called ""unfair,"" but added, ""That's not going to happen with me.""It was not just Mr. Biden who was ruminating on the 2016 election on Thursday; Mrs. Clinton's loss in the Electoral College was on the minds of other candidates as well as voters.At a campaign office opening in Plymouth, N.H., the entrepreneur Andrew Yang told voters: ""Donald Trump is our president today because he had a very simple message -- he said he was going to 'make America great again.' What did Hillary Clinton say in response? 'America is already great.""'""That did not quite work,"" Mr. Yang said. ""The problems are real. The struggles are real. Many Americans are being left behind. But Donald Trump's solutions were not what we need.""And Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, campaigning at a town-hall-style event in Concord, N.H., was asked by a voter whether she would work to unite the party around the Democratic nominee if it was not her. The voter noted how some supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont did not rally behind Mrs. Clinton in the general election against Mr. Trump.Ms. Warren began a lengthy answer by first committing to party unity: ""Every single person who is in the race for the Democratic nomination for president would make a far better president than Donald Trump,"" she said to applause.""I'm in all the way,"" she added, and started making the case for differences between the 2020 race and the 2016 campaign -- chiefly, in her telling, the palpably greater determination and intensity among Democrats to beat Mr. Trump.""What we have to remind ourselves is, 2020 is not 2016. The world has changed,"" she said, recalling the protest marches after Mr. Trump's inauguration and the Democratic victories in 2018 in the House of Representatives and key governorships, and in 2019 in Kentucky, Louisiana and Virginia.""We are getting stronger and we are in this fight,"" she said. ""2020 gives us this remarkable moment that is very different from '16 or '12 or '08 or however far you want to go back. This moment where Americans are off the sidelines.""Saying that ""the door is open a crack"" to an era of major reforms and the end of ""business as usual,"" she added: ""Think about it -- a nation that elects someone like Donald Trump is a nation that has got serious problems. Going back is not where we want to be. Our chance in 2020 is to look at that crack, drop our shoulder, run hard at it and build the America we want to be.""Asked for comment, a Republican National Committee spokesman, Steve Guest, said, ""Insulting half the country didn't work for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and it won't work for the Democrats in 2020, either.""Mr. Sanders, another leading progressive in the race, also waded into the debate over how to defeat Mr. Trump as he uncorked some of his fiercest criticism of Mr. Biden to date in an interview with The Washington Post.""It's just a lot of baggage that Joe takes into a campaign, which isn't going to create energy and excitement,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""He brings into this campaign a record which is so weak that it just cannot create the kind of excitement and energy that is going to be needed to defeat Donald Trump.""Mr. Sanders on Thursday reported an eye-popping fund-raising haul of more than $34.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, according to his campaign, ahead of Mr. Biden at $22.7 million -- Mr. Biden's strongest quarter to date -- as well as former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose campaign reported more than $24.7 million.Even as Mr. Sanders sharpened his attacks on Mr. Biden in the interview, he largely stuck to his familiar message on the trail in Iowa on Thursday, denouncing income inequality and championing his signature policy proposal, ""Medicare for all."" At a canvass kickoff in Grinnell, he jokingly named a young girl as his running mate.As he boarded his new campaign bus after that event, he briefly answered a question about his fourth-quarter fund-raising, calling attention specifically to the more than five million contributions his campaign had received since he entered the race. ""That tells me the kind of grass-roots support that we have and tells me why we're going to win the nomination and why we're going to defeat Donald Trump,"" he said.Reporting was contributed by Patrick Healy and Matt Stevens from Concord, N.H.; Sydney Ember from Muscatine, Iowa; and Nick Corasaniti from New York.PhotographJoseph R. Biden Jr. said at a campaign event in Anamosa, Iowa, on Thursday that voters were likely to see more of his statements ""being taken out of context and lied about or altered.""

| Jump to first hitRepublicans want to cast President Trump's impeachment as a narrow argument over aid to Ukraine. Democrats want to describe it as part of a broader struggle with Russia.WASHINGTON -- When Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a curse-laden tirade to a reporter on Friday, asked, ""Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?"" he was getting at an essential element of President Trump's defense in the impeachment trial. White House officials are convinced that Americans are indifferent to what happens in the struggling former Soviet republic, and they may well be right.But the impeachment trial is about more than the fate of Ukraine -- and whether Mr. Trump sold it out for a ""domestic political errand,"" as his former adviser, Fiona Hill, put it so bitingly. To Democrats, it's about a president who undercut his own administration's stated goal of pushing back hard against Vladimir V. Putin's Russia -- the geopolitical challenge of a new, very different Cold War.It is one of those cases where the geography of the debate shapes the politics of the argument.As long as the president's lawyers can focus the debate on the narrower question of Ukraine, they can argue that the charges against the president focus on a foreign policy sideshow: how the president uses the spigot of American aid and attention to mold another country's behavior.""They basically said, 'Let's cancel an election over a meeting with the Ukraine,""' Mr. Trump's White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, said on Saturday, characterizing the Democrats' arguments as he opened the president's defense. Mr. Cipollone made the case that the Democrats are seeking to undo Mr. Trump's 2016 victory or fear that they cannot beat him in 2020.Yet the defense team's characterizations about Ukraine are also designed to make the impeachment charges appear to be on a fundamentally trivial affair, surrounding the treatment of a faraway country that, as Mr. Pompeo suggests, most people could not find on a map stripped of country names. (He challenged the NPR reporter, Mary Louise Kelly, to identify Ukraine, and she reported that she did.)That is precisely why the man leading the Democrats' prosecution of the case, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, focused so relentlessly on Russia last week.Mr. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, understands that Russia resonates in a way that Ukraine never can. His argument revives questions of whether Mr. Putin has some strange, still unexplained control over the American president -- which is why Mr. Schiff played the cringe-worthy tape of Mr. Trump's news conference with Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, in summer 2018. In his public statements, Mr. Trump appeared to adopt the Russian leader's self-interested theory that someone else was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's servers in the last presidential election.""It's a breathtaking success of Russian intelligence,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""This is the most incredible propaganda coup,"" he continued, because ""it's not just that the president of the United States standing next to Vladimir Putin is reading the Kremlin talking points. He won't read his own national security staff talking points.""Cast that way, this is no argument over American aid to Kyiv, new details of which emerged on Sunday in an unpublished manuscript by John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser. Instead, the entire matter is part of a battle over Russia's use of Ukraine as a petri dish in disruption -- the place where Mr. Putin has experimented with seizing territory, undermining a hostile government and conducting cyberattacks that literally turned off the lights.And it is an argument over Mr. Putin's efforts to manipulate the 2020 election, at a moment when even Mr. Trump's own Department of Homeland Security says the Russians are already testing new techniques. By demanding that the new president of Ukraine investigate Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and a political opponent of Mr. Trump, and reviving theories that the Democratic National Committee's server is somewhere in Ukraine, Mr. Trump was essentially joining that manipulation effort, Mr. Schiff was saying.""The threat that he will continue to abuse his power and cause grave harm to the nation,"" Mr. Schiff said of the president, ""is not hypothetical.""In less partisan times -- say, when a presidential election does not loom -- Mr. Schiff's argument might strike a political chord, chiefly because it is the Republicans who, until recently, have been particularly hawkish about Mr. Putin's Russia.It is easy to forget now, but when Mr. Trump tried to water down sanctions on Russia two years ago, his own party pushed back so hard that new penalties for Moscow passed 98 to 2. (In one of the strange twists of history, one of the two opposing votes was cast by Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who is a leading contender to take on Mr. Trump in November.) In the House, the measure passed 419 to 3. Angry, Mr. Trump signed the bill, knowing any veto would be overturned.But the politics of impeachment are different than the politics of sanctions. So it is no surprise that, as the Republicans focus on Ukraine and the Democrats focus on Russia, both are bending the facts to fit their case.Mr. Pompeo, for example, has been known to pause his episodic blasts at State Department correspondents to make the legitimate point that it was the Trump administration that gave powerful anti-tank weapons -- called Javelins -- to Ukrainian forces, a step that President Barack Obama refused.The issue came up this weekend, as Jay Sekulow accused the Democrats of keeping that fact out of their 23 hours of arguments. ""Javelin missiles are serious weapons,"" Mr. Sekulow, the president's personal lawyer, reminded the senators at the trial on Saturday. He quoted the testimony of the two previous top American diplomats in Ukraine, including Marie L. Yovanovitch, who was recalled from her post last year, in one of the events at the center of the impeachment charges.The Javelin decision is the best piece of evidence that the Republicans have at hand that Mr. Trump has been willing to stand up to Mr. Putin. Almost everything else cuts the other way, leaving little doubt that in twisting the arm of the new Ukrainian government, Mr. Trump was not only pursuing his own political interests but also helping Mr. Putin's.Even before he was elected, Mr. Trump wondered aloud why the United States was helping Ukraine fight off the Russians. It made no sense, he argued in a March 2016 interview on foreign policy, his first extended discussion of his worldview as a candidate.""Now I'm all for Ukraine, I have friends that live in Ukraine,"" Mr. Trump said during the interview at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida golf resort. He complained that when the Obama administration moved to impose sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea and ""was getting very confrontational, it didn't seem to me like anyone else cared other than us.""He added: ""Even their neighbors didn't seem to be talking about it. And, you know, you look at Germany, you look at other countries, and they didn't seem to be very much involved.""In fact, they were very involved and continue to provide aid to Ukraine to prop up its democracy and its economy while often complaining about rampant corruption. But in the interview, Mr. Trump made no mention of corruption; instead, he lumped Ukraine in with the many other examples he cited of nations that the United States supports while other countries freeload.The release over the weekend of a recording of Mr. Trump at a dinner in 2018 makes clear that the president understood early in his term that unless aid continued to Ukraine, it could be easily overrun.""How long would they last in a fight with Russia?"" Mr. Trump asked at the dinner.""I don't think very long,"" said Lev Parnas, the Soviet émigré who worked for Rudolph W. Giuliani in pressuring Ukraine. ""Without us, not very long.""What's missing from the record of Mr. Trump's manipulation of the aid to Ukraine last summer is any indication that he sought an assessment from the Pentagon, the intelligence agencies or his own National Security Council over whether suspending American help might, in fact, lead to the downfall of the Ukrainian government.And that, in the end, may be the most telling fact of all.If nothing else, what Americans learned from watching the impeachment trial over the past week is that Mr. Trump seemed to regard the conduct of foreign policy the way he has regarded any other policy: a chess move toward re-election rather than geopolitical advantage for the United States. Otherwise, there would be conversations weighing the benefits of restricting aid against the harm to American interests in countering the power of Russia.There is anecdotal evidence that many around Mr. Trump did in fact push back -- including Mr. Pompeo, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, and the C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel. Their arguments were ignored until a whistle-blower's complaint made clear that the suspension of aid to Ukraine was about to become public.So far, not one has testified as part of the impeachment process or spoken publicly about what they told Mr. Trump about the potential consequences of his domestic political errand. It is a silence that speaks as loudly as the arguments made in the Senate.PhotographDefending President Trump, Republicans have cited Javelin missile sales to Ukraine.

| Jump to first hitTeenagers are campaigning, debating, running fact checks and forming party-based coalitions (hype houses). One of them called it ""cable news for young people.""As Twitter and Facebook continue to dominate conversations about social media and the 2020 presidential election, TikTok is quietly becoming a political force.Teenagers in America -- many of them too young to vote -- are forming political coalitions on TikTok to campaign for their chosen candidates, post news updates and fact check opponents. They are sharing real-time commentary for an audience that is far more likely to watch YouTube videos than turn on a cable news channel.In a sense, these TikTok users are building short-form TV networks, each with a cast of talking heads. On TikTok they're called hype houses, named after the high-powered influencer collab house in Los Angeles. These political houses are not physical homes, but virtual, ideological ones represented by group accounts.There are conservative-leaning houses (@conservativehypehouse, @theconservativehypehouse, @TikTokrepublicans and @therepublicanhypehouse, which amassed more than 217,000 followers in under a month) and liberal ones (@liberalhypehouse, @leftist.hype.house). There are also bipartisan houses, for users who love discourse, and undecided houses, for those who aren't sure what or whom they love.""I do feel like TikTok is cable news for young people,"" said Sterling Cade Lewis, 19, who has nearly 100,000 followers. ""CNN and Fox and big-name news media, those are all geared toward people who have honestly grown up with a longer attention span.""TikToks, on the other hand, run a maximum of 60 seconds; most videos are as short as 15. ""Being able to make shorter videos and educational clips, it's easier to connect with a younger generation who's just swiping through their phones 24/7,"" Mr. Lewis said.In recent months, content on TikTok has been getting more political. Before the general election in Britain in December, TikTok users there voiced their opinions on Brexit through popular formats, including lip syncs, skits and ""checks"" (self-assessments, essentially). In the United States, political videos have revolved around the Trump administration, the Democratic presidential primary and the general presidential election in November.The nickname ""Mayo Pete,"" for example, was popularized on TikTok, as was a popular meme about Mike Pence, suggesting that he is in favor of gay conversion therapy. (Vice President Pence is opposed to same-sex marriage, but he has never voiced support for conversion therapy.). Political hype houses were born out of this enthusiasm for election-related content.Political TikToks often rely on popular trends and dances. In one video, Kyndal, 14 and a member of @liberalhypehouse, does a dance as she points to statistics about President Trump's history of racist comments.For the most part, these videos revolve around two candidates: Bernie Sanders and Mr. Trump. ""The Republican hype houses all root for Trump, and the liberal hype houses all root for Bernie,"" said Javon Fonville, 19, the founder of the progressive hype house (handle: @votebernie2020).Many users are campaigning hard, especially because they may not be of voting age in time for Nov. 3. ""I feel like I am making an impact on the election even though I can't vote,"" Izzy, 17, said of her pro-Sanders TikToks.Many of these creators look up to YouTube's political commentators and have sought to replicate their success on TikTok, where growth can happen rapidly. Benjamin Williams, 19, said the platform is ideal for the kind of videos he wants to make and the audience he hopes to reach. ""A lot of political stuff is on Facebook and Twitter, but Gen Z isn't really into that stuff,"" he said. ""With TikTok you can put politics into comedy and have someone their age talking like they're a friend.""Mr. Williams said he is inspired by YouTubers like Steven Crowder, Tim Pool and Paul Joseph Watson, a prominent far-right personality and Infowars contributor who is known for spreading conspiracy theories.Speaking of which: TikTok has struggled to prevent conspiracy theories from spreading across the app. Media Matters, a nonprofit, recently issued a report on the platform's role in spreading false information on the coronavirus.""It worries me a lot that some of these videos have one million views,"" Kyndal, of @liberalhypehouse, said, referring to the misinformation on the platform. ""Knowing that one million impressionable teens have seen this video and chosen to believe or not believe it.""A TikTok spokeswoman wrote in an email: ""We encourage our users to have respectful conversations about the subjects that matter to them. However, our Community Guidelines do not permit misinformation that could cause harm to our community or the larger public.""For many members of political hype houses, tamping down on misinformation is a top concern. When various accounts began citing the claim that Mr. Sanders intended to tax Americans making more than $29,000 a year at a rate higher than 50 percent, Jordan Tirona, 19, responded with a video debunking it.Though they disagree on major issues, members of different political groups frequently engage with each other. Their videos often go viral when they ""duet"" on major issues. (Duetting is a feature on TikTok that allows users to respond to videos with videos of their own and post them side by side.)The @republicanhypehouse and @liberalhypehouse accounts frequently duet over health care reform and corporate tax rates. TikTokers across the partisan divide also take part in live-streamed debates on TikTok.Cam Higby, 20, the founder of the bipartisan hype house who also posts under @republicanism, said that ultimately he wants to build a platform on TikTok where anyone can promote their opinions, whether they're on the right or left. He live-streams himself for hours, debating people on TikTok and Discord.Many members of Gen Z will be voting for the first time in the 2020 presidential election. Those who can't have been taking political action in other ways, especially on social media.""I think it's cool when you have people who are like 14 trying to get involved in politics and educate themselves,"" Mr. Higby said. ""Those are the people -- they're not voting this year, but they'll be voting within the next term.""Photograph(PHOTOGRAPHS VIA TIKTOK)Word count: 994Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitHe's gaining, and he has some considerable advantages he lacked in 2016.At this point in 2016, Bernie Sanders was competitive in Iowa but had no clear path to the nomination. Four years later, he finds himself in an enviable position: rising in the polls, enjoying the most resources, and facing relatively few attacks from his campaign rivals.A CNN/SSRS poll on Wednesday found him leading Joe Biden nationwide, 27 percent to 24 percent. In an average of polls, Mr. Biden still leads by about six percentage points, but his advantage over Mr. Sanders has been cut in half over the last three months.Mr. Sanders's position may be even better in the early states. The Selzer poll, Iowa's most highly awaited survey, shows him with a narrow lead in Iowa. Other polls show him gaining, though split on exactly where he stands in a divided field. He also remains well positioned in New Hampshire, giving him a chance to sweep the two early states.Large elements of the Democratic establishment strongly oppose Mr. Sanders, who is not a Democrat, raising the possibility of a vigorous campaign to stop him if he emerges as a front-runner. But it is clear that if he wins the early states, he will not face the obstacles that made it all but impossible for him to win the nomination in 2016.Mr. Sanders's current standing might be surprising considering his circumstances as recently as a few months ago. He had a heart attack in October. He seemed stuck in third place in national polls, with around 15 percent support. Well-known candidates with just 15 percent support do not usually go on to win. A factional rival for support on the left, Elizabeth Warren, had steadily gained in the polls.But the events of that same period opened a path for Mr. Sanders.In one sense, Ms. Warren's rise in the polls might have gone too well. Her standing began to falter around the time she matched Mr. Biden in national polls, which invited scrutiny from the news media and her opponents. Her position on ""Medicare for all"" funding and her weak standing in hypothetical polling matchups against the president offered avenues for attack. At the same time, Pete Buttigieg surged to the lead in Iowa; he and Ms. Warren promptly clashed, preventing either from solidifying a strong position in the state.In most elections, conflict between these two idealistic liberal candidates would have been good news for the establishment favorite, Mr. Biden. But he never emerged as a classic establishment front-runner, someone with a daunting number of endorsements and superior resources. He found himself outspent, in some cases by a wide margin, by lesser-known rivals at exactly the point in the race when an establishment front-runner would have been expected to spend lots of money to overpower his rivals.Mr. Biden's weak elite support has done more than simply deprive him of the resources to capitalize on his opening in Iowa. It has led many elite supporters to seek an alternative, empowering rivals who have weakened Mr. Biden further. Some have gone to Mr. Buttigieg, who has raised far more money than Mr. Biden.One elite supporter -- Michael Bloomberg -- has actually entered the race, and could sap Mr. Biden's support on Super Tuesday on March 3. Well-timed endorsements at Mr. Biden's expense could plausibly push another rival, Amy Klobuchar, into contention in Iowa.Throughout all this, Mr. Sanders has gone relatively unscathed. His position in the polls -- just behind the front-runners, without obvious momentum -- gave his opponents no incentive to attack. And he received less scrutiny from the news media than he might have otherwise. His supporters were the likeliest to say they had made up their minds, offering even less reason for a rival campaign to attack him. Yet Mr. Sanders outraised all of his opponents, giving him the resources to push ahead while squabbles -- such as between Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg -- weakened others.These are the kinds of conditions that often contribute to late movement in primary contests and, indeed, Mr. Sanders has steadily risen in national and early state polls.His lead in the Ann Selzer/Des Moines Register/CNN poll nearly two weeks ago marked the moment when these conditions no longer clearly held. But his opponents largely declined to attack Mr. Sanders at the most recent debate. Ms. Warren's allegation that Mr. Sanders told her that she couldn't win the general election because she was a woman was not pursued vigorously at the debate or thereafter.With just under two weeks to go until the Iowa caucuses, it remains unclear whether Mr. Sanders or anyone else has a meaningful lead in the state. But Mr. Sanders faces fewer obstacles than he did in 2016. Hillary Clinton was a juggernaut who consistently held around 50 percent support in national polls throughout the race and an overwhelming lead among black voters.This time, it's conceivable that Mr. Sanders will face a split field after Iowa and New Hampshire, with as many as four rivals positioned to claim a strong showing in the two early states and with Mr. Bloomberg spending hundreds of millions of dollars on his own behalf.Mr. Sanders's position among nonwhite voters is also better today than it was in 2016. Polls suggest he is leading among Hispanic voters, who will play a meaningful role in Texas and California on Super Tuesday.He still trails Mr. Biden among black voters, but he is far more competitive among them than he was four years ago. A recent Washington Post/Ipsos poll gave Mr. Biden a lead of 48 percent to 20 percent lead among black voters, less than Mrs. Clinton's commanding 80-20 advantage.The Sanders gains are driven by strength among younger black voters, who back him by 12 points. Over all, his weakness among black voters is an obstacle, but not an insurmountable one.At this point, his main weakness is arguably among white voters, at least as judged against his performance in 2016 or the performances of prior outsider, ideologically consistent candidates. In 2016, he won New Hampshire by a wide margin and essentially fought Mrs. Clinton to a draw in Iowa while badly trailing in national polls.Of course, he could still lose both states. But if he wins, he will face far greater scrutiny. As Ms. Warren can attest, front-runner status brings a different kind of treatment from the news media and rival campaigns, which can halt or reverse a candidate's gains. The breadth of the opposition to Mr. Sanders among Democratic elites increases the likelihood of a vigorous attempt to halt his momentum.There is no reason to assume that he can build a winning coalition in the face of heightened scrutiny or a concerted effort to stop his campaign, even if he wins Iowa.But as the recent polling shows, there's also no reason to assume he can't.PhotographBernie Sanders during a rally Saturday in Manchester, N.H., a state where he remains well positioned, giving him a chance to sweep voting there and in Iowa.

| Jump to first hitThe decision suggests that the Sanders campaign is largely ceding another Southern state to Joseph R. Biden Jr. and going all-in on the Midwest instead.BURLINGTON, Vt. -- Senator Bernie Sanders has canceled a planned rally in Jackson, Miss., and will instead travel to Michigan on Friday, a striking indication that his presidential campaign is shifting its focus to the Midwest and largely ceding another Southern state to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., according to people familiar with the plans.After holding a rally in Phoenix on Thursday night, Mr. Sanders had been scheduled to travel to Jackson on Friday for a rally focused on racial justice.The change in plans suggests that Mr. Sanders will not challenge Mr. Biden for the support of black voters in the South -- a vital base in the Democratic Party -- and is instead going all-in on the Midwest as he tries to compete with Mr. Biden for working-class voters there. Black voters in the South have overwhelmingly backed Mr. Biden to this point, and on Super Tuesday this week their support lifted him in states like Alabama, North Carolina and Virginia.In Alabama, Mr. Sanders won only 9 percent of black voters, compared with 72 percent for Mr. Biden, according to exit polls. Mr. Biden outperformed Mr. Sanders among black voters in Virginia by more than 50 points, and by 40 points or more in Texas and North Carolina. In several states, Mr. Sanders came in third among black voters, behind not only Mr. Biden but also Michael R. Bloomberg.Mr. Bloomberg quit the race a day later, and Mr. Sanders's ideological rival on the left, Senator Elizabeth Warren, announced on Thursday that she was dropping out as well, effectively making the Democratic contest a two-man race between Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden.The shift in Mr. Sanders's schedule was also an acknowledgment that he had not improved his standing among black voters in the South four years after his first run for president. In 2016, he faced criticism for his inability to organize support from African-Americans, a weakness that contributed to his loss to Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primary.Speaking to reporters in Burlington on Thursday, Mr. Sanders acknowledged the scheduling change but said his campaign was sending staff members to Mississippi, which votes next Tuesday, along with Michigan and four other states. Michigan is the biggest prize of that day, awarding more than three times the pledged delegates of Mississippi.""If possible, I will try to get to Mississippi,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""You can't go every place.""""We're very proud of the fact that we have strong support in the African-American community,"" he added. ""We are going to be working with the African-American community, the Muslim community, in Michigan, and in every state in the country.""Asked if he saw a path forward for his campaign without winning Michigan, Mr. Sanders said he did. ""Every state is important,"" he said. ""Michigan is very, very important.""He also acknowledged Ms. Warren's exit from the race, crediting her with running a ""strong, issue-oriented campaign"" that ""changed political consciousness in America.""""I would simply say to her supporters out there, of whom there are millions, we are opening the door to you, we would love you to come on board,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""Together I think we can win this primary process.""Sanders aides are confident that Mr. Sanders lines up favorably against Mr. Biden in the industrial Midwest, and they have already laid out plans to highlight Mr. Biden's record on trade, which includes voting for the North American Free Trade Agreement. While many blue-collar voters say they feel a connection to Mr. Biden, many have also grown increasingly suspicious of free trade in the Trump era.In an interview, Faiz Shakir, the campaign manager for Mr. Sanders, said the campaign was considering running an ad in Midwestern states like Michigan and Ohio that will emphasize Mr. Biden's record on trade, and Mr. Sanders has already added blistering remarks about Mr. Biden into his stump speech.""I will be talking in Michigan about the fact that Joe supported disastrous trade agreements,"" Mr. Sanders said Thursday.At an event in Phoenix on Thursday night, his first rally since Super Tuesday, Mr. Sanders laced into Mr. Biden for his record on trade, the Iraq war and Social Security, as he has done recently.But he also opened two new lines of attack, knocking Mr. Biden for his past votes for the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy that prohibited openly gay people from serving in the military and for his past support for the Hyde Amendment, a measure that bans federal funding for most abortions.""When you've got two candidates, unlike when you have 18 candidates, it is possible to really contrast the views of the candidates,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""That's what I'm going to do.""There was a brief disruption at the rally in Phoenix when a man in the crowd unfurled a Nazi flag bearing a swastika, before he was quickly removed. ""The senator is aware of the flag with the swastika on it and is disturbed by it,"" said Mike Casca, a campaign spokesman. Mr. Sanders is Jewish.A crucial part of Mr. Sanders's argument has been the idea that he is the most electable candidate, able to defeat President Trump in a general election by appealing to the same working-class white voters who helped hand Mr. Trump his victory in 2016. But among aides and advisers, there has been a growing recognition that his claim hinges on his ability to demonstrate this strength in Midwestern states during the primary.Mr. Sanders's disappointing performance on Super Tuesday -- he won only four states to Mr. Biden's 10 -- has only increased the sense of urgency inside his campaign.At a news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Sanders said he was ""disappointed"" in the Super Tuesday results. And in an extraordinary concession, he admitted that his campaign had not managed to generate the soaring turnout among young people that he had banked on to secure the nomination.While Mr. Sanders has managed to draw support in high numbers among other demographic groups, including Latino voters, his deficit with black voters in the South was central to his losses on Super Tuesday.Rather than cite his own shortcomings, however, Mr. Sanders has pointed to his opponents' strong connections with African-American voters. In an interview on Wednesday night with Rachel Maddow of MSNBC, he suggested that Mr. Biden was benefiting from his relationship with former President Barack Obama -- and used a parallel argument to explain his deficit in 2016 as well.""We're running against somebody who has touted his relationship with Barack Obama for eight years,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""Barack Obama is enormously popular in this country in general and the African-American community. Running against Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton was enormously popular.""""It's not that I'm not popular,"" he added. ""Biden is running with his ties to Obama and that's working well.""He also said he was generally doing well among voters of color, including Latinos, and with younger black voters.PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders is turning his focus to Michigan, a ""very, very important"" state in the race.

| Jump to first hit1988March 8Sweep for Bush, 
But a Battle 
For DukakisRepublicans Vice President Bush took a long stride toward the Republican Presidential nomination yesterday by sweeping all 16 primaries at stake.At the end of a day when more convention delegates were picked in both parties than had ever before been chosen at one time, the Vice President appeared to have at least half the number needed to win the nomination.About a third of the delegates to each party's nominating convention were at stake yesterday. While Democratic primaries or caucuses were underway in 20 states, Republicans were voting in 16 primaries, 14 of them in the South or border states.The Vice President called the results of Super Tuesday a ""major political victory"" that exceeded his ""fondest expectations.""""I'm going to be the next President,"" he said. By Michael OreskesDemocrats Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, the Rev. Jesse Jackson and Senator Albert Gore Jr. divided the biggest one-day harvest of national convention delegates of this election year yesterday.But Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, short of cash and under siege from his foes, was badly beaten almost everywhere, putting the future of his campaign in peril.Mr. Dukakis won Texas, Florida and Massachusetts, the largest states at stake in yesterday's round of 21 Democratic primaries and caucuses. But Mr. Jackson, riding the near unanimous approval of black voters, and Mr. Gore ran ahead of Mr. Dukakis in most of the other Southern states. By E. J. Dionne Jr.POSTSCRIPT Mr. Bush won the general election going away, with more than 53 percent of the popular vote and 426 electoral votes.1992March 10 Clinton Says
He Is Offering 
'Something New'Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas dominated former Senator Paul E. Tsongas today in the biggest test so far of the primary season, winning a string of victories in his native South, including a decisive triumph in Florida.The Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses, held in 11 states, gave Mr. Clinton a powerful lift in his drive for the Democratic Presidential nomination as the race moves on to the March 17 contests in Illinois and Michigan. For Mr. Tsongas, those contests now become critical as he seeks to repair the damage caused by his heavy losses across the South, most tellingly in Florida, the one Southern state where he had hoped to hold the line.On the Republican side, President Bush won commandingly across the region, with about two-thirds or more of the vote everywhere. But the President was once again given a warning for the November election, that even in Bush strongholds like Texas and Florida, a sizable minority of Republican voters would vote against him. Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, won a third of the vote in Florida, a little less than a quarter in Texas and had similar backing in most other states.Mr. Clinton, for his part, seemed to be reaching out for the change-oriented voters who were drawn in many states to Mr. Tsongas. In his victory speech in Chicago tonight, the Arkansas Governor cast the election as a chance to break decisively with the politics of the past decade: ""a choice of more of the 80s versus something new in the 90s.""""The people in the South heard the worst about me, but they saw the best,"" Mr. Clinton said.By Robin TonerPS The third-party candidacy of Ross Perot changed the math a bit here, as Mr. Clinton won it all with only 43 percent of the vote.1996March 5 Dole Cruises,
And Makes Call 
For Party UnitySenator Bob Dole won a clean sweep of eight primaries spanning New England, the Rockies and as far South as Georgia yesterday, leaping far ahead of his rivals in the biggest test thus far of the Republican Presidential primary season.In a string of triumphs in politically and geographically diverse states that he said demonstrated his ability to unite Republicans, Mr. Dole handily won in Georgia, Massachusetts, Colorado, Connecticut, Maryland, Vermont, Maine and Rhode Island.The results apparently claimed two casualties, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana and former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee. Aides to both said they would announce their withdrawals from the race on Wednesday.Two of Mr. Dole's rivals who have never held elective office -- Mr. Buchanan and Steve Forbes -- vowed to press on even though they competed for a distant second or third place in most of the contests yesterday.At a boisterous victory rally last night on Capitol Hill, Mr. Dole set his sights on President Clinton rather than dwell on the intramural competition. After buoyantly reciting state after state where he had won, Mr. Dole declared: ""Tonight we're proving the pundits wrong -- and pretty soon we're going to unite and beat Bill Clinton in 1996.""Asked by reporters yesterday about how strong he would be against Mr. Clinton, the 72-year-old Senator replied: ""He's a little taller than I am, but I've got lower blood pressure and lower cholesterol -- and I'm not going to make health an issue in the campaign."" By Richard L. BerkePS Mr. Clinton became the first Democrat since Franklin D. Roosevelt to win consecutive terms.2000March 7 Bush and Gore
On the Attack
After Easy Wins
Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore crushed their rivals from ocean to ocean yesterday in powerful displays that assured them their parties' nominations.After claiming the two biggest electoral powerhouses, California and New York, which account for more than 40 percent of the delegates chosen yesterday, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore immediately turned to each other -- and to firing the first salvos of the more than eight-month general election campaign that lies ahead.Mr. Bush laid out several themes for the general election in a combative speech that was devoted not to his challenger, Senator John McCain, but to lambasting Mr. Gore. ""He is the candidate of the status quo in Washington, D.C., and he has a tough case to make in the general election,"" Mr. Bush said to supporters in Austin, Tex.At boisterous rally in Nashville earlier in the evening, Mr. Gore did not mention Mr. Bush by name but called on the Republican nominee to debate him twice a week and to spurn unregulated soft money donations.Mr. Gore's opponent, former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, did not win one state, a defeat so pronounced that his advisers said it was only a matter of days before he withdraws. And Mr. McCain said he would retreat to the mountains of Arizona to ""take stock of our losses"" and decide whether to proceed.In several states Mr. Gore held a ratio of 3 to 1 or better. The Republican verdict was decisive, though not as unanimous.By Richard L. BerkePS After a long recount in Florida, and a Supreme Court decision, Mr. Bush prevailed by only five electoral votes.2004March 2 Kerry's Big Night
Drives Edwards
Out of the RaceSenator John Kerry blazed to victories in Democratic primaries from New York to California yesterday, effectively capturing his party's presidential nomination and prompting his main rival, Senator John Edwards, to move to end his campaign.Mr. Kerry defeated Mr. Edwards in almost every state, including Ohio and Georgia, where Mr. Edwards had been looking for a victory to keep his candidacy alive, in what was shaping up as a nationwide romp. Faced with a staggering night of losses, Mr. Edwards flew home to Raleigh, N.C., last night to withdraw from the race today, an aide said.President Bush called Mr. Kerry, of Massachusetts, to congratulate him on his victories. ""I said, 'I hope we have a great debate about the issues before the country,""' Mr. Kerry said, recounting his conversation with the president.Mr. Kerry's hope for a 10-state sweep was frustrated not by Mr. Edwards but by Howard Dean, his onetime nemesis, who finally won his first primary, in Vermont, his home state, two weeks after he withdrew from the race.Most of all, Mr. Kerry offered a vigorous attack on the White House, previewing what officials in both parties said would be an extraordinarily rough general election campaign.""I am a fighter,"" he proclaimed, and proceeded to use the platform of his nationally televised remarks to attack Mr. Bush for proposing a constitutional amendment to outlaw same-sex marriages.""George Bush, who promised to become a uniter, has become the great divider.""By Adam NagourneyPS Mr. Bush won just over half the popular vote and had a 35-vote edge in the Electoral College.2008Feb. 5 Democrats' Race
Still Too Close
As McCain RollsRepublicans Senator John McCain of Arizona won the most states and appeared poised to win the most delegates on Tuesday with impressive primary victories in the delegate-rich states of California, New York and Illinois. Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor, revived his candidacy with victories across the South.Their strong showings posed a serious challenge to the candidacy of Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, who vowed to press on with his campaign after winning in Montana, North Dakota, Minnesota, Massachusetts and Utah.By Michael CooperDemocrats Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama carved up the nation in the 22-state nominating contest on Tuesday, leaving the Democratic presidential nomination more elusive than ever. Mrs. Clinton won California, Massachusetts, New Jersey and her home state, New York, while Mr. Obama took Connecticut, Georgia, Minnesota and his base in Illinois.It was a night of drama as millions of Democrats cleaved sharply between two candidates offering them a historic first: The opportunity to nominate a woman or an African-American to lead their party's effort to reclaim the White House. Yet it was also a night when neither Mr. Obama nor Mrs. Clinton could decisively lay claim -- or even secure an edge -- to the nomination, assuring an electoral fight that will unfold for weeks to come. By Patrick HealyPS Mr. Obama rolled past Mr. McCain with more than 69 million votes, still the highest total for a presidential candidate.2012March 6 Edge for Romney,
But Republicans
Keep On SluggingMitt Romney appeared to pull off a narrow victory in Ohio on Super Tuesday but lost several other states to Rick Santorum, a split verdict that overshadowed Mr. Romney's claim of collecting the most delegates and all but ensured another round of intense infighting on the road to the Republican presidential nomination.The result came at the end of a long night that put Mr. Romney that much farther ahead in the race for the nomination, but dashed any hopes he had of using the day to assert himself as the inevitable nominee.Far from bringing more clarity to the race as some in the party had hoped, Tuesday's elections gave every candidate cause to keep driving forward -- including Newt Gingrich, who won a definitive victory in Georgia.Mr. Romney won in Massachusetts, where he served as governor; in Virginia, where neither Mr. Gingrich nor Mr. Santorum qualified for the ballot; and in Vermont and Idaho. Mr. Santorum won in Tennessee, North Dakota and Oklahoma.But all eyes were on Ohio, which The Associated Press called for Mr. Romney early Wednesday morning, capping a turbulent night in which the results seesawed both ways within a very tight range.When the result in Ohio was still pending, Mr. Romney assured supporters in Boston, ""I'm going to get this nomination.""Seemingly noting some of his own mistakes over the past couple of weeks, Mr. Romney struck a chastened note, saying: ""I've listened, and I've learned. I hope I'm a better candidate for it.""By Jim RutenbergPS Mr. Obama defeated Mr. Romney, but with fewer electoral votes and a smaller share of the popular vote than four years earlier.2016March 1: Democrats Hillary Clinton
Makes History
With Big WinsHillary Clinton took full command of the Democratic presidential race on Tuesday as she rolled to major victories over Bernie Sanders in Texas, Virginia and across the South and proved for the first time that she could build a national coalition of racially diverse voters that would be crucial in the November election.Based on results from Democratic primaries and caucuses in 11 states, Mrs. Clinton succeeded in containing Mr. Sanders to states he was expected to win, like Vermont and Oklahoma, and overpowering him in predominantly black and Hispanic areas that were rich in delegates needed for the Democratic nomination.Mrs. Clinton, who also won Massachusetts and showed notable strength among Southern white voters, came away with a strong delegate lead over Mr. Sanders -- notably larger than the one that Barack Obama had over her at this point in the 2008 presidential race.""What a Super Tuesday!"" Mrs. Clinton declared to cheers at a victory rally in Miami. In her recent signature line mocking Donald J. Trump's slogan, she said: ""America never stopped being great. We have to make America whole -- fill in what's been hollowed out.""The contests on Tuesday were well suited to Mrs. Clinton's strengths: her popularity with minority voters, her political kinship with Southern Democrats from her two decades in Arkansas, and her success in delegate-rich Texas in 2008. She won sizable victories in Arkansas as well as Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee, with especially big margins in counties with many blacks.By Patrick Healy and Amy ChozickPS Mrs. Clinton became the first woman to be the nominee for any major American party.2016March 1: Republicans Trump Shows Off
His Wide Appeal:
'I Am a Unifier'Donald J. Trump won sweeping victories across the South and in New England on Tuesday, a show of strength in the Republican primary campaign that underscored the breadth of his appeal and helped him begin to amass a wide delegate advantage despite growing resistance to his candidacy among party leaders.Mr. Trump's political coalition -- with his lopsided victories in Alabama, Georgia, Massachusetts and Tennessee, and narrower ones in Arkansas, Vermont and Virginia -- appears to have transcended the regional and ideological divisions that have shaped the Republican Party in recent years.With strong support from low-income white voters, especially those without college degrees, he dominated in moderate, secular-leaning Massachusetts just as easily as he did in the conservative and heavily evangelical Deep South.Brandishing his Super Tuesday victories as proof of his political might, Mr. Trump said he expected to consolidate the Republican Party behind his campaign.""I am a unifier,"" he told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., after the winners of about half the day's contests had been declared. ""Once we get all of this finished, I am going to go after one person: Hillary Clinton.""Senator Ted Cruz reasserted himself with victories in his home state, Texas, in neighboring Oklahoma and in Alaska, earning a reprieve as he fends off questions about his viability. The wins strengthened his case that he is the only alternative capable of overtaking Mr. Trump.By Alexander Burns 
and Jonathan MartinPS Mr. Trump became only the fifth candidate to win the general election but lose the popular vote.Photograph(PHOTOGRAPHS BY ED KOLENOVSKY/ASSOCIATED PRESS; RALF-FINN HESTOFT/ASSOCIATED PRESS; DOUG MILLS/ASSOCIATED PRESS; DAVID J.

| Jump to first hitThe Affordable Care Act, which has survived two major challenges in the Supreme Court, faces another test.WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear a third major challenge to the Affordable Care Act, setting up likely arguments this fall in a case that could wipe out President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement.The court granted requests from Democratic state officials and House members who wanted to thrust the fate of the Affordable Care Act into the public eye just as Americans prepare to vote this November. The Supreme Court did not say when it would hear the case, but under its ordinary practices, arguments would be held in the fall and a decision would land in the spring or summer of 2021.Democrats, who consider health care a winning issue and worry about possible changes in the composition of the Supreme Court, had urged the justices to act quickly even though lower courts had not issued definitive rulings. They wanted to focus political attention on the health law's most popular provisions -- like guaranteed coverage for pre-existing medical conditions, emergency care, prescription drugs and maternity care -- and to ensure that the case was decided while justices who had rejected earlier challenges to the law remain on the court.In the meantime, the law remains almost entirely intact but faces an uncertain future.The case the justices will hear was brought by Republican state officials, who argued that when Congress in 2017 zeroed out the penalty for failing to obtain health insurance, lawmakers rendered the entire law unconstitutional. The Trump administration sided with the state officials, arguing that the rest of the health care law could not survive without a penalty for flouting the requirement that most Americans have health insurance, sometimes called the individual mandate.A Federal District Court judge in Texas agreed, ruling that the entire law was invalid, but he postponed the effects of his ruling until the case could be appealed. In December, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, agreed that the mandate was unconstitutional but declined to rule on the fate of the remainder of the health law, asking the lower court to reconsider the question in more detail.The Democratic states and the House, which intervened in the case to defend the health law, asked the Supreme Court to put its consideration of whether to hear the appeal on an unusually fast track. The court turned down that request in January.Having lost that fight, the states and the House asked the court to hear their appeal in the ordinary course. They said Supreme Court review was warranted because part of a federal law had been held to be unconstitutional, which is often reason enough for the justices to agree to hear a case. They added that the lower courts' rulings had created doubt about the balance of the law.""The uncertainty created by this litigation is especially problematic because individuals, businesses, and state and local governments make important decisions in reliance on the A.C.A.,"" lawyers for the states wrote. ""Prolonged uncertainty about whether or to what extent important provisions of the A.C.A. might be invalidated makes these choices more difficult, threatening adverse consequences for American families, health care markets and the broader economy.""In urging the court to deny review, the Trump administration said that the justices should wait for a definitive ruling from the lower courts. ""Immediate review is unwarranted in the case's present posture,"" the administration's brief said, ""because the court of appeals did not definitively resolve any question of practical consequence.""One issue that could be particularly consequential for the election is the threat the case poses to the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Those protections, which bar insurers from denying coverage to people with past or chronic illnesses or charging them more, are popular with Americans of all political persuasions. Democrats made them a huge focus of their successful 2018 effort to retake the House, and will undoubtedly put them front and center again.""Thanks to Donald Trump, pre-existing condition protections are on the chopping block this fall,"" Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said in a statement on Monday shortly after the court's announcement. ""Americans who count on their health care will hear loud and clear who is fighting to secure protections for pre-existing conditions, and who is trying to take them away.""Another of the law's provisions that might gain political salience this year, as the coronavirus becomes a serious concern, is its requirement that insurance plans cover vaccinations at no cost.""This case is a stark life-and-death reminder how much is at stake this fall and what's on the ballot right now: Democrats must nominate the candidate whom they know can beat Trump and bring along the Senate, to ensure we can protect our health care for generations to come,"" Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. said in a statement.The public has remained deeply divided on the health law since it passed a decade ago this month, but in February, the law reached its highest favorability rating since the Kaiser Family Foundation started measuring public opinion shortly after the law's passage. The latest Kaiser poll found that 55 percent of the public supported it, and that repealing the law was no longer the top health care issue for Republican voters, a sharp contrast to 2016.Of the remaining Democratic presidential candidates, Mr. Biden and Michael R. Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York, strongly support keeping and improving the Affordable Care Act. Senators Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts favor doing away with it, and all private health insurance, and instead creating a ""Medicare for all"" program run by the federal government. Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii supports Medicare for all for everyone who wants it and wants to preserve private insurance as an option.California's attorney general, Xavier Becerra, a Democrat, said the case, California v. Texas, No. 19-840, underscored the two sides' differing approaches to the Affordable Care Act.""We should all be working to improve health care instead of ripping coverage away from those most in need,"" he said in a statement. ""As Texas and the Trump administration fight to disrupt our health care system and the coverage that millions rely upon, we look forward to making our case in defense of the A.C.A. American lives depend upon it.""The Trump re-election campaign released a statement focused on the Democrats' ""Bernie Sanders-inspired, socialist health care agenda,"" with no mention of the lawsuit or the Affordable Care Act.Ken Paxton, a Republican and the attorney general of Texas, the state leading the lawsuit, issued his own statement, saying that the entire law was ""unsupportable"" now that the appeals court had agreed that the individual mandate was unconstitutional, adding, ""I look forward to finally settling the matter before the U.S. Supreme Court.""Robert Henneke, the lawyer representing two individual plaintiffs in Texas in the case, emphasized the growing support of some Democrats for a single-payer health system, saying in an interview, ""The left will be demagoguing this lawsuit, but I think it's a bit disingenuous, given that a large number of their elected officials have moved toward Medicare for all and single-payer health care.""There was no immediate reaction from the Justice Department.The Supreme Court has already ruled in two major cases challenging core provisions of the health law. In both, it left most of the law in place.In 2012, the court upheld the law's requirement that most Americans obtain insurance or pay a penalty, saying it was authorized by Congress's power to assess taxes. The vote was 5 to 4, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. writing the controlling opinion, which was joined in its key section by the court's four-member liberal wing.In 2015, the court said the federal government can provide nationwide tax subsidies to help poor and middle-class people buy health insurance, rejecting an argument that the subsidies were available only in states that had created marketplaces, known as exchanges, to allow people who lack insurance to shop for individual health plans. A contrary ruling would have created havoc in the insurance markets and undermined the law.The vote was 6 to 3, with Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Anthony M. Kennedy joining the court's four more liberal members to form a majority.Justice Kennedy retired in 2018, but the remaining members of the majorities in the two cases are still on the court.The number of uninsured Americans under 65 decreased by 18.6 million from 2010, when the health law was passed, to 2018. Most of them gained insurance through expanded Medicaid, the government insurance program for the poor. Others got coverage through new private insurance options, often with subsidies to help cover the cost, or, for adults under 26, through their parents' health plans.PhotographIn 2015, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government could provide tax subsidies for the purchase of health insurance.

| Jump to first hitThe state, which awards the third most delegates on Super Tuesday, will help show whether Mr. Biden can galvanize enough moderates to deprive Mr. Sanders of an overwhelming lead.CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Is Bernie Sanders unstoppable? Did Joseph R. Biden Jr. gain enough lift from South Carolina to push aside Michael R. Bloomberg and Senator Elizabeth Warren and make it a two-person race?Answers to both questions will be written across 14 states from coast to coast on Tuesday. And perhaps nowhere more than in North Carolina will the strength of a potential Biden revival and a reset of the Democratic primary be calibrated.This state, which awards the third most delegates after California and Texas on Super Tuesday, is demographically suited to Mr. Biden: One in three Democrats here are African-American, and many college-educated suburbanites live in greater Charlotte and in the Raleigh-Durham region.Together, the five Southern states apart from Texas that are voting -- which carry about 25 percent of the total delegates to be won on Tuesday -- will show whether Mr. Biden can continue sweeping up black voters, and whether he can coalesce enough moderates to deprive Mr. Sanders of a nearly insurmountable lead.""Biden really got off of life support last night,"" said Michael Bitzer, a political scientist at Catawba College in North Carolina, speaking the day after Mr. Biden's landslide victory in South Carolina. ""If he can at least be competitive on Tuesday in North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama and Arkansas, and be competing in Texas, he may have a good night.""But there are plenty of obstacles to that rosy scenario: Nearly 800,000 people voted early in the state, before the South Carolina results or the twin endorsements of Mr. Biden on Monday by Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, who ended their campaigns. Mr. Biden is a David against the Goliath of Mr. Bloomberg's spending. And Mr. Sanders, who came relatively close to Hillary Clinton here in 2016, retains many supporters.Bill Toole, a Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor, said Mr. Bloomberg ""has a chance here"" because of the state's moderate leanings and because Mr. Biden had disappointed many Democrats with his uneven debate performances and early-state losses.""People want to see a candidate who can win and who is moderate,"" Mr. Toole said on Saturday before the full South Carolina results were reported, which showed Mr. Biden carrying black voters nearly four to one over Mr. Sanders. ""If Biden had been more on his game, he would have been that person, but he's faltered enough that people are uncertain.""Mr. Toole was working the crowd in Charlotte at a state Democratic Party dinner where the keynote speaker was Mr. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City. The presence of Mr. Bloomberg, who said he had 124 paid staff members and 10 offices in North Carolina, is ubiquitous in TV ads, pitches to voters in the mail and online, and yard signs at seemingly every intersection. He has spent nearly $15 million in ads here, nine times as much as Mr. Sanders and 60 times as much as Mr. Biden, according to The Charlotte Observer.When Mr. Bloomberg was asked after the dinner, once Mr. Biden's commanding win in South Carolina was clear, whether he was a spoiler who could end up benefiting Mr. Sanders, he declined to answer.A polling average of North Carolina, which does not include surveys taken after South Carolina's results, shows Mr. Biden at 24.6 percent, just ahead of Mr. Sanders at 23.2 percent. Mr. Bloomberg was at 16.4 percent and Mr. Buttigieg, who withdrew from the race on Sunday, was in single digits. Though Mr. Buttigieg said he was dropping out in part so he would not split the anti-Sanders vote, and on Monday planned to throw his weight behind Mr. Biden, it is unclear where most of his backers will go. In polls they have named various second choices, including Ms. Warren.Mr. Sanders has been courting black voters in North Carolina. He attended an Ash Wednesday service in Goldsboro at the church of the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, a former state N.A.A.C.P. president, and led a march to an early voting site from Winston-Salem State University, a historically black college.Jillian Johnson, a co-chair of the Sanders campaign in the state, pointed to a 50 percent increase in early voting this year by millennials in Durham County, a stronghold of progressive politics. ""If that trend holds, we will see Sanders getting an edge,"" said Ms. Johnson, who is mayor pro tempore of the city of Durham. ""Our turnout in Durham can flip an entire state election.""She said she expected Mr. Sanders to do well, ""but it's not going to be Nevada,"" where he beat Mr. Biden by more than 25 percentage points.North Carolina had 17 days of early voting that ended on Saturday afternoon, before Mr. Biden's victory in South Carolina. The total number of early votes surpassed those in the 2016 primary. In interviews, many Democrats said they were unusually conflicted and unsure who would be most likely to defeat President Trump, and so were hesitating to cast a ballot. A major uncertainty is how many waited for a sign from South Carolina, and whether there will be a surge of in-person turnout on Tuesday.One South Carolina result that may haunt Mr. Bloomberg: the humiliating third-place finish there by another billionaire, Tom Steyer, who had spent lavishly to court black voters and dropped out after earning only 11 percent in the state.""It could be the canary in the coal mine for Bloomberg,"" Mr. Bitzer said. ""Bloomberg's strength tends to be among moderate suburban voters. But if Biden's South Carolina victory kind of shifts them back over to his camp, Bloomberg may see a lot of his money go up the chimney Tuesday night.""On Saturday, before the South Carolina polls had closed, Mr. Biden appeared at St. Augustine's University, a historically black college in Raleigh, N.C. The crowd that filled a university gymnasium was modest compared with the multitudes who came out later that day in the same city to hear Mr. Buttigieg, one day before he withdrew.But Mr. Biden seemed energized by the prospect of a good night in South Carolina, and his performance sent an electricity through the crowd that is not always seen at his rallies. He blended chestnuts from his biography with pointed attacks on the National Rifle Association and the ""poisonous rhetoric"" of Mr. Trump.""I've lived through some moments of crisis in my life and my family, but I'll be damned if I'm going to lose my country to this man,"" he said, drawing loud applause.""If North Carolina stays with us on Tuesday,"" he predicted, ""there'll be no stopping us from there to the nomination.""Mary Ann Parrott, who works for an education publisher, had entered the gym waffling among moderate candidates, worried that Mr. Biden's performance in the debates suggested he was not forceful or focused enough to take on Mr. Trump.She had a different view on the way out.""Today he was everything I needed him to be,"" she said.PhotographJoseph R. Biden Jr. is hoping his support in Southern states, especially with African-American voters, can slow Bernie Sanders down on Super Tuesday.

| Jump to first hitGov. Mike DeWine ignored a court ruling and said the state's health director was closing the polls on Tuesday based on worries that the coronavirus placed voters and poll workers in potential danger.Ohio's governor on Monday night said he and top state heath officials would ignore a court ruling and postpone Ohio's presidential primary by declaring a public health emergency because of the coronavirus outbreak.The governor, Mike DeWine, said that the state's health director, Dr. Amy Acton, had issued the order based on concerns that the coronavirus outbreak placed both voters and poll workers in potential danger.His announcement came just hours after Judge Richard A. Frye of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas rejected the state's request to push back voting to June 2.""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" Mr. DeWine, a Republican, said on Twitter.He added: ""While the polls will be closed tomorrow, Secretary of State Frank LaRose will seek a remedy through the courts to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity.""Ohio was one of four states scheduled to vote on Tuesday. The other three -- Arizona, Illinois and Florida -- said that they planned to proceed with their elections while taking additional health precautions.Officials in Ohio had said as recently as Sunday that they would go forward with primary voting, but Mr. DeWine indicated that they had become increasingly worried about the safety of polling sites after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned against gatherings of 50 or more people.By Monday afternoon, Mr. DeWine said he wanted the primary pushed back but did not have the authority to unilaterally delay the election and that a lawsuit would be filed to move the vote. On Monday evening, Judge Frye rejected the request.Dan Tierney, a spokesman for the governor, said Mr. LaRose would seek through the courts to have another date set for in-person voting in Ohio.Elections officials in the three other states scheduled to vote on Tuesday gave a range of reasons that they were pressing ahead.""We are fortunate to have numerous options in Florida to cast our ballots safely and securely,"" Laurel Lee, the secretary of state, said at a news conference. She added that more than two million ballots had already been cast through early in-person voting and vote by mail.Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida added that he was committed to holding the elections, saying, ""The fact of the matter is, these things can be done in a way where you're not going to have crowds.""In Arizona, the state Democratic Party was seeing huge turnout in the form of early mail-in ballots, said Matt Grodsky, a party spokesman. ""We believe that delaying the election would cause undue chaos to this election process,"" he said.Katie Hobbs, Arizona's secretary of state, said that ""we have no guarantee that there will be a safer time to hold this election in the near future,"" adding, ""The longer we wait, the more difficult and dangerous it could become.""Kentucky, by contrast, announced on Monday that it was delaying its primary from May 19 to June 23. The announcement was made by Kentucky's secretary of state, Michael G. Adams, in a video statement on Twitter.""Postponing the primary was not an easy decision, but the Republican secretary of state and Democratic governor agreed, and so do county clerks from both parties,"" Mr. Adams said. ""My hope is that this delay will allow us to have a normal election. Even if not, this delay will allow me, the state board of elections and our county clerks time to assess what changes we must make to ensure a successful primary election.""The proposed new date for the Kentucky primary, June 23, would fall outside the June 9 deadline set by the Democratic National Committee to hold all nominating contests, and could result in a loss of delegates.The moves to postpone elections on Monday came days after elections officials in Louisiana and then Georgia said they would push back their upcoming primary elections in response to the outbreak. On Friday, Louisiana announced that its April 4 election would be postponed by more than two months, to June 20; Georgia followed suit a day later, saying it would reschedule its March 24 contest for May 19.Kate Bedingfield, deputy campaign manager for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said in a statement after Mr. DeWine's afternoon announcement, ""We will follow the guidance offered by state public health officials for how to best ensure their populations are looked after while encouraging participation in our democracy."" Senator Bernie Sanders's campaign declined to comment.The developments in Ohio added yet another logistical speed bump to a presidential primary that has already been upended by concerns that voting could worsen a public health crisis.Several other states have said they were changing or considering making changes to their voting processes and procedures in response to the outbreak. Wyoming suspended the in-person portion of its Democratic caucuses, allowing residents to either vote by mail or drop off their ballots at a county polling location instead.Postponements are highly unusual in American political campaigns, but not entirely unprecedented. States have broad autonomy to shape various aspects of their primary elections, including determining the timing.Reporting was contributed by Matt Stevens, Maggie Astor, Shane Goldmacher, Patricia Mazzei and Jennifer Medina.

| Jump to first hitFor the first time, millennials and Generation Z have enough electoral clout to seriously compete with their elders. But many feel more disillusioned than empowered.The oldest of them were just out of college on 9/11; the youngest were not yet born. Over the two decades that followed, they all came of age under storm clouds: of war, of recession, of mass shootings, wildfires and now a pandemic.The result is perhaps the most profound generational gap since the 1960s: between the Generation X, baby boomer and Silent Generation voters who remember one world, and the millennial and Generation Z voters for whom that world never existed.In November, for the first time, the new generations will have enough electoral clout to seriously compete with the old. But, with Senator Bernie Sanders's campaign barely clinging to life, many feel more disillusioned than empowered.In the Democratic primary race, most millennial and Gen Z voters -- meaning, roughly, people ages 18 to 39 -- have supported Mr. Sanders, of Vermont, or Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, and few are enthusiastic about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. On the Republican side, young voters are less likely than older ones to support President Trump, and some conservatives have left the party altogether.The problem is circular and self-reinforcing. Just when millennial and Gen Z voters have the most power to choose their leaders, many feel no one is speaking to them. So many of them don't vote. So many candidates continue not to speak to them. So they get still more disillusioned.""I would love to see more emphasis on listening to young people and talking to us instead of at us,"" said Deana Ayers, 21, a senior at the University of North Texas who voted for Mr. Sanders. ""I'm the future of your party. You should be giving me resources and training and listening to the way I want this party to look.""Within the Democratic Party, the generational tension has played out most vividly through the contest between Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders. But it is fundamentally about young voters' sense that they are living in an entirely different world than their parents, and that politicians -- or at least the ones winning elections -- aren't acknowledging it.Millions of millennials, born between 1981 and 1996, cast their first votes for Barack Obama, and members of Generation Z, born after 1996, began entering the electorate as Mr. Obama's term was ending. For them, his administration is a reference point for who is electable and what is achievable.""We grew up with a black president who ran on a platform of change,"" said Michael May, 20, a student at the University of Toronto who voted for Ms. Warren in his home state, California. ""We think that more is possible than older generations do.""They also think more is needed -- and that, too, is a function of experience.Older generations ""had a lot more economic stability when they were growing up and a lot less of this existential looming threat of the next big political or global crisis,"" said Lucas Ryan, 23, a student at Washburn University in Kansas who supported Ms. Warren. ""It feels like we just never stopped living in some crisis or another.""Those crises, especially the Great Recession, stunted millennials' professional and financial growth in ways that did not resolve after the recession ended. Now, the coronavirus threatens to once again upend any gains they have made.BreAnna Caslake of Arizona said that at 34, she still owed $23,000 in student loans, and that she and her husband were struggling to pay their water bill. Tom Kilian, 28, of Jacksonville, Fla., said he and his wife had been delaying having a child because of financial instability, health care costs and climate change. Both he and Ms. Caslake voted for Mr. Sanders.Ms. Caslake said she was unlikely to vote for Mr. Biden in November. Mr. Kilian said he would, but reluctantly.""I am very aware of the contempt that conservative Democrats hold my generation in,"" he said. ""And the feeling is definitely mutual.""Millennials and Gen Z lean left, and they largely oppose Mr. Trump: His approval rating in a Gallup poll this month was 36 percent among 18- to 34-year-olds, compared with 44 percent over all.But many of them also oppose what they see as an outdated Democratic establishment. And they don't necessarily think replacing Mr. Trump will make their lives better.""Beating Trump is important to me, but that is not the primary issue of this campaign,"" said Adam Miller, 24, who lives in Chicago and voted for Mr. Sanders. ""When I hear Bernie speak about the bold action he wants to take against climate change, I see a future where I can consider starting a family again. When he talks about canceling student debt, medical debt and recognizing health care as a human right, I see a life for myself where I can live without these financial burdens.""Young conservatives, of course, do not want the same policies as young liberals -- but many of them express the same disillusionment with their leaders, and the same sense that neither party is addressing their needs.In particular, young Republicans tend to be more liberal than older ones on issues of gender, sexual orientation, race and multiculturalism.""The older people in my party are more wedded to preserving culture than preserving liberty,"" said Natalia Castro, 23, who grew up in rural Florida and now works in Washington. ""A lot of older conservatives are a lot slower to advocate for legal immigration because they're concerned with what they see as the American identity, and I think that's problematic.""Climate change is also a big issue for young Republicans, just as it is for young Democrats. They don't necessarily support proposals like the Green New Deal. But they do want the government to take urgent action, and the resistance at the top of their party has been alienating.Blair Egan, 22, said she had argued over climate change with older Republicans, including her father, who she said ""isn't thinking about what the world's going to look like 50 years down the line because it honestly doesn't impact him.""Ms. Egan, a graduate student at the University of Illinois Springfield, also wants the government to address the student debt crisis and the cost of higher education, even if she doesn't support the sweeping loan forgiveness some Democrats have proposed. She recently graduated from Ohio University with $30,000 in debt despite academic scholarships, and was able to enroll in a master's program only because of a tuition waiver.Both she and Ms. Castro are loath to vote for Mr. Trump -- who Ms. Egan argued used conservative ideas ""as a smoke screen for a message and platform that's based in anxiety, fear, suspicion and conspiracy"" -- but are deeply frustrated that their choice is him or a Democrat with whom they disagree on important policies.Ms. Castro said that she would never vote for a Democrat who supported gun control -- her one nonnegotiable issue -- but that she wouldn't vote for Mr. Trump either. She said she wished Representative Justin Amash, the Michigan libertarian who left the Republican Party last year, would run third-party. More likely, she will cast a write-in vote.Much like young Democrats, many young Republicans say they are frustrated at the degree to which their views isolate them within the party.""I've been called a RINO more times than I can count, which I don't appreciate, because that's their way of questioning my integrity and my principles,"" Ms. Egan said. ""There are plenty of other young Republicans, even if they're not saying it, who feel alienated or ostracized because they're being asked to support an ideology they didn't sign up for.""Their elders may say much of what is true now was also true decades ago. Boomers grew up with the threat of nuclear extinction and the view that previous generations had made a mess of everything from war and peace to sex. Many young Democrats were alienated from the party establishment and bitter when their favored candidates lost to more conventional ones. Rare is the political moment when the choices of the young trump those of older generations.Still, in dozens of interviews, young voters on both sides of the aisle said that they felt their generation had been left to clean up after older ones, and that they resented what they saw as a choice by leaders in both parties not to prioritize the issues they cared about.""I still feel like I relate more to Republicans than Democrats,"" said Hannah Daniel, 21, a student at Union University in Tennessee. ""But I really do feel a bit politically homeless.""Their open frustration is really exhaustion, some said: at educating themselves, explaining themselves and still feeling ignored or patronized.The outright anger comes because they see the stakes as life and death.""We are quite literally fighting for our lives, for our survival, when it comes to issues of gun safety, when it comes to the climate crisis, when it comes to treating people with dignity and respect,"" said Evan Feldberg-Bannatyne, 21, a student at Earlham College in Indiana who supports Mr. Sanders.""It strikes me as almost tragic that the world has gotten to a place where I feel like my childhood was ended abruptly,"" he continued, ""and I was forced into a position where I had to fight.""PhotographSupporters of Senator Bernie Sanders in Ann Arbor, Mich., this month, above.

| Jump to first hitWASHINGTON, Pa. -- In the winter of 2018, Cindy Callaghan knocked on doors. Lots and lots of doors. A new soldier in the sprawling ranks of the anti-Trump resistance, she spent her weekends in the small towns of southwestern Pennsylvania, telling strangers about Conor Lamb, the Democrat who was running for Congress in a district that President Trump carried by nearly 20 percentage points.When Mr. Lamb won his special election in a narrow but stunning upset, it seemed that there was an opportunity, if enough people put in enough work, to change minds and thus change the country's politics. ""I felt like there was,"" Ms. Callaghan said.Now, as she watches the Republicans' swift rebuff of impeachment charges, the meltdown of the Iowa caucuses and the infighting among the supporters of various Democratic presidential candidates, she feels that less and less. ""It doesn't matter -- find any kind of totally corrupt thing that Trump did and it doesn't matter,"" she said. ""Republicans are just unified. They're a damn steel curtain.""""I'm taking a break until this summer,"" she said.Three years ago, when hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets in protest of Mr. Trump, the resistance seemed immense. Two years ago, when legions of canvassers and postcard writers helped flip dozens of congressional seats nationwide, it proved effective. Now with the 2020 election approaching, the Democratic Party seems as disjointed as ever, while the Trump administration appears not only undismayed but emboldened.And veterans of the four-year-old resistance, particularly in places where they remain outnumbered, are facing up to an unwelcome truth: This is going to be even harder than it once looked.Meetings are packed, protesters still gather on freezing sidewalks and the big picture is repeated like a mantra: The goal is building a solid political infrastructure that will pay off in the long run. But in the back of crowded community rooms, activists murmur nervously about discord among the Democrats, the unshakable enthusiasm of the Trump faithful and the nagging suspicion that the mission of winning converts and allies might have reached its limits. The long run is nice, but 2020, as even the most patient concede, is The Big One.""It just feels like life and death,"" said Pam Maroon, 65, who was spending a weeknight with a dozen other women at a canvassing training session southeast of Pittsburgh. ""I'm less optimistic,"" she said, still sour from watching the news earlier in the day. ""It's exhausting, emotionally and mentally. But you have to keep going.""This weary anxiety is in part a feature of geography. Democrats may be racking up wins in elections in the cities and inner suburbs, but their fortunes have been less bright farther afield.Once a bastion of union power, rural western Pennsylvania has been veering rightward for years, a shift that went into overdrive with Mr. Trump. After the 2016 election, small Democratic groups began sprouting up all over, many started by mid- and late-career women who had done little, if any, political work before.In Panera booths far from blue Pittsburgh, they were elated to find others who thought like them. Surely there had to be more -- if not other Democrats, at least Republicans turned off by the president.""He's losing his vote base,"" thought Christina Proctor, 42, when she joined the ranks of the newly energized in Washington County. She had been alarmed by the local fervor for Mr. Trump in the run-up to the 2016 election, but in the months that followed she thought this allegiance was flagging. She does not think that anymore. ""They're 100 percent on board,"" she said.In 2018, a strong year over all for Pennsylvania Democrats, Republicans mostly held the line in the counties outside of Pittsburgh. In last year's local elections in some of the places that helped send Mr. Lamb to Congress -- his district has since been redrawn, leaving several of those counties, including Washington County, in a more conservative congressional neighborhood -- Republicans took control of one county government after another. In some places, the Republican Party is in its strongest position in nearly a century.""I'm very pessimistic of winning anything here, anything of note,"" said Jake Mihalov, a public defender in Washington, Pa., who ran for district attorney as a Democrat. He estimated that his campaign and its supporters knocked on tens of thousands of doors. He lost by more than 25 percentage points. Working toward the 2020 elections, in which he sees the only realistic goal for local Democrats as losing the presidential race a little less badly, ""is going to take motivation that I don't have right now,"" he said. ""It was tough when we were optimistic.""On Wednesday evening last week, as senators in the other Washington argued about calling witnesses in the impeachment trial, the new leaders of the local Democratic committee in Washington, Pa., sat in their headquarters, debating whether they had reached the limit of people in the county who were still persuadable.Ms. Proctor, now the party's vice chairwoman, believed they probably had. She and the current chairman, Ben Bright, 50, had both been part of the grass-roots surge after the 2016 election, joining a group called the Washington County Democrats; Ms. Proctor would later learn this was not actually the local party. The county's official Democratic committee was apparently not big on meeting, campaigning or advertising itself.Ms. Proctor and Mr. Bright eventually took over the local party with plans to rebuild it from the ground up. The victory of Mr. Lamb, who lost Washington County but by a much narrower margin than Hillary Clinton, suggested all kinds of possibilities.""The first race I was ever involved in was like the best candidate that comes around in a lifetime,"" Ms. Proctor said.But after the midterms, ""things started puttering out,"" she said. ""People just didn't care. They weren't showing up at the grass roots anymore. They just weren't. Nobody cares about municipal elections.""In the meantime, the Republicans were getting to work.Dave Ball, the vice chairman of the Washington County Republican committee, agreed that local political sentiment had been blowing in his party's direction, driven by the people moving in to work in the fracking boom and the dwindling of the old union faithful. But the scale of the party's recent success, Mr. Ball said, would not have come about without aggressive organizing.""We got a lot of people around here mobilized that had never been mobilized before,"" he said, talking of a program to encourage employers concerned about Democratic policies to urge their employees to vote Republican. At the party's booth at the county fair, he said, ""we signed up 500 people to work.""They have the victories to show for it.Mr. Bright had a somewhat rosier take than Ms. Proctor on the prospects for local Democrats. He pointed out that the big picture in 2020 was the overall statewide vote, and here in Washington that came down to margins. If Mr. Trump were to win rural counties like this one by the same numbers that Republicans had been putting up in key state and local races, he would lose Pennsylvania.Besides, he said, the Democratic Party in the county had been disintegrating for years; reversing that would take time. ""After getting beat up for two years in a row maybe we're not where we should be,"" he said. ""But we've built some infrastructure here. It's not going to be short term.""It is impossible to pinpoint the mood of something as broad and disparate as the Democratic grass roots. On the other side of the state, in the counties around Philadelphia, Democrats have been buoyed by victory after victory, even in longtime Republican strongholds. Around Pittsburgh, many suburbs have turned Democratic with surprising speed.""I have a hard time seeing how Donald Trump can legitimately win Pennsylvania,"" said John Craig Hammond, a college professor who was trounced in a Statehouse race in 2016 but has since helped flip multiple local seats to the Democrats in a Pittsburgh suburb. ""People like me and the people who I knock on doors with, we recognize what we need to do.""Still, in conservative communities, splits have opened between newly energized progressive activists and veteran local Democrats who insist that working with Republicans is the only way some things can get done. One former Democratic Statehouse candidate in a rural county north of Pittsburgh, soundly beaten in her first run for office in 2018, said she and her fellow activists now mostly gather just to drink wine and talk, exhausted by the uphill struggle.With little pre-existing Democratic Party infrastructure in many places and, for now, without a single cohesive candidate to unify the base, upholding enthusiasm ""is a really heavy burden to put on the backs of these individuals,"" said Dana R. Fisher, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland who has studied the new activism. ""People are just burned out and they're worried,"" she said, pointing to the Iowa Democratic caucuses, where turnout was lower than many had anticipated, as evidence.Last Saturday morning, the day after the president's acquittal in the impeachment trial had become all but certain and a new round had begun in the seemingly perpetual feud between supporters of Mrs. Clinton and Bernie Sanders, the Washington County grass-roots group met in the basement of the local library. More than two dozen people came, a good showing. But amid the talk of petitions and candidates, the reality of the daunting task ahead and the setbacks recently behind was not far out of mind.""When we lost all of our county row offices I felt like somebody had died,"" said Susan Bender, a retired schoolteacher, 72 years old and entering her fourth year as an activist. Talk turned to the primary, and Ms. Bender worried that Democrats further to the left would not do much better here. ""But,"" she went on, ""you can't stop.""PhotographA canvassing training session in Greensburg, Pa., southeast of Pittsburgh.

| Jump to first hitBrian Michelz has never worn a political T-shirt or been to a campaign rally. But when he voted for the first time in his life, it was for Bernie Sanders. What will he do if Mr. Sanders loses?MADISON, Wis. -- Debt has dogged Brian Michelz his entire adult life.It started with an ambulance ride when he was 18 and two hospital stays. Then came college loans. By the time Mr. Michelz made it out into the world, his credit score was so low he could not even get a credit card. He has paid for everything he has ever bought -- televisions, furniture, cars -- up front. After grocery shopping on Wednesday, his bank account had three dollars in it.Mr. Michelz, 29, has never worn a political T-shirt or been to a campaign rally. But when he voted for the first time in his life, in the primary of 2016, it was for Bernie Sanders.""I wouldn't say I'm on the left, or a liberal progressive,"" Mr. Michelz said in his apartment one morning last week, sitting next to his wife, Sarah Michelz, who had just come home from her work as a nurse. ""I feel like Sanders understood -- there's too much medical debt and college debt. I was like, 'OK, he's speaking the truth.""'Mr. Sanders has staked his campaign on the promise that he can draw in voters who have felt left out of politics -- in particular the young and the working class, especially in regions like the Midwest where Democrats lost to Donald J. Trump in 2016.Now, as the fight for the Democratic nomination approaches what could be a final, critical stage with primaries in Michigan and Wisconsin, the future of his candidacy rests on these voters and whether they will turn out in larger numbers than they have so far. The Democratic Party also faces a risk: Should Mr. Sanders lose the nomination, some of his supporters -- tired of being offered conventional solutions -- could sit out the general election, or vote for Mr. Trump or a third-party candidate.For voters like Mr. Michelz (pronounced Michaels), Mr. Sanders has inspired loyalty because he is the rare political leader who has both diagnosed the source of their problems and tried to offer solutions. Mr. Michelz is part of a generation scarred by the Great Recession. After borrowing more money for their education than their parents did, many are treading water in jobs that do not pay enough and delaying marriage and children.Mr. Sanders's message has resonated deeply with these voters. In the recent California primary, 47 percent of voters who said income inequality was their most important issue picked Mr. Sanders. Just 13 percent voted for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.Mr. Michelz's wife has debt, too, as do most of his friends. One is so anxious about it that he takes medication. The only ones who do not have debt come from families that can afford to help them.Ms. Michelz, 30, borrowed around $100,000 for nursing school, and pays $800 every month, a sum that is more than half their rent in the small, tidy apartment on the southwestern edge of Madison. They both want children, but Ms. Michelz thinks they should wait.""I want to be slightly more comfortable financially,"" she said, ""to have a little extra cushion.""Mr. Michelz has heard the critiques of Mr. Sanders: He is unelectable. He is radical. His programs cost too much. He knows the senator is not perfect. But he likes his direction.He plans on voting for Mr. Sanders in the Wisconsin primary next month. But he is not sure what he will do in November if Mr. Sanders is not the nominee.Mr. Sanders is certainly a better choice than Mr. Biden, he said, who looks like ""an ordinary, run-of-the-mill politician,"" who is influenced by money and power in the same old ways.""When I look at him, I don't see real change or anything like that,"" he said.Early SkepticismMr. Michelz grew up in a large house with a pond at the end of a long driveway a few miles from Yale, a tiny town in rural Eastern Michigan known for its annual bologna festival. His grandparents lived nearby and owned an apple orchard. He spent summers clearing it of brush and weeds.His grandfather was political -- an avid Rush Limbaugh listener who always voted Republican. But his parents, absorbed with their own troubles, were not. His father, who worked on telephone lines, abused his mother, sometimes violently. He could be loving, playing catch with Mr. Michelz and his brother after work. But he could also be frightening, once shoving Mr. Michelz across the living room when he misbehaved. When Mr. Michelz was 13, his father killed himself.The experience turned Mr. Michelz into a skeptical person who did not trust easily. He developed a keen sense for when adults were being sincere -- and when they were not.""I sought out anything that was real,"" he said.News and popular culture -- and by extension politics -- felt fake. One day something was true, and the next day it was not. He remembers seeing something on TV that said chocolate was bad for you. The next day there was something that said it was good for you.""It was like everything was for sale,"" he said. ""I always thought reality TV shows were really embarrassing. News was lumped in with that.""In 2008, the financial crisis tore through his family. His mother lost their house that she had fought to keep after his father's suicide, and she and her two sons had to move in with Mr. Michelz's grandparents.That year, when Mr. Michelz was 18, he took a part-time job cleaning out houses after they had been foreclosed on. He saw closets stuffed with cherished possessions -- photographs, prom dresses, watches -- and threw these things into dumpsters. Once, a man begged him to open the door so he could retrieve his belongings.It was a searing experience and the beginning of his political education.""When I hear Bernie's forgiving debt and people say, 'It's way too expensive,' I think, you did the craziest thing for the banks,"" he said of the bailouts. ""Yet normal families were thrown in the street, literally.""He continued: ""The middle finger was given to our family, while the rich guys got off scot-free.""Finding SandersBy 2012, Mr. Michelz was attending a small Lutheran college in Minnesota. He started paying more attention to the news. He was spending a lot of time online and started looking up things he had heard, like the line from the protesters at Occupy Wall Street that the top 1 percent of Americans had more wealth than close to half of the rest of the country.""At first I thought it couldn't be true,"" he said. ""It just didn't make sense.""It was around this time he first saw Mr. Sanders -- on his grandparents' TV talking about health care. Mr. Michelz looked him up and saw that he had been saying the same thing for years. He liked what he heard. He thought about his $24,000 in medical debt and how arbitrary it seemed.As for the economy, nothing made sense. He spent years in college classes learning teaching, but ended up working in a tire store because it paid better. He went to college, just like everybody said he should, but is now working in a job that does not require a degree.Mr. Sanders seemed to be telling him why his life looked and felt the way it did. His financial instability was not some individual failure, but a function of a broader economic system that had become so unequal that fixing it was a moral calling.What Mr. Sanders proposed ""was creating the conditions to make people's lives less stressful,"" he said.And as for the arguments against Mr. Sanders -- all these things he wanted would cost too much and would cause economic chaos and people to suffer -- that was already happening, he thought. Domestic violence, families breaking apart, children not getting the care they needed -- the common thread was the economic system.The fact that Mr. Sanders was rejected by the establishment merely proved his worth for Mr. Michelz.""I knew it was OK to be hated by the mainstream,"" he said.So on March 8, 2016, he rode to the polling station in Yale with his grandfather. Rush Limbaugh was on the radio. When they walked inside, he voted for Mr. Sanders and his grandfather voted for Mr. Trump. It was his first time voting, but he does not remember feeling much of anything.""I just thought, I'm going to at least put my voice in a direction, even if no one hears it,"" he said.Mr. Michelz never considered voting for Mr. Trump, finding him unappealing and bothered by his stance on climate change. But he does not hate him. Some of the people he loves most voted for him. He understands why.""The truth is, they are speaking to a frustrated America,"" Mr. Michelz said of political candidates. ""That's why someone who is as ridiculous as Trump got elected. People wanted to see someone who wasn't proper, who wasn't afraid of the establishment. He appealed to people who thought it was all becoming a sham.""He added: ""It's the same thing with Bernie.""A few months later, Hillary Clinton became the Democratic nominee.In November, he did not vote. Looking back, he does not regret it.This NovemberFour years later, he has even more at stake.Mr. Michelz is now married. After years of blocking out his ruined credit score, he cares a lot about it. He still cannot get a loan, which means leasing a new car is out of the question. He wants badly to buy one with heated seats for Sarah. Instead they are stuck with their old models. He recently poured $3,000 in bonuses from his job at the tire shop into his car.Sometimes Mr. Michelz worries about not providing enough for his family.""I think about Sarah,"" he said. ""She's around doctors every day. Does she ever have a thought, 'I could be with someone who makes way more money?' I know that's irrational. On the one hand I'm bothered by it. But on the other, I know I'm giving 110 percent.""So, he tries to show her every day that he loves her. He often buys her flowers. Last Thursday, a small vase in the kitchen held two carnations and a rose.""Sometimes yeah, I feel shame,"" he said of his financial situation. ""But I fight it because I know it is not of my doing.""All of this has brought him back to politics, which he now knows is the thread that runs through many of these problems. This year he found that he loved Andrew Yang.""To me, he made Bernie seem outdated,"" he said. When Mr. Yang dropped out, ""I was bummed, but I was happy, too. His message got out there.""He feels wiser now. He no longer believes the American story that everyone should be able to pull themselves up by their bootstraps.""That's a big lie that benefits the rich and keeps the system the same,"" he said.He will still vote for Mr. Sanders, though he knows it is a long shot.""Even if it doesn't work, I'm going to throw my vote that way,"" Mr. Michelz said. ""I have nothing to lose.""Will he vote in November?If he thought Mr. Sanders had been treated unfairly by the Democratic Party establishment, ""it's possible I might just vote for Trump,"" he said.He sounded a bit sheepish.""That might be immature, that might be bad,"" he said. ""But I guess I still don't view Trump as Hitler either.""Even if Mr. Biden won against Mr. Trump, he said, millions of Americans will still be in poverty, schools will still be underfunded, ""all the stuff they are blaming on Trump will still be there.""But would he vote for Mr. Biden?""You know, I don't think I would,"" he said. ""Nothing against him as a person. But my life probably wouldn't change if he became president. I don't think other peoples' would either. So, what's the point?""Amanda Cox contributed reporting from New York.PhotographBrian and Sarah Michelz outside their apartment complex in Madison, Wis.

| Jump to first hitDemocrats are still figuring out how to get Latinos in the party to turn out. They voted at the lowest rate of any minority group in the last four presidential elections, though turnout apparently increased in the 2018 midterms, making them a complicated voting bloc to understand.Latinos come from more than two dozen countries, and are of varying races, religions and cultures. Trying to find a cohesive message for such a broad and diverse group risks marginalizing some of its members.That's why Latino leaders on this year's Democratic presidential campaigns aren't doing that. They're instead trying to understand what Latinidad -- or Latino identity -- means for themselves and for their work, and to use that understanding to engage their communities.Jonathan Jayes-GreenLatinx outreach director for Senator Elizabeth Warren of MassachusettsLike many immigrants brought to the United States when they were young, Jonathan Jayes-Green had a rebellious stage as a teenager, which for him meant moving away from Panamanian culture and embracing American culture instead. He was trying to assimilate and adapt to a new country, culture and language.""I think it was closer to the end of my high school career then I said, 'No, actually, I love that Spanish is my first language,""' he said. ""I love that I have an accent and that my folks speak a little bit differently.""'For Mr. Jayes-Green, rediscovering his roots came through embracing and loving dance, music and food. Salsa, merengue, arroz con coco and plátano helped him reconnect with himself, but it was a long journey.""My experience living at the margins of how Latinidad has been constructed, particularly being Afro-Latinx and queer, makes me fight to make sure we continue to expand it for those who want to be a part of it,"" he said.Finding a way to redefine what it means to be Latino is at the core of Mr. Jayes-Green's work. And he's excited to be doing that as part of the movement he sees Elizabeth Warren creating with her campaign.""What I love when Senator Warren talks about her many plans is that in order to make them be anything beyond a piece of paper, we need a movement,"" he said. ""We need it to be able to fight for big structural change that we need in our community.""His job is to make sure that all Latinos have a space at the center of that movement. It was important to him to bring people from the campaign to support him last fall at a Supreme Court hearing over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shielded some young undocumented immigrants from deportation and which the Trump administration is seeking to end. Mr. Jayes-Green is a DACA recipient, also known as a Dreamer.""It's how we continue to make space for the Latino movement to be a part of the campaign, but also for the campaign to show up to the movement,"" he said. ""It's a two-way street.""Laura JiménezNational Latino engagement director for former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.Laura Jiménez has been listening to a lot of Juan Luis Guerra lately. A lot of ""Visa Para un Sueño,"" a lot of ""Ojalá Que Llueva Café.""Working directly with her community fills her with pride, and listening to Juan Luis, a merengue and bachata singer considered a Dominican national treasure, brings her back to that work every time.Ms. Jiménez grew up in the Bronx, but she would spend summers in the Dominican Republic with her father. After high school, she moved to Florida.""I had to get rid of a lot of accents,"" Ms. Jiménez said. ""And there was always this feeling that you never fully belonged anywhere.""It took Ms. Jiménez a long time to love her identity, and it wasn't until six years ago that she realized that her background was valuable.""It is my family that is on the line here,"" she said. ""It's my community that is being attacked. So this all feels very, very personal every day.""She learned early on in politics that there would often be only a few Latinos in the room.""It can be very lonely, especially when you start working in these spaces,"" she said. ""But you figure out quickly that your voice is important, and if you don't speak up, that perspective will never be heard.""But speaking up is essential, Ms. Jiménez said, particularly given the stakes of the 2020 race.""Trump is using our community to win re-election. He's demonizing us,"" she said. ""And because this election is about us, we have to prioritize, as a community, someone who can defeat this man.""She believes former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. will fight for Latinos, and she says he has been reflective over the millions of deportations that happened under the Obama administration. She pointed to his immigration plan as evidence.""As an immigrant myself, and someone who worked on this plan, I see a lot of things there that will help a lot of people in our community,"" she said.Edwin TorresLatino outreach director for Senator Amy Klobuchar of MinnesotaAfter Edwin Torres came to the United States, his family moved around the Los Angeles area more than 20 times. Sometimes they were homeless. By the time he graduated high school, he had attended more than a dozen public schools.The American dream his parents were chasing didn't make sense to him. ""I started thinking that this shouldn't be happening in this country,"" he said.His parents left El Salvador in the 1990s as civil war ravaged the country, and it took seven years to raise enough money to bring Mr. Torres across the border.They wanted him to have an education, and it wasn't until he went to college that he learned to appreciate the sacrifices they had made.Mr. Torres was part of the first wave of Dreamers approved for DACA. He got a full scholarship to Saint John's University in Minnesota.""I came into college with a newfound freedom, a freedom that I've never tasted before, a freedom that I was validated, that I had a right to be here,"" he said.Last fall, Mr. Torres stood outside the Supreme Court for the hearing on DACA. His status is set to expire this year.""It was one of those moments where we were shouting and your voice would crack because of how emotional you are,"" he said. ""I am an American in every single sense but the document.""Mr. Torres worked on local campaigns in Minnesota before joining Amy Klobuchar's presidential bid last March. He said he was inspired by her ability to rally support for Democrats up and down the ballot.""She went the extra mile in 2018 to make sure we flipped the House in Minnesota, which then allowed us to have bigger conversations on licenses for all, and other progressive policies,"" he said.""As an undocumented and unafraid DACA recipient, and as a gay Latino man in America, I want our next president to be able to unify our country.""Belén SisaLatino press secretary for Senator Bernie Sanders of VermontDuring her childhood in Arizona, Belén Sisa felt as if she belonged to the only Argentine family in the state. She wished she had a more normal name, a more normal childhood. She always lay low.""I grew up in a primarily white, middle-class neighborhood where for the first part of my life I felt really ashamed of not only being an immigrant, but also being undocumented,"" she said. ""I was just trying to assimilate any way possible, because I wanted to be the same as everyone else.""It wasn't until Ms. Sisa was approved for DACA that she felt empowered and safe enough to get involved in politics.""Whether I was undocumented or documented, that didn't define me,"" she said. ""I was still deserving of being able to have a seat at the table.""She soon found a community of activists and undocumented young people just like her. She became a community organizer in Arizona and eventually moved into electoral politics. Even though she couldn't vote herself, she wanted to ""advocate for other people to be civically engaged, and do so on my behalf.""She was drawn to Bernie Sanders because of his plans to fight exploitation in the workplace and improve access to education and health care.""Even in the moments where me and my family had no idea who this man was, he was fighting for us,"" she said.She volunteered for Mr. Sanders during his first presidential run, in 2016, and ended up working with the campaign as a Latino outreach coordinator. She's now the Latino press secretary for his 2020 campaign.""It would have been completely unheard-of for someone running to be the next president of the United States to hire an undocumented person for such a visible role, and to trust that person to advocate for your agenda,"" she said. ""I think that says a lot about where his priorities are.""Cecilia CabelloCalifornia state director for former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.Cecilia Cabello is a third-generation Angeleno, and each generation lived in a different neighborhood of the city, but not by choice.Her great-grandparents moved to Los Angeles from New Mexico at the turn of the 20th century. According to family lore, they had a house near what is now Union Station, but they were displaced when the station was built. The family moved to Boyle Heights, until the construction of the 5 Freeway pushed them farther east.""The story of Latinos in L.A. is really kind of the story of my family,"" Ms. Cabello said.She was raised by her grandmother, who taught her only English. ""It wasn't so much that she was ashamed of who she was, but her trying to protect me from the things that she went through,"" Ms. Cabello said.It wasn't until Ms. Cabello went to New York for college and then came back a decade later that she reconnected with her Chicano roots. Upon her return to Los Angeles, she was struck by the blatant racism she saw around her. It was a ""shock to the system.""""I had a sheltered childhood in the sense that when you're only around Latinos and Asian folks, you're not seeing that kind of disparity,"" she said. ""That really lit my fire in terms of reconnecting with identity, understanding a lot of Chicano history and Latinos in L.A., and got me kind of politically motivated to do stuff.""She was drawn to Pete Buttigieg because he reminded her of Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles and former President Barack Obama. ""I just liked the way he talked about America,"" she said.""What I truly believe in is our founding documents. On paper we're all equal, but that's obviously not true, so we have to work until it's actually true for everyone,"" she added. ""A lot of what Latinidad is to me is getting that work done.""Photograph(PHOTOGRAPHS BY JOSE A. ALVARADO JR.

| Jump to first hitFor months, the two candidates had rarely faced off in direct attacks. But now, as the polling leaders, they are using the other as a foil to press their divergent cases for the presidency.SALEM, N.H. -- Bernie Sanders stands before his audience reciting his familiar pitch, railing against the elite and declaring that America is ""the only major country not to guarantee health care for all."" He directs his message to working-class voters and young people, vowing to make it easier to join unions and to legalize marijuana across the country. He is holding concerts to show off his big crowds.Pete Buttigieg calls out to independents and Republicans even though registered Republicans can't participate in New Hampshire's primary. He warns about the cost of ""Medicare for all"" and says it is a risk to be ""alienating Americans at this critical moment."" He says pointedly that a ""revolution"" of the kind Mr. Sanders is pushing for is not what voters want.On the last day before the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Sanders, the white-haired independent senator from Vermont, and Mr. Buttigieg, the youthful former mayor of South Bend., Ind., offered starkly different messages as they vied for dominance in the first primary state in the election calendar. With recent polls showing the two men in a close race after finishing in a near tie for the lead in Iowa last week, they are aggressively escalating their rivalry, using the other as a foil to press their divergent cases for the presidency. Both campaigns on Monday officially requested a recanvass of some Iowa caucus results.It is a striking departure from their posture earlier in the race. For months, the two candidates eyed each other warily from opposite ends of the Democratic Party's ideological and generational spectrum, obliquely competing for bigger crowds but rarely facing off in direct attacks. Yet amid signs that Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Elizabeth Warren may be slipping, Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg are now pushing their closing arguments in New Hampshire with messages that are clearly aimed at gaining an edge on each other even though they are largely still angling for different voters.""Tomorrow you have a choice,"" Mr. Sanders said at a morning stop in Manchester, N.H. ""You have the option to vote for a campaign which will not only defeat Trump but which will transform this country."" And he sent an implied rebuke to Mr. Buttigieg by declaring that he had ""changed the nature of the game"" with respect to fund-raising.At this point in the race, no two candidates better reflect the political and cultural divisions in the Democratic Party that have come to define the primary -- and the party's different visions for change. And their ascendancy to the top of the polls reflects the new contours of a race that has changed since Iowa, presenting voters here with a distinct directional choice.Both men have seemed invigorated by the clash, eager to draw an explicit contrast with a candidate who represents what they are not.Mr. Sanders, a 78-year-old democratic socialist, wants a political revolution that will lift up working-class Americans who know what it is like to struggle. He believes that he can mobilize people who do not usually participate in the political process, inspiring a movement that will extend across the country and overwhelm President Trump in the general election in November.Like a professor imparting wisdom to his class, he speaks from a podium, his right arm in constant motion to underscore each point. He rarely takes questions from voters and almost never from reporters at his events.""You all know what a deductible is?"" he asked a crowd Socratically in Rindge, N.H., before charging ahead with a lengthy riff on Medicare for all.Mr. Buttigieg, who at 38 is less than half Mr. Sanders's age, pitches himself as an agent not of political but generational change, offering a more moderate, traditional path to retaking the White House for the Democratic Party. At his upbeat rallies, he offers frequent overtures to independents and voters he calls ""future former Republicans.""During a flurry of stops on Monday, Mr. Sanders focused on highlighting the same message he has presented voters for years, portraying himself as a beacon of consistency who can fix a political and economic system he views as broken.""What we are going to do is begin the process of transforming this country,"" Mr. Sanders said at the rally in Rindge, inside a field house at Franklin Pierce University. ""We are prepared, with your help, to take on the greed of Wall Street, the insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the military-industrial complex, the prison-industrial complex and the entire 1 percent.""In contrast, Mr. Buttigieg emphasized the idea that he'd bring together people from across the political spectrum with a message of moderation. Mr. Sanders, he said, is offering unrealistic plans that can't be paid for under the new taxes he's proposing.""How are we going to pay for it? Are we going to pay for it in the form of still further taxes or are we going to pay for it in the form of broken promises?"" Mr. Buttigieg told supporters Monday at Plymouth State University in Plymouth. ""We have to choose a responsible approach that can actually get big things done and answer the question of how we're going to get from point A to point B.""The two candidates have not just implicitly drawn contrasts; they have also attacked each other directly, especially in the last few days as the Iowa results and recent polls established them as the two front-runners. Over the weekend, Mr. Sanders laced into Mr. Buttigieg for raising money from billionaires, including ""heads of large corporations, C.E.O.'s in the pharmaceutical industry, people from Wall Street.""""If you think that people are going to get money from the C.E.O.'s of drug companies and are going to tackle the greed and corruption of the pharmaceutical industry, you're mistaken,"" Mr. Sanders told a capacity crowd in Hanover on Sunday. ""If you think people are going to get money from financiers in the fossil fuel industry, and they're going to be prepared to take them on and transform our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and sustainable energy, you'll be wrong. So, it does matter where money comes from.""On Monday, he reprised his targeted jabs at Mr. Buttigieg, whom he called a ""smart guy.""""Pete seems to think that it doesn't matter that, in his case, he raised lots and lots of money from at least 40 billionaires,"" Mr. Sanders said at an afternoon event for supporters in Salem, at a coffee shop that featured a Sanders ""presidential blend.""On Saturday morning, before Mr. Sanders had begun his billionaire broadsides, Mr. Buttigieg was obliquely criticizing Mr. Sanders's calls for a ""revolution"" as divisive. Though he never mentioned his rival by name, Mr. Buttigieg told a crowd of nearly 1,000 in Keene on Saturday morning that he disagreed with the notion that ""if you're not for a revolution"" then ""you don't fit.""On Monday morning in Plymouth, he stressed the point harder.""This is a moment for bringing as many people as we can into the picture, but a picture where your only choices are between a revolution or the status quo is a picture where most of us don't see ourselves,"" Mr. Buttigieg said.The spat has delighted Mr. Sanders's advisers, who have long harbored a distaste for Mr. Buttigieg. In addition to privately frowning on his inexperience, many continue to pronounce his last name incorrectly. Mr. Buttigieg's aides, too, frequently join in a chorus of criticism of Mr. Sanders, pushing videos on Twitter on Monday morning featuring Mr. Sanders dodging a question about the cost of his health care plan.The two candidates have different bases, and it is unlikely they can siphon much support from each other at this stage: Mr. Sanders appeals to working-class voters and young people, while Mr. Buttigieg's supporters tend to be older, whiter, more educated and wealthier.""He's very well-spoken but he doesn't have any real experience, and I think he's entirely beholden to the rich donor class,"" Henry Buck, 30, said of Mr. Buttigieg after hearing Mr. Sanders speak at a stop in Nashua.But their willingness to engage with each other is a sign that the race is intensifying: Both recognize they need to consolidate support from their respective wings of the party to win the nomination, as well as make the most compelling case that they can defeat Mr. Trump to attract those whose No. 1 priority is to remove the president from office.Sydney Ember reported from Salem, and Nick Corasaniti from Hanover, N.H.

| Jump to first hitAs many as 12 states may hold primaries on June 2, which now carries the biggest delegate haul since Super Tuesday. That could change how the rest of the Democratic race plays out.Think of it as Super Postponed Day.June 2 had been an afterthought on the Democratic primary calendar. Ever since Joseph R. Biden Jr. seized the mantle of front-runner, voters in New Jersey and a few other states scheduled to vote that day assumed the Democratic horse race would be over before their primaries rolled around.But with numerous states pushing back voting to June 2 because of the coronavirus pandemic, the date has gained sudden prominence. It now confers a huge bounty of delegates, second only to Super Tuesday in early March, with Indiana, Pennsylvania and others moving to hold their primaries on the first Tuesday in June.Although Mr. Biden has built an all but insurmountable lead, June 2 -- which is a long 10 weeks away -- will be his first chance to clinch the presidential nomination. Only then would the former vice president have a definitive reason to press for the withdrawal of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who has shown no inclination to leave a race that feels frozen in place.Some Democratic strategists see possible perils in the delay. Having to wait until June 2 for the next major chapter in the nominating race largely deprives Mr. Biden of a chance to rack up interim victories that would bring media attention; President Trump, meanwhile, is promoting his leadership in a global pandemic. A Monmouth University Poll on Tuesday showed Mr. Biden with a three-point lead over Mr. Trump among registered voters nationally, 48 percent to 45 percent, an edge the pollsters called ""negligible.""As the Democratic nominee-in-waiting, Mr. Biden may simply have to wait longer.""This idea apparently being floated by the Sanders campaign that Bernie can stay in the race and accumulate delegates without harming Biden's chances of winning in November is delusional,"" said J.J. Balaban, a Democratic strategist in Pennsylvania. The lengthy pause in the primary and Mr. Sanders's reluctance to step aside are distractions, Mr. Balaban said, from the need for Democrats to refocus on the general election race, in which Mr. Trump has a head start raising money and coalescing supporters.Michael Soliman, a Democratic strategist in New Jersey, said the delay might not be all bad if it concentrates the minds of voters on the need for change in the White House. ""As this crisis causes more states to push back their primaries, New Jersey voters will not only be reminded about the need for strong and steady leadership, but they will finally be in a position to play a meaningful role in securing the nomination for Joe Biden,"" he said.On Tuesday, Delaware became the latest state to move its primary, originally scheduled for April 28, to June 2, under an executive order by Gov. John Carney. Pennsylvania's Legislature passed a bill on Wednesday to likewise reschedule the state's primary from April 28 to June 2, which Gov. Tom Wolf is expected to sign by the end of the week.Delaware and Pennsylvania would bring to six the number of states to move primaries to June 2, including Connecticut, Indiana, Maryland and Rhode Island. The newcomers join the five primaries originally scheduled that day: New Jersey, Montana, New Mexico, South Dakota and the District of Columbia. (Inevitably, the date seems destined to be stamped the ""Acela Primary"" for its new regional tilt.)Ohio, which canceled its primary scheduled for March 17 because of the coronavirus, also has its sights on June 2. The date is one week before the June 9 deadline that the Democratic National Committee has set for states to hold primaries.Election officials in New York, which is emerging as a hot spot of infections, are considering delaying their presidential primary from April 28 to June 23. A group representing New York's election commissioners on Tuesday called for the primary to be moved to June 23, the date of another statewide vote, and to allow all voters to request absentee ballots. As the D.N.C. rules currently stand, New York could forfeit some delegates at the national convention for voting so late.In all, 822 pledged delegates would be at stake on June 2 if all the states eyeing that date follow through. The D.N.C. has said a candidate needs 1,991 to clinch the nomination.Mr. Biden currently leads, with 1,214 pledged delegates to Mr. Sanders's 910. The delegate math has become nearly prohibitive for Mr. Sanders; to overtake Mr. Biden, he would need to win the remaining states by about 20 percentage points.Few of the remaining states on the map feature the voting blocs, chiefly large numbers of Hispanics, where Mr. Sanders has done well. He has lost in a series of states where he was thought to have the advantage, notably Michigan, Minnesota and Texas.With the coronavirus outbreak, the Vermont senator has turned away almost entirely from conventional campaigning, instead converting his campaign apparatus to rally his liberal supporters around fighting for his vision of health care during the emergency. On Tuesday night he streamed a ""coronavirus town hall"" featuring health experts, a musical guest and Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, a chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.Four years ago, Mr. Sanders never formally dropped out of the primary race even after Hillary Clinton became the presumptive nominee on June 7. (Mr. Sanders endorsed Mrs. Clinton a month later, just before the national convention.)Mr. Biden has struggled to adapt to the new political landscape in which there are no more scheduled debates or live rallies, and Mr. Trump has seized the national spotlight with daily briefings from the White House. A Biden appearance from his Delaware basement on Monday, in which he criticized Mr. Trump for not acting like the ""wartime president"" he claims to be, was not picked up in real time by any of the major cable news channels.Mr. Biden appeared again from his new home studio in a round of television news interviews on Tuesday. On MSNBC, he said that he opposed calling off any elections; on CNN, he said that he was ""staying in place, not gathering at events"" and that anyone who enters his home, Secret Service agents included, wears masks and gloves.He was asked about Mr. Sanders's ""ramping up"" for primaries in New York and elsewhere.""I think that's his decision,"" Mr. Biden said.PhotographDejuane Miller and other Ohioans voted early in Dayton last week before the primary was shelved.
