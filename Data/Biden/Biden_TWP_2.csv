CONCORD, N.H. "" Pete Buttigieg fought back against attacks from three of his rivals while former vice president Joe Biden tried to salvage his campaign with a retooled underdog message Saturday as Democratic presidential contenders careened toward a primary in New Hampshire that could narrow the path forward for several candidates.
Biden, reprising an argument he made in Friday night's brawling presidential debate, said the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., would put the Democratic Party 'at risk' were he to become the nominee. 
His campaign put out a new digital ad that derided Buttigieg as a lightweight who dealt with 'decorative' issues in contrast to Biden's role in marshaling landmark Obama administration measures such as the Affordable Care Act and the nearly $1 trillion effort to salvage the economy after the 2008 crash.
'The reports of our death are premature,' Biden shouted into a microphone to a group of campaign volunteers at a campaign headquarters.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who effectively tied Buttigieg in Monday's Iowa caucuses, hit Buttigieg for taking money from wealthy donors.
'If you are serious about political change in America, that change is not going to be coming from somebody who gets a lot of money from the CEOs of the pharmaceutical industry,' Sanders said.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) accused the former mayor of being overly flippant about the seriousness of impeaching President Trump, repeating an attack that she made on the debate stage but also calling out Sanders as a candidate whom Americans are likely to reject.
'When we were asked, 'Do I think a socialist [shouldn't] be the one who leads the Democratic ticket,' I was the [first] one who raised my hand,' Klobuchar said. 'People know that I'm straightforward with them and I tell them the truth.'
She, like Biden, was trying to build momentum from Friday's debate, when she forcefully made her case to be considered by the moderate voters who previously might have been deliberating between Biden and Buttigieg.
Her campaign touted one sign that she had gained some notice: quickly raising $2-million by midday Saturday, according to her campaign. 
The increasingly frantic tone of the campaign continued Saturday night at a New Hampshire Democratic Party dinner in Manchester, where, one by one, the candidates made their pitches "" as well as the same thinly veiled criticisms they uttered earlier in the day. Supporters on all sides cheered and booed.
The tenor reflected candidates' frustration that the race has remained stubbornly fluid, with uncertainty more popular than many of the candidates. A new poll showed that roughly half of New Hampshire voters have not definitely made up their minds with just days to go before Tuesday's primary.
The CNN poll, conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center, showed 28-percent supporting Sanders, 21 percent for Buttigieg and 11 percent for Biden. All other candidates were in single digits, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who was at 9-percent.
The poll findings demonstrated the split among the candidates in the past week. Buttigieg and Sanders were seeking to duplicate in New Hampshire their top-of-the-field showing in the Iowa caucuses. Biden and Warren, who each at one point led in pre-Iowa polling but who trailed the two leaders Monday night, were seeking to avoid a second-straight failure that would call into question their path forward.

No presidential candidate has finished lower than second place in New Hampshire and gone on to become the party's nominee. For all of the candidates, there was another looming problem: the entrance, as of the March 3 Super Tuesday primaries, of former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who has already spent hundreds of millions of dollars in pursuit of the nomination, although he has yet to appear on a ballot or step on a debate stage.

Several of the candidates took on Bloomberg in Friday night's debate, and Sanders returned to his criticism Saturday. 
'We have a former mayor of New York "" I won't mention his name,' he said at an event in Dover, N.H., prompting laughter in the crowd. 
Sanders said he has no objection to Bloomberg running for president. 'But what in my view he is not entitled to is to buy an election,' Sanders said. 'And that is precisely what the corruption of the American political system is about.'

It was Buttigieg's sudden rise that made him the target of his rivals; he had gained 14-points since Monday in a Boston Globe-WBZ-TV-Suffolk University tracking poll released Friday night, reaching a dead heat with longtime New Hampshire leader Sanders. 

Biden's new ad contrasted his role in the Obama administration with Buttigieg's former job.
'When President Obama called on him, Joe Biden helped lead the passage of the Affordable Care Act, which gave health care to 20 million people,' says a narrator in the ad. 'And when parkgoers called on Pete Buttigieg, he installed decorative lights under bridges, giving citizens of South Bend colorfully illuminated rivers.'
The ad also credited Biden with leading the administration's successful effort to bail out the auto industry and restore the economy, which it compared to Buttigieg's action that 'revitalized the sidewalks of downtown South Bend by laying out decorative brick.' 


 As he did in Friday's debate, Buttigieg pushed back by casting himself as representing both a new generation and a break from the long-standing animosities of Washington. 

 'I know some folks are out there saying, 'What business does a mayor of South Bend have running for the president?' ' Buttigieg said at a stop in Hanover. ' 'You don't have an office in Washington, your community is a little out of the way.' What I'm saying is that's exactly the point.'
Later in the day, seeming to respond to Biden's ad, he added: 'There are so many communities, rural areas, small towns, industrial cities and pockets of big cities' who feel 'left behind by Washington.'
'We're tired of being reduced to a punchline by Washington politicians,' he said.
Buttigieg had help trying to persuade the undecided voters of New Hampshire. As he emphasized that he was a candidate the country could rally behind, a supportive super PAC, VoteVets, poured roughly $400,000 more into a TV ad campaign running in the state, including spots that feature veterans praising Buttigieg. The group had previously sent $1.3-million to support Buttigieg.

Biden's refreshed and far more aggressive approach was the result of his departure from the campaign trail for two days, during which he huddled with his advisers at his home in Delaware. He invoked the 1972-car accident in which his first wife and daughter were killed, and the cancer that claimed his oldest son, Beau, in 2015. 

'I've lost a lot in my lifetime, like many of you have,' Biden said Saturday morning at a Manchester theater crammed with supporters. 'But I'll be damned if I lose my country, too.' 
He also spoke with more swagger than he has in recent months, reminding voters of the highlights in his career. 
'You guys call these debates? I've been in debates. I debated Paul Ryan. I debated that woman from Alaska who said she could see Russia,' he said, referring to his vice presidential debate clashes with former Republican vice presidential nominees Ryan and Sarah Palin, the former Alaska governor. 
At another point, he said: 'If you notice, I'm still winning nationally. You guys keep forgetting that.' 
Biden spared no sympathy for Sanders or Buttigieg. 
'Ask yourself, will it be easier or harder to win with a socialist "" a democratic socialist, self-stated "" at the top of the ticket?' Biden asked, lacing into Sanders.
Buttigieg, he suggested, would also be a gamble. 
'I do not believe we're a party at risk if I'm the nominee,' Biden said during a speech to voters in Manchester. 'I do believe we're at risk if we nominate someone who has never held office bigger than mayor of South Bend, Indiana.'
When it was noted by reporters that Biden's attacks on Buttigieg echoed the complaint that Hillary Clinton leveled 12 years ago against Barack Obama, Biden interjected.
'Oh, come on, man!' Biden said. 'This guy's not a Barack Obama.'
Asked why he had not addressed Warren, he said: 'She hasn't said anything, if you noticed, in the last month.'
 'I respond when people misrepresent my record,' he said. 'Elizabeth hasn't attacked me.'

Sanders, for his part, drew crowds during the day that exceeded 1,000 people. He gleefully told supporters Saturday that 'the establishment is beginning to get nervous' about his rise. 
' 'How do we stop Bernie Sanders and his movement? Oh my god, the people are standing up, fighting for justice, how do we stop?' ' he said mockingly of his critics. 
'Well, they ain't gonna stop it,' he said, drawing cheers. 'We're on the march.' 
Warren, the only top-tier candidate who adopted a strategy of staying clear of the fight, largely maintained that position Saturday, including during Saturday night's Democratic Party dinner, where she brushed back against the notion that her candidacy was in trouble.
'I've been winning unwinnable fights pretty much all my life,' she said.
Warren noted throughout the day that it was the third anniversary of the day she was criticized by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) during a lengthy speech she gave on the Senate floor. McConnell's response "" 'Nevertheless, she persisted' "" became a rallying cry for her supporters.

'Mitch McConnell said those words that a lot of women have put on T-shirts, a lot have embroidered on pillows, a lot have had tattooed on their bodies: Nevertheless, she persisted,' she said at a midday event in Manchester, as the crowd repeated the phrase along with her and applauded. 
'The only way we're gonna make this better is if we use this Democratic primary to build a grass-roots movement,' she said. 'Are you ready for some big, structural change?' 
She attended a get-out-the-vote event with supporters in Manchester, N.H., and then went door-knocking her husband, Bruce, and her dog, Bailey. 
 When asked by reporters about her debate performance, Warren said she wished she had spoken more.
'I thought it went well,' Warren said. 'It was a good debate. A lot of back and forth. But I still got to cover issues I care about. Obviously, there's more I would've liked to have talked about. . . . I had my hand up a lot. But you know, I know all candidates want more airtime.'

More than 80 break with tradition to endorse 
a presidential candidate
More than 80 career national security professionals have signed an open letter of support for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, saying that President Trump ""has created an existential danger to the United States.""
Most of the signatories, who include career diplomats, intelligence officers and defense policymakers, have served both Republican and Democratic administrations. They noted that their policy views cover a spectrum and as officials they ""have often been in opposition, sometimes bitterly, with each other."" 
But in a letter published online Wednesday, they expressed a shared belief that Trump's approach to leadership has undermined the country's role in the world. 
""His reelection would continue this downward spiral and will likely have catastrophic results,"" say the signatories, most of whom have never publicly endorsed a candidate for president. 
Doug Wise, a former CIA clandestine officer and former deputy director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, broke a career-long vow to serve in silence by signing the letter. 
""We need to restore courtesy, respectability and consensus decision-making based not on the personal interests of Donald J. Trump but on the personal interests of Americans,"" said Wise, who retired in 2016 after 48 years of government service. 
Wise, who leans Republican, said that he has never voted for president, content to trust in the American democratic system ""to produce a good president and commander in chief."" But the system has failed, he said. So this November, he said, he will cast his first vote for president - for Biden.
Larry Pfeiffer, former senior director of the White House Situation Room and a former chief of staff to then-CIA Director Michael Hayden, said he leans Republican. ""If Donald Trump wasn't running, and it was Mitt Romney versus Joe Biden, I'd be endorsing Mitt Romney,"" he said. ""And I probably wouldn't be public about it.""
Pfeiffer, who served five presidents dating to Ronald Reagan, said he sees himself as nonpartisan, so much so that endorsing a candidate feels like ""an unnatural act.""
Margaret Henoch, a former CIA officer who joined the agency in the Reagan administration, agreed that a public endorsement is ""absolutely"" unheard of for career professionals. But these are not normal times, she said. 
Henoch said her endorsement is ""not political."" It's driven by a desire to restore ""the stability of the country and the world and the respect for the role and function of government"" in a democratic society.
Paul Rosenzweig said he was a Republican but became an independent in 2017 because ""the standard-bearer for my party no longer represented the values that I think the party should stand for.""
""Even though I am sure I will disagree with much of what [Biden] does, I am also certain that the overall result will be far superior under Biden than under Trump,"" said Rosenzweig, who served as a senior policy adviser at the Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush and as a senior counsel to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in the Clinton administration.
James R. Clapper Jr., a former director of national intelligence who entered government service in the Kennedy administration and retired in 2017, has voted ""both ways"" in federal elections. He considers himself a ""Democrat domestically and a Republican in the foreign and national security realm.""
He, too, said he would vote for Biden. ""I just think he would represent, if elected, a restoration of normality to the country,"" said Clapper, a retired Air Force lieutenant general who served in five Democratic and five Republican administrations.

Concern high after activists rush the stage at Super Tuesday rally
Joe Biden's presidential campaign on Wednesday began privately deliberating whether to formally request Secret Service protection for the candidate, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, a day after protesters rushed the stage at his event in Los Angeles in what experts called a major security breach.
Both Biden and fellow candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) rely on private security firms to handle their public appearances, which is unusual this late in a presidential campaign cycle in comparison with 2016, 2012 and 2008. But their emergence over the past week as the clear front-runners in the Democratic primaries has prompted calls for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the U.S. Secret Service, to authorize full-time protection for both of them.
""Taking into consideration the remaining candidates' large campaign operations, high polling averages, as well as physical threats to their safety . . . I urge you to immediately initiate the consultation process to determine whether to provide USSS protection"" to Biden and Sanders, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss), the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, wrote in a letter Wednesday to acting DHS secretary Chad Wolf.
Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.), a member of the Homeland Security Committee and co-chair of Biden's campaign, told reporters that Democratic lawmakers were ""worried about"" security for the Democrats on the campaign trail even before the incident at Biden's speech on Super Tuesday.
The Biden campaign has begun deliberating over whether to move forward with a formal request to the Secret Service, according to the person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to comment freely about a sensitive security matter. The Sanders campaign did not immediately respond to questions on the subject. The DHS also did not respond to a request for comment.
The onstage skirmish during the former vice president's remarks in Los Angeles highlighted the potential risks for candidates addressing large crowds. A pair of vegan activists holding signs reading ""Let Dairy Die"" rushed the stage before being physically pushed and pulled away by bystanders including Biden's wife, Jill, and a campaign aide in a video that has circulated widely online.
The incident was a ""massive security failure,"" said Jonathan Wackrow, a risk-management consultant at Teneo who served as a Secret Service agent in the agency's Presidential Protective Division. ""These were environmental activists. Anyone aligning with a specific ideology is potentially dangerous. I think both Bernie and Biden would want it at this point.""
The question over which presidential candidates deserve taxpayer-funded Secret Service protection, and when such protection should begin, can be a tricky calculation - for federal officials and the candidates themselves. Under federal guidelines, a candidate must meet minimum standards that include being a ""major"" candidate in his or her party - generally defined as a someone who is regularly appearing at rallies, conducting a national campaign and receiving at least 15 percent support in established polls. Biden and Sanders both meet such requirements.
Campaigns must request protection from the DHS, and a bipartisan congressional advisory committee - led by the Senate majority leader, currently Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) - helps review the request before the DHS secretary makes a decision.
Outsourcing security to the federal government can be a boon for cash-strapped campaigns and also bestow a heightened legitimacy on candidates. But some candidates in past presidential campaign cycles have tried to hold off over concerns that a large security entourage could hamper their ability to interact more directly with supporters.
Both Biden, during his eight years as vice president, and Sanders, during his 2016 contest against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, have received Secret Service protection in the past.
""Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden need secret service protection,"" Robert Gibbs, a White House press secretary under President Barack Obama, said on MSNBC on Tuesday. Of the skirmish at Biden's event, he added: ""What happened tonight was nothing short of genuinely scary. . . . They should have Secret Service protection in the next 24 to 48 hours.""
Obama received Secret Service protection earlier than any other candidate - in May 2007, nearly a year and a half before the 2008 election. The congressional advisory committee at the time warned that the first viable African American candidate for the White House faced an unusually high security risk. (Hillary Clinton, who also was running for the Democratic nomination at the time, already received Secret Service protection in her capacity as a former first lady.)
In 2012, the eventual Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, got protection in February of that year, while Donald Trump and Ben Carson, running for the GOP nomination in the 2016 cycle, began receiving Secret Service coverage in November 2015.
In 2016, Trump and Clinton had instances at their campaign events in which Secret Service agents jumped onstage to surround them over concerns about protesters.
As president, Trump receives round-the-clock protection. Former presidents continue to have smaller Secret Service details - but Biden no longer is granted such protections as a former vice president.
Wackrow, the former agent, has not seen intelligence reports about the 2020 candidates. But he suggested Biden's threat profile might be magnified because of President Trump's unfounded allegations that the former vice president had acted improperly when his son Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.
That accusation led Trump last summer to privately pressure Ukraine's president to open an investigation into the Bidens, a demand that ultimately led House Democrats to impeach Trump. The president has berated the Bidens in public remarks and called on China to open an investigation into Hunter Biden's business activities in that country.
""They've now made him a target,"" Wackrow said. ""It's all rhetoric, but rhetoric can transcend to physical harm.""

DES MOINES "" When Tanya Keith and her teenage daughter Aviva Jotzke learned that their favorite Democratic presidential candidate, Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, had dropped out of the race a few weeks before the Iowa caucuses, they cried and mourned with fellow supporters.
Then they began to assess their options. 
Over the next seven days, they would attend three campaign events for different candidates, have numerous conversations with each other and friends who had committed to other candidates, and endure what seemed a never-ending weighing and reweighing of what issues and leadership traits matter most to them. 
'I am not comfortable in the undecided space,' said Keith, 48, who committed to Booker at a Memorial Day picnic in 2019 and was his precinct captain for her neighborhood. 'I don't like to sit and mull and wait.'
Their desire to commit early is rare this caucus season. Iowans always feel a special responsibility in kick-starting primary voting, but that sentiment has been heightened this year by the party's determination to defeat President Trump, now gestating for more than three years. 
Many voters have found themselves paralyzed by indecision as they try to determine not only which candidate they like best but which has the best shot of beating Trump in November. 
Polls show an unusually large number of Democrats are uncommitted, and a recent Monmouth University poll of Iowa found 4 in 10 voters said they could change their minds before caucus day.
Their decision-making is complicated by a historically large Democratic field, which has given voters like Keith and Jotzke far more candidates to consider than in a usual year, and the shadow of the 2016 campaign, in which nominee Hillary Clinton lost narrowly in states that typically vote Democratic. Across the state, Iowa Democrats often sound like television pundits as they describe how each candidate might fare on a debate stage with Trump or in balloting in swing states. 

Even those who have committed can find themselves thrust back into indecision if their chosen candidate drops out "" as Booker did on a recent Monday morning.
Keith loved "" and still loves "" what she saw as Booker's kindness and relatability, the way he connected with younger voters, and his call for 'baby bonds' that would give every newborn a $1,000 savings account, which she considers 'the way to talk about reparations without getting white poor people up in arms.' 
She moved to Iowa from New Jersey about 27 years ago, and she and her husband are raising their family in Des Moines' diverse River Bend neighborhood because 'it was important for me to live somewhere where my kids would not assume that white people were just all there was.' 
'I just loved how he talked about racial and economic inequality,' she said of Booker. Then she paused and screamed out loud in frustration at his departure.

It took Jotzke, 17, a bit longer to commit to Booker, as she originally signed a caucus card for Pete Buttigieg, the millennial former mayor of South Bend, Ind. She thought that because Buttigieg is gay he would bring a different perspective to the race and have empathy for marginalized communities. 
'He didn't apply it, at least in my opinion, to racial justice and to standing up for trans people and all the marginalized people,' said Jotzke, a junior in high school who will turn 18 about three weeks before Election Day, meaning she is allowed to caucus for the first time in February. 'He just didn't apply it well.'
'And that was sad,' her mom said. 
'Yeah,' she said. 'It was sad.' 
Jotzke switched to Booker late last year, after she talked to the candidate "" and he followed up with her. Of everyone in the field, she concluded, Booker was the most empathetic and understanding.
When he dropped out, they didn't have a second choice and weren't sure they wanted to commit to anyone else. How could they suddenly support a candidate they had been arguing against as they tried to build support for Booker? 
'It's hard because it's a mourning of what could have been,' Jotzke said. 'I don't know if there's anyone as good as him. I don't want to pick any of the others. I want to pick him.'
Keith was angry that Booker left the race when so many Iowans were still undecided "" and that he had been pushed off the debate stage by rules set by the national party. She was invited to attend a house party featuring billionaire Tom Steyer and decided to attend so that she could 'scream at him' about 'what money has done to this race.' Jotzke had no interest and stayed home to do homework. 
When Keith arrived at the party, she saw the beloved former principal of her children's school and realized she couldn't make a scene. She was impressed by Steyer's passion for protecting the environment and his answers on combating racial inequality. She ended up hugging him and posing for a photo. But he did not win her over.

The mother and daughter kept at it. They've been campaigning together for years "" as a toddler before the 2004 caucuses, Jotzke would go 'banging on doors' with her mother for the eventual Iowa winner, John F. Kerry "" and they didn't want to sit out this year's voting.
They quickly cut their list to the two women in the race: Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Jotzke added one more person to her list: Andrew Yang, the tech entrepreneur whose ideas she liked, although she worried about his lack of political experience. 
'I try to envision the debate stage in the general election, and I think about watching some septuagenarian white man yelling at another septuagenarian white man,' Keith said. 'And it just feels wrong to me. And I feel like we need to talk about what's happening in this country on a level that old white men don't get. And I think that women, especially moms, understand on a base level what is happening in this country.'
Although both often hear the argument that former vice president Joe Biden has the best shot at beating Trump, they just don't think that's true. 
'He just keeps sounding like your grandpa that isn't like overtly racist but still says things that are NOOOOT comfortable with where we are in 2020,' said Keith, who works in historical preservation and, on the side, has written two books about soccer. 'Like, I don't think that he's a bad person.'
'You still love him,' Jotzke continued. 'You still want him in the family.' 
'And then Bernie,' her mother said, continuing down the list of septuagenarians. 'Why did he not drop out after that heart attack? . . . He's the only candidate that would be past his expected life expectancy on Election Day. That's disturbing, you guys, it's really disturbing.'

On policy, the two know that the candidates have been sorted, often against their will, into two major buckets: the left wing and the centrists, the dreamers and the pragmatics. But when they looked at the field, they saw candidates with positions that seemed similar and uniformly more liberal than those of Clinton just a few years ago. 
Four days after Booker dropped out, Jotzke got a call from a Buttigieg supporter. It was not the first entreaty. A few days before, a Sanders supporter had knocked on their door, and their phones had been filling with calls and messages. 
Jotzke explained that she wouldn't caucus for Buttigieg because he hadn't, in her view, advocated enough for marginalized communities. She found herself making the case for Klobuchar, noting the senator has passed a lot of bipartisan legislation and has won in rural Minnesota counties that Trump won in 2016. 
She got off the phone and heard her mother on the phone with a Warren supporter calling from Massachusetts, who had nearly persuaded Keith to caucus for the senator. 
'Did you just commit to caucusing for Warren?' Jotzke asked. 'That's not okay because I'm leaning towards Klobuchar.' 
The two agreed to not make up their minds until they had seen both candidates in person. They mostly agreed on the pros and cons of each: They loved that Warren has such a massive organizing operation in their state and elsewhere. They really liked that Klobuchar is from the Midwest and younger. They liked that Warren has been a leader on liberal issues, but they worried about her promise to provide free college for all, which Klobuchar has said could lead to the working class paying the tuition bills of the rich. They suspected that Klobuchar would be more likely than Warren to make Booker her running mate, but there was no way to know for sure. 
There's one other thing that worried them about supporting Warren: Bernie bros, the avid Sanders supporters who engaged in angry battles with opponents in 2016. 
'We both worked on Hillary Clinton's campaign, and we saw what the toxicity between Bernie bros and Hillary people became, and we're both real slow to want to engage with that,' Keith said. 'His supporters "" not him "" his supporters are so rabidly tearing into Warren supporters that it's just a real turnoff.'
Five days after Booker dropped out, the two attended a Planned Parenthood event for Warren in a Des Moines home, and Keith asked the senator about the private 2018 dinner with Sanders during which Warren says Sanders raised doubts that a woman could defeat Trump. (The senator from Vermont has denied Warren's account.)
'I believe you 100 percent,' Keith said. 'Because I looked at you and I looked at him and I'm like, 'He did that.' I know that Bernie Sanders said those things to you. . . . I know what men say to us in rooms and then what they say to us in person to gaslight us.' 
Keith said she had 'a little PTSD from the Clinton campaign' and asked Warren to share her plans 'for shutting that down when you're the nominee.'
Warren said she and Sanders are longtime friends who 'fight for the same issues.'
'What I truly believe is,' Warren said, 'we're going to have to pull together.'
The event deepened Keith's tilt toward Warren and left Jotzke suddenly conflicted. The next night, they attended a Klobuchar rally in the Des Moines suburbs. Before it was over, they had swapped positions.
Keith found Klobuchar a 'very relatable' fellow Midwestern mom who was 'tough as nails' and told jokes that made her burst out laughing. She liked that Klobuchar sent her daughter to a public school where a majority of students qualify for free or reduced lunches "" just like the schools where she sends her children. She loved that the senator closed with a riff on the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the need for racial justice and fairness. 
'I'm talking myself into Amy,' she told Jotzke.
At the same time, Jotzke was struck by the lack of enthusiasm at the Klobuchar event and worried that the senator didn't have the personality to energize a crowd or propel people to vote. She also found Klobuchar to be a less polished speaker, saying 'um' at least six times in one minute. 
'We'll talk in the car,' Jotzke told her mother. 

On the drive home, the two went back and forth on the strengths of the two women and the visions for the country they both championed. That night, they were amused to see that the New York Times editorial board had landed at the same place, endorsing Warren and Klobuchar. Together, they watched videos from the board's interviews.
Warren seemed to have more gravitas, while also being funny and intelligent. While Klobuchar might better connect in intimate settings and small towns, Warren appeared more comfortable in front of massive crowds and on debate stages, they both felt. Plus, both candidates would soon be trapped in the impeachment trial in Washington, putting more responsibility on their Iowa organizers "" an area where both felt Warren is stronger. 
'Well, that settles it,' Jotzke said, 'I'm for Warren.'
Her mother agreed and the next afternoon "" as Yang prepared to visit their neighborhood and as Sanders held a rally less than three miles away "" the two traveled to Warren's headquarters to sign yet another commit-to-caucus card. It had been exactly one week since Booker left the race. 
The next day, they planted a light-green Warren campaign sign in their snow-covered front yard. They left the Booker sign right where it was.

CONCORD, N.H. "" The Democratic Party's nomination campaign began with the biggest and most diverse field in history. More women and more candidates of color populated the field than ever before. Unless something changes quickly, the contest could devolve into a competition among only white men.
Despite having two women and an Asian American sharing the stage at Friday night's debate in New Hampshire, right now the Democratic race appears to be a contest among two white men in their late 70s, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former vice president Joe Biden, and another in his late 30s, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg. Another septuagenarian, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, is waiting to pounce, depending on the results of the first four primaries and caucuses. 
The fact that this is a battle among white men represents an unexpected turn for a party whose success in the 2018 midterms depended heavily on an outpouring of support and activism by women and whose failure in 2016 was the result, in part at least, of a falloff in turnout among voters of color, especially African Americans. The party's future depends on both those groups and, overlapping with them, the active support of younger people.
The changing face of the Democratic Party is an oft-told story, celebrated by party leaders and by rank-and-file Democrats alike. It is a point of pride for Democrats that their party looks more like the changing American population than does the Republican Party, whose presidential candidates of late have gotten about nine of every 10 votes from whites.
 What has gotten less attention is the tension the diversification of the Democratic coalition has produced under the party's big tent. The rising parts of the population are the rising parts of the Democratic Party. They now want more than acknowledgment that their votes are important. They are not satisfied simply to cast their votes for a Democratic candidate. They want a bigger voice at the Democratic table.

Much has been said about the ideological divisions within the party, highlighted again during Friday's debate at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire by questions about whether Sanders's brand of democratic socialism would sink him in a general election against President Trump and take down other Democrats in Senate and House races or produce big turnout among a new coalition of voters.
Debates are waged over whether Medicare-for-all amounts to a budget-busting, complex, big-government idea or is the obvious and essential health-care future for a country where many people have no insurance or are saddled with high deductibles and other costs. Conflicts like that are among the choices Democratic voters will be weighing in the primaries and caucuses.
But there's another division that the party is struggling to resolve, which is who has power and who should have power.

More than a year ago pollster Anna Greenberg, looking ahead to 2020 and beyond, played down the ideological divisions among Democrats, but she made another important observation. She described Democrats as 'a party in flux' not over ideology but over that balance of power within the party's coalition. 
Greenberg said she saw the coming period as 'the last gasp of older white men who have control in the party.' 
The 2020 campaign was to be the moment when the rising coalition asserted and perhaps took power, but it has not worked out that way so far. There's no single reason that has turned out to be the case. Some people blame it on the fact that the first two states to vote, Iowa and New Hampshire, are predominantly white. Some blame it on the inability of candidates who have fallen to the sidelines to run better campaigns.

Three candidates of color "" entrepreneur Andrew Yang, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii) and former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick "" remain as active but lagging candidates. Yang has his Yang Gang and has raised some money, but he does not have enough support to be a serious contender. Gabbard launched her campaign last February, and Patrick jumped into the race late, but neither has yet to make a mark.

But gone from the field are two black senators, Kamala D. Harris (Calif.) and Cory Booker (N.J.), and the Latino former housing secretary Julián Castro. All entered the race with serious expectations. Harris became one of the most talked-about candidates in the early stages. But none of them, ultimately, was able to attract serious support or serious amounts of money. 
In addition to Gabbard, two other women remain "" Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.). While Gabbard has been a gadfly in the race, Warren and Klobuchar have played more significant roles. Gone among the female candidates are Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.) and author Marianne Williamson.
Warren entered the campaign as one of the three best-known and best-regarded candidates, along with Biden and Sanders. She set the pace with a flurry of plans for attacking corruption in government and concentrated power in the private sector. She led the field in Iowa at one point, but last Monday she finished a weak third in Iowa and appears to be struggling in New Hampshire.

Klobuchar has struggled from the start to break into the upper ranks, overshadowed by better-funded candidates and trying to make her mark as a moderate, results-oriented Democrat in a party that has been moving to the left. 'If you are tired of the extremes in our politics and the noise and the nonsense, you have a home with me,' she said Friday night.
At Friday's debate, Warren was a quiet presence, staying out of the scrums for the most part and focusing on the message that has guided her candidacy while trying to present herself as someone who can unite the party. If that strategy doesn't give her a boost, she will have difficulty overtaking the leaders here.
Klobuchar had what might be the best night of her campaign, witty and sharp-tongued at the same time. She questioned whether Sanders could effectively lead the party in a general election, and she accused Buttigieg of taking the easy path by highlighting his outsider status and implicitly criticizing people with Washington experience. 
'It's popular to say and makes you look like a cool newcomer,' she said to the 38-year-old mayor. 'I don't think that's what people want right now. We have a newcomer in the White House and look where it got us. I think having some experience is a good thing.'
But she's had good debate performances before, and they've never translated into growth in support. She has remained in single digits in national polls and ended up fifth in Iowa. She hopes for better in New Hampshire but has to rise quickly to become a force in the nomination contest.
For many female voters and for many voters of color, this turn in the race has produced frustration and a feeling of being left out once again and a step down from when the campaign started a year ago.

Critics say policy ignores real problem: The easy spread of disinformation
Facebook has banned users from posting computer-generated, highly manipulated videos, known as deepfakes, seeking to stop the spread of a novel form of misinformation months before the 2020 presidential election.
But the policy "" first reported by The Washington Post and confirmed by Facebook late Monday "" does not prohibit all doctored videos. The tech giant's new guidelines do not appear to address a deceptively edited clip of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that went viral on the social network last year, prompting criticism from Democratic leaders and digital experts.
'While these videos are still rare on the Internet, they present a significant challenge for our industry and society as their use increases,' Monika Bickert, the company's vice president for global policy management, wrote in a blog post.
The changes come as Bickert prepares to testify at a congressional hearing Wednesday on 'manipulation and deception in the digital age.' The inquiry marks the latest effort by House lawmakers to probe Facebook's digital defenses four years after Russian agents weaponized the site to stoke social unrest during the 2016 race.
The new Facebook policy would ban videos that are 'edited or synthesized' by technologies like artificial intelligence in a way that average users would not easily spot, the company said, including attempts to make the subject of a video say words that they never did.
Facebook, however, will not ban videos manipulated for the point of parody or satire. And it signaled that other lesser forms of manipulation would not be outlawed either, though they could be fact-checked and limited in their spread on the site.
Such a rule would still allow the infamously altered 'drunk' video of Pelosi that was viewed millions of times on Facebook last year, where her speech was slowed and distorted to make her sound inebriated. The effect was accomplished with relatively simple video-editing software. To contrast with more sophisticated computer-generated 'deepfakes,' disinformation researchers have referred to these kinds of videos as 'cheapfakes' or 'shallowfakes.'
Drew Hammill, a spokesman for Pelosi, criticized Facebook for its approach. The company 'wants you to think the problem is video-editing technology,' he said in a statement, 'but the real problem is Facebook's refusal to stop the spread of disinformation.'
Facebook acknowledged last year that its fact-checkers had deemed the doctored Pelosi video 'false,' but the tech giant declined to delete it because, as a spokeswoman said, 'we don't have a policy that stipulates that the information you post on Facebook must be true.'
Nor does the policy seem to restrain other simpler forms of video deception, such as mislabeling footage, splicing dialogue or taking quotes out of context, as in a video last week in which a long response presidential candidate Joe Biden delivered to an audience in New Hampshire was heavily trimmed to make him sound racist.
Those omissions prompted sharp criticism from Biden's campaign Tuesday. Bill Russo, the former vice president's campaign spokesman, said Facebook's handling of deepfakes is inadequate and offers only the 'illusion of progress.'
'Facebook's policy does not get to the core issue of how their platform is being used to spread disinformation,' he said, 'but rather how professionally that disinformation is created.'
Hany Farid, a digital forensics expert at the University of California at Berkeley whose lab has worked with Facebook on deepfakes, similarly criticized the company's new approach, calling it too 'narrowly construed.'
'These misleading videos were created using low-tech methods and did not rely on AI-based techniques, but were at least as misleading as a deep-fake video of a leader purporting to say something that they didn't,' Farid said in an email. 'Why focus only on deep-fakes and not the broader issue of intentionally misleading videos?'
Facebook spokesman Andy Stone said early Tuesday that the manipulated-media policy would not apply to political advertising, noting that the company has declined to send political ads to third-party fact-checkers or label ads as false. On Tuesday afternoon, however, Stone said that he'd misspoken and that Facebook would remove political ads if the company determined they included highly manipulated video.
The Democratic National Committee's chief security officer, Bob Lord, said in a statement that Face book's policy addresses only a narrow segment of deceptive tactics. 'This change comes up short of meaningful progress and only affects one small area of the larger disinformation problem,' he said.
Facebook and other tech firms last year sponsored a 'deepfake detection challenge,' offering prize money to researchers who could deliver the most refined techniques to automatically detect manipulated videos. A set of real and manipulated videos was released to researchers last month, and the challenge is scheduled to end in March.
The language that Facebook is using to delineate its rules resembles a policy raised at a June 2019 meeting in San Francisco convened by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace to discuss how social media platforms should deal with manipulated media ahead of the 2020 election, according to a person who was present and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private meeting. The person said there was significant debate about what degree of editing is required before something is declared misleading and whether social media companies should adopt more sweeping rules against deceptive content.
The policy's provisions for videos 'manipulated for purposes of parody or satire' could lead to thorny debates over whether a video labeled as 'deceptive' was merely intended to lampoon for dramatic effect.
It's unclear, for instance, whether the policy would ban a deepfake like the one created last year in the aftermath of the Pelosi video uproar in which Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg appeared to gleefully celebrate his control of user data. The creator told The Post last year that the video was a form of satire and 'a cautionary tale of technology and democracy.'

Super Tuesday is the day when the most states hold contests to pick a presidential nominee, the most voters have a chance to go to the polls, and the most delegates will be allotted. More than a third of all delegates for the Democratic National Convention are up for grabs on this one day.
Super Tuesday is a popular day to hold a primary because so many states want an early say in who gets the nomination. So they've clustered as early as they can without stealing any thunder from the first four states.
When is Super Tuesday?
It's today, March 3. 
Vermont's polls close first at 7 p.m. Eastern, and California's last at 11 p.m. Eastern. We won't know all the results Tuesday, because the tabulating of votes could go late into the night. California's final results will take days, at least, as mail-in ballots must be postmarked by primary day.
How many delegates are at stake? 
Fourteen states and one territory vote, to award a total of 1,357 delegates.
It's the delegate total that counts when figuring out who wins a party's presidential nomination. The first candidate to get a majority of the nearly 4,000 delegates wins the nomination. Before Super Tuesday, less than 5 percent of delegates will have been allotted. After: 38 percent. The day is even more consequential this year because California, with its big delegate haul, moved its primary up. 
Why is it especially important this year?
The race did narrow in the last couple of days.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has seized the lead in the liberal lane, in delegates and in recent national polling.
The competition in the other lane, for a more moderate alternative to Sanders, remains muddled. Former vice president Joe Biden won in South Carolina on Saturday, putting him in the driver's seat for that. Shortly afterward, three candidates dropped out of the race - former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and investor Tom Steyer.
When the not-Sanders competition was still so murky in late 2019, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg jumped in the race. Super Tuesday is the first time he will appear on presidential ballots. His late entry strategy was to skip the early states, and he has spent hundreds of millions of his own money on campaign ads. His standing in the polls rose, making his candidacy one more wild card in this race.
The candidates' strategies 
Sanders is making a big play for California, and polling suggests it could pay off. But lots has happened in the race in the few days before Super Tuesday, and Biden was already polling well enough in California to contend for some of the state's delegates. That becomes more likely if Buttigieg's and Klobuchar's former supporters boost him. 
The candidates are also focused on Texas and a thriving Democratic Party there. A CNN poll released Friday found Sanders with a big lead in both California and Texas.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is still in the race despite not having won any contests so far, and she is hoping to at least win her home state.
Bloomberg specifically tailored his message to appeal to black voters in states like North Carolina. A poll in the state released Friday shows him bunched up with Sanders and Biden. But some of his supporters fear that if Biden does well with black voters, it could ding Bloomberg's chances in the South on Super Tuesday.
A brief history of Super Tuesday 
It was born out of a desire by Democrats in the 1980s to nominate a moderate candidate, said Richard Berg-Andersson of the Green Papers blog. In 1984, Democrats nominated Walter Mondale, who got crushed in the general election. For the next election, Southern states moved their primaries en masse to March to try to have the more conservative wing of their party chime in sooner. (It didn't work: Democrats nominated then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, also a liberal, who also lost.)
Today, Super Tuesday is more geographically diverse. Each state wants a say early in the nominating contest.
Super Tuesday can be decisive and signal the end of a primary, like it was for both parties in 2000, said Josh Putnam, a political science professor who runs the elections blog Frontloading HQ. ""But they can also show whether things are evenly divided or evenly enough to keep primary season going for a longer time,"" he said in an email.

Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), whose candidacies embody competing wings of the Democratic Party, have emerged as the leaders in the contest for their party's presidential nomination, according to a Washington Post-ABC News national poll.
The findings come little more than a week before the first votes of the 2020 campaign will be cast in Iowa's precinct caucuses, where there has been a spirited contest involving not only Biden and Sanders but also Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and entrepreneur Andrew Yang both hope to spring a surprise on the others on caucus night.
Based on past campaigns, the Iowa results will have an immediate impact on the overall shape of the race and on public attitudes, nationally and in individual states that immediately follow the Feb.-3 caucuses: New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. A Post average of recent New Hampshire polls shows Sanders and Biden virtually tied, with Warren and Buttigieg not far behind.
Nationally, however, the competition has moved in the direction of Biden and Sanders, with Warren, Buttigieg and others now clearly behind. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning registered voters, Biden is favored by 32-percent with Sanders at 23-percent, according to the new Post-ABC poll. In both cases, those percentages are slightly better than what each received in an October Post-ABC national poll.
Warren is currently running third but has seen a significant drop in her support nationally, falling from 23-percent in October to 12-percent in the new poll. Still, she is the only other candidate for the Democratic nomination in double digits.
The fourth- and fifth-place candidates represent a shift in the Democratic hierarchy. Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who was not a candidate when the last Post-ABC survey was conducted but who has spent several hundred million dollars since then, runs fourth at 8-percent. Yang, whose debate performances have drawn favorable reviews and whose candidacy projects a non-politician's flair, is at 7-percent.
Buttigieg, whose rise in Iowa and New Hampshire earlier this year caught others in the field by surprise, is at 5-percent, reflecting modest slippage since October. Klobuchar is at 3-percent, Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) is at 2-percent, and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick are at 1-percent.
The poll shows that Democrats are clearly motivated in this election, with 73-percent of Democratic leaners saying they are certain to vote in their state's primary or caucus. That's little changed since last July but significantly higher than the 59-percent who said in January 2016 they were certainly going to vote. Similarly, Democratic leaners are slightly more satisfied with their choices of candidates this year than they were four years ago.
Although 9 in 10 Democrats who named a candidate when asked whom they are supporting say they are enthusiastic about their choice, 53-percent overall say they still would consider another candidate. That is a reflection of the fluidity that has marked the Democratic campaign for most of the past year, as voters have tried to assess a record-large field and weigh who might be best against President Trump.
Biden's candidacy has been buoyed by perceptions that he is the candidate who could lead the party back to the White House, and the current poll again gives him the highest marks on that question. At this moment, 38-percent of Democratic leaners name Biden as having the best chance to beat Trump, with 18-percent naming Sanders and 10-percent naming Warren.
Biden also leads his rivals on two other questions that are central to the debate inside the party about the best path to victory, motivating the Democratic base or attracting independent or moderate voters. Many Democratic strategists say it will take a combination of both to overcome some of the advantages that Trump, as an incumbent during a time of low unemployment, currently enjoys.
On the question of who can best motivate the Democratic base, Biden is named by 32-percent while Sanders is named by 21-percent. Asked who can attract those independent and moderate voters, 29-percent name Biden and 17-percent name Sanders. No one else hits double digits on that question.
Biden and Sanders "" one running as a more moderate establishment figure and the other as a revolutionary democratic socialist "" are about even on the question of 'who comes closest to you on the issues,' with the senator from Vermont at 24-percent and Biden at 22-percent. Warren, whose liberal platform is closer to Sanders's than to Biden's, is third at 15-percent.
Biden's candidacy is also strengthened by the demographic pillars of support he has maintained throughout the year. As in many polls, he is the leading candidate among African Americans, with about half the support of black adults. He is also ahead among those Democrats who identify themselves as moderate or conservative and leads among voters 50 and older, where he holds a roughly a 3-to-1 advantage over Sanders.
The Post-ABC poll finds Sanders scores slightly better than Biden among voters under age 50, although his margin among this group is not as large as is Biden's among those over 50. The younger the voter, the more support Sanders gains, with the caveat that these younger voters historically have been more difficult to turn out in primaries or caucuses.
Sanders also is favored by Democrats who identify themselves as liberal and shows signs of building support among some nonwhite voters. 
Warren suffered slippage among many groups of voters since October, but particularly among women, where her support fell from 26-percent to 12-percent. She also dropped 15-points among self-identified liberals.
But while she trails Biden and Sanders as the first choice among Democratic voters, she does well when people are asked who represents their second choice. 
Overall, nearly a quarter (23-percent) name Warren as their second choice, slightly higher than either Sanders or Biden. When first and second choices are combined, Biden leads at 48-percent, followed by Sanders at 41-percent and Warren at 35-percent. All the other candidates trail by at least 20-points in this combination.
At the Democratic debate in Iowa earlier this month, Warren and Sanders tangled over whether he had told her privately that a woman could not win the presidency. He denied saying it, and she said he had. Warren used the opportunity to make a forceful case to answer questions about whether a woman is at a disadvantage in a presidential election.
The Post-ABC poll finds that fewer than 3-in-10 (28-percent) of Democratic-leaning adults say a man is more likely than a woman to defeat Trump, with 63-percent saying it doesn't matter and 7-percent saying a woman would have the advantage against this president. Women are no more or less likely than men to say a woman has a better chance of winning.
Support for Warren is significantly higher among voters who say either that it doesn't matter or who believe a woman has a better chance of winning, but she nonetheless trails Biden and Sanders among that group. Men overall are more likely than women to say either it doesn't matter or a woman has a better chance of beating Trump. Women are more likely than men to say a man has a better chance of beating Trump.
The Post-ABC poll was conducted by telephone from Monday through Thursday among a random national sample of 388 Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, including 349 who are registered voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus six percentage points for both groups.

White House lawyers are gearing up for a scorched-earth defense of President Trump in the impeachment trial, mounting a politically charged case aimed more at swaying American voters than GOP senators "" and damaging Trump's possible 2020 opponent, Joe Biden.
 Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, and Jay Sekulow, Trump's personal attorney, plan to use their time in the trial to target the former vice president and his son, Hunter, according to multiple GOP officials familiar with the strategy. Trump's allies believe that if they can argue that the president had a plausible reason for requesting the Biden investigation in Ukraine, they can both defend him against the impeachment charges and gain the added bonus of undercutting a political adversary. 
The strategy "" aimed squarely at muddying the waters surrounding the two impeachment articles of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress "" carries potential risk. Some congressional Republicans have encouraged the White House to prioritize a line-by-line rebuttal of the Democrats' case, ensuring that wary moderates are provided enough cover to vote for Trump's acquittal. It is unclear whether going after a former colleague will sway that core constituency, protecting moderates from possible political blowback at home "" though a senior administration official made clear that Trump's legal team would try to do both.
The official, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter frankly.
The offensive will mark the first time lawmakers or the public have heard a full-throated White House defense. The president's attorneys rejected the House invitation to participate in the last phase of the impeachment inquiry, making their presentation "" expected Saturday and Monday "" the team's first major turn in the spotlight. 
Until now, the White House has struggled to address why Trump froze military aid to Ukraine and repeatedly postponed a promised White House meeting with newly elected President Volodymyr Zelensky while pressing for investigations of the Bidens and an unfounded conspiracy theory about Ukraine interfering in the 2016 election. The White House also has had difficulty explaining why Trump's personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani was the point person on policy toward the Eastern European nation. 
In October, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney openly admitted that a quid pro quo occurred, telling reporters to 'get over it' "" though he later walked back the comments. 
Trump is eager for his team to take the stage and has been trying to strategically time it to maximize TV viewership. He has told allies that while he's fine with the defense beginning its presentation Saturday for a few hours starting at 10 a.m. "" in part because he hopes it will drive discussions on Sunday morning talk shows "" he prefers the bulk of their arguments to happen Monday when more Americans will be watching television, according to White House officials who were not authorized to speak publicly. 
'After having been treated unbelievably unfairly in the House, and then having to endure hour after hour of lies, fraud - deception by Shifty Schiff, Cryin' Chuck Schumer - their crew, looks like my lawyers will be forced to start on Saturday, which is called Death Valley in T.V.,' Trump tweeted Friday morning. 
The emerging strategy comes as the White House has heard conflicting advice from Republicans eager to share their opinion on the best rebuttal. In recent weeks, there has been a quiet, behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign by both GOP senators and Trump's House allies on his defense team, creating confusion among Republicans about which strategy the White House will adopt.
The deliberations occasionally have been marked by intense discussions, including debates about whether to push a process-focused case against Democrats or to take on each of their points and accusations individually, according to senators and congressional aides familiar with the talks. Over the past 24 hours, the debate has focused more on how much time should be dedicated to going after the Bidens. 
Those divergent views were on full display in the Capitol this week. Rep. Lee Zeldin, a New York Republican advising Trump's defense team, told reporters that Trump's lawyers needed to re-litigate what is considered a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election to help Hillary Clinton "" and, therefore, justified Trump pushing Ukraine to investigate the matter. But some Senate Republicans, including No. 2 leader John Thune (S.D.), want the White House to avoid what they consider a baseless conspiracy theory. 
'I think the intelligence community has very conclusively determined that it was Russia "" and not Ukraine "" that interfered in the 2016 election, so … I guess that's not a direction I would have them go,' Thune said.
Other Senate Republicans, including Trump ally Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), have publicly pushed back on a key White House legal team talking point: that the charges against the president do not constitute a crime and therefore his actions are not impeachable. 
Trump himself actively recruited lawyer and TV commentator Alan Dershowitz at a Mar-a-Lago buffet to make that very argument "" then sought out Dershowitz's wife to help persuade him to do it. 'He wants me to make the argument that the case does not meet the grounds for impeachment,' said Dershowitz. 'He knows that I feel very strongly about constitutional issues.'
Democrats, meanwhile, have been bracing for this moment, anxious about the Trump team getting 24 hours without any interruptions and pushback from impeachment managers. That concern only grew after Trump's lawyers uttered several inaccuracies on the Senate floor Tuesday, including a claim that House Republicans were not allowed to question witnesses during closed-door depositions. They could, and they did.
Democrats want to ensure that the Trump team doesn't get the last word, in part by using some of the allotted 16 hours of questions and answers to correct any misstatements. 
'I'm concerned about their deceptive and misleading statements,' said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), promising that Democrats would 'ask questions that are, in effect, an invitation to set the record straight.'
Democrats have been anticipating that the defense would shift attention from Trump's alleged misconduct to focus on the Bidens. That, in part, is what drove House managers to devote a considerable portion of their Thursday presentation to a preemptive rebuttal on those points, arguing that several Republicans and Europeans had supported Biden's efforts to push out corrupt former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin. 
Trump and Republicans have accused Biden "" without proof "" of ousting Shokin because the prosecutor was investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that employed Hunter Biden on its board while the elder Biden was vice president. Republicans also have pointed to concerns about the appearance of a conflict of interest, which were expressed by some of the Democrats' top witnesses in the impeachment inquiry.
'The House managers sort of drove a knife through the heart of those false arguments ahead of time … and I think that will help make the case,' Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters Thursday. 
Not all Republicans are eager about a singular focus on the former vice president. In an unusual role-reversal, Trump's most aggressive House allies have urged the legal team to focus on trying to undercut the Democrats' timeline and arguments.
'You can't talk about corruption broadly without talking about Burisma and Hunter Biden's involvement,' said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who also is assisting the defense team. 'That being said, I think the vast majority of this emphasis is on what were the components that led the president to ultimately release the aid.' 
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and his top attorney on the House Oversight Committee, Steve Castor, both of whom participated in the House investigation, have been working with the Trump team to try to highlight what they see as weak spots in the impeachment case.
As the impeachment managers showed clips of Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland confirming a quid pro quo, Jordan has pushed for the team to counter by highlighting Sondland's changing statements as well as his own admission that he never heard such a directive from Trump.
'Remember, Sondland is the guy who had to amend his testimony, the guy who had to clarify his testimony, is the guy they rely on the most?' Jordan said.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) has been on the other side of the argument, working closely with the White House and meeting with Trump's legal team as recently as Thursday evening to encourage them to go hard on Hunter Biden's Burisma position. 
'Focus on what matters, which is the substance,' he said on Hugh Hewitt's radio show Friday morning, summarizing his advice to Trump's team. 'And I told them, 'Look, nothing matters more than the facts on Burisma.' . . . Lay out substantive, factual reasons why investigating Burisma, the president had a responsibility to do so.'
Senate Republicans said they have been eager to hear what Trump's team has to say "" in part because they don't know what line of attack it will take. Privately, some Republican senators have groused in recent days that the Trump team is 'everywhere but nowhere,' as one described the dynamic, speaking on the condition anonymity to give a frank assessment.
'They are on TV and at the Capitol yelling at the Democrats, but I'm not really sure what the whole range of the argument is. Are you?' the GOP senator asked, adding that the frustration was shared by other Republicans.

Are his tweets helping or harming Sanders's chances?


ATHENS, Ga. - Just after waking up, Zach McDowell powered on his tablet and searched through Reddit. He picked up his cellphone and checked Twitter. Scanning through the rants of strangers praising and maligning his preferred presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), he asked himself a question: To tweet or not to tweet?
The question itself was new for McDowell, whose tweets defending Sanders used to be impulsive and unthinking. But as Sanders picked up momentum in the Democratic primaries, his critics continued to harp on the aggressive, online swarm of predominantly white male supporters that had rallied around the democratic socialist from Vermont. They called them the ""Bernie Bros.""
""I prefer the term Bernard Brother,"" McDowell said, because it seemed more respectable. As a white, mustachioed 23-year-old just out of college and working a $15-an-hour tutoring job, he fit the description. He acted the part too, occasionally joining in online pile-ons.
Now, McDowell was questioning his rules of online engagement. What if, for once, the pundits were right? The wrong tweet might feed into the stereotype and alienate potential supporters. Meanwhile, moderate Democrats were coalescing around former vice president Joe Biden, who was campaigning on restoring a sense of American civility. 
The criticism of Sanders's online attack squad has been harsh. As she ended her campaign Thursday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) decried the ""organized nastiness"" of some of his supporters, saying he did not do enough to rein them in.
Sanders has

 disavowed the most abusive voices while defending the majority of his backers.
""We have over 10.6 million people on Twitter, and 99.9 percent of them are decent human beings,"" Sanders said at a recent debate. ""And if there are a few people who make ugly remarks, who attack trade union leaders, I disown those people. They are not part of our movement.""
McDowell applauded Sanders's statement, but he also worried the criticism was overblown. He was just playing politics in the way he knew how.
His generation had grown up absorbing the news through ""The Daily Show"" and ""The Colbert Report,"" which intimately intertwined politics and absurdity. And political punditry on 24-hour news channels can seem as aggressive as any battle royal.
The gaming of American politics didn't seem much different from sports or the games he played online. And if that was the way politics was being played, should it not come with the trash-talking, irreverent hyperbole that comes with any other fan base on the Internet?
""I've seen people be just as vicious if you have a fight between Star Wars versus Star Trek,"" McDowell said.
Using a pseudonym and a private Twitter account closed to the general public, McDowell had added to a chorus of Sanders supporters who compared former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg to a rat and joked that Biden's campaign was ""elder abuse.""
When he saw a video with Warren, he searched his keyboard for the snake emoji - a common trope applied to Warren after she alleged Sanders told her that a woman couldn't beat President Trump. ""Hiss,"" McDowell had typed.
On this February morning, he was scrolling through Twitter again. Up came an ad for former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, featuring a montage of the ""Bernie Bros"" supposedly going too far.
The ad included examples of Sanders supporters threatening to ""come after"" fans of other candidates. But those instances were lumped in with a picture of Sanders photoshopped to make it seem like he was aiming a cartoonish gun at the viewer. ""I am no longer asking for your vote. #Bernieorbust,"" it said.
McDowell laughed so uncontrollably his eyes started to water. ""I don't know how I'm supposed to be threatened by this,"" he said. ""It's clearly fake, unless you're so old, and you have no glasses.""
Then came a tweet from an African American political analyst, Jason Johnson, who had referred to some Sanders supporters as ""racist liberal whites"" and ""misfit black girls"" after they attacked him for disputing the idea that Bloomberg is an oligarch.
""This guy has a PhD, and he doesn't understand what an oligarch is?"" McDowell said of Johnson.
McDowell tried to respond to Johnson. But the pundit had already blocked him.
That's when McDowell remembered that, months ago, he had tweeted at Johnson, who complained Sanders's supporters were taking his words out of context. 
McDowell replied: ""shut up nerd."" 
""I was just trying to be funny,"" he said. ""Maybe it is a failed attempt. Twitter is not real life.""

A movement unto itself

In real life, McDowell was driving to a house on a sunny Saturday in this college town where he was meeting with a group of Sanders supporters.
""What up?"" yelled a black woman with a large Afro named Mariah Parker standing on the porch.
""What up!"" McDowell replied. He stepped inside a living room filled with about 15 Sanders supporters, all under 40. Two-thirds of the group were women; one-third was black.
""The Bernie Bro stuff is an erasure of the stories of people like me,"" said Parker, who is 28. Sanders's unlikely political ascent had inspired Parker to run for office herself. In 2018, she became the first black LGBTQ woman to sit on the local county commission, and now she was organizing door-knocking campaigns to drum up support for Sanders in South Carolina.
""Are you all ready to elect the first Jewish, democratic socialist president?"" she asked the group to cheers.
McDowell jumped back into his Hyundai. Joining him were two friends he met in the library while he was a student at the University of Georgia.
""Would you like to sit in the front?"" Lydian Brambila, a 27-year-old student, asked Ryan Vogel, 36.
""No way,"" Vogel said. ""I don't want to be a Bernie Bro."" 
The three laughed. When others used the term, it stung like a slur. But when fellow Bernie fans used it, it felt like an inside joke.
Vogel, who is white and grew up wealthy, resented the lack of empathy some of his conservative relatives had for working people. Brambila was born to Mexican immigrants who worked long hours for little pay and taught their child to believe that the American Dream could be achieved by working hard and doing well in college. 
""The system didn't work for me,"" said Brambila, now a graduate student working a $15-an-hour job and sinking into debt getting treatment for debilitating migraines.
McDowell grew up upper-middle-class, the son of a commercial real estate agent and a stay-at-home mom. He was around 11 years old during the financial crisis of 2008. His father's company went bankrupt, and his parents began to cut back.
 ""My dad would come home, as a shell of a person, and his friends all hated their jobs,"" McDowell said. ""I was terrified in college that was the only way to live, and I was just trying to figure how to mitigate that suffering. And then came Bernie.""
Sanders's 2016 campaign gave the three a sense of relief that their family shame, their parents' exhaustion, their inability to attain the American ideal was not their fault. They believed Sanders when he said the struggles of working people were baked into a system reliant on greedy corporations and reckless lawmakers.
As McDowell's love for Sanders grew during the last presidential election, he became more suspicious of the Democratic establishment.
Problems counting votes during the 2016 primaries led him to believe that the Democratic National Committee and the system were working against Sanders.
""I felt like I was going insane in 2015 and 2016,"" McDowell said. ""All these things were happening, and we couldn't prove it. I just internalized a lot of it, thinking something was going on. Maybe that was the point of it, to make us feel powerless.""
So he began following Sanders supporters sleuthing online for clues that the fix was in. Soon he was reading ""Das Kapital"" and picking up jokes about Karl Marx. He found kindred spirits in a podcast called ""Chapo Trap House,"" a profane political comedy show whose hosts were unabashed Sanders supporters.
They joked that Buttigieg was in the CIA (hence, the rat imagery), mocked the sexual prowess of Bloomberg and became a cultural touchstone on the Reddit pages that McDowell perused.
""It's amazing how as crass and profane as the Chapos are, they are just as easy to show how heartfelt and sincere they are about the politics they espouse,"" McDowell said. ""To write that off as them being 'Bernie Bros' is just an oversimplification.""
This wave of young, radical support online was a movement unto itself, with a lexicon that borrowed from Chomsky and Lenin, potty humor and kink: ""Chud"" was the word they used for an obnoxious Trump supporter, and the ""Neolibs"" were the new generation of establishment Democrats. The art of applying theory to the real world was referred to as ""praxis,"" and to extricate oneself from the struggle was to ingest the ""black pill."" 
Generations of young socialists had longed for the revolution in American politics, and McDowell and his friends were eager to be a part of it, even if they worried it wouldn't succeed.
""Sometimes, I guess I worry that just, like, I'm going to die and not see anything change,"" Brambila said, as Bruce Springsteen's ""Born in the U.S.A."" played in the car. ""Do you think they will truly form solidarity with working people? I fear that I'll be alone. Just me and my advanced opinions.""
""You can't black pill yourself,"" McDowell said. ""You have to also take action. That's why we're going out today.""

Taking the conversation offline
They arrived in a working-class, majority-black area in Greenville, S.C. It was a hilly neighborhood with no sidewalks and decrepit single-family homes surrounded by oak trees. 
The campaign had assigned them to knock on 31 doors, which were all highlighted on a phone app. 
""Hi, I'm a volunteer with the Bernie Sanders campaign,"" McDowell said when a resident answered the door. ""Bernie is a candidate who believes in economic justice for all. Do you know about the primary coming up?"" 
The first woman who answered was a 30-year-old single mother working two jobs. She said she supported Sanders's policies to raise the minimum wage and legalize marijuana. At another home, a medical lab technician in his 40s told them he was between tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Sanders, which McDowell said would make the decision easy because Yang had dropped out of the presidential race. ""I didn't know that,"" the man said.
They continued walking along the street when a Suburu stopped in front of them. There were three older people inside.
""Can you give us some directions?"" the driver said. ""We keep on running into dead ends.""
The driver peered over the car window, squinting through her glasses.
""Y'all are Bernie?"" the driver said.
The Sanders trio nodded.
 ""We are out for Biden,"" the driver said. She seethed: ""We goin' beat you."" 
Then, the car sped off.
""OK boomer,"" Vogel joked. Political confrontation was more awkward in person.
The neighborhood was now in the rear-view mirror, and McDowell was back in his car, heading back to Georgia. 
The political landscape in South Carolina was different from what they had seen online. Over the course of the afternoon, not one voter had asked about Sanders being socialist or about their tweets. Many just wanted to have a conversation.
""They wanted to be treated with dignity,"" said Vogel from the back seat. ""We need to talk to people like they have dignity.""
Vogel's online presence did not always reflect that sentiment. After 2016, he stopped posting serious messages about politics on Facebook. It was ruining too many friendships, particularly when he noted sarcastically on Election Day, ""Who could have anticipated that the least popular Democratic candidate ever could lose to Trump?"" He didn't cast a ballot for president that year, abstaining from choosing between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
""I remember being so mad at you,"" Brambila said. ""How dare you, with the privilege of not being scared, choose not to vote? I was angry and wanted you to feel shamed.""
""I feel bad about it,"" Vogel said. ""A lot of people still aren't talking to me.""
This time around, Vogel tried to keep his political commentary lighter. The soft sell did not seem to work, either. After he posted a meme using a Star Trek character to criticize Warren as a faux liberal, he found himself getting into an online argument with someone who condemned him as a ""cultist"" for Sanders and a ""Bernie Bro.""
Brambila argued that perhaps it was time to take the conversation offline. More success could be found talking in person, like they did while door-knocking. What was there to be gained by piling onto celebrities' feeds, mocking supporters of other candidates with cheeky memes and threatening violence? 
""It's just, now that we might win, maybe we should find ways to be more welcoming,"" Brambila said. ""Maybe it changes our approach, to help find solidarity with more people.""
""I'll be honest,"" Vogel said. ""With all this Bernie Bro stuff, I'm more hyper aware of things I do online. I just am.""
McDowell wasn't so sure he was ready to give up social media just yet. He thought Brambila had a point and that threatening violence went too far. But he found camaraderie online. And he felt some of the criticism directed at Sanders's supporters was not in good faith - designed more to undermine the movement than anything else.
Vogel glanced at his phone. On the Twitter feed: A New York Post headline that Judge Judy vowed to ""fight the Bernie Sanders revolution to the death."" A friend of Vogel's in Hollywood compared Sanders's movement to Trump's. Chris Matthews, then still an MSNBC host, likened Sanders's victory in Nevada to the fall of France to the Nazis in World War II.
""How is saying that okay?"" McDowell asked of Matthews, who had later apologized for the comments. ""That boy ain't right. He needs some milk.""
Brambila apologized to Vogel for trying to shame him for not voting in 2016. 
""I'm no longer 'vote blue no matter who,' "" Brambila said. ""These people don't support my interests.""
""We live in Georgia,"" Vogel said. ""It's not like a Democrat is going to win here anyway.""
""If our boy doesn't win, then it probably means the DNC cheated again,"" McDowell said. ""I think he's going to win. This country is going to see the bigger picture.""
It was dark by the time they returned to Georgia. After dropping off Vogel and Brambila, McDowell wrestled with himself about what to do if Sanders lost the nomination. He considered Trump to be more dangerous than Biden and worried about how a second term might affect immigrants and minorities in this country. 
Twitter might not be real life, but politics was, and dogma had its limitations. Sitting out of the election was a black pill he did not want to take.

EAST AMANA, Iowa "" Anna Navin stepped out of her Honda, grabbed a large pink backpack from the passenger seat of her car and knocked on the door of Glenn Goetz, a 68-year-old retiree.
Navin, a 28-year-old organizer for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was meeting with Goetz to see whether he would take on more duties as a precinct captain, including knocking on doors in other nearby communities and helping recruit volunteers.
As she stepped inside, Navin and Goetz greeted each other like old friends, and after a few months of running into each other at county parades and volunteer events she had hosted on Warren's behalf, they were. He offered her a cup of tea and a plate of freshly baked cookies as they sat down at his kitchen table to strategize about an area he planned to canvass. 
He had already been to the neighborhood, and he wondered whether it was too aggressive. 'You know, the more we talk to these caucusgoers, the better,' Navin assured him. 'People will know you as the Warren guy.'
Navin was careful not to ask too much. Democrats here tend to resist the 'big, structural change' central to Warren's campaign. Many work with fans of President Trump, or live next door to them. In this environment, even some of Warren's most loyal supporters are reluctant to come out.
'You want to be respectful of what people are comfortable with and what they aren't comfortable with,' she said. One of the biggest parts of her job, she said, is holding people's hands and gently leading them further.
It is one of the many lessons Navin has learned while trying to forge the human connection that often determines a voter's willingness to turn out on a cold winter night to caucus. She has made the argument for her candidate face to face, house to house, going to places politicians often don't to rally support. She is one of the hundreds of young staffers and volunteers who descend on Iowa every four years like an invading army and are the vital backbone of presidential campaigns here.
Many Democratic presidential candidates, such as former vice president Joe Biden, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), have robust organizations. But among locals, Warren's organization stands out.
Although the campaign has declined to release exact numbers, the senator is believed to have more than 100 field staff fanned out across the state, including some who have been on the ground for the better part of a year. Warren staffers have become deeply embedded, showing up at high school sports games, book clubs, bingo nights and potluck dinners dressed in the campaign's signature liberty green attire. In Fairfield, Iowa, a family recently named their newborn goat Herb, after the Warren field organizer who has prolifically canvassed that town for months. In Mason City, an organizer who was in the hospital for emergency surgery used his recovery time to pitch the ER staff on Warren's candidacy.
The stories about Warren staffers in Iowa and how far they go to sell her candidacy regularly circulate among rival campaigns, eliciting eye rolls, but also grudging admiration. 'It's like, where did they find these kids?' marveled a longtime Iowa Democratic activist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because she endorsed another candidate in the race.
As Warren's poll numbers slip amid attacks from rivals over her embrace of Medicare-for-all and the costs of her various policy plans, she is counting on her organization to help her finish on top in Iowa, propelling her to New Hampshire and beyond.
Navin, organizing in a part of Iowa Democrats seldom go, is part of that plan.
An English major in college, Navin got involved in politics three years ago, after Trump's election. Back then, she was living in the Bay Area, working for the Oakland chapter of Habitat for Humanity. She quit her job and moved to Arizona, where she worked as a field organizer for a few Democratic campaigns, including Kyrsten Sinema's successful U.S. Senate bid.
After that, she thought she had retired from organizing "" 'I'm old for this job,' she said, pointing out that many of her colleagues are in their early 20s. But earlier this spring, Navin heard Warren speak about affordable housing, the issue she cared about most, describing it as a human right. 
'I just fell in love right there,' Navin said. 'I thought, we have to elect a woman like that. . . . And that is what got me out to Iowa.'
For the past seven months, she has become intimately acquainted with the rolling landscape of Iowa and Tama counties, a rural area in eastern Iowa that has grown increasingly conservative over the years. The counties were among the 31 in the state that backed Barack Obama before supporting Trump three years ago. There are about 5,900 registered Democrats here, about a quarter of the electorate according to the state voter roll, spread out over some 1,300 square miles. Most voters are registered as 'no party.'
Navin makes about $700 a week, about the same amount she was earning in California. But the money goes much further here, especially because she is doing little besides working. She regularly pulls 12-hour days on Warren's behalf, seeking out undecided voters, holding supporter meetups and doing whatever else she can. She lives off gas station pizza or bags of cheddar-flavored Chex Mix, her go-to snack. 'I have bags in my trunk,' she said.
For fun, she and her roommate "" a fellow Warren organizer "" sometimes watch videos of Warren's events from that day. 'I wake up thinking about Elizabeth Warren,' Navin said. 'And I go to bed thinking about Elizabeth Warren.'
Navin's days usually begin around sunrise, when she reads emails and catches up on what's happening with the campaign.
Before she heads out for the day, she has calls with other Warren staffers and launches into what is a near-constant stream of texting with volunteers she has recruited and other prospective supporters, setting up meetings or going over canvassing schedules. Navin is out the door by 9 or 10 a.m., making the hour commute to one of her two counties to meet with voters and knock on doors.
Navin often finds herself driving down long dusty roads to remote farms, unsure of what reception she will get. Although she has a list of Democrats and independents she is tracking down, she occasionally finds herself face to face with a spouse or family member who backed Trump in the last election, or talking to a Democrat who says Warren is way too liberal.
People have never been rude or unkind, she said. No one has ever slammed a door in her face. If people didn't want to talk, they told her so. But to her surprise, many often did, and invited her inside their homes, in part because they were shocked she had come knocking at all. 'You get to know people in these more intimate settings,' Navin said. 'Because it's these one-on-one meetings. . . . You get longer to talk to people, to get to know them.'
After meeting with Goetz, Navin went to the public library in Williamsburg to meet with Callie Reynolds, 29, a young mother who had started volunteering for the campaign after meeting Navin at a coffee shop in North English, where she lives.
Reynolds, along with her 2-year-old son Kohner, regularly knocked on doors. As Navin produced crayons and a coloring sheet featuring Warren's golden retriever Bailey to keep Kohner occupied, Reynolds excitedly told her she had sent more than 3,000 text messages to voters the day before on the senator's behalf. 'They are talking about me in the chat rooms,' Reynolds said excitedly, referring to a mobile app used by Warren volunteers. 'They don't understand how I'm so fast.'
Reynolds had been working on voters much closer to home, too, including her mother and her fiance, both registered Republicans. She was close to convincing her fiance, and her mother had just committed to caucus for Warren, in part because of her plan to revitalize rural America. 'One more down!' Reynolds said.
Even when Navin finds Warren supporters, they are often reluctant to openly identify as Democrats. During an afternoon meeting in North English, Jason Lightfoot, 45, agreed to canvass on Warren's behalf "" as long as it was not in the city where he lives. 'Everyone knows where I lean politically, based on Facebook. I don't hide it,' he said. 'But signs in the yard, knocking on doors, I know I probably shouldn't do that.'
Part of the reluctance was his wife's job as principal at the local high school, which he worried could be complicated by politics. But he also admitted he did not want to get into it with his neighbors, who tend to be more conservative than he is.
'People don't feel comfortable. I get it,' Navin said about Lightfoot's hesitance. 'You can't make people do something they don't want to do.'
Navin drove back to Williamsburg, where she presided over a phone bank with four female volunteers she had recruited from the region, including Reynolds. The group had lists of registered Democrats and independents in Iowa and Tama counties, and as they drank tea and nibbled on candy and sandwiches, they went row by row, calling the voters.
Tina Becerra-Hensley, a 55-year-old volunteer from Amana, had brought a bell rattle, which she loudly shook when she spoke to a voter who said they were supporting Warren. Each time, the women cheered wildly. 
But on a few of the calls, voters voiced some concerns. One questioned Warren's Medicare-for-all proposal and its impact on private insurance. Another bluntly said he did not believe a woman could beat Trump and could not support Warren because of that.
As Olivia Doehrmann, a 24-year-old special-education teacher from Amana, tried to discuss this opinion with the man, the women grew quiet and listened to her end of the conversation. The joy and energy in the room slowly deflated. The issue had come up before.
After Doehrmann hung up, Rosetta Mason, 60, shook her head. 'When I hear a man say that, I say to them, 'What if it were your daughter? Are you going to tell your daughter she can't run for president?' ' Mason said. 'I don't understand why people think we're not ready for a woman. It should be about what job skills you have.'
Across the table, Navin nodded. She had heard this same argument from other voters during her months traveling the back roads of this rural county, how they just were not convinced that a woman could win. Every time it came up, Navin had the same answer, pointing to the record number of women elected to Congress in last year's midterm elections and how Warren had made history as the first woman from Massachusetts ever elected to the U.S. Senate.
Now Navin tried to raise the spirits of these women, her most loyal volunteers, who had sacrificed hours of their time approaching friends and neighbors on behalf of Warren, a woman they would probably never meet, because they believed in her and her cause.
'People said Barack Obama wasn't electable. People said Donald Trump wasn't electable,' Navin said. 'If anyone can [break barriers], it's Elizabeth.'

President plunges toward kind of conflict 
he pledged to avoid 
With a single momentous decision to authorize a drone strike killing a top Iranian commander in Baghdad, President Trump immediately thrust himself into the center of a volatile and unpredictable region "" taking his presidency into just the kind of foreign entanglement he pledged to avoid. 
Trump followed early Friday's targeted strike on Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani "" the leader of Iran's special operations forces abroad "" with a decision to send an additional 3,500 soldiers to the Middle East to respond to the heightened tensions. 
Coming in quick succession, the drone strike and troop deployment cast Trump as a pivotal figure in what could be the United States' next military conflict with a foreign power. The moves also underscored how Trump's impulsive approach to the presidency can swiftly upend the status quo to produce a sense of disarray.
Iran has pledged 'harsh retaliation' over the killing of Soleimani. Iraqi officials have publicly condemned the United States for conducting the strike on its soil. Global markets fell Friday, while oil prices shot upward. The State Department urged Americans to flee Iraq immediately. Praise and criticism for Trump's actions reverberated through Congress and the campaign trail Friday, largely along partisan lines.
The killing may be the test of presidential mettle that Trump's critics, U.S. allies and even some Republicans have worried would come. Inexperienced in global affairs outside the business realm, distrustful of international alliances and resentful of U.S. obligations overseas, Trump is now on the knife's edge of what could be wider conflict in the very region he blames for unfairly entangling U.S. forces.
Trump sought to project a sense of calm as he addressed the nation Friday, claiming that the 'flawless precision strike' had stopped Soleimani from carrying out an 'imminent' attack on American diplomats. 
'We took action last night to stop a war,' the president said from his Florida vacation home. 'We did not take action to start a war.'
Trump has vacillated between his isolationist impulses and his desire to present an image of strength to foes around the world, leading to confusion about his foreign policy ideology, said Leon Panetta, who served as a defense secretary and CIA director in past Democratic administrations. 
'Part of the problem that has led to this situation is a series of mixed messages from this administration as to exactly what the president stands for,' he said. 'We're now in this cycle of punch and counterpunch, and I just don't see how we're going to be able to successfully end this cycle before we get into a war.'
Trump indicated that he is hoping to avoid a war with Iran, even as he asserted that the United States is 'ready and prepared' for any retaliation from Tehran.
'I have deep respect for the Iranian people,' Trump said. 'They are a remarkable people, with an incredible heritage and unlimited potential. We do not seek regime change.'
But Iranian leaders have publicly threatened retaliation, underscoring the significance of the airstrike that killed Soleimani, the longtime commander of Iran's Quds Force, on a road near the Baghdad airport. Trump seemed to respond in kind, warning on Twitter on Saturday evening that 'if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets, we have targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level - important to Iran - the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD.'
Iraq's parliament planned to hold an extraordinary session Sunday to discuss the attack, which Iraqi leaders condemned as a violation of sovereignty. 
By owning the potential for conflict with Iran and potentially upending relations with Iraq, Trump is tempting war with the most potent adversary he is likely to face, short of a full nuclear conflict with North Korea. Iran is second only to Israel in the might of its military in the Middle East. It is economically and diplomatically connected across the world, including with U.S. allies and in proximity to nations and interests dear to the United States, including Israel, Europe and the oil-rich Persian Gulf.
While U.S. intelligence has closely tracked Soleimani for years, Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama rejected such a strike out of concern it would lead to war. Trump embraced that difference Friday, seeking to imply that he was tougher and more willing to confront adversaries than his predecessors.
'What the United States did yesterday should have been done long ago,' Trump said. 'A lot of lives would have been saved.'
Trump's decision was immediately met with partisan rancor, as congressional leaders learned of the strike from public news reports rather than customary private briefings. On Saturday evening, after the White House sent over a classified notification to Congress of the Soleimani strike, that divide deepened. The notification, required by the War Powers Act, comes as Democrats are already considering steps to limit the president's ability to act in Iran without congressional approval. 
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Friday that he was not briefed as is customary in such operations and warned, 'This action may well have brought our nation closer to another endless war, exactly the kind of endless war the president promised he would not drag us into.'
Some GOP lawmakers close to Trump also said they were not told about the operation before it happened "" and said privately that they would have appreciated a briefing. But Republicans almost universally praised Trump publicly, even as some sought more information about what Soleimani's death might mean for the stability of the region.
'Ultimately it was his decisive action that made the difference,' said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), a Trump confidant. 'The pundits who say this will embolden terrorists must have 'Hug a Terrorist' bumper stickers on the back of their cars. It's ridiculous.'
For Trump, Iran has been a constant source of interest since before he ran for office. He sharply criticized Obama in 2011, accusing him of inviting war to improve his reelection chances. He called the 2015 international diplomatic agreement limiting Iran's nuclear program a catastrophe and rejected U.S. allies' pleas to retain the pact even if it was not perfect. He eventually overrode objections from his national security advisers and withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018. 
Trump has also openly courted new talks with Iran, often praising the country for its own negotiating skills and promising that he could deliver the airtight deal he says Obama could not. As recently as September, Trump said he hoped for face-to-face negotiations with Iran's leaders.
Although Trump has taken provocative steps before, including designating Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization, he has also stepped back from potential conflict. He called off U.S. airstrikes on Iranian facilities in June, following the downing of a U.S. drone. And he took no military action following a devastating September attack on Saudi oil facilities that he blamed on Iran.
The head-snapping moves have left a trail of confusion in Washington and other global capitals about the nature of Trump's foreign policy doctrine.
When he campaigned in 2016, Trump touted an 'America First' policy, arguing that wars in the Middle East had been colossal failures, costing American lives and treasure. 
'War and aggression will not be my first instinct,' he said in an April 2016 foreign policy speech. 'A superpower understands that caution and restraint are really truly signs of strength.'
The tension between Trump's desire to project toughness and his desire to pull back from Middle East conflicts is at its most critical point right now, as his 2020 reelection effort is gearing up.
Late Friday, Trump was privately telling his top advisers he was surprised at how quickly many Democrats have criticized him, according to a White House official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly. 
Trump said that he feels like he caught the Iranians 'red-handed' as they attempted to plan future attacks and finds it 'almost funny' that Democrats 'can't say, 'Wow, this is great,' ' according to the official.
In particular, Trump is keeping close watch on former vice president Joe Biden, whom he continues to see as his likely future rival in the fall election campaign, the official and others close to the president said. 
Still, White House officials and leading Republicans cautioned Friday that Trump should not be considered a hawk and said he was prone in meetings this week to bemoan 'nation-building.' They said he does not rely on the advice of generals as much as he did earlier in his presidency.
Some veteran Republicans see benefits for Trump's reelection campaign, especially in a potential matchup with Biden.
'It's a very strong moment for him and a great contrast with Joe Biden,' said former senator Rick Santorum (R-Pa.). 'He can argue Biden and the Obama administration have always been indecisive, and I expect he'd make that case if it ends up being the president against Biden.'
On Friday, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner and others had discussed a possible prime-time address by the president, but those plans did not materialize, according to a White House official and a top GOP lawmaker who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private deliberations. 
Trump's Iran policy has faced withering criticism, as there has been little indication that the president's 'maximum pressure' campaign has achieved its desired results.
'There's been a lack of realistic strategic thinking about the Iran policy since the beginning of the Trump administration,' said David Schanzer, director of the Triangle Center on Terrorism and Homeland Security at Duke University. 
'There is an idea that essentially it could be bullied into acting against its own interests, and I think that was unrealistic in light of the history of the relationship with the United States and the nature of the regime.'
Robert Malley, president of the International Crisis Group and a former Obama administration official, said it is all but certain that Iran will respond in the wake of Soleimani's death. He cautioned that Iran may not do so immediately, meaning that U.S. forces will have to be 'on guard for a long time.'
Panetta said he feared that Trump had not fully considered the risks associated with taking out Soleimani and disrupting the politics of a volatile region.
'The 21st century is a century in which we've easily gotten into wars but found it very difficult to get out of wars,' he said. 'So there is a greater responsibility now to evaluate just exactly what the consequences are going to be.'

To counter Trump, White House hopeful is taking his fight online


Joe Biden is attempting to significantly escalate his public presence, following two weeks in which he has been confined to his home, a limitation that left some Democrats worried their party had lost a prominent national voice to counter President Trump.
After the March 17 primaries, Biden gave an election night speech from his home, but the poorly lit backdrop and grainy footage made even some of his supporters wince and compare it to a hostage video. 
He tried a virtual town hall, which was riddled with technical glitches. 
Democrats urged Biden's campaign to try to wrestle a place onstage to better compete with Trump, and abruptly Biden has begun to change course.
Utilizing a new camera that was installed in his basement over the weekend, Biden sat for a round of television interviews that his advisers said were meant to open a new phase in which the former vice president will be far more visible to Americans as they navigate the nation's twin health and economic crises. He took questions from reporters on Wednesday and held a virtual happy hour with supporters Wednesday night. 
He expressed dismay over Trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic, ridiculing him for not doing more sooner, urging him to listen to scientific experts and saying of the president's plan to get Americans back to work by Easter: ""What's he talking about?""
""He should stop talking and start listening to the medical experts,"" Biden said Tuesday on CNN. ""What is going on with this man?""
""He says he's a wartime president - well, God, act like one,"" he added. ""Move. Fast.""
In the Wednesday video conference with reporters, Biden again criticized Trump's timeline.
""It would be a catastrophic thing to do for our people and for our economy if we sent people back to work just as we were beginning to see the impact of social distancing take hold,"" he said.

The drumbeat prompted relief from some Democrats who had worried Biden was rendering himself almost invisible.

""A week ago I would have said he wasn't present nearly enough. Now, it seems like they're finding their footing and he's taking the right tone,"" said Julián Castro, the former housing secretary under President Barack Obama and a former Democratic presidential candidate. 
""He has a lot of experience and Vice President Joe Biden does reassure people,"" Castro added. ""He should use that - and I think that's why he needs to be more present.""
Although Biden has more than four decades of experience as an elected official, he holds no current role that would give him public standing amid the crisis, apart from being the leading candidate in the Democratic presidential race. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is his sole remaining competitor. 
Trump's daily briefings have been widely aired. Among Democrats, the most visible daily appearances have been made by two governors, Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Gavin Newsom of California.
In recent days, Biden also has deferred to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), not wanting to do or say anything to unravel delicate negotiations in Congress over measures to help workers and companies. 

That has at times made Biden more of a political bystander than the party's standard-bearer.
""I have to tell you, I find that just like anybody who cares about this, I'm chomping at the bit. I wish I were still in the Senate, being able to impact on some of these things,"" Biden told reporters Wednesday. ""But I am where I am. I hope to be the nominee of the Democratic Party. And I hope I'm able to get my message across as we go forward.""
Some Democrats have privately told Biden that he has to do more to improve, saying that his low profile was driving broad concerns that he wasn't capitalizing on Trump's widely panned early response.
""I have some sympathy for him because it's a hard thing. He has no formal responsibility. You can't go out. You can't have events. It's hard,"" said David Axelrod, a Democratic strategist who helped run Obama's campaign during the economic crisis in 2008. ""But I think there are things he could do. You can do things that are more interesting than giving poorly produced quasi-presidential speeches.""
Many Democrats pointed to a video featuring Biden adviser Ron Klain - an explainer, complete with a whiteboard, about Trump's coronavirus response and the holes in his arguments - as a viral success. But it also underscored the failings in Biden's own events - speeches that have at times been halting or beset by technical problems. 
Other Democrats have organized more seamless appearances. Over the past week, former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke has used Facebook Live several times to get messages out. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) headlined two conference calls with activists to gin up support for the priorities she was pushing to include in congressional coronavirus legislation. 

Sanders held an online coronavirus town hall on Tuesday night with Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and health experts, and he had another live stream on Wednesday night. 
All told, Sanders had held seven coronavirus-related events that were seen by 14 million viewers. He also raised more than $2 million for various charities that support those affected by the outbreak. 

Biden campaign advisers say they are trying to do more and attempting to get him in front of a camera every day. They also are trying to hone other ideas, such as live-streamed conversations with doctors or with young people, or events highlighting grocery workers and others whose roles have become essential. 
Driving some of the anxiety among Democrats is that Trump's approval rating has increased amid the crisis. Biden on Wednesday said that the emphasis should be on Trump's actions, but he also suggested that it would be good for the country if Trump is seen as strong.
""Well, I hope that he does - he's so strong that he's up way above that,"" he said of new Gallup job approval numbers. ""Because we need the help now.""
The demand by some Democrats that Biden more aggressively seek out attention comes as key blocs of the party are beginning to coalesce around his candidacy. In the past few weeks, as he has won a string of primaries, several of the largest labor unions in the country have backed Biden. 
""These two things give him the latitude to be the standard-bearer of a fight for people and for working families,"" said Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, the county's second-largest teachers union. ""He now has the latitude to be the standard-bearer, and I think you're going to see that more and more.""
Some Democrats pointed out that Biden has demonstrated he has an enormous well of support among the party's voters, which gives him a wide berth to work out an appropriate response to Trump. 
""What that miracle of Super Tuesday showed is there really is a depth of support for Biden in this country, even though he was coming off a year where he was not operating at the top of his game,"" said Jennifer Palmieri, who was Hillary Clinton's communications director in 2016. ""I think he understands he's a vessel for people who have decided, 'You're the guy that we want to take on Trump.' ""
Like other Americans, Biden has found his own life altered in recent weeks. He is no longer surrounded daily by his advisers, many of whom are now working from home. Instead, he has been holding two 90-minute conference calls each morning, one with a group of health experts and another with a team of economic advisers. 

In a chilling detail that indicates the added anxiety around his age - he is 77 - and medical vulnerability, Biden revealed several days ago that when campaign workers occasionally come to his house, they wear gloves and masks. He recently began receiving protection from the Secret Service, and those agents, too, are wearing gloves and masks. 
Biden said on Tuesday that he has not been tested for the coronavirus and that his doctors have told him he does not have any underlying conditions that could increase his risk, beyond his age.
Biden has indicated that he will soon begin narrowing the options for his running mate, whom he has said will be a woman. His initial list holds more than a dozen names, but he said he is attempting to narrow it down to about 11 for more serious vetting. 
His more immediate concern is Sanders's continued presence. Biden's advisers have been speaking to those close to the senator, trying to find common ground, although Sanders is showing no signs of an imminent departure and has said he would agree to another debate with Biden in April. 
""I think we've had enough debates,"" Biden told reporters Wednesday. ""I think we should get on with this.""

Journalist
on Trump's machismo and Buttigieg's stoicism
When Rush Limbaugh poked fun at the idea that Democrats might nominate Pete Buttigieg, a 'gay guy' who 'loves kissing his husband on debate stages,' to face off against a real 'Mr. Man' like President Trump, the former South Bend, Ind., mayor responded characteristically. Rather than feign outrage and denounce the radio host's bigotry, he used Limbaugh to create positive viral moments for himself. Buttigieg waited a few days until he had a national audience on CNN, where he said last Sunday: 'Well, I love my husband. I'm faithful to my husband.' Then, coolly, and with a hint of a grin, he added, 'I'm not going to take lectures on family values from the likes of Rush Limbaugh.' 
Limbaugh took the bait. The next day on his show, he claimed that Buttigieg was 'mad' about his comments, and said Trump had called to encourage him to 'never apologize' for them. Now that Buttigieg had apparently lured Trump into the mix, he delivered the coup de grace at a town hall in Las Vegas on Tuesday: 'I mean, sorry, but one thing about my marriage is it's never involved me having to send hush money to a porn star after cheating on my spouse with him or her.' 
Buttigieg's persona has inspired a thousand jibes and memes during his unlikely run, most of them unflattering: He's an 'emotionless technocrat' for instance, or just plain 'Mayo Pete.' And while he has turned himself from a small-city mayor into a serious contender for president, Buttigieg's super-composed exterior can be a disadvantage in a party primary race, where passion and 'relatability' are appealing. 
But in a general election, one on one against an out-of-control bully like Trump, Buttigieg's calm and calculated approach would make him a very dangerous challenger. A contest between Buttigieg and Trump would present a clash between two distinct "" and distinctly old-school "" ways of projecting masculinity. It would be like a comically over-the-top WWE Hall of Famer entering the ring against a 21st-century Gary Cooper, whose secret weapon is his steely self-possession.
Trump is a classic case study of what psychologists call 'masculine overcompensation.' After future Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter called him a 'short-fingered vulgarian' in 1988, Trump reportedly spent 25 years sending him pictures of his hands, digits circled in gold Sharpie, to prove otherwise. When Marco Rubio picked up on the theme in 2016, Trump turned the next Republican debate into a nationally televised member-measuring contest: 'He referred to my hands "" 'If they're small, something else must be small.' I guarantee you there's no problem. I guarantee.'
It's not enough for Trump to be tall and bulky; when men get under his skin, he has to belittle them, literally, with labels like 'Liddle' Bob Corker,' 'Liddle' Adam Schiff' and now 'Mini Mike' Bloomberg, who 'wants a box for the debates.' It's not enough to control America's nuclear codes; he must boast to Kim Jong Un that his 'nuclear button' is 'a much bigger - more powerful one.' And when it comes to women, standard-issue misogyny is never enough. Stormy Daniels becomes a 'Horseface' for threatening his manhood, while the 'hot' ones, he boasts, always welcome even his crudest sexual advances. 
But masculinity is always a performance; the more performative it is, the less healthy. And Buttigieg's act is just as consistent and firmly ingrained as Trump's routine, though it offers a starkly different presentation: even-keeled, carefully controlled and cerebral. Some attribute it to Midwestern stoicism, and his mother has called it 'a family trait.' Others have chalked it up to his time poring over grocery-pricing spreadsheets for McKinsey and Co. 
Buttigieg has told me and other reporters that he's just 'laid back,' with a talent for 'compartmentalizing.' But gay men like Buttigieg and me, who choose to stay in the closet well into adulthood, often develop the kind of 'strong, silent' and non-demonstrative form of masculinity that we thought we had to adopt to survive, or to hide, or both. When you're in the closet, every moment of every day is a calculated performance "" the way you walk, the way you talk, what you wear, the way you look at girls, the way you deal with boys, what you tell your parents about your day.
You can still see the effects of the closet in Buttigieg's formal bearing (not just a military trait), his difficulty really opening up into a smile (his mouth stretches into a toothy grimace, with his eyes squinted) and the invisible barrier that always seems to exist in each interaction, no matter how pleasant. It's what happens, as Michael Hobbes wrote for HuffPost, after years of 'constantly scanning social situations for ways we may not fit into them.' And for Buttigieg, who didn't come out until age 33, that's a lot of years of unnatural self-constraint. -
During my three interviews with him before he declared his presidential campaign, Buttigieg didn't care to talk much about any of that, though he joked at times about his rigid habits. His husband, Chasten, was more forthcoming. 'I can see how people think he has a lot of walls up,' he said. 'Peter's still trying to come out of his shells.' 
When he first gave a full accounting of his time in the closet "" in a speech at a Human Rights Campaign event in Las Vegas last year "" it was all about pain, until he 'became whole' later in life. In his teens, he said of his sexuality, 'I would have cut it out with a knife.' That chimed deeply with anyone who's been there: the welter of emotions stuffed down, through dint of constant effort and practice, because the cost of revealing them might be exposure. Coming out of the closet and finding "" if you're as lucky as Buttigieg "" the love of your life is massively freeing and courage-giving. But old habits of presenting yourself don't drop away overnight. 
No presentation of masculinity "" not Buttigieg's, and not Trump's "" is a salubrious thing. It's all toxic. But there's a key difference. Trump's idea of manliness involves degrading women, threatening violence against racial and religious and sexual minorities, and using false and superficial displays of 'strength' (Who's the loudest? Who's the meanest? Who's sleeping with the hottest women? Who's making other people look small?) to overcome self-doubt and feel 'big.' By contrast, men who take the stoic approach, stifling their emotions and anything that smacks of stereotypical 'femininity,' mostly harm themselves; acting like Gary Cooper can eat you up from the inside. But on a general-election stage, against Trump's primordial displays of dominance, the style that Buttigieg fashioned in the closet might serve him well, especially combined with the relative freedom he's found in the few years since. That's partly because his only real insecurity in life, it appears, has been about his queerness; intellectually, politically and morally, Buttigieg betrays almost too much self-confidence. He speaks in such perfect paragraphs that his critics think he is scripted, even when he improvises. It can sometimes come off as lofty or smarter-than-thou "" but the message discipline is impressive. And Buttigieg has shown a sneaky flair for effective zingers.-
This past week, Buttigieg offered a taste of how he'd square off against Trump. Asked what he'd do if he became president and Trump refused to leave the White House, the ex-mayor deadpanned, 'I guess if he's willing to do chores, we can work something out.' While Trump would have no trouble striking back at Joe Biden, with his schoolyard threats to 'beat the hell out of him,' or Bloomberg, trying to out-billionaire him, how would his fragile manhood respond to such casual disdain from, of all things, a gay man?
'We know what he's going to do, and it just doesn't get to me,' Buttigieg said on the trail awhile back, when someone asked how he'd stand up to Trump on a debate stage. 'Look, I can deal with bullies. I'm gay and I grew up in Indiana. I'll be fine.' It's hard to believe, whatever you think of his politics, that he wouldn't be fine; in many ways, he seems well-suited to tie this particular opponent in knots. Which would, if it ever came about, be a heavy irony indeed: a persona developed in lonely suffering, helping to lift the first openly gay candidate to the presidency.

When he organized the first retreat of the Blue Dog Coalition in 1995, then-Rep. John Tanner reserved 50 rooms at a resort on Maryland's Eastern Shore. 
As the event drew closer, the Tennessee Democrat learned that he had booked only 23 rooms, setting the coalition of fiscally moderate House Democrats off to a potentially very rocky start.
On Friday, though, the Blue Dogs celebrated their 25th birthday, a quarter-century run of bonding over what it is like to represent the most conservative terrain inside the House Democratic caucus. Their ranks have ebbed and flowed over the years, a movement that could usually be seen as tracking whether the Democrats were holding the majority.
If their weekly meetings had several dozen lawmakers, that meant things were going well for House Democrats. When attendance dropped into the low teens, as it did five years ago, that meant Democrats were out in the political wilderness searching for a path to relevance. 
Now flush with 25 members "" including nine freshmen, eight of whom flipped GOP districts in 2018 "" this coalition feels as if it is once again thriving. They look a lot younger and more diverse than the original 23 members, with a geographic focus that is shifting into the suburban districts that were once Republican strongholds. 
'While the makeup and size of our coalition has changed over the years, our focus on fiscal responsibility and a strong national security has never wavered,' Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), the current co-chairman of the Blue Dogs, said in a House floor speech last week. 
Their focus on fiscal matters, however, comes at a fairly stark moment in national politics. After spending the Obama White House years howling about the federal debt, Republicans have largely abandoned fiscal restraint both in terms of tax and spending policies, with the debt soaring by more than $3 trillion in President Trump's three years in office. 
Democrats running for president often critique Trump and Republicans for rank hypocrisy on the issue, but none has any real plan to tackle the debt. In fact, while they all generally would push to repeal the 2017 tax cuts, those presidential candidates then would use those funds on expansive federal programs, such as the Medicare-for-all proposal touted by Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). 
This makes the Blue Dogs, while strong again in numbers and clout, feel almost as isolated now on a key policy as they were when Tanner madly scrambled to find staff and strategists to attend their first retreat. 
'Most importantly, Blue Dogs remain focused on our founding principles of fiscal responsibility,' said Murphy, who has endorsed former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg in the 2020 race. 
Clearly the coalition is quite concerned that Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist, at the top of the ticket would put many of their seats in peril. So far, among those who have endorsed, the Blue Dogs heavily favor Bloomberg and former vice president Joe Biden. 
After the 1994 elections swept Republicans into the House majority for the first time in 40 years, making huge gains in defeating rural Democrats, some of those remaining felt as if they needed a new home. 
Tanner, who retired in 2010, put together a group of more than 20 Democrats who survived the previous election and wanted to find some middle ground, particularly after Republicans successfully lampooned the Clinton administration's health-care proposal as big government. 
They were even willing to work with Republicans on their proposals to balance the annual federal budget. 
'If you don't get control of your budget, whether you're a nation, a country, a business, or a family, you lose control of your destiny. This is a great disservice to future generations who can't vote and make decisions. So I thought we needed to work toward balance,' then-Rep. Glen Browder (D-Ala.) told a biographer, transcripts of which were included in a detailed Medium post that is a retrospective on the coalition.
About two-thirds of the original group hailed from the South, and only two were women. 
Founded on Feb. 14, 1995, they chose the name after a painting of a blue dog with yellow eyes hanging in the offices of Rep. W.J. 'Billy' Tauzin, then a Democrat from Louisiana who hosted their early meetings. 
What that group did not realize was that it would be another 12 years before Democrats regained the majority. By that point, Tauzin, after switching parties later in 1995, had finished up a three-year run as Republican chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 
A few other original Blue Dogs also switched parties, and it was not until the 2006 midterm elections "" when Democrats successfully recruited a crop of candidates who appealed to those rural and exurban regions "" that both the coalition and the broader caucus swept back into power, allowing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to make history as the first woman ever to wield that chamber's gavel. 
By 2010, their numbers soared to 54, but the group was set up for another big fall, getting wiped out in those midterms and seeing their ranks dropped to a fraction of that record high. 
By 2015, just 15 House Democrats joined the coalition, a low mark that left the Blue Dogs without any real bark or bite. 
 But in 2016, following a shooting massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Murphy jumped into a House race in Florida. 
Rescued by the U.S. Navy as an infant Vietnamese boat refugee, Murphy, 41, defeated a 24-year incumbent and then easily won reelection in 2018, providing the portrait for the new era of Blue Dogs: younger, more diverse, socially liberal while still fiscally conservative. 
There are five women among the Blue Dogs, including four who won GOP districts in 2018. 
As he gathered current staff and Blue Dog alumni to celebrate last Thursday, Tanner told the secret of how he made the annual retreat a success: no policy or issue agenda items, just socializing.

Pessimism runs deep, poll shows 
President perceived to have emboldened racists

President Trump made a stark appeal to blackAmericansduring the 2016 election when he asked, 'What have you got to lose?' Three years later, black Americans have rendered their verdict on his presidency with a deeply pessimistic assessment of their place in the United States under a leader seen by an overwhelming majority as racist.
The findings come from a Washington Post-Ipsos poll of African Americans nationwide, which reveals fears about whether their children will have a fair shot to succeed and a belief that white Americans don't fully appreciate the discrimination that black people experience.
While personally optimistic about their own lives, black Americans today offer a bleaker view about their community as a whole. They also express determination to try to limit Trump to a single term in office.
More than 8 in 10 black Americans say they believe Trump is a racist and that he has made racism a bigger problem in the country. Nine in 10 disapprove of his job performance overall. 
The pessimism goes well beyond assessments of the president. A 65 percent majority of African Americans say it is a 'bad time' to be a black person in America. That view is widely shared by clear majorities of black adults across income, generational and political lines. By contrast, 77 percent of black Americans say it is a 'good time' to be a white person, with a wide majority saying white people don't understand the discrimination faced by black Americans.
Courtney Tate, a 40-year-old elementary school teacher in Irving, Tex., outside Dallas, said that since Trump was elected, he's been having more conversations with his co-workers "" discussions that are simultaneously enlightening and exhausting "" about racial issues he and his students face every day. 

 'As a black person, you've always seen all the racism, the microaggressions. But as white people, they don't understand this is how things are going for me,' said Tate, who said he is the only black male teacher in his school. 'They don't live those experiences. They don't live in those neighborhoods. They moved out. It's so easy to be white and oblivious in this country.'
Francine Cartwright, a 44-year-old mother of three from Moorestown, N.J., said the ascent of Trump has altered the way she thinks about the white people in her life. 
'If I'm in a room with white women, I know that 50 percent of them voted for Trump and they believe in his ideas,' said Cartwright, a university researcher. 'I look at them and think, 'How do you see me? What is my humanity to you?' '

The president routinely talks about how a steadily growing economy and historically low unemployment have resulted in more African Americans with jobs and the lowest jobless rate for black Americans recorded. Months ago, he said, 'What I've done for African Americans in two and a half years, no president has been able to do anything like it.' 
Those factors have not translated positively for the president. A 77-percent majority of black Americans say Trump deserves 'only some' or 'hardly any' credit for the 5.5-percent unemployment rate among black adults, compared with 20-percent who say Trump deserves significant credit. 
In follow-up interviews, many said former president Barack Obama deserves more credit for the improvement in the unemployment rate, which declined from a high of 16.8-percent in 2010 to 7.5-percent when he left office. 
Others said their personal financial situation is more a product of their own efforts than anything the president has done. 
'I don't think [Trump] has anything to do with unemployment among African Americans,' said Ethel Smith, a 72-year-old nanny who lives in Lithonia, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta. 'I've always been a working poor person. That's just who I am.'

Black Americans report little change in their personal financial situations in the past few years, with 19-percent saying it has been getting better and 26-percent saying it has been getting worse. Most, 54-percent, say their financial situation has stayed the same. 
A similar 56-percent majority of African Americans rate the national economy as 'not so good' or 'poor,' contrasting with other surveys that find most Americans overall rate the economy positively, although there are sharp political divides on this question. 
Beyond questions about the economy, African Americans see a range of concerns impacting the country overall as well as their own communities. 
Just 16-percent of black Americans believe that most black children born in the United States today have 'a good opportunity to achieve a comfortable standard of living.' A 75-percent majority think most white children have such an opportunity. 
More than 8 in 10 say they do not trust police in the United States to treat people of all races equally, and 7 in 10 distrust police in their own communities. 
Black Americans also widely sense that their experiences with discrimination are underappreciated by white Americans.Justabout 2 in 10 say that most white Americans understand the level of discrimination black Americans face in their lives. 
The starkly negative outlook appears to be a turnabout from previous points during both the Obama and George W. Bush presidencies, according to surveys that asked related questions. A 2011 Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation survey found 73-percent of black women said it was a 'good time' to be a black woman in America, while a similar survey in 2006 found 60-percent of black men saying it was a good time to be a black man. 
Yet the Post-Ipsos poll also finds that 65-percent of black Americans say they feel optimistic about their own lives most or all of the time. This positive personal outlook crosses age and political groups. While it peaks among those who are older and with higher incomes, roughly half of black Americanswith incomes under $35,000 annually say they feel optimistic about their lives. 
Dana Clark, a father of 11 in Ontario, Calif., said he tells all of his children that it's possible to succeed in America, but that they'll have to work harder than the white children they encounter. 
'I tell them we're going to set this plan up. Whatever you want to do, you're going to be able to do it,' he said. 'But it ain't going to be easy, especially if [you] want to make some money because you're going to be in a world where they're not going to expect you to be there. You can get what you want, but you've got to work harder, faster and stronger.' 
The survey, by The Post and Ipsos, a nonpartisan research firm, is one of the most extensive recent surveys focused on views of the country and Trump among black Americans, who are often represented by only small samples in customary national polls. It was conducted among 1,088 non-Hispanic black adults, including 900 registered voters, drawn from a large online survey panel recruited through random sampling of U.S. households. 
Few black voters responded positively to Trump's campaign appeal for their votes. Exit polls taken during the 2016 election showed just 8-percent of African Americans supported Trump and 89-percent backed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, although black turnout was significantly lower than in 2008 and 2012 for the election and reelection of Obama, the country's first black president. 
In the Post-Ipsos poll, roughly three-quarters of black adults say the things that Trump is doing as president are 'bad for African Americans,' while a similar majority 

saysObama's actions as president were good. 
Kenneth Davis, a truck driver who lives outside Detroit, said that when Trump was elected, co-workers who secretly harbored racist thoughts felt emboldened to publicly express them. 
'One gentleman is waving the Confederate flag on the back of his pickup truck,' said Davis, 48, who is a Marine Corps veteran. 'He was very brave to say, 'Trump's president, I'm going to get my window [painted].' '
Retired federal prison Warden Keith Battle said the political climate has exposed 'unresolved racial issues' and that Trump has emboldened white supremacists. Battle, who lives in Wake Forest, N.C., said white supremacists 'are not the majority of whites in America, but there is a significant amount still, I'd say 30-percent, and I think they're just leading the country down a path of, eventually, chaos. They're feeling jeopardized of losing their white privilege.'
Survey respondents were asked to say how Trump's presidency has affected them personally or African Americans in general. The responses illuminated the data in the poll. 
'Donald Trump has not done anything for the African American people,' said one person.
'He has created an atmosphere of division and overt racism and fear of immigrants unseen in many years,' said another.
A third said, 'He has taken hatred against people of color, in general, from the closet to the front porch.'
Others echoed that sentiment, saying that the president has emboldened those with racially prejudiced views and therefore set back race relations for years. 'I sense a separation between myself and some of my white associates,' one person wrote.
Trump's overall approval rating among black Americans stands at 7-percent, with 90-percent disapproving, including 75-percent who disapprove 'strongly.' 
Similarly large majorities of black men and women disapprove of Trump, as do black Americansacross different age, education and income levels. Trump receives somewhat higher marks among self-identifiedblack conservatives, with 25-percent approving of his performance, compared with 5-percent of moderates and 3-percent among liberals. 
Few black Americans appear open to supporting Trump's bid for reelection at this point. He receives between 4 and 5-percent support among black registered voters in head-to-head matchups against eight potential Democratic nominees. But the level of Democratic support depends on who is the party's nominee, peaking at 82-percent for former vice presidentJoe Biden and falling to 57-percent for former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg.
The Post-Ipsos survey was conducted Jan. 2-8 through Ipsos's KnowledgePanel, a large online survey panel recruited through random sampling of U.S. households. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points among the sample of 1,088 black adults overall and four points among the sample of 900 registered voters.

LEAVING HIM IN PLACE A DIRE RISK, THEY SAY
Impeachment managers assail president's character
House prosecutors finished their opening arguments in President Trump's impeachment trial on Friday, arguing that his conduct toward Ukraine reflected a dangerous reflex toward political expediency and a lack of character that will backfire on Republicans if they do not help remove him from office.
Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and his colleagues attempted to drive this argument home Friday to sway a handful of Republican senators whose position on gathering further evidence will determine the arc and scope of the trial. Yet there were few signs that any Republican was persuaded, leaving open the matter of possible witness testimony and further dampening Democrats' already meager hopes of a conviction in the GOP-controlled Senate. 
Schiff's pointed and increasingly personal approach was an attempt to go beyond the specifics of House Democrats' case to make the broader argument that Trump is an untrustworthy president who is likely to repeatedly flout the Constitution if allowed to stay in office.
'It goes to character,' Schiff said. 'You don't realize how important character is in the highest office in the land until you don't have it.' 
The Democrats' closing statements were their final appeal to senators before the next phase of the trial: an aggressive rebuttal from Trump's lawyers that will kick off Saturday and continue in earnest on Monday.
Speaking Friday on the Senate floor "" hours after new evidence emerged of Trump's campaign to oust the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine starting in 2018 "" Schiff predicted that Trump's future behavior would vindicate Democrats' claim that he abused his power, and he warned Republicans the president, now their ally, could ultimately turn on them.
'Do you think for a moment that any of you "" no matter what your relationship with this president, no matter how close you are to this president "" do you think for a moment that if he felt it was in his interest, he wouldn't ask you to be investigated?' he asked.
The remarks concluded the House managers' case for the first article of impeachment, which charges Trump with abuse of power over allegations he withheld military aid and an Oval Office meeting from Ukraine to pressure the country's leaders into announcing investigations into Trump's political rivals. These included former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, while his father was in office. The managers spent the rest of the day detailing their case for the second article of impeachment "" obstruction of Congress, following Trump's barring the executive branch from cooperating with the House investigation. 
The Senate will reconvene Saturday at 10 a.m. for several hours of what Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow described as 'coming attractions' from his side "" a preview of the pro-Trump case before the full-scale presentation begins Monday. The timetable is aimed at garnering peak television viewership "" a priority for Trump as he faces the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history "" though Sekulow also said that his side would not use its full 24-hour time allotment for defending Trump. 
'We're not going to try to run the clock out,' he said this week.
Democrats faced continued criticism from Republicans that their presentations were tedious and difficult to follow.
'I just thought yesterday was like, too much,' said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), calling the remarks repetitive and 'mind-numbing.' 'This needs to end. They've had an opportunity to make their case.'
While many Republicans echoed the view that the trial has been repetitive, every member of the Senate GOP caucus has voted against hearing from new witnesses or collecting new evidence.
It was clear when the trial resumed at 1 p.m. on Friday afternoon that Schiff heeded some of Republicans' complaints: rather than speaking for hours at a time, the managers presented in shorter spurts, rotating more often and punctuating their remarks with more video clips. 
After Trump's defense concludes, mostly likely on Monday, the trial will enter a question-and-answer phase that will last for up to 16 hours. This is expected to take place Tuesday and Wednesday, followed by a debate Thursday over whether to seek testimony from witnesses. Democrats are pushing for former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to appear, while most Republicans have shot down the idea of hearing from witnesses. But they have said that if Democrats secure the votes to subpoena any of their choices, the GOP will push for Joe or Hunter Biden to appear.
Democrats need four Republicans to join them in any attempt to secure new testimony or evidence and the senators being targeted have been careful to say that they have made no decision "" while giving no indication they are moving closer to supporting any subpoenas.
Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), one of the most closely watched Republican senators, said Friday that the House managers had 'presented us with a mountain of overwhelming evidence,' though it was unclear which way he was leaning on the question of hearing more. 
Alexander told reporters that he will make his decision on admitting witnesses and other new evidence only after the White House defense team makes its case.
'I think that question can only be answered then,' he said. 'We've been polite to the House managers, listened to them carefully, and now we're going to do the same with the president's lawyers. I think the House managers have done a good job of making their arguments. But that doesn't mean I will agree with them.'
Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) raised the prospect that a Senate trial could drag on for months if Trump administration witnesses are called, arguing that the issue of executive privilege would have to be litigated in the courts.
'This could tie up the Senate through the election and even beyond as the courts litigate these claims,' Cornyn said during an appearance on conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt's syndicated radio show. 'We'll wait and see, but right now, I'm not for extending this for months and months while claims of privilege and the like are litigated in the courts.'
The question of whether the Senate will seek more evidence was heightened Friday by a new Washington Post-ABC News poll revealing that a majority of American adults, 66 percent, support the Senate calling new witnesses to testify, as opposed to 27 percent who don't.
ABC News also reported Friday that it reviewed a recording of Trump at a private dinner telling associates that he wanted then-U. S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch gone, a reminder of the evidence yet to be uncovered about Trump's actions. 
'Get rid of her! Get her out tomorrow. I don't care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. Okay? Do it,' Trump is heard saying, according to ABC News.
Schiff challenged the Senate to call the administration's bluff on whether witnesses would be limited from testifying by executive privilege and let Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is presiding over the trial, make those calls.
Calling executive privilege 'the last refuge of the president's team to conceal the evidence from the American people,' Schiff argued that Roberts should 'decide issues of evidence and privilege' whenever witnesses or the president claim it, but that the assumption Trump will try to silence certain witnesses by claiming executive privilege should not keep the Senate from calling them to testify.
'The Senate will always have the opportunity to overrule the justice,' Schiff said to reporters, adding that 'you cannot use executive privilege to hide wrongdoing or criminality or impeachable misconduct, and that is exactly the purpose for which they seek to use-it.' 
After Roberts scolded both sides for overheated rhetoric late Tuesday night, Democrats took pains to tone down their accusations against Trump and his supporters in the Senate. 
Yet Schiff also sharpened his case on Friday, arguing that Republicans trust Trump at their own peril. 
He invoked the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) in arguing about the strategic importance of Ukraine as a U.S. ally and quoted him as saying, 'We are all Ukrainians.'
And he made a lengthy case that Trump's skepticism about the conclusions of U.S. intelligence services "" particularly about Russian interference in the 2016 election "" represents a 'coup' for Russia. 
'Has there ever been such a coup? I would submit to you that in the entire length of the Cold War, the Soviet Union had no such success. No such success,' Schiff said. 'I hope it was worth it. I hope it was worth it for the president. Because it certainly wasn't worth it for the United States.'
Trump's defenders are focused on Biden's push to oust former Ukraine prosecutor-general Viktor Shokin, who was overseeing a probe of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma and its owner at the same time that Biden's son was serving as a member of the company's board. 
Biden's actions were in line with official U.S. and European policy at the time "" a consensus that Shokin was involved in corrupt schemes and needed to be removed. 
Democrats detailed these facts on Thursday with the awareness that Trump's legal team was likely to focus on them during their defense of the president.
The president's aides and allies continued to portray the trial as a waste of time and one that is not capturing the public's attention. 
'As you've seen, the ratings keep going down every day in terms of viewers,' White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said on Fox News. 'I think that next week, we need to get this over with so we can get on with the business of the country.'Schiff concluded his remarks Friday night with a different message as he urged senators to support hearing more evidence.
'I ask you. I implore you: Give America a fair trial,' he told senators. 'Give America a fair trial. She's worth it.'

His electability is assailed as he nears Biden in polls and rises in Iowa and N.H.

WEST DES MOINES "" Sen. Bernie Sanders faced a sudden barrage of attacks from his rivals Sunday amid signs that he was surging in the critical early-voting states of Iowa and New Hampshire and closing the gap nationally with the race's longtime polling leader, Joe Biden. 
Sanders's rise, with only days left before the Feb. 3 caucuses here, prompted urgent warnings from competing campaigns that the party is in jeopardy of nominating a self-identified democratic socialist whose views would turn off the broad swath of voters required to defeat President Trump in the November general election.
'Bernie Sanders could be the nominee,' the campaign of Pete Buttigieg declared in an ominous-sounding fundraising message to supporters Saturday. A pointed text message followed on Sunday: 'We risk nominating a candidate who cannot beat Donald Trump in November. And that's a risk we can't take.'
The focus on Sanders represents a shift from much of the past year in which the top candidates largely ignored the senator from Vermont, wagering that there was little benefit in fighting with a candidate with a loyal following but who might not be able to build on it. The more traditional campaigns "" mainly those of Biden, the former vice president, and Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind. "" focused more on trying to siphon support from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who was ascendant in the summer and early fall but has dropped in recent months.
The dynamic underscores the remarkable nature of Sanders's candidacy, which seemed doomed as recently as October after the 78-year-old suffered a heart attack. Since then, Sanders has become re-energized, with new endorsements and surveys that suggest he has the chance to expand his base of support. 
Several new public polls have shown Sanders on the rise, particularly in Iowa and New Hampshire, where he appears to have taken the lead. A national Washington Post-ABC News poll published over the weekend showed Biden and Sanders in the clear top spots nationally "" with Biden at 32 percent and Sanders at 23 percent among Democratic-leaning registered voters.
 Much of the intensifying debate over Sanders over the weekend centered on his ability "" or lack thereof "" to beat Trump. The discussion once again laid bare the argument that has vexed a Democratic Party desperate to beat the president, but unsure whether the best path to victory means energizing liberal voters eager for a 'political revolution,' as Sanders promises, or nominating a more centrist candidate who can piece together a left-center coalition.
The polling on that question is not conclusive. A Post average of national surveys dating back to December shows that Biden leads Trump 48 percent to 43-percent, while Sanders's edge is a slightly narrower 47-percent to 44 percent for Trump.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who has presented herself as a moderate best able to defeat Trump, seized a chance to make the electability argument on national television Sunday "" telling ABC News that Sanders's Medicare-for-all plan puts him out of step with voters in many more moderate or conservative parts of the country that might be open to voting Democratic in November.
'When you look at what just happened in the last election, as well as those governor races in Kentucky and Louisiana, look what happened,' Klobuchar told ABC News. 'Those were candidates where Democrats won in states that were red, states that were purple, like Michigan, like Kansas, congressional races all over the country that fit the district, that fit that the state, that did not suggest blowing up our current health system and kicking 149-million Americans off their current health insurance in four years.'
A more cutting critique came Sunday from another candidate, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who seemed to mock Sanders's political ideology during a South Florida speech to Jewish voters.
'I know I'm not the only Jewish candidate running for president. But I am the only one who doesn't want to turn America into a kibbutz,' he said, a reference to the socialism shared by Sanders and the Israeli collective farm where Sanders worked decades ago. 
Biden, who has long argued that Democrats need to choose a nominee who can help Democrats win back swing-state voters, took subtle steps that seemed designed to create contrasts with Sanders. 
After Sanders was criticized for promoting the endorsement of podcast host Joe Rogan, who-has made disrespectful remarks about the transgender community, Biden tweeted Saturday: 'Transgender equality is the civil rights issue of our time. There is no room for compromise when it comes to basic human rights.'
Biden, meanwhile, continued to roll out endorsements from elected Democrats in the early states, underscoring his appeal in the middle of the party.
Rep. Cindy Axne (D-Iowa), who offered her high-profile endorsement to Biden on Saturday, said a 'pragmatic' platform is key to fostering victories like hers in down-ballot races moving forward.
'I can tell you from flipping a seat here a year ago, you do not win seats in purple districts like ours without a top of a ticket that-actually supports the values-the people in this country want to see as far as leadership,'-Axne said in an interview Sunday. 
Sanders and his campaign have grown more explicit in their arguments for why they believe he would be the strongest opponent for Trump.
The senator, after all, leads what has effectively become a political movement "" one that would surely mobilize for Sanders if he were the nominee but-that remains an open question when it comes to turning out for a more establishment-oriented candidate. Many stayed home in 2016 rather than vote for Hillary Clinton, who had defeated Sanders in a bitter primary that year.
'In terms of electability, which is a fair question, we need a campaign which has energy, which has excitement, which has a strong grass-roots movement, which is able to raise money from working families to campaign and not just billionaires and Wall Street executives,' Sanders said Saturday at a rally in Ames, Iowa, that drew some 1,400 people, including 400 in an overflow room set up in an adjacent gymnasium.
The argument is being echoed by one of Sanders's most prominent supporters, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a star on the political left, who argued during appearances here that many voters in the heartland would be drawn to Sanders's message. 
'I almost get insulted on behalf of people' when they say what will or won't win the Midwest, Ocasio-Cortez said Saturday in Marshalltown, Iowa. She argued that because of the economic struggles that many people are experiencing, 'radical change is exactly what we need now.'
On Sunday, Ocasio-Cortez pushed back against critics who say Sanders would alienate some voters. 
'I don't think he's divisive,' she said. 'I think he distinguishes himself. I think he's very clear about who he is.'
Another Sanders backer, liberal filmmaker Michael Moore, brought along a printed list of campaign events that Sanders did for Clinton after losing to her in 2016, clearly designed to allay lingering anger that Sanders didn't do more to press his supporters to turn out. 'He went and held on his own 42-rallies to get out the vote for Hillary,' Moore said. 
Sanders has sought to turn the sudden hostility he is facing into a battle cry that he hopes will energize his base to turn out in large numbers on caucus night.
'The big-money interests are getting very nervous,' he said, prompting cheers. 'They're looking at recent polls in New Hampshire and in Iowa, and they're saying, 'Oh, my God, Sanders can win.' '

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg spent Super Tuesday with all the trappings of a winning campaign - packed field offices from Miami to Orlando, a ""victory"" party with a smoke machine and disc jockey, and supporters who introduced him repeatedly as ""the next president of the United States."" 
The candidate wanted history to record that he was not finished, even as early results Tuesday showed his support collapsing and former vice president Joe Biden moving to consolidate the same electorate that Bloomberg had spent about $500 million of his own money to win. 
After it was apparent that his dream of taking Super Tuesday by storm would never come to pass, Bloomberg refused to show disappointment. ""Here's what is clear: No matter how many delegates we win tonight, we have done something no one thought was possible,"" he told a crowd of about 1,000 after Biden had won Alabama, North Carolina and Virginia. ""In just three months, we've gone from 1 percent in the polls to being a contender for the Democratic nomination for president.""
That might have been an overstatement, given Bloomberg's poor performance in many Super Tuesday states. Bloomberg set out to test whether a candidate can overwhelm his rivals with limited campaigning and unlimited spending. On the first day he actually appeared on a ballot, the answer was clearly no, and in coming days he will probably face growing pressure to step aside.
It's hard to overstate the importance the Bloomberg campaign had placed on Super Tuesday. His campaign's fundamental theory was that he could ignore the first four contests and instead blanket the March 3 states with enough ads to leave his rivals behind. Instead, it was Biden who found himself telling a cheering crowd, ""They don't call it Super Tuesday for nothing.""

Two weeks ago, Bloomberg's own advisers wrote a memo saying the Democratic candidates not named Bernie Sanders had to consolidate forces to preserve any path to the nomination. But even before voters rendered their verdict Tuesday, Biden had done that, winning endorsements from Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn) and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg. 
Bloomberg had begun his surprise campaign for president on a platform of altruism. His wealth, he promised, would be used to build the Democratic Party up and down the ballot, no matter who the nominee was, with the singular goal of defeating Donald Trump and making progress on issues he cared about. He will soon have to answer to how staying in the race furthers that goal.
He made clear Tuesday night that his aim was still defeating Trump, and that his campaign might still have a dual purpose, boosting his own candidacy and promoting the Democratic cause generally. 
""While my fellow candidates spent a whole year focusing on the first four states, I was out campaigning against Donald Trump in the states where the election will actually be decided like Wisconsin and Michigan and Pennsylvania and Ohio and North Carolina, and of course, Florida,"" he said. 
Bloomberg's spending accounted for the vast majority of the money shelled out by the candidates in Super Tuesday states - about $18 million in Virginia, $8 million in Alabama and $17 million in North Carolina - yet he handily lost all three to Biden on Tuesday. Polling in other prizes, like California and Colorado, was not promising for him either. 
It was a rough letdown for a long-shot presidential campaign that had tried to rewrite the rules of how the White House is won and how much money it could cost. He tried to bypass nearly a year of campaigning in the early primary states, and his wealth allowed him to skip over the onerous process of fundraising. 
Among the other things, Bloomberg's money had purchased a sophisticated data and polling operation that had a firm handle on the state of the country. But like the monitors in the election-night ballroom Tuesday, which switched from cable news to campaign videos before Biden notched his first win in Virginia, the campaign did want to share what it knew.
Only as the polls closed did campaign manager Kevin Sheekey begin to back away from the Bloomberg camp's unyielding insistence that he would fight on until the Democratic convention in Milwaukee. 
""You make an assessment in any campaign like this after any time there is a vote,"" Sheekey said. ""As of right now we are committing to stay in, but we will see what happens tonight."" 
Another campaign aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the campaign is regularly reevaluated, and that process would continue Wednesday. Bloomberg was expected to return to New York on Wednesday.
""Today is a marker,"" the aide said, referring to the Super Tuesday vote.
 From the start of the campaign, Biden had loomed large in Bloomberg's thinking. The former vice president's seeming hold on the nomination had been a major reason Bloomberg initially decided not to run in early 2019. Months later, it was Biden's faltering performance that led Bloomberg to get into the race after all. 
For Bloomberg, the only early result to cheer Tuesday night came from the announcement that Bloomberg had won the territory of American Samoa, taking four of its six delegates to the convention. 
Bloomberg has vowed that the campaign he built will go on even if the candidate himself pulls out, with the goal of boosting whoever the Democratic nominee is. The data program he is assembling, called Hawkfish, would continue its work, aides say, and hundreds of campaign staffers in swing states would continue to work through November. 
The most substantial legacy of Bloomberg's campaign is likely to be his massive advertising apparatus. The political world has never seen anything like the flood of money unleashed by the multibillionaire, and he has suggested that will continue.
Under campaign finance law, which has rarely focused on self-funded candidates, Bloomberg's campaign can pivot at any moment to run ads in support of Biden or another candidate. He has reserved nearly $7 million in advertising over the next two days, which can be repurposed to whatever message he chooses.
Sanders's advisers have promised to renounce any support from Bloomberg in a general election, given the candidate's distaste for billionaires, but Biden's team has not been so discouraging. The ties between the two camps run deep. Sheekey, an early donor to Biden's 2020 campaign, was considered as a potential chief of staff for Biden when he served as vice president, according to people familiar with the discussions.
As Tuesday approached, Bloomberg had begun to appear more comfortable in the role he had chosen for himself. After a disastrous performance in his first debate on Feb. 19, he improved his performance in his second debate, completed two town halls on Fox News and CNN without incident and found the beginnings of some comfort speaking without a script on the campaign trail.
He also was getting better at looking beyond hard data. On Tuesday, Bloomberg hardly mentioned the 14 states where voting was taking place but took every chance he could to talk about the Florida primary in two weeks.
""I have no intention of dropping out,"" he said testily in the Little Havana neighborhood of Miami when a reporter challenged him on his declining fortunes. ""I'm in it to win it.""
But the kinks that had been evident from the start of the campaign in late November remained. 
""I've only been doing this 10 weeks,"" he told some diners in Miami as he made his way around El Pub restaurant, even though it had been 14 weeks at that point. He was dressed in khakis and tasseled loafers, no suit jacket, which he called a ""man of the people"" look.
""I've never run for president before,"" he joked with the diners. ""I had nothing else to do.""

President Trump was acquitted Wednesday by the Republican-controlled Senate of charges that he abused the powers of his office and obstructed Congress as it probed his attempts to pressure Ukraine into political investigations "" capping a tumultuous, three-week impeachment trial that leaves his fate in the hands of voters in November.
Democrats fell far short of the two-thirds majority required to remove Trump from office, as senators voted 52 to 48 to acquit him on the abuse-of-power allegation and 53 to 47 to clear him of obstruction. 
The outcome represented a political triumph for the White House and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who successfully held together nearly the entire GOP caucus in blocking witnesses or additional evidence from the proceedings. Just one Republican, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, voted to convict the president of abuse of power.
Shortly after the twin acquittal votes, Trump tweeted that he will deliver a statement Thursday on 'our Country's VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax!' He also tweeted a clip featuring a mock magazine cover with signs showing him staying in office far beyond the two terms permitted under the Constitution. And Brad Parscale, Trump's 2020 campaign manager, proclaimed that he had been 'totally vindicated.' 
'Throughout this wholly corrupt process, President Trump successfully advanced the interests of the United States and remained focused on the issues that matter to Americans,' White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said. 'He spent his time achieving real victories for the people of this country, and the Democrats "" once again "" have nothing to show for their fraudulent schemes.'
The third impeachment trial of a president in U.S. history concluded one of the most bitter episodes in recent memory in Washington "" marked by partisan fighting over what constitutes a fair trial, furious debates over the propriety of Trump's dealings with Ukraine and outsized pressure on a small core of Republican senators who held considerable sway in whether the trial would subpoena key witnesses from the Trump administration who had defied calls to appear before the House during its investigation.
But the vote by Romney, the party's 2012 presidential nominee, robbed the president of the unified GOP opposition against impeachment that he had enjoyed and repeatedly boasted of since the inquiry began in September. Romney is the first senator in history to vote to remove a president of his or her own party.
Romney called Trump's demand to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky that he investigate former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter a 'flagrant assault on our electoral rights, our national security and our fundamental values.' In a July 25 phone call with Zelensky that he has repeatedly described as 'perfect,' Trump pressed Zelensky to investigate not only the Bidens but a discredited theory that it was Ukraine rather than Russia that attempted to interfere in the 2016 election. 
'There's no question in my mind that were their names not Biden, the president would never have done what he did,' Romney said in an eight-minute speech delivered in a Senate chamber that was nearly void of his colleagues. Later, he added: 'Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine.' 
Romney was the sole senator who not only defected from his own party but split his vote, choosing to acquit Trump of obstructing Congress. 
Democrats accused Republicans of emboldening an unchecked president who sought foreign influence in U.S. campaigns for his personal benefit. Republicans portrayed Democrats as a party still embittered by its loss in the 2016 presidential elections that has now decided to weaponize the constitutional impeachment process. 
'This sham process is the low point in the Senate for me,' said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), once a Trump foe who has transformed into one of the president's closest allies. 'If you think you've done the country a good service by legitimizing this impeachment process, what you have done is unleashed the partisan forces of hell.' 

The question of whether Trump should stay in office now moves from the Senate chamber to the campaign trail. Just one day prior, Trump stayed away from any mention of impeachment in Tuesday's State of the Union address, although he is almost certain to tout his acquittal at rallies and in other venues, such as Thursday's planned statement, as he campaigns for a second term.
The issue is also likely to surface in competitive Senate races, mostly as Democrats target GOP senators for aligning themselves with Trump and his conduct. But in a victory lap news conference after the votes, McConnell said the Democrats' decision to proceed with impeachment was a 'colossal political mistake.'
The majority leader noted that Trump is enjoying some of his strongest approval ratings now and added that 'as a poll watcher who's looking at polls in certain Senate races, every one of our people in tough races . . . is in better shape today than they were before the impeachment trial started.' 
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) insisted that Democrats were not motivated by politics and said 'Democrats walked out of the Senate chamber with their heads held high.'
Ripples from impeachment also may continue in the House, with Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and one of the impeachment managers, saying Wednesday that Democrats will probably subpoena former national security adviser John Bolton in the near future.
'When you have a lawless president, you have to bring that to the fore, you have to spotlight that,' Nadler told reporters. Bolton has said he would appear before the Senate if subpoenaed but has been silent on whether he would appear before the House.
Despite weeks of protests from Democrats, the Senate last week voted not to hear from additional witnesses, including Bolton, during the trial. An unpublished manuscript from the ex-White House official's forthcoming book has alleged that Trump directly tied the withholding of nearly $400 million in military assistance to Ukraine to the political investigations the president had demanded. 
The tone inside the chamber during the historic vote was solemn, as each senator took turns standing up at his or her desk and proclaiming 'guilty' or 'not guilty' to each article of impeachment. The public galleries were the most crowded they have been throughout the trial, as the backbenches on the chamber floor, reserved for members of the House who wanted to attend the trial, filled in with congressmen from both parties.
Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the lead prosecutor for House managers, sat in the first chair of their table, turned at a three-quarters position so he could swivel his head around the chamber with every senator's name called out, glancing around the room. When each of the two roll calls ended, he pivoted around to stare at the clerks and parliamentarians as they double checked the votes. 
Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. read the results after each vote, proclaiming Trump not guilty of both charges. Shortly after, McConnell thanked Roberts for presiding over the proceedings with a 'clear head, steady hand and the forbearance that this rare occasion demands.' 
Trump was impeached by the House on Dec. 18, as nearly all Democrats there proclaimed that he had abused his powers and then obstructed Congress's attempts to investigate him. At the heart the case against Trump presented by the impeachment managers was the allegation that he withheld military aid and a coveted White House meeting to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. The younger Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, while his father was vice president. 
Throughout the acrimonious Senate trial, the only real point of suspense "" aside from where a handful of senators would land on the conviction vote "" was whether a majority of senators in the narrowly divided chamber would decide to call more witnesses, particularly after the Bolton revelations. 
Democrats cited polling that showed the public broadly favored summoning witnesses to Trump's impeachment trial, and argued it was only fair to hear from Trump administration officials whom the White House had summarily blocked from testifying before the House, some even under a subpoena. But most Senate Republicans, many of whom took no public issue with the president's conduct, said it was not their responsibility to secure witnesses and documents, particularly when House Democrats didn't exhaust their options to obtain them, such as going to court. 
Unlike in the House, in which a handful of Democratic lawmakers split from their party to oppose either article of impeachment, Senate Democrats stayed united in their stance that Trump deserved to be removed from office for his conduct. 
Sen. Doug Jones (Ala.), who faces the toughest reelection bid for an incumbent Democrat this fall, chose to convict on both impeachment articles, saying he was 'deeply troubled' by the White House legal team's case arguing for 'virtually unchecked presidential power.' Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (Ariz.), a freshman senator who has bucked her party on occasion, also voted guilty on both. 
So did Sen. Joe Manchin III (W.Va.), one of the few Democratic lawmakers who has a relationship with Trump and was seen as perhaps the White House's best chance at a bipartisan acquittal. Manchin, who in recent days began floating a censure resolution that gained little traction in either party, announced his decision shortly before senators gathered to vote at 4 p.m., and inside the chamber, Sinema approached him and the two whispered to one another and hugged.
'Despite the false claim that a president can do no wrong, the president is not entitled to act with blatant disregard for an equal branch of government or use the superpower status of the United States to condition our support of democracy and our allies on any political favor,' Manchin said. 
As for the lone party defector, the GOP backlash against Romney began to mount immediately, with the president's son, Donald Trump, Jr., calling on Senate Republicans to expel him from the conference. Romney's own colleagues were gentler in their disagreement, with Republican leaders saying they did not try to persuade him one way or another on the conviction vote. 
'He's made it very clear from the beginning, even on the witness vote, that he was going to go his own way,' said Senate Majority Whip John Thune (R-S.D.). 'This is one of those historical votes where everybody has to do what they think is the right thing.' 
The impeachment trial also became entwined with the 2020 Democratic presidential campaign, forcing the four senators still in the race "" Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Michael F. Bennet (Colo.) "" off the trail just weeks before the first nominating contests began Monday in Iowa.
At a campaign stop Wednesday morning in Derry, N.H., before he zipped back down to Washington, Sanders called Trump a 'pathological liar' who 'probably doesn't know the difference between truth and lies.'

Former vice president Joe Biden swept to decisive wins in Florida, Illinois and Arizona on Tuesday, extending his run of victories on a primary election day in which the growing national response to the coronavirus pandemic complicated voting as it threatened to disrupt future contests. 

The emphatic wins raised further questions about the viability of the campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). It set Biden, who began the day leading the contest by more than 100 delegates, on a clear course to a first-ballot victory at the Democratic National Convention in July barring a seismic shift in the race's dynamics.
This was the third consecutive week of voting in which Biden dramatically outperformed Sanders, including 16 of the past 21 contests before Tuesday's. 
 ""Our campaign has had a very good night,"" said Biden, speaking briefly Tuesday evening on a live stream from his home in Wilmington, Del. ""We moved closer to securing the Democratic Party's nomination for president. And we're doing it by building a broad coalition,"" he said, pointing to support from minorities and suburban women.
 Biden offered a message aimed at unifying the party, much as he did after his victories last week, telling Sanders's supporters that he shares many of the senator's priorities.
 ""I hear you. I know what is at stake. I know what we have to do,"" Biden said. 
In the general election swing state of Florida, the biggest prize of the night, with 219 pledged delegates, Biden was winning more than twice as many voters as Sanders after the vast majority of votes had been counted. 
He won every county in the state, claiming voters at least 45 years old by 6 to 1, according to a statewide voter poll by Edison Media Research. Sanders won voters younger than 45 by just over 10 percentage points, far too little to overcome Biden's lead with older voters. 
In Illinois, with 155 delegates at stake, over 6 in 10 voters said they trusted Biden more than Sanders to handle a major crisis, and nearly 7 in 10 said Biden has the better chance of defeating President Trump in November.
Biden's speech to the nation provided a striking coda to a complicated primary day. As he moved ever closer to becoming the Democratic nominee, he stood alone in front of a camera without a cheering crowd - symbolizing the example Americans have been asked to follow by isolating themselves from others in the midst of the novel-coronavirus outbreak.
""Tackling this pandemic is a national emergency that is akin to fighting a war,"" Biden said. ""This is the moment for each of us to see and believe the best in every one of us."" 
Voters braved historic conditions in the three states that cast ballots a day after Trump requested that Americans stop congregating in groups of more than 10 people to reduce transmission of the virus, which has sequestered millions in their homes, closed businesses across the country and hammered the financial markets. 
Reports of polling place disruptions - with unopened precincts, a dearth of cleaning supplies and long lines in some places - emerged across the country. Both candidates urged voters to take extra precautions. 
The Sanders campaign told supporters that ""going to the polls amid the coronavirus outbreak is a personal decision and we respect whichever choice voters make."" Biden told voters that they should vote by mail or from curbside if possible. 
""If you vote in person, please wash your hands, don't touch your face, and stay 6' from others in line,"" Biden tweeted. 
Sanders made no mention of the elections Tuesday night when he addressed the nation about his proposed responses to the coronavirus pandemic. Shortly before Florida closed the last of its polling places, Sanders offered a long list of responses to the viral outbreak that would cost about $2 trillion, he said, including a monthly $2,000 check for every American household for the duration of the crisis.
Signaling an intent to stay involved in the political conversation, Sanders directed people to his campaign website and concluded by saying, ""I look forward to continuing to communicate with you to tell you where we are coming from, what our ideas are and look forward to hearing from you.""
Sanders was not expected to speak publicly again Tuesday night, according to a campaign official. 
Sanders and his wife, Jane, spent the day in Washington, where the Senate is working on relief packages to respond to the virus, according to a campaign official. Biden met with advisers and public health experts at his Delaware home before his televised address. 

Voting in Ohio, the fourth state that was to cast ballots Tuesday, was delayed at the last minute by Gov. Mike DeWine (R) as a result of the growing viral infection, despite a court ruling that voting should take place.
DeWine said Monday night that he wanted to postpone in-person voting until June 2 and extend absentee balloting into the intervening weeks.
 Georgia, Louisiana, Maryland and Kentucky also have rescheduled their contests for later in the year. Under Democratic Party rules, states have until June 9 to complete their delegate selection primaries or caucuses, and party leaders have the authority to seek rule changes to accommodate states that fail to meet the deadlines. 
Democratic Party Chair Tom Perez urged states to adopt vote-by-mail, no-excuse absentee voting and to expand polling place hours to prevent more delays in the primary calendar.
""As our country deals with the uncertainty of covid-19, it is critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters,"" Perez said in a statement Tuesday afternoon.
A key question for Tuesday was to what extent voters would stay home to avoid exposure to the virus. So far this year, turnout has increased by about 30 percent over 2016 levels. 
Initial estimates by Edison on Tuesday night showed turnout in Florida up about 8 percent from four years ago, bolstered by a substantial early vote. In Illinois, turnout appeared lower than in 2016.
Before polls closed, the Biden campaign expressed confidence that the results would all but seal the nomination for their candidate.
""It would take a drastic, historically-incomparable swing for Sen. Sanders to win more delegates than Biden today or to close the delegate differential,"" wrote Kate Bedingfield, Biden's deputy campaign manager in a memo issued Tuesday afternoon. 
Biden's team laid out a case that the primary results would be valid, rebutting questions raised by Sanders's allies that the potential for a depressed turnout because of the virus might cast doubt on the validity of the outcome. 
""The American people are resilient and strong,"" Bedingfield wrote. ""We have maintained our democracy through war and peace, economic downturn and prosperity, and in previous moments of public health crisis. We held elections during the Civil War, the 1918 flu pandemic, and World War II.""
Both campaigns have dramatically shifted their strategies as a result of the pandemic, forgoing travel and rallies for the past week in favor of virtual town halls for Biden and a streaming ""fireside chat"" and a ""digital rally"" for Sanders. 
The Sanders campaign said Tuesday that its programming had been viewed more than 5 million times. ""Our digital organizing infrastructure is unmatched, and in this moment of fear and uncertainty, we are proud to be able to speak directly to Americans,"" Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in a statement. 
Biden's campaign also plans to hold virtual high-dollar fundraisers in which the candidate will interact online with donors.
Biden's team is increasingly focusing on the assumption he will win the nomination. Biden himself announced at a Sunday night debate that he would pick a woman to be his vice president. The campaign plans soon to detail who will be in charge of vetting potential running mates. 
Sanders's defeats Tuesday were a reprise of four years ago, when Sanders lost the primaries in Arizona, Florida and Illinois to Hillary Clinton. She crushed him in Florida, winning by more than 30 percentage points, and bested him by nearly 20 percentage points in Arizona. The margin was tightest in Illinois, where the two candidates were within two percentage points.
In this primary, after a string of devastating losses, Sanders started offering blunt public appraisals of his campaign's efforts, admitting that he has failed to convince Democrats he is more electable than Biden but arguing that he has won the battle of ideas and the support of young people.
In the starkest terms yet, he warned Democrats on Monday night not to overlook the youth vote. ""It really does stun me to what degree the Democratic establishment continues to ignore the needs and the ideas of younger people,"" Sanders said during his digital rally. 
But the results Tuesday made clear those strategic recalibrations had not solved his problems. 
Even close confidants said they couldn't predict what Sanders ultimately would decide about his candidacy. He and his wife are expected to reach a decision together, people in frequent contact with them said. 
Some allies have privately speculated that the coronavirus crisis might make it more likely for Sanders to stay in the race. As a longtime advocate of creating a Medicare-for-all system in which the government is the sole provider of health insurance, Sanders has said the pandemic shows precisely why universal health care needs to be enacted swiftly. 
RoseAnn DeMoro, a close Sanders friend and a former head of an influential nurses union, said Monday that the volatility across the country is justification for the senator from Vermont to stick it out.
""Anything can happen,"" she said in an interview Monday. DeMoro expressed disdain for Biden and his supporters, accusing some of being ""out of touch"" and taking ""cheap shots.""
Larry Cohen, who heads a pro-Sanders nonprofit, saw a different benefit to staying in for the long haul: a slow and steady accrual of delegates to the national convention. In Cohen's view, this will give the Sanders movement leverage against the Biden forces when it comes to forming key party panels and shaping the party's approach to health care and climate change. 
""It's a big difference between one-third of the Florida delegates versus zero,"" Cohen said.

The precinct caucuses in Iowa could have provided a coming-out moment for the Democratic Party and its field of presidential candidates. Instead, the caucuses resulted in a night of chaos and confusion and, for one more day at least, provided an unexpected gift to President Trump.
Collectively, Democrats were floundering and at least partially in the dark as the candidates left Iowa and headed to New Hampshire for events ahead of next week's primary. 
With no official results released until late afternoon Tuesday, the campaign descended into competing claims about who did well and who did not as the candidates sought to game the system to their advantage. When the Iowa Democratic Party released partial results, the numbers proved again that volatility lies ahead.
The situation was ready-made for a president who thrives on chaos, who likes nothing more than to seize on the weaknesses of his opponents. Trump's political style is to divide and conquer, which is how he won the presidency. He is now hoping to divide the Democrats as a way to disrupt the selection of his November rival, weaken his eventual challenger and raise broader doubts about the Democrats' readiness to govern.
For Trump, the breakdown in Iowa allowed the spotlight to turn back to him without any of the Democrats being able to fully celebrate victory and gain the kind of attention that other winners in Iowa have enjoyed. 
The caucuses were supposed to be the one moment for Democrats to seize the headlines in a week when much focus will be on the president, a week that includes Tuesday's State of the Union address and Wednesday's vote in the Senate that will end the impeachment process with an expected acquittal on both articles approved by the House.
The president, feeling both exonerated and emboldened, will use the two events as moments of triumph and as a return to business as usual. Whatever history says about the impeachment of this president, and however the coming campaign year treats him, the months since the impeachment proceedings began certainly have been beneficial to him politically.

Support for his removal from office has ticked down slightly from where it was when the House began its inquiry. Additionally, Gallup reported Tuesday that the president's job approval rating has risen to 49-percent, the highest of his presidency. Gallup's numbers reflect not only a rise in his approval among Republicans, to 94-percent, but also among independents, where his current 42 percent is five points higher than in early January and marks another high among those Americans.
Meanwhile, the Democratic candidates will be heading toward a debate Friday night in New Hampshire that could be as consequential as any of their encounters during the campaign. Whatever the final results from Iowa show, it was apparent from partial numbers that Democratic voters in Iowa remained fractured over their choice of a nominee, despite a year of campaigning.
Iowa sometimes produces genuine clarity through its caucus process, but this year something else happened. Candidates swarmed the state and found big crowds of voters there to see and hear them "" a sign of the energy that helped Democrats take control of the House in the 2018 midterms and determination to defeat the president in the general election.
With two dozen Democrats declaring their candidacies during 2019, Iowa seemed poised to become a more important testing ground than ever. But as the year moved from spring to summer and then to fall, another reality set in. No candidate was able to break away from the others. Iowa voters liked many of the candidates but seemed to love no one in particular.
On caucus night, turnout fell far short of the predictions of late last year, when many strategists were suggesting the number of participants would break the 2008 record of nearly 240,000. Whether the smaller turnout was a result of indecision or lessening enthusiasm about their field of candidates is something the Democrats will have to answer if they hope to win in November.

Based on partial data released Tuesday, which accounted for 62-percent of the nearly 1,700 precincts, it appeared possible that the eventual winner will have the lowest percentages of 'state delegate equivalents,' as Iowa Democrats calculate results, of any previous winner. The results also could have one candidate with more state delegate equivalents, and therefore the official winner, and another with more total votes among those who showed up at the precincts, who will claim a moral victory.

The partial results showed former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg leading in the battle for state delegate equivalents, a remarkable standing for a 38-year-old gay ex-mayor from a not-large city. Running second in SDEs was Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), though in these partial results he had more raw votes when participants stated their initial preferences and when they realigned. Buttigieg was benefiting from the complex formula for calculating SDEs.
Running third in the partial results was Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), with former vice president Joe Biden in fourth and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) not far behind him in fifth.
The partial results "" unless they were to change dramatically, and no one was predicting they would "" represent a particularly harsh blow to Biden, who began the campaign as the nominal front-runner, owing to his service as President Barack Obama's vice president and his four decades of experience in the Senate.
Overnight Monday, his campaign was raising the most pointed questions about the quality of the state party's data, a sign that the candidate and his advisers preferred to look to the next series of contests with Iowa's results permanently in question.




Electability has been Biden's principal argument in claiming to be at least a nominal front-runner. But only about a quarter of Iowa Democrats who said electability was most important backed him Monday. 
Buttigieg spoke to supporters late Monday night and delivered a speech as if he had been declared the winner. As a tactical maneuver, it was almost Trumpian. More than any of the candidates, he needed a strong finish "" in the top three at least and ahead of Biden at a minimum. He could end up with far more than that.
Warren, who faced difficult months at the end of last year, looked rejuvenated during the final weekend of the Iowa campaign and sounded so Tuesday when she started campaigning in New Hampshire, describing a race among three candidates: herself, Buttigieg and Sanders.
One other candidate could be a beneficiary of how everything played out in Iowa, and especially Biden's performance. Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg is skipping the first four states but is spending record amounts of money in the Super Tuesday states and beyond. His hopes depend on a weakened Biden and worries among many Democratic voters about the other alternatives. Campaign officials announced Tuesday that he will double his advertising in key states.
Democrats can survive Monday night's messy counting in Iowa. The calendar moves swiftly from here, and the absence of clarity in Iowa will give way to results of upcoming primaries and caucuses.
Whether those contests produce an effective nominee by the end of March and one who can rally the Democratic base and appeal to other voters who could help decide the general election is the question that worries many strategists. The president will do what he can to keep the Democrats off-balance and jumped at the opportunity he was given from Iowa. Democrats can't afford to give him more openings.

Coordinated attacks come as Democratic rival blasts handling of Iran
President Trump and his campaign have launched their most sustained attacks yet on Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, highlighting the Vermont senator's rising poll numbers and sharp criticism of the White House's handling of tensions with Iran.
In a coordinated string of press statements, Twitter posts and televised digs over the past week, Trump and his allies have trained their sights on Sanders, seeking to tarnish his foreign policy credentials and commander in chief appeal. The attacks represent a shift for Trump, who had previously devoted more of his energy to criticizing former vice president Joe Biden. 
Trump's allies say the president drives the campaign's political strategy, acknowledging that he is an avid consumer of the public polling and the cable-TV punditry that has documented Sanders's growing strength in the Democratic presidential primary. 
Trump mentioned Sanders by name 10 times during his rally last week in Ohio "" more than any other candidate. He continued the attacks on Twitter over the weekend and on Monday, singling Sanders out for more direct criticism than other Democratic contenders.
'Wow! Crazy Bernie Sanders is surging in the polls, looking very good against his opponents in the Do Nothing Party,' Trump wrote Sunday on Twitter. 'So what does this all mean? Stay tuned!'
Sanders, who has pilloried Trump for authorizing the drone strike that killed Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, had a curt response: 'It means you're going to lose.'
Trump's campaign has released three statements in the last week specifically attacking Sanders on foreign policy, a significant escalation that has been mirrored by top Twitter accounts managed by campaign aides.
On Monday, the campaign accused Sanders of defending 'the world's top terrorist' and 'pushing a naive, dangerous policy of appeasement toward Iran.' Other aides attacked Sanders on issues ranging from student loans to human rights.
Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, said the focus on Sanders is not a sign of fear of the Vermont senator or any other candidate, arguing that 'Trump would beat any of them handily.'
'Over the last year, the campaign has engaged various Democrats when the opportunities have presented themselves,' Murtaugh said. 'In Sanders's case, his surge in the polls coincided with his emergence as the chief apologist for the Iranian regime. We needed to point out that he would be dangerous as president since he made clear he would appease terrorists and terror-sponsoring nations.'
Sanders, who has been staunchly opposed to America's entanglements in the Middle East, has used the conflict with Iran to draw a contrast both with Trump and with his Democratic rivals. He has accused Trump of abandoning his 2016 pledge to extract the U.S. from costly wars and has made a direct appeal to Trump voters who are disillusioned by the president's performance in office. 
'Bernie, who has spent his entire life standing with the working class, is going to spend every moment of the general election reminding working Americans that Trump was lying when he said he would stand with them and that he would end the endless wars,' said Mike Casca, the Sanders campaign communications director. 'He's the most corrupt president in American history, and Bernie Sanders is going to sweep him out of the White House.'
Earlier this month, Sanders introduced legislation to block funding for military conflict with Iran, something he said would be 'disastrous.'
'At a time when we face the urgent need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, to build the housing we desperately need, and to address the existential crisis of climate change, we as a nation, must get our priorities right,' he said in a joint statement with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.).
Sanders has seen his poll numbers rise and his fundraising improve as he has campaigned on bringing about a 'revolution' capable of ousting Trump from office. A poll released Friday by the Des Moines Register and CNN showed Sanders narrowly leading a close race in Iowa just three weeks before the Feb. 3 caucuses there. The survey is the first to have Sanders leading in the state, and it showed that he enjoys support from 20 percent of likely voters.
Sanders raised $34.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, a massive sum fueled by his online fundraising machine that bested all Democratic contenders. 
Some Trump allies have described Sanders's fundraising as an impressive sign of his potential staying power in the Democratic primary. 
And while most of the Trump campaign's recent attacks on Sanders have focused on foreign policy, the president's surrogates have ramped up their critiques of his domestic agenda as well. Aides said they expect the onslaught against Sanders to continue and intensify, as Trump uses the liberal senator as a stand-in for the entire field of Democrats. 
Trump is scheduled to hold a rally today in Wisconsin, a state where Sanders has said his appeal to working-class voters could put him in a strong position to defeat Trump. Last year, Sanders embarked on a 'Bernie Beats Trump' tour to highlight his strength against the president in key states.
'FACT: Bernie Sanders Is A Wealthy, Fossil Fuel-Guzzling Millionaire,' read one statement from the Trump campaign on Thursday, a day after the campaign released a statement saying he 'Can't Be Trusted To Defend American Lives.'
Sanders has cast doubt on the Trump administration's shifting explanations for the strike that killed Soleimani, accusing the president of concocting a reason to conduct an 'assassination' of a foreign official.
'The difficulty that we have, and I don't mean to be rude here, is we have a president that's a pathological liar,' he said Friday on NBC's TODAY show. 
Trump's campaign has responded by trying to brand the senator as soft on terrorism, a scorched-earth tactic that has come to define the strategy of the president's reelection bid. 
'How many American children have to be left fatherless before Bernie Sanders will defend American lives?' Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted Sunday.
Some of Trump's advisers say they are spoiling for a general election fight with Sanders, describing him as a 'socialist' who turns off moderate voters. 
'I'd rather face Bernie versus Biden,' said Bryan Lanza, who advised Trump's 2016 campaign and transition. 'Let's have the real contrast of who these parties are. Let's have the real debate.'
Trump appeared to egg on a battle between Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Monday, tweeting that the two liberals are fighting over voters. He also turned his fire on former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who has been running ads targeting Trump on health care and other issues. 
'Bernie Sander's volunteers are trashing Elizabeth 'Pocahontus' Warren. Everybody knows her campaign is dead and want her potential voters,' he wrote, misspelling the slur he regularly uses against Warren. 'Mini Mike B is also trying, but getting tiny crowds which are all leaving fast. Elizabeth is very angry at Bernie. Do I see a feud brewing?'

Political consultant
on running for president during an era of social distancing
As the coronavirus spread to over 40 states, and as the number of Americans infected increased, two campaigns for the Democratic presidential nomination were hopscotching across the country on airplanes carrying hundreds of people: the candidates, exhausted staffers and journalists covering the politicians' every move. These ensembles often traveled to multiple states on a single day, from one crowded event to another, in an effort to win delegates, who will then gather at a national convention in just a few months. 
What could possibly go wrong?
It's hard to imagine a worse activity to undertake during a pandemic than a presidential campaign. Combating the virus demands social distancing, but a campaign demands social contact - constantly. The more of it, the better. That ethos is changing fast, however: On Tuesday night, both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders called off primary-night campaign rallies ""out of concern for public health and safety,"" as the Sanders camp put it. The Democratic Party has moved its Sunday debate from Phoenix to Washington and will hold it without an audience, and both the Biden and Sanders camps have told staffers to work from home and ended door-to-door canvassing. After defiantly announcing a ""Catholics for Trump"" rally in Milwaukee this coming week, President Trump's campaign pulled the plug on it - and the president also canceled a trip to Nevada and Colorado. 
If the virus continues its current trajectory, the candidates may find themselves conducting the first ""no touch"" campaign in American history - one in which baby-kissing is unthinkable, ""virtual"" rallies replace raucous crowds and the conventions become only-for-TV events. Trump seems more likely to resist this path, out of either stubbornness or ignorance, but even if just the Democrats modify their behavior, it would be a remarkable spectacle that could even affect which candidate wins in November. 
Sen. Sanders (I-Vt.), former vice president Biden and Trump are all in their 70s, so people rightly wondered whether they were at risk of catching the virus on the campaign trail. On CNN's ""State of the Union"" last weekend, Sanders - who, despite getting 
trounced in Tuesday's primaries, says he will continue his campaign
- suggested that he might have avoided crowds ""in the best of all possible worlds, maybe."" But at that point, he said he'd be running ""as hard as we can.""
In fact, protecting the candidates is the relatively easy part. Presidential campaign staffs are quite adept at social distancing; they do it all the time when they want to keep their candidate from the press, for example. They can use similar methods at public events: Have their candidate enter through a side door, approach a podium from behind the stage, speak to a room full of 1,000 people (or an arena of 15,000), from a safe distance, and then leave to thundering applause without ever coming within a few feet of anyone. 
It's the crowds that are most at risk in this scenario, and not just from other audience members. Few understand the enormous number of people that a presidential campaign - whether during a primary race or a general election - puts in motion every time the candidate travels.
First there are the advance teams. Those crowds aren't spontaneous, after all. An advance team that assembled a crowd and managed an event for a candidate in Seattle last week may be in Miami building the next crowd this week. Unlike the candidates, advance teams don't have the option of not interacting with people. From scouting locations, working with local law enforcement to organizing volunteers working the event, it's just not possible to build a crowd without interacting with a lot of people. 
Then there are the journalists who wander into the audience and ask all those questions (""Why are you for Bernie?"" ""Why Trump?""), then get back on the campaign plane to ask similar questions, in a new crowd, in a new city.
In retrospect, it seems almost insane: Before Tuesday's primaries, the Democratic campaigns and the press were shuttling among Missouri, Michigan and the state of Washington, which has seen the largest number of people testing positive for the coronavirus and the largest number of deaths in the United States. Then they were off to Arizona, Florida, Ohio and Illinois. It's not just the travel itself: It's the pace of it, the range, the close quarters on planes and in those rooms and arenas.
The recent cancellations are reassuring, and they suggest we're about to enter a new world of campaigning. In the past few election cycles, campaigns have made use of ""tele-town halls,"" in which thousands of supporters can call in to a conference number and hear the candidate speak live to them. Such virtual town halls could replace rallies; Biden has announced that his funding raising events will be virtual, too, for now.
The loss of door-to-door campaigning could be one of the bigger setbacks that the virus deals to the campaigns. Over the past decade, campaigns have seen a resurgence in engaged supporters volunteering to knock on doors - and voters seem more receptive to appeals from neighbors and fellow citizens than they do to TV ads, which are increasingly viewed as propaganda. What's more, getting out the vote is the mainstay of every campaign's field organization: Volunteers go to polling places, check off the names of those who have voted and then drive to the houses of those who haven't - even offering a ride to the polls. Volunteers can still call voters, from their own homes, but they won't be offering anyone a ride. (And the system breaks down if volunteers can't check those lists at polling sites.) If the crisis continues, the campaigns will have to reinvent field organizing and get-out-the-vote operations, though it's hard to envision how.

A ""no-touch"" campaign would inevitably be one that's more driven by expensive advertising. And satellite interviews with local TV news programs, already a staple of campaigns, will become even more important, possibly shifting the balance of power somewhat from cable news to local stations in key states.
Such a campaign will hurt some candidates more than others. Sanders's days as a candidate are probably numbered, but he has relied on crowd events to demonstrate the energy and passion his message generates; it's hard to imagine a substitute in a world where large assemblies are taboo. Which also raises the question of how Trump's campaign will respond, given that its signature has been large rallies. Can this man possibly conduct a reelection campaign sans adoring crowds wearing MAGA hats? He is likely to view the long-term abandonment of these events as an implicit admission that his handling of the crisis is not, as he likes to say, ""perfect."" So might he - despite this week's display of caution - conclude he'd prefer to resume the kind of campaigning he enjoys so much? 
He can try. But if the coronavirus continues to spread, and if public health officials urge Americans to avoid crowds, even White House propaganda may not be enough to prevent Republicans from grasping reality. Trump may face the prospect of his supporters staying home and watching on TV as he speaks to smaller and smaller crowds - a potentially humiliating spectacle.
Democrats and Republicans might also have to scrap their national conventions as we know them. We've already seen several Republican elected officials who attended the Conservative Political Action Conference in late February choose to self-quarantine because of contact with an attendee who tested positive for the coronavirus. Some of those same officials also had contact with Trump before they isolated themselves. This worry and confusion arose from an event that's tiny relative to a party convention. 
For years, both party conventions have been little more than partisan TV shows; the coronavirus could offer an opportunity finally to admit this fact. There is no reason to have delegates travel during a health crisis to be props in a party telethon. The parties can produce one night of live speeches and videos, and the next night air the nominee's acceptance speech and the unveiling (or, in the Republicans' case, the re-unveiling) of the vice-presidential nominee. For a while, it looked as if a brokered Democratic convention might be a possibility. That's not going to happen, so there's no need to plan secure ways for state delegations to caucus and vote on multiple ballots without being in the same large room.
With luck, the coronavirus will abate by Election Day in November. If not, there will be no easy way to handle the possibly hundreds of thousands of voters who could be ill or quarantined. As a contingency, state legislatures should change laws for absentee ballots, making them far easier to cast. The virus doesn't know red from blue, so this should be a bipartisan issue. 
No one wants to see any of this occur. But the coronavirus is disrupting global supply chains, upending stock markets and spurring nations to effectively lock down their populations. It would be sheer hubris to think that, amid such chaos, the American presidential campaign is somehow immune.

DES MOINES "" President Trump, on the cusp of acquittal by the Senate and with the highest approval rating of his tenure, marched newly emboldened into the State of the Union address on Tuesday night. The Democratic Party's presidential primary has descended into chaos, with early figures showing that its onetime front-runner, a once-formidable former vice president, is politically wounded. 
The Democratic five-alarm fire has begun. 
Around the country on Tuesday, Democrats found themselves baffled by the circumstances engulfing their party "" even one that is known for, and sometimes takes pride in, its tendency to overreact with worry. 
'This is just one sad week,' said former senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.).
'While I am having these very dark, sad feelings about the Senate GOP and a whitewash, here comes this mess in Iowa,' Boxer said, referring to the impeachment trial. 'This is a wake-up call. We're going to be tested.'
Democrats, after three-plus miserable years under Trump, hoped this would be a turning point, with the president facing impeachment for allegedly abusing his power and Democrats beginning in earnest the campaign to oust him. But neither process is going as planned, reviving Democratic jitters that Trump is somehow not subject to the ordinary laws of politics.
And there is little confidence the coming weeks will provide much clarity. Arguably one of the biggest beneficiaries of the current turmoil is former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, a presidential hopeful who could see an opening in the chaos. On Tuesday he announced he was hiring more staff, spending more on television ads and scheduling more campaign events. 
For all the scandals and allegations against him, Trump's approval rating rose Tuesday to 49 percent, his best Gallup poll performance since 2017. Approval of his handling of the economy has also been strong.
Some Democrats say that is a far more ominous warning sign than the confusion in the Iowa caucuses.
'Far too many Democrats are wrapping themselves around an axle about the delay of results and release of data in Iowa,' said Jen Psaki, a Democratic consultant and veteran of three presidential campaigns. 'The existential threat to [a Democrat] being in the White House is Donald Trump is about to be acquitted and his approval rating has gone up. We're missing the point here.'
Democrats were concerned that turnout for the caucuses, which party officials just weeks ago predicted would hit record levels due to voter enthusiasm to take on Trump, apparently fell short of expectations, potentially suggesting a lack of enthusiasm for the candidates.
Turnout was on course to match the numbers for 2016, but was likely to fall far short of the 2008 caucuses, when a historic number of Iowans showed up to show their enthusiasm for then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.). The falloff coincided with relatively low interest in the Democratic presidential debates, which have not attracted same the level of viewership as in prior election cycles.
'For a while I think there was this thought that you have these candidates running different kinds of grass-roots campaigns and doing this organizing, and that's going to bring new people into the caucus,' Psaki said. 'That didn't happen. We don't need to panic or wet our beds here, but we need to take a look at what that means.'
Some party officials said that while the relatively low Iowa turnout may suggest an uncertainty as to who is the best choice to run against Trump, it does not reflect a lack of enthusiasm, and they predicted that many of the voters who stayed home will turn out in November.
Still, the combination of the muddled result, a botched process that forced the Iowa Democratic chairman to apologize late Tuesday, and the low participation levels was demoralizing to many in the party.
'Iowa was a debacle,' said Joe Trippi, a longtime Democratic consultant, adding that the confusion about what actually happened was especially damaging. 
'We don't know a damn thing "" that's what's crazy,' Trippi said. 'This totally transparent thing that everyone in the room knew what happened and saw it happen "" and no one outside the room knows. It's just mind-blowing.'
The party began releasing some of the results late Tuesday afternoon, and with 62 percent reporting, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) were vying for first place, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) trailing in third. 
Biden was in fourth, a disappointing finish after he made a major push in the state in the past two months, taking a campaign bus all around Iowa, working to earn the biggest endorsements, and spending significantly on television ads. 
Instead, the leaders were two un or tho dox candidates "" the 38-year-old former mayor of a small-to-medium city and a 78-year-old democratic socialist who recently suffered a heart attack. The showing began to fray nerves among Democrats who have had lingering concerns about Biden's sluggish campaign style, small crowds and rhetorical missteps.
'This is not going particularly well so far,' James Carville, a well-known Democratic consultant who has endorsed Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) for president, said on MSNBC.
Taking aim at the Democratic leadership, Carville added, 'This party needs to wake up and make sure that we talk about things that are relevant to people. In 2018 we had good, diverse, strong candidates that had real connections and talked about real things. We don't need to become the British Labour Party.'
That party suffered a major defeat in the last British election under left-leaning leader Jeremy Corbyn. 
'Right now, I've got to tell you,' Carville said, 'I'm not very impressed.'
Biden was the only one of the top four candidates who lost support from the first round of voting Monday night to the second round. 
It was just a few days earlier that Biden, while stopping for ice cream on the campaign trail, mocked Buttigieg for being a small-town mayor. 
'You guys have seen Pete. He's a good guy,' Biden told a group of reporters. But he added, 'You know, I've gotten more than 8,600 votes in my life.'
As the initial results came in on Tuesday, Buttigieg was on course to get more votes than Biden has received in his three runs for president. 
Some of Biden's campaign aides and supporters defended his showing, attributing the loss more to the demographics and dynamics of Iowa than any fundamental problem with his campaign. With upcoming primaries in Nevada, South Carolina and an array of Southern states with more diverse populations, they predicted he would rebound.
'You can't construct a worse scenario for Joe Biden to have to run in [than Iowa] "" he has to fight with both hands tied behind his back,' said Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), a former presidential candidate who endorsed Biden. 'He is strongest with communities of color and older voters, and the caucus doesn't allow for any of that.'
Ryan said that as he called Iowans leading up to the caucuses to advocate for Biden, a number of older voters said that they were struggling to get to the polls, especially since the caucuses can take several hours.
'It was like, how do you expect this guy to win this thing, or do well, when his strength in the electorate is not coming to the polls?' Ryan said. 'If it was a primary, he would have won. Those voters who can walk in and vote and walk out, working-class people. I think he would have won this thing.'
Ryan said that Biden could revive himself, especially in Nevada and South Carolina. 
'People are happy to start moving onto some larger states with a little more diverse electorate,' he said. 'It's not even fair,' he added, referring to Iowa.
More broadly, some Democrats warned against reading too much into the party's struggles over the past week, given the turbulent and fluid condition of the current political landscape. With the focus quickly moving toward next Tuesday's New Hampshire primary and beyond, and with impeachment soon in the rear view mirror, the party's natural strengths will reassert themselves, they said.
'We are much better talking about health care and climate change and other issues than impeachment,' said Barney Frank, a former congressman from Massachusetts. 
Many in the party remain optimistic that a surge of energy from voters frustrated and angry at the Trump presidency is likely to power them to victory in November.
'A lot of times in politics, it's good to get the bad stuff out of the way,' Boxer said, adding that she was choosing to be philosophical about the week's woes for her party. 'Whether that's the weaknesses of candidates or the weaknesses in voting systems "" it's best to get them out of the way.'
Still, Frank said, one thing is clear from the past few days.
'This is the coup de grace for the Iowa caucus,' he said. 'There are so many substantive arguments against Iowa, it being unrepresentative and being a caucus state. But this screw-up greatly increases the leverage. This should be the final push to getting rid of Iowa.'

NASHUA, N.H. ""
A steady stream of anxious Democratic voters went to the polls in this pivotal state Tuesday saying they'd chosen a candidate only in recent days or even hours, underlining Democrats' deep-seated frustration and uncertainty over how to defeat a president they revile.

Terry Heinzman, walking into a Manchester precinct, surprised herself by voting for former vice president Joe Biden. Just hours earlier, she had been trying to decide between Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).
'I thought it was going to be Amy or Elizabeth,' Heinzman said as she put on an 'I voted' sticker. But as the retired event planner, 74, entered her polling place at the McDonough School, she decided that reversing what she saw as the calamitous damage of the Trump era required a more experienced hand. 
'As much as I am progressive, in my values and the way I think this country ought to go, I don't think it's time right now,' Heinzman said. 'I think there's so much cleaning up to do.' Yet, asked whether Biden could beat Trump, she said, 'I'm not sure anybody can, to be perfectly honest with you.' 
That fatalism was widespread among voters in the first-in-the-nation primary, even after a year of campaign by a Democratic field that at one point included more than two dozen contenders. Linda Ryan, a 62-year-old teacher who voted in Nashua, also agonized until the 11th hour, saying, 'I didn't decide until yesterday.' 
Ryan had been torn between Klobuchar and Buttigieg, finally choosing the former because 'I just think she's more electable.'
New Hampshire has played an outsize role in shaping previous presidential primaries, but Democrats fretted that the outcome this year would provide little clarity. The New Hampshire primary came a week after the botched Iowa caucuses that produced a delayed, muddled result.
'The truth of the matter is, tonight is likely going to raise more questions than answers,' said Karine Jean-Pierre, a Democratic strategist and senior adviser at MoveOn.org. 'After tonight, less than 600,000 people will have voted. More than twice that many people will ride the New York City subway home tonight.'

Some campaigns also suggested the muddle was likely to continue. Warren campaign manager Roger Lau wrote to supporters Tuesday, 'No candidate has come close yet to receiving majority support among the Democratic primary electorate, and there is no candidate that has yet shown the ability to consolidate support.'
For his part, Biden "" who led the national polls for much of the past year "" planned to leave New Hampshire early to head to South Carolina, a reflection of his poor prospects in the Granite State, where Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) led the latest polls. Before departing, Biden pronounced himself 'mildly hopeful' about New Hampshire "" a slight improvement over an earlier assertion that he would 'probably take a hit' there "" and signaled his hope for a rebound in South Carolina. 
Still, voters in New Hampshire grappled with their decision, saying Democrats across the country were looking to their state for guidance after the Feb.-3 Iowa caucuses were plagued by technical difficulties. In the end, both Sanders and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg declared victory in Iowa.
The turbulence led to a highly unusual inability by voters Tuesday to choose candidates until they absolutely had to. Preliminary exit polls suggested that nearly half of voters made their decisions in the past few days. That is considerably higher than the 36-percent of Iowa Democrats who made their decisions in the days before last week's caucuses. 
It's also roughly double the percentage of New Hampshire voters who decided in the days before the 2016 primary, a contest that had been effectively narrowed to Sanders and Hillary Clinton. 
 The exit poll, conducted by Edison Media Research for the National Election Pool, The Washington Post and other media organizations, only underscored how undefined and unpredictable the Democratic race has been. 

Donald Sanborn, who voted Tuesday in Merrimack, had been undecided between Buttigieg and Klobuchar, both seen as more-moderate alternatives to Sanders. He ended up choosing Klobuchar because he was impressed by her performance at a recent debate. 'She was just so calm and knowledgeable,' he said.
Brian Murphy, 47, who voted for Warren in Portsmouth, said that while he was excited by several of the candidates, he longed for one who combined several of their qualities. 'I wish we could build them all into one giant candidate that can beat the beast,' Murphy said, meaning Trump. 
The president, who was in New Hampshire on Monday for a rally, presents a formidable challenge for Democrats in part because his party is unified behind him while the Democratic field remains fractured. In New Hampshire's Republican primary, Trump faced only nominal opposition from former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld.
Democratic activists and officials were also shaken by the turnout in Iowa, which had fallen below their expectations, raising questions about whether the party's candidates had sufficiently energized the electorate. 
'The turnout in Iowa should have every Democrat concerned "" it was a disaster,' said Jean-Pierre. 'We will not beat Trump unless we get turnout up.'
Sanders, who boasts of his ability to attract new voters to his presidential run, acknowledged Tuesday that turnout in Iowa had not been as high as he wanted but cited an increase in the number of young voters as an encouraging sign. He touted the 7,500 attendees at his Monday-night rally in Durham, tweeting that it was it 'the largest New Hampshire rally of any candidate in this primary.'

One presidential hopeful who was not on the ballot in New Hampshire also loomed large Tuesday: former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg. 
The billionaire candidate has spent more than $300-million on his campaign, targeting states where voting is to take place beginning next month. By skipping the early states, while dominating television ad spending in places where other Democrats have not yet focused, Bloomberg has disrupted the usual nominating process.
At least a few New Hampshire voters opted to side with Bloomberg even though he was not on the ballot. Bloomberg received three write-in votes in the small community of Dixville Notch, whose five residents cast their votes just after midnight Tuesday in a long-standing tradition.
Bloomberg's rise in the polls has sparked increasing attacks from other candidates, who have been highlighting his record spending. 'I don't begrudge his wealth, but I do begrudge a billionaire thinking he can buy the election,' Sanders said in an interview with 'NBC Nightly News.'
But even the impassioned messages of candidates such as Sanders left large numbers of Democrats undecided when they arrived at their polling places Tuesday.
Tom Cerone said he was torn between Buttigieg and Sen. Michael F. Bennet (D-Colo.) until he got to the school in Merrimack where he was to cast his vote.
'I was gonna do Bennet,' Cerone said. 'And then I said, 'You know, he's so low in the polls, let me get to Pete.' '

While campaigning, president boasts of being at center of operation 

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. "" President Trump has quickly turned the U.S. drone killing of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani into a boast for the campaign trail, regaling supporters with tales of his role in the operation as he seeks to burnish his commander-in-chief credentials in an election year.
 At a campaign rally in Milwaukee last week and in a private event with Republican donors at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla., this weekend, Trump has cast Maj. Gen. Soleimani's death this month as overdue justice for a man who denigrated the United States and used roadside explosives to kill and maim. 
In doing so, Trump has not bothered to vigorously defend the legal justification for the drone strike he ordered. (The administration has said Soleimani was planning 'imminent' attacks on U.S. assets but has not put forward detailed evidence.) Trump also seems to have abandoned his unfounded claim that up to four U.S. embassies were threatened after Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper and other top officials acknowledged they were not aware of such a threat.
Rather, Trump has focused on placing himself at the center of the action. In leaked audio from the GOP fundraiser, Trump described listening in the White House Situation Room to live updates from a U.S. official who counted down the seconds until the strike on Soleimani was carried out.
'Then, all of a sudden, boom,' the president said. 
Other presidents have made the demise of high-profile national security threats a feature of their talking points for the campaign trail, including former president Barack Obama, who used the killing of al-Qaeda mastermind Osama bin Laden to push back against Republicans who had called him feckless during his run for reelection in 2012. 
But Trump's focus on Soleimani, as well as the killing of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a U.S. miliary raid in Syria this past fall, comes at a particularly fraught moment for a president who faces an impeachment trial in the Senate and has been consistently criticized by Democrats, and some Republicans, as lacking the temperament to lead the country.
Last month, former vice president Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, unveiled a campaign ad featuring a viral video of foreign leaders laughing while privately talking about Trump at a NATO gathering. A group of prominent GOP political strategists launched a major fundraising effort to help defeat him in crucial swing states in 2020. And a new book "" 'A Very Stable Genius,' written by two Washington Post reporters "" has offered alarming details of Trump dressing down U.S. military leaders and his own national security aides as 'a bunch of dopes and babies' during a private briefing at the Pentagon in 2017. 
By talking tough about the deaths of Soleimani and Baghdadi, Trump appeals 'to an electorate who likes to hear those sorts of things,' said Bryan McGrath, a retired naval officer who helped organize one of two 'Never Trump' letters signed by Republican national security experts in 2016. 'Most importantly, he's putting himself out there as a man of action, and I think that is appealing to his base.'
McGrath said he retains deep misgivings about Trump's leadership, but, he added: 'I like that Soleimani was taken out. I'm not exactly sure about all the planning that went into it. But I won't hold that one against him.'
Since announcing Soleimani's death, Trump has touted the operation as a measure of his resolve, criticizing Obama and former president George W. Bush for having passed up chances to kill the Iranian general. Both of them reportedly were concerned that such an act would lead to a war.
At his rally in Milwaukee on Tuesday, Trump spent much of the opening portion of his remarks boasting of his 'bold and decisive action to defend American lives and deliver American justice' against 'the world's number one terrorist.' 
Soleimani 'was the king of the roadside bombs,' Trump said. 'Great percentages of people don't have legs right now and arms because of this son of a bitch, okay?' He hammered Democrats who questioned the rationale for the strike and his overall Iran strategy, saying his political rivals 'should be outraged by Soleimani's evil crimes, not the decision to end his wretched life.'
As he did in his remarks at the private GOP fundraiser, Trump at the rally re-created a purported conversation he had with another unnamed official "" this one on the night that Iran responded to Soleimani's killing by launching a dozen ballistic missiles at Iraqi military bases that house U.S. troops. 
'I said, 'How many killed?' 'Nobody, sir.' I said, 'How many hurt?' They said, 'Nobody, sir.' And I said, 'They just saved themselves $1-trillion and a lot of lives,' ' Trump said, suggesting he would have escalated the conflict with additional sanctions and military strikes if U.S. personnel had been injured. 
Despite Trump's public statements that no Americans were wounded, at least eight U.S. troops suffered signs of concussions in the attack, officials said.
Robert Spalding, a retired Air Force general who served on Trump's National Security Council, said the president's use of Soleimani's death as a political cudgel is 'consistent with what's been done in the past.'
 'I don't see it as something outside the realm of what other people have done,' he said. 'Does talking about things like that burnish his credentials as a military leader? Well, I think that's up to whoever is listening to it.'
Polls suggest Trump has not won over the public on his Iran strategy. According to an ABC News-Ipsos poll, 56-percent of the public disapprove of Trump's approach on Iran, compared to 43-percent who approve. And 52-percent feel less safe after the strike on Soleimani vs. 25-percent who feel safer, the poll found. A Reuters poll taken before Iran's missile attack found that 71-percent of the public believe war with Iran is very or somewhat likely over the next few years. Just 51-percent held that view in May. 
Trump supporters have pointed to Iran's public statements that it does not seek to further escalate the crisis as evidence that the president scored a tactical victory in taking out Tehran's top military strategist with minimal costs to U.S. personnel. 
But critics have noted that the confrontation led Iraq's government to temporarily suspend counterterrorist operations against the Islamic State and vote to expel U.S. troops from the country, a demand Trump opposed this month. 
Last week, Douglas London, a retired CIA officer, wrote in Just Security, a national security journal, that he feared Trump was focusing on big-name 'celebrity' targets instead of more strategic operations. Along with Soleimani, London cited bin Laden's son Hamza, who was killed this past summer in an operation in which the United States played a role. 
'I am of the mind, knowing what a bad guy Soleimani was and the intelligence collection the U.S. is capable of, that it was quite probable that we had the intelligence case to justify this kind of operation' on Soleimani, said Ned Price, a former CIA officer who served as a spokesman for the National Security Council under Obama. 'What worries me is the prospect that President Trump undertook an operation with an eye more to the politics than to the strategic context. This, to me, sounds like a president who wants to look and act tough as he enters the election cycle.'

White working class in Michigan, Missouri seen as vital for Democrats

CLAYCOMO, Mo. - Dianne Maxwell enjoyed a comfortable life in this suburb north of Kansas City, until her husband lost his job as a printer last year.
He's since found work as a long-haul truck driver, but money is tight.
So when a Bernie Sanders volunteer knocked on her door Saturday, she had one issue on her mind. ""What matters to me is the middle class,"" she said, adding that her vote in Tuesday's primary hinges on which candidate will do more to improve health care and take on the burgeoning national debt.
The battle for the Democratic presidential nomination shifted to the Midwest this week with a showdown over which of the top two remaining candidates has the strongest appeal among working-class whites - the voters seen as crucial to the party's hopes of making gains in this region and beating President Trump in November. The duel will play out largely in Michigan and Missouri, which hold primaries along with four other states Tuesday - the next in a string of big primary days that could determine a presumptive nominee in a matter of weeks. 
Sanders dominated this group in his 2016 Democratic primaries against Hillary Clinton, including in his stunning victory that year in Michigan. His allies have argued that many working-class voters in the region drawn to Sanders's populist message wound up staying home or backing Trump in the general election, sparking the president's decisive wins in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
But former vice president Joe Biden, a native of Scranton, Pa., who has presented himself as a son of the Rust Belt and a champion of the middle class, has argued that he is more suited to win these voters back. Exit polls from last week's Super Tuesday contests, in which Biden surged to take a national delegate lead, showed that he beat Sanders among non-college-educated whites by four points.
""Missouri is critical as a test of Sanders's ability to hold on to white working-class voters,"" said Dave Robertson, chair of the political science department at the University of Missouri at St. Louis. ""If he can't do this in Missouri, he can't do it in the big Midwestern states coming up - Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania - that will be key to winning the general election in November.""
In Missouri this weekend, Biden touted his working-class roots. Fresh off his victories last week and with a national delegate lead, Biden held a campaign rally Saturday at the National World War I Memorial and Museum in Kansas City, with workers from firefighters and electrical unions carefully arrayed behind him in the setting sun.
""All those who've been knocked down, all those counted out and all those who have been left behind - this campaign is your campaign,"" he said, drawing cheers with a common refrain from his stump speech.
He often recalls personal stories that shaped him from his childhood in Scranton. He also reflects on the tragedy that befell him as a young senator-elect, when his wife and baby daughter were killed in a car crash.
Even Biden's opponents say his personal narrative appeals to voters. ""He has a compelling personal story. He's very likable, very decent, and people trust him as vice president. He's certainly a formidable opponent,"" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a Sanders supporter. ""But I don't think a return to normalcy is sufficient.""

Biden's wife, Jill, appeared at events in St. Louis, Columbia and Kansas City on Monday, according to the campaign. Union workers will be knocking on doors throughout the Midwest for Biden, and surrogates such as Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.) joined picketing Teamsters in Michigan over the weekend.
Walt Landis, 59, a draftsman and retired farmer from Faucett, Mo., said he supported Biden in part because he thinks Biden's establishment ties mean he will be able to cooperate with the Republicans in Washington.
Sanders, he said, is too much of an iconoclast.
""He's a bit too militant for me,"" Landis said. ""We don't need a revolution - we had that argument in 1776.""
Sanders and his volunteers, meanwhile, have tried to keep the conversation focused on policy. In recent days, the candidates have sparred over Social Security and Biden's past support of trade deals such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.
On the stump, Biden, 77, the son of a used-car salesman, calls himself ""Middle Class Joe."" Sanders, 78, touts his decades of work on liberal causes and proposals such as the $15 minimum wage and the cancellation of student debt.
""He's the most pro-worker, pro-union candidate we're ever going to have, at least in my lifetime,"" Bobby Cervantes, 31, a graduate teaching assistant at the University of Kansas, said as he canvassed for Sanders on Saturday in Claycomo, a working-class neighborhood of modest ramblers and split-level homes near a Ford assembly plant. He tucked literature in doorways that outlined Sanders's plans for Medicare-for-all, fair trade and worker rights.
Maxwell, 54, a former Kmart worker, said she was worried about empty promises from both candidates when the Sanders volunteers knocked on her door.
""Who am I going to give my trust to?"" she wondered.
""Bernie wants to make sure everybody gets free college and to get rid of student loan debt,"" said campaign volunteer Hannah Allison, 32, a teaching assistant from Lawrence, Kan.
""But how are we going to pay for it?"" Maxwell countered. ""He hasn't come up with a concrete plan. Kind of like Trump - build the wall and have Mexico pay for it.""
Her neighbor Nathan Clapham, 26, a college student, said he was voting for Sanders. He said he was raised in poverty, the child of itinerant construction workers, and now lives with his sister because he can't afford an apartment of his own.
""Bernie's rhetoric of populism hits the same kind of notes as Trump's, so he'll be more appealing to working-class people,"" Clapham said. ""Unfortunately, every single person who's going to get up on that stage is pushing 80 years old.""
""But at least Bernie wants different things,"" he continued. ""Biden is literally saying we're going to keep doing the same things we've always done. It's not working.""

Former vice president rebukes college student who posed question

HAMPTON, N.H. "" With Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg battling to win Tuesday's primary here and seize the momentum in a highly unpredictable race, another drama is playing out with serious implications for the other high-profile candidates in the Democrats' once-sprawling field.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren is facing the prospect of losing badly in a state neighboring her home of Massachusetts, while Joe Biden's campaign is bracing for another potentially humiliating defeat and, as a result, a new round of anxiety among its top donors and questions about the viability of a former vice president once seen as the Democrats' best hope to defeat President Trump.
The grim question facing Warren and Biden is not whether they can win New Hampshire, according to strategists, but how low they will finish "" and what that result would mean for their candidacies. 
Two days before voters head to the polls, Biden advisers were already eager to move on, hoping the former vice president would do better with Nevada and South Carolina's more diverse electorate. But there are growing concerns, even inside his campaign, that financial resources are being strained just as the race shifts into an expensive national campaign. 
Biden in recent days has retooled his stump speech, focusing on the stories of those he has met on the trail, and growing emotional as he speaks about the 2015 death of his oldest son, Beau. 
But at times, he struggled to connect with voters. On Sunday morning, at an oceanside ballroom here, Madison Moore took the microphone and warned the former vice president that the question she was about to ask was going to be a bit mean. 
'How do you explain the performance in Iowa and why should voters believe that you can win the national election?' asked the 21-year-old student at Mercer University in Georgia. 
Biden said it was legitimate question, but then turned the spotlight back on her, asking: 'Iowa's a caucus. Have you ever been to a caucus?'
When she indicated yes, he rebuked her: 'No, you haven't. You're a lying dog-faced pony soldier.'
The phrase was an allusion to a line in a John Wayne movie that Biden had used before. Even so, Moore said she was shaken and flummoxed at his reaction. 
In a statement to The Washington Post, Moore said Biden insulted her. 
'It is totally irrelevant whether I've been to a caucus or not,' she said. 'Joe Biden has been performing incredibly poorly in this race. His inability to answer a simple question from a nobody college student like me only exacerbates that reality.'
Biden went on to say that the caucuses posed challenges to his campaign, and he conceded that they were less prepared. 'I congratulate Pete, I congratulate Bernie,' he said. 'They were really well organized. Better than we were.'
As the Democratic presidential candidates sprint to the finish ahead of Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, the momentum is clearly behind Sanders and Buttigieg. Public polling suggests that Biden's main competitors in the race for third place are Warren and Klobuchar, who finished third and fifth in Iowa, respectively.
A finish of fourth place or lower by Biden in New Hampshire would also probably give a boost to the campaign of former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg (D), who has cast himself as the chief 'establishment' alternative to Sanders and who is forgoing the early states in favor of the March 3 Super Tuesday contests. Bloomberg has already invested hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising in those states.
For his part, Biden has simultaneously sought to play down expectations and ramp up his attacks on his rivals. 'Now, let's be realistic; I think it's always going to be an uphill fight,' he said in an interview on ABC News's 'This Week' that was taped Saturday.
Pointing to Sanders and Warren, he added: 'When you're running against two people who are neighboring senators, you know the deal.-. . . So I think it is an uphill fight, but I think it's a fight we will do well in.'
After his Iowa loss put a dent in his campaign's main selling point "" his electability "" the former vice president has doubled down on his argument that he is the candidate best poised to bring together the diverse parts of the Democratic coalition.
'No one has ever won the nomination without being able to get overwhelming support from the African American community,' Biden said on 'This Week.' 'And so far, no one's been doing that but me.'
Biden also on Sunday took a swipe at Sanders's health-care plan, saying it was too expensive and would take too long to enact. The Vermont senator's biggest problem, Biden argued, was that he wasn't being fully truthful with the American people.
'Look, the one thing I think the public is looking for as much as anything is authenticity,' Biden said. 'Just tell me the truth. And if you don't know, don't ask me to buy a pig in a poke.'
Alan Kessler, a longtime Democratic fundraiser and donor and one of the Biden campaign's top bundlers, said he was concerned by the distance between Biden and the top two finishers in the Iowa caucuses. 
Biden's donors and fundraisers are not expecting him to win in New Hampshire and are managing the expectations of other donors, reminding them that Iowa and New Hampshire are driven by support from mostly white voters and that Biden's strength lies with a more diverse coalition. 
'The finishing fourth wasn't, to me, as much of a situation as the disparity between him and Mayor Pete and Sanders,' Kessler said. 'The good thing is, a lot of my compatriots feel the same way, which is: Wait and see. The narrative all along has been Nevada to some degree, and certainly South Carolina.'
Donors are 'worried and concerned' about Biden's campaign, he said, and are advising the candidate to take a more aggressive approach "" advice many of them are giving on donor calls with Biden. 
'Things have to change a little bit. He's got to interact with the media in a less scripted way. I think that's happening. He's got to come out swinging "" no longer Mr. Nice Guy. If that turns off some voters, so be it,' Kessler said. 
As Warren and Klobuchar spent their Sunday on the trail wooing voters, they, too, tamped down expectations for New Hampshire.
Warren largely hewed closely to the stump speech and event format that she's used for the past 13 months. The speech uses her hardscrabble biography to explain how she became interested in the financial woes of the middle class and how she became focused on leveling the playing field for Americans.
Warren's been so unwavering that reporters pressed her repeatedly Sunday on whether she plans on making any changes.
In response to a question from a reporter in Concord about whether the state represents her last stand, Warren replied, 'It looks like it is going to be a long battle to the nomination.'
'I'm in it for the long haul,' she added. 'I built a campaign to be in it for the long haul.' 
Warren demurred when a reporter pointed out that a number of attendees left her Concord town hall early.
'It seemed like to me a pretty enthusiastic crowd,' she said.
Warren allies say that the field is so fractured and fluid that they believe she still has a chance to do well later in the calendar even if she only musters a third-place finish here. If Biden collapses, his support from minority communities would be up for grabs "" and Warren's boosters believe it's unlikely that nonwhite voters will flock to Buttigieg or Klobuchar. Should Sanders prevail in New Hampshire with a big win, they hope Democrats will look for a more unifying candidate who can also fire up the liberal base of the party.
Warren's campaign on Sunday sent an email to supporters noting that it had set a $2-million fundraising goal last week and 'blew right past it.'
The email came one day after Klobuchar's campaign sent its own missive to supporters noting that the senator from Minnesota had raised more than $2-million in the wake of Friday night's Democratic debate.
Klobuchar has been holding as many as five or six campaign events a day; on Sunday, she deployed her husband, John Bessler, on the trail in New Hampshire as well.
Recent polling shows that many New Hampshire voters, like 59-year-old Ken Meade, remain undecided.
Meade, of Laconia, had previously supported Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and is now torn between Klobuchar, Warren and several others "" but he noted that he believes Biden, 77, and Sanders, 78, are both too old to be president.

'When I get to the voting booth, it might just be gut,' Meade said after attending Warren's town hall Sunday. 'At that moment, who do I think has the best chance of beating Trump?'

Trump aides gird for growing possibility that witnesses will be allowed 
President Trump and his allies are moving to undermine the credibility of former national security adviser John Bolton, while also preparing to fight his ability to testify during the Senate impeachment trial, according to White House aides and outside advisers familiar with the strategy.
As the president's lawyers were defending his actions toward Ukraine on the Senate floor on Monday, Trump aides and allies were privately girding for the growing possibility that multiple witnesses will be allowed to appear. They scrambled to determine which testimony they could block and which witnesses they should potentially call, the aides said.
The shift in the White House's impeachment strategy comes after news emerged Sunday evening that a book by Bolton alleges that the president directly tied the holdup of nearly $400-million in military aid for Ukraine to investigations into former vice president Joe Biden "" a potential 2020 rival "" and his son Hunter Biden. 

Among White House aides and Capitol Hill Republicans, there was a growing brew of anxiety, unease and frustration, as well as the sense that the allegations contained in Bolton's book, which is due in March, could push the Senate impeachment trial into next week, yielding more damaging disclosures for Trump as he heads into this year's reelection contest. 
Though the White House continued to push aggressively Monday against witness testimony "" especially from Bolton "" some aides are now convinced that they will lose that battle. 
White House Counsel Pat Cipollone has privately insisted to senators and allies that the White House did not know Bolton was going to make such an accusation in the book. The manuscript was submitted to the National Security Council in late December as part of a routine pre-publication review process. 
Top NSC lawyer John Eisenberg knew that the NSC had a copy of the book but had not reviewed it, a person close to him said. 
Cipollone and other White House lawyers had neither expected nor planned for Bolton's book to emerge during the impeachment trial and engaged in discussions Sunday night and Monday morning about whether they should adjust their trial strategy.
Trump's longtime personal attorney Jay Sekulow seemed to allude to the allegations in Bolton's upcoming memoir about his time in the White House, 'The Room Where It Happened,' when the Senate trial resumed Monday, but only briefly and obliquely. 
'We deal with transcript evidence, we deal with publicly available information,' Sekulow said on the Senate floor as he pressed the president's case. 'We do not deal with speculation, allegations that are not based on evidentiary standards at all.'
Trump also sought to undermine Bolton, as well as distance himself from his former senior adviser, in tweets that allies pointed to as they tried to tamp down public speculation that Bolton's book could be damaging to the president. 
'I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens,' Trump wrote. 'In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book.'
The president's allies tried to portray Bolton as a disgruntled former employee or as someone greedily trying to profit off his time in the White House.
The Republican National Committee blasted out talking points attacking Bolton "" who has served in Republican administrations dating back to Ronald Reagan "" in an email titled 'That's one way to boost book sales.'
'How convenient that this leaked info happened to be released at the same time preorders were made available for the book on Amazon,' read the Republican committee email. 'What a joke.' 
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, in a text message to The Washington Post said he regretted pushing Bolton for the position of national security adviser and said the president was always skeptical of Bolton. He said that Bolton 'never once raised any objection to what I was doing in defending' the president, and accused him of acting cowardly. 
'I never thought of him as not having the courage to deal with people man to man,' Giuliani said. 'So I put him in the category of John the Backstabber.'
Aides and allies said they took solace in their belief that Trump will be acquitted regardless of whether Bolton or other witnesses appear. One-senior Republican official-likened the allegations in Bolton's manuscript to the nausea that can accompany a rough boat ride "" unpleasant but not fatal.
'It's like choppy waters, but the boat is not going to sink,' the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share an assessment of the Bolton announcement. 'They might throw up because of seasickness, but they're not going to die.' 
But behind the scenes, the White House worked feverishly to quell a possible rebellion in the Senate, with both senior adviser Tony Sayegh, who was brought back into the administration to help with impeachment messaging, and White House director of legislative affairs Eric Ueland reaching out to Republican lawmakers and their aides.
House Democrats charge that Trump withheld military aid and a White House meeting to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens and a since-discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election. Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, while his father was vice president.
Officially, the administration continued to push its previous message that Trump did nothing wrong in his July-25 phone call with Zelensky "" a call at the heart of the whistleblower complaint that ultimately launched the impeachment inquiry "" and the disclosures in Bolton's book do not change those basic facts. 
Sayegh traveled Monday morning to Capitol Hill to address a meeting of Republican Senate communications aides, where he reiterated that pitch. 
Some Republican senators, however, remained frustrated, privately pushing the White House to find out just when the president's legal team learned of the allegations in Bolton's manuscript "" and whether there are other bombshells that might emerge.
In an indication of how much Senate Republicans were caught off guard by the news about Bolton's book, which was first reported by the New York Times, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) said he had no knowledge of its contents. 'The Leader did not have any advance notice,' his spokesman said in a statement. 
At the end of last week, Republican leaders were confident they could beat back any attempts to call witnesses and vote to acquit Trump by Friday, but they are now facing a less certain path to ending the trial.
Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.), an influential conservative, on Monday expressed openness to calling witnesses, proposing a 'one-for-one' deal, in which both Democrats and Republicans would be allowed to call one witness each.
Republicans have said that if Democrats secure the votes to call Bolton or other administration officials, they will seek the testimony of one or both of the Bidens.
Meanwhile, just about everyone implicated by Bolton's book sought to distance themselves from him. 
In a statement, the attorney for acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, Bob Driscoll, dismissed the charges in the book concerning his knowledge about alleged actions taken toward Ukraine as having 'more to do with publicity than the truth.'
'John Bolton never informed Mick Mulvaney of any concerns surrounding Bolton's purported August conversation with the president,' Driscoll wrote. 'Nor did Mr. Mulvaney ever have a conversation with the president or anyone else indicating that Ukrainian military aid was withheld in exchange for a Ukrainian investigation of Burisma, the Bidens, or the 2016 election.'
Attorney General William P. Barr also has consistently worked to inoculate himself from the Ukraine scandal "" even as his Justice Department has gone to court to advance the administration's efforts to withhold documents and testimony from Congress as part of the impeachment process. When news broke Sunday night that Bolton claimed to have told Barr, after Trump's July phone call with Zelensky, that the attorney general's name had been invoked, a Barr spokeswoman was quick to dispute Bolton's account.
The spokeswoman, Kerri Kupec, said Bolton did not bring up the July phone call during a conversation with Barr. 
Two Justice Department officials familiar with Bolton and Barr's conversation, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the matter's political sensitivity, said that Bolton had called Barr in late July or early August but that Bolton and Barr talked only about Giuliani's Ukraine-related efforts. 
One of the officials said the call was brief. Bolton, the official said, told Barr that Giuliani was 'doing this foreign policy-type stuff,' and warned Barr, 'you need to steer clear of that.' The official did not recall Bolton ever bringing up the July phone call between Trump and Zelensky, and said when Barr was informed of that call weeks later, he reacted as if he was learning for the first time. 
And even Bolton seemed to want some distance "" at least from how the news from his book came into public view. 
Bolton's lawyer, Charles Cooper, denied that he or his client had anything to do with the leak of the manuscript to the Times. 
'I can tell you unequivocally that we had nothing to do with the leak of any information concerning John's manuscript,' Cooper said in an interview.

President Trump sought to assure his supporters Saturday that the coronavirus is under control after earlier confirming the first U.S. death attributed to the infection and boasted of the country's great economic comeback after Wall Street's worst week since the 2008 financial crisis. 
Rallying conservatives eights months before the election, Trump mocked the height of Democratic candidate and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, crouching at the lectern for dramatic effect, called Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) a ""lowlife"" for his vote to convict the president on an article of impeachment and described Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as a ""crazy professor.""
Against the backdrop of a growing global virus and the South Carolina Democratic primary, Trump delivered a 90-minute speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference in which he crowed about his political success in 2016, lashed out at his preferred targets - Democrats and the news media - and polled the audience on which of his rivals would be easier to beat in November. 
The response suggested the answer was Sanders.
 Trump warned of ""far-left radicals"" who will ""indoctrinate our children . . . impose a fanatical code of political correctness, bombard our citizens with fake news propaganda and implement policies that would turn America very quickly into a large-scale Venezuela."" 
He called the House Democrats ""lunatics,"" railed against illegal immigration and complained about losing the distinction as Time magazine's person of the year to the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg. 
Trump sneered at Democrats for questioning the job he's doing on the threat of the spreading novel coronavirus. Trump was criticized over remarks he'd made during a political rally in South Carolina on Friday night calling the virus the Democrats' ""new hoax,"" likening it to the Russia investigation and the impeachment inquiry and trial. 
Trump said Saturday during a White House news conference that he wasn't calling the virus a hoax, but rather the Democrats' accusations that he's mismanaging it. 
""Everything is under control,"" Trump told the CPAC crowd, falsely stating that it was the Democrats who ""wanted to let infected people pour into our country.""
The annual gathering of activists and politicians was created in the 1970s to reflect Ronald Reagan's brand of conservatism. But in recent years, the event has become a Trump affair. 
As a private citizen, Trump spoke at CPAC for many years before formally entering politics, but he was never taken seriously by attendees as a presidential contender. 
Romney, now persona non grata at the event because of his conflicts with Trump, was once a darling of the CPAC crowd, winning the group's presidential straw poll in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2012. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) won it in 2015 and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) in 2016 - the years Trump ran for, and won, the presidency.
Now, the mention of Romney's name elicited boos and thumbs-down gestures from the crowd as Trump assailed the 2012 GOP presidential nominee. 
Romney, the only Republican to vote to convict Trump on the abuse of power article of impeachment, said the president's actions were ""grievously wrong"" in pressuring Ukraine to investigate domestic political rivals, including former vice president Joe Biden.
Anne Copp, a former state representative in New Hampshire, voted for Romney in 2008 and 2012, but said she was very upset by his ""grandstanding"" vote on impeachment. 
She said she liked that Trump criticized him during his speech. 
""His political career and aspirations are over,"" she said of Romney. 
Wearing a rhinestone Trump pin, Copp, 59, said she cried multiple times during Trump's speech because she was so moved. 
A lifelong Republican, she said she is worried about the increasing popularity of socialism in the United States - especially among young people. 
But she said there are enough people who recognize the dangers posed by socialism that she thinks Sanders would be the easiest candidate for Trump to beat.
The audience booed when images of Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) flashed on the screen and booed at the mention of socialism. 
Trump basked in chants of ""four more years"" as he disparaged the Democratic presidential candidates one by one. 
He described a recent Democratic debate in which Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) challenged Bloomberg on his record, marveling at her success and describing Bloomberg's performance as the worst. Trump claimed that Biden couldn't put words together and that if he were elected, others would be running the country while ""he'll be sitting in a home somewhere.""
He repeated a crowd-driven poll from his rally Friday night in asking the audience to determine the easier candidate for him to beat, ""Sleepy Joe"" Biden or ""Crazy Bernie."" 
This crowd, like the one in South Carolina, cheered loudest for Sanders. The only difference was that in South Carolina, Trump urged Republicans to vote for Sanders in their state's Democratic primary - which allows anyone regardless of party to vote. 
But not every Republican is confident that Sanders will be easy to beat. 
Ken Gosnell, 47, who runs his own consulting business in Frederick, Md., said he's concerned about Sanders's strong following but also said he is confident that Trump will win on his record - especially on the strong economy and family values. 
Gosnell's wife was adorned in a short-sleeve dress with TRUMP 2020 emblazoned over it. 
Trump ended his speech vowing to save America before embracing a U.S. flag, kissing it and mouthing three times, ""I love you, baby.""

Ex-D.C. Council member has lost longtime alliesin bid to reclaim seat
Since launching his bid to reclaim the D.C. Council seat he gave up under pressure in January, Democrat Jack Evans has been scolded by former constituents and abandoned by longtime allies. A former council colleague said no when Evans asked for a donation. 
Paul Trantham, a veteran signature collector for D.C. candidates, said that it took six days to get 100 people to sign a nominating petition for Evans - and that he caught plenty of flak along the way.
 ""People cussed me out. People walked around me,"" said Trantham, a neighborhood commissioner in Southeast Washington. ""I've been abused verbally, disrespected and told shame on me.""
But friends and associates say Evans is feeling more confident after submitting hundreds of signatures Wednesday to qualify for the Democratic primary ballot in June and is preparing for his first public appearance - at a candidate forum Thursday - since announcing his comeback bid. 
""He got a good taste of what it's going to be like going door-to-door. Because people say, 'Oh, you need to get out,' "" said one associate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. ""He doesn't want to be a lobbyist or practice law. This is all he wants to do, so he's going to try to hang on.""
In January, Evans gave up the Ward 2 seat he held for 29 years, as his colleagues prepared to expel him for repeated ethics violations involving his private consulting work for businesses with interests before city government.
Just 10 days later, he filed to reclaim the seat in the June primary and in the special election to complete his term. He faces seven Democrats and a Republican.
 On Wednesday, Evans gave his first interviews to news outlets since resigning. He told DCist, ""A week ago people thought Joe Biden was dead in the water, so I mean, politics is a funny business, you know?""
He declined to speak with The Washington Post.
Evans skipped a candidate forum hosted by the Sierra Club in February, has not promoted his campaign on social media and did not make his traditional appearance at a popular Groundhog Day event - where critics displayed a large sign denouncing him as corrupt. 
""A damaged politician going into the election wants there to be as little news as possible because it reminds people you are embattled,"" said Chuck Thies, a political operative who has informally advised Evans.
Instead, Evans and supporters who remain loyal have been working to collect signatures and small donations under the city's new public financing program, according to interviews with activists in Ward 2, operatives and Evans's rivals. Evans personally collected signatures outside grocery stores, civic association meetings and farmers markets, and by going door-to-door, according to multiple people who have spotted him.
Leroy Thorpe, a Shaw community activist close to Evans who volunteered to collect signatures, said he saw a racial divide in support for the lawmaker's comeback bid. 
""Couple of whites were a little angry, and some said they would support him but didn't want to sign,"" Thorpe said. ""Black people have no problem signing.""
That lines up with a poll conducted by The Post in November before Evans resigned. It found that most voters disapproved of Evans, but black residents were more willing to be forgiving. 
MaryEva Candon, a longtime Democratic activist and friend of Evans's, said he will focus on asking voters for forgiveness and reminding them of his accomplishments - including securing money for parks and helping to pull the city back from the brink of bankruptcy. 
""Even people who don't intend to vote for him don't deny all his accomplishments for the ward,"" Candon said. ""He's going to talk to people and say that he made a mistake and 'Please, I hope you can trust me again.' ""
In a Feb. 7 fundraising letter obtained by The Post, Evans asked supporters for a second chance.
""I recognize that I have personally tarnished my legacy of public service,"" Evans wrote. ""I also recognize that D.C. residents are a generous and redemptive citizenry and extend second chances. . . . I would greatly appreciate an opportunity to redeem myself in the eyes of the voters and my colleagues on the D.C. Council, and make amends for my mistakes."" 
Yvette M. Alexander, a former council member, is not in a mood to be forgiving. She said that Evans called her to ask for a donation but that she declined. 
""The friend in me most certainly would give. But the council member in me would be a little torn,"" Alexander said. ""Not that we don't like Jack and appreciate his service, but what are the consequences for what you did?""
Evans has also lost longtime supporters in the D.C. business and LGBTQ communities.
The Gay and Lesbian Activist Alliance declined to include him while scoring candidates, citing his ethics troubles despite his longtime support for LGBTQ rights. Lobbyist David Julyan encouraged executives and fellow lawyers to back Patrick Kennedy, a 28-year-old neighborhood commissioner from Foggy Bottom who chaired Evans's 2016 campaign but now is running against him - and to his left. 
Evans ""continues to be a friend, but he is not going to return to the council and supporting his effort will bring confusion and likely ensure a far-uber progressive will take the seat,"" Julyan wrote in a Feb. 18 email to business advocates obtained by The Post and first reported by the D.C. Line. 
David Catania, a former council member who lobbies for business interests, held a fundraiser and meet-and-greet for Kennedy at his lobbying offices Tuesday morning. 
""The business community, like everybody else, is done with Jack,"" Kennedy said. ""I have support from people who are democratic socialists, who are in the business community and LGBTQ community, and education activists."" 
Evans is to appear with his primary opponents for the first time at a forum Thursday evening at Foundry United Methodist Church, which he has attended for years.
With three months until primary day, he also faces the prospect of new developments in the various ethics scandals surrounding him. 
Federal authorities who have issued subpoenas related to Evans and searched his home have not charged him with a crime, but they have not said whether the case is closed. The city ethics board has reactivated a case against Evans that was halted because of the federal probe. 
Tom Lindenfeld, a political strategist in the District, said D.C. voters are willing to be forgiving - but perhaps not so quickly.
He cited the example of Marion Barry, who failed to win a 1990 council election after his conviction on drug charges but returned to the mayor's office and the council after his release from prison. 
""There's a cooling-off period that's necessary,"" said Lindenfeld, who himself returned to mainstream politics after pleading guilty to a political corruption charge in 2014. ""Even Marion tried it too early and lost, and that's somebody who people thought was unbeatable.""

Senate lowering bar for presidents' permissible conduct, historians say

The evidence of President Trump's actions to pressure Ukraine was never in serious dispute. After a systematic presentation of the facts of the case, even some Senate Republicans concluded that what he did was wrong.
But neither was the verdict of Trump's impeachment trial ever in doubt. The Senate's jurors are scheduled to etch an almost-certain acquittal into the historical record on Wednesday.
The impending judgment that the president's actions do not warrant his removal from office serves as a testament to Washington's extraordinary partisan divide and to Trump's uncontested hold on the Republican base. The expected acquittal also has profound and long-term ramifications for America's institutions and the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches, according to numerous historians and legal experts.
In effect, they say, the Senate is lowering the bar for permissible conduct for future presidents.

'It's a dispiriting moment for an American system that in many ways was founded on the insight that, because humankind is frail and fallen and fallible, no one branch of government can have too much power,' said Jon Meacham, an American historian and author. 'The president's party, instead of being a check on an individual's impulses and ambitions, has become an instrument of them.'
Since the moment House Democrats opened their impeachment inquiry in September, Trump has projected a sense of persecution and self-pity. He called the effort a coup to overthrow him and defraud the results of the 2016 election.
Again and again, Trump proclaimed on Twitter, 'READ THE TRANSCRIPT!' "" though the notes from his July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky did not seem to exonerate him. Rather, the notes made plain Trump's scheme to get Ukraine to open an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden.
With Trump commanding such exceptionally high approval ratings among Republican voters, however, even senators who acknowledged his actions were wrong voted Friday to block new evidence in the trial and pave the way for acquittal.

One of Democrats' great hopes to permit fresh testimony from firsthand witnesses, including former national security adviser John Bolton, had been Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), a self-described institutionalist who is retiring and would not have to face the wrath of the GOP's pro-Trump base.
But Alexander demurred. Although he said Trump's actions were 'inappropriate' and had 'already been proven' by House impeachment managers, the senator said that there was 'no need for more evidence' and that he believed Trump's conduct did not meet the Constitution's standard of 'treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors' for an impeachable offense.
'Let the people decide,' Alexander said in a lengthy statement Thursday explaining his position.
Another Republican seen as a possible supporter for permitting witness testimony, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, also came down against doing so. Although she did not comment specifically on Trump's actions with Ukraine, she faulted the overall impeachment process as too partisan and unfair.
'I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything,' Murkowski said in a statement. 'It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed.'
Only two Republicans "" Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine "" voted to allow additional testimony, two votes shy of the threshold required for the measure to pass. And with the final impeachment vote requiring a two-thirds majority to convict the president, the outcome seems preordained.
'This impeachment was a fait accompli at all times,' said Bill Whalen, a fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford University. 'You talk to congressional Republicans and there's a feeling that the president is being persecuted, that impeachment was a conviction in search of a crime.'
William A. Galston, chair of the Brookings Institution's Governance Studies Program, said acquittal 'was not only perfectly predictable, but in my judgment, completely inevitable.'
'The United States political scene is as deeply polarized along partisan lines as it has been for at least a century,' Galston added. Noting Trump's high ratings among Republican voters, he said, 'It would take a very brave Republican indeed to break ranks with the president under these circumstances.'

This is not the first instance in which Trump has skirted penalties for wielding the powers of his office for personal or political gain. Former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III found that the president repeatedly worked to block or thwart the Russia investigation, acts that could potentially have prompted obstruction of justice charges were he not a sitting president.
But Trump sidestepped any serious penalties then, just as he appears to now with Ukraine.
One of the president's lawyers, Alan Dershowitz, proffered a sweeping argument on the floor of the Senate last week that Trump using the powers of his office to pressure Ukraine to open a corruption investigation into the Bidens was not impeachable or illegal because it was done in pursuit of his reelection.
'If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment,' Dershowitz said during the trial.
In the face of stinging criticism from constitutional scholars and legal experts, Dershowitz said later on Twitter that his comments were being mischaracterized. 'A president seeking re-election cannot do anything he wants,' Dershowitz wrote. 'He is not above the law.'

Still, Dershowitz's argument was persuasive for some Republican senators looking for arguments with which to defend Trump irrespective of what the evidence showed.
'Let's say it's true, okay? Dershowitz last night explained that if you're looking at it from a constitutional point of view, that that is not something that is impeachable,' Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) told reporters.
Timothy Naftali, a historian at New York University and former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum, said the arguments advanced on Trump's behalf in the Senate trial could have lasting consequences for the future of presidential power.
'The Republicans have embraced a theory that permits future abuses of power,' Naftali said. 'The outcome of acquittal was predictable . . . but I'm afraid that this process in the Senate is more enabling of an abusive president than expected.'
The nation's founders gave Congress oversight responsibilities and powers of impeachment as a check on the executive. Yet, with this week's likely acquittal of Trump, Meacham argues, the Senate instead has become a tool in the president's perpetuation of his own power.
'It is not hyperbolic to say that the Republican Party treats Donald Trump more like a king than a president,' Meacham said. 'That was a central and consuming anxiety of the framers. It is a remarkable thing to watch the party of Lincoln and Eisenhower and Reagan and the Bushes become an instrument of Donald Trump's. That's a massive historical story.'

The Senate voted to bar new evidence in the impeachment trial Friday, paving the way for President Trump's acquittal even as several top Republicans acknowledged that his actions toward Ukraine were not appropriate.
Eleven days into the trial, the highly anticipated vote, which was decided 51 to 49, revealed the partisan divisions in the chamber over whether to subpoena witnesses and documents, a step Democrats argued was crucial to weighing whether Trump abused his power in pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations of his political rivals. Among Republicans, only Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Mitt Romney (Utah) supported the resolution. 
In declining to add to the case presented by House Democrats, the Senate delivered a victory for the White House that all but guaranteed that Trump will remain in office. With a final vote on the articles of impeachment set for Wednesday at 4-p.m., Democrats argued that Trump's expected acquittal will be illegitimate, an acknowledgment of their looming defeat.
'If [a] judge or president believes that it is to his or her advantage that there shall be a trial with no witnesses, they will cite the case of Donald Trump,' said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), one of the House impeachment managers. 'They will make the argument that you can adjudicate the guilt or innocence of the party without hearing from a single witness, without reviewing a single document. . . . I would submit that will be a very dangerous and long-lasting precedent that we will all have to live with.'
Soon the questions surrounding Trump's actions toward Ukraine will move from the Senate floor to the campaign trail, where voters instead of lawmakers will weigh the evidence in the heat of the 2020 presidential election. 
House Democrats have promised to continue investigating Trump, and new, potentially damaging information could emerge as it has at times during the trial from an indicted former associate of Trump's personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani and a forthcoming book by John Bolton, the former national security adviser.
But on Friday, Senate Republicans said they had finished weighing the matter "" united in their decision to move on, even if members offered varying and at times conflicting reasons for their impending votes to acquit.
Trump is accused of withholding military aid and an Oval Office meeting to push Ukraine's leaders into announcing probes of Democrats, including former vice president Joe Biden, now a presidential candidate, and his son Hunter. The House impeached Trump in December on two counts "" abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. 
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) called the result of the trial 'one of the worst tragedies that the Senate has ever overcome.'
'Americans will know that this trial was not a real trial. It had no witnesses, no documents,' Schumer told reporters after the vote. 'It is a tragedy on a very large scale.'
As the Senate concluded its business for the weekend, Trump accused Democrats of 'scamming America.' 
The Senate approved a resolution setting up closing arguments Monday. Senators will have an opportunity to give speeches Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday about how they plan to vote. 
Postponing the final stage of the trial until next week will allow senators to have a full weekend and was a relief for many who have complained about long hours and uncomfortable conditions in the Senate chamber. 
But extending the timetable into next week also means the trial will collide with two other major events on the political calendar "" the Iowa caucuses on Monday, in which four Democratic senators are competing, and Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday night. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called Trump on Friday evening to brief him on the updated timetable, and the president signed off on it, according to an official familiar with the conversation. 
Trump left for Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, on Friday afternoon without taking questions from reporters.
The impeachment managers' effort to persuade Republicans to support calling witnesses was confirmed as a failure earlier in the day when pivotal swing vote Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said she would oppose the motion. 
In a sharply worded statement, Murkowski decried the impeachment process that started last fall in the House, while declining to weigh in on Trump's actions. 
'Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate,' Murkowski said. 'I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything. It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed.'
While Murkowski said her decision was based on her distaste for the process, other Republicans acknowledged to varying degrees that the president was culpable "" a shift in position for some that distanced them from the White House and served as an attempt to inoculate themselves if new incriminating details emerge.
Among the Republicans who argued Trump's behavior was wrong or problematic but not impeachable were Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.), Rob Portman (Ohio), Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.) and Lamar Alexander (Tenn.).
'Just because actions meet a standard of impeachment does not mean it is in the best interest of the country to remove a President from office,' Rubio wrote Friday in a Medium post. 
'I believe that some of the president's actions in this case . . . were wrong and inappropriate,' Portman said Friday in a statement. 'But I do not believe that the president's actions rise to the level of removing a duly-elected president from office.' 
Alexander told The Washington Post on Friday, after announcing the previous night that he would not support calling witnesses, that 'there's a difference between inappropriate conduct, which that clearly is, and treason, bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors. There's a big gap between this conduct and impeachable conduct.'
Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said he had hoped Alexander would have a 'Howard Baker moment,' referring to the Tennessee Republican senator who played a key role in ending Richard M. Nixon's presidency during Watergate and for whom Alexander was a protege.
'But it appears he will not,' Durbin said. 
Republicans staked out their positions as new revelations from Bolton's unpublished manuscript seemed to undercut key elements of Trump's defense. 
The New York Times reported Friday that Bolton writes in his forthcoming book that Trump told him in early May to call newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and ask him to meet with Giuliani, who was pushing for investigations into the Bidens and a widely contested theory that Ukraine worked with Democrats to undermine Trump during the 2016 election. 
The directive to Bolton was reportedly given during a meeting that included Giuliani, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, who has led Trump's defense on the Senate floor. If true, it would represent the earliest reported example of Trump's direct involvement in the pressure campaign against Ukraine. 
Trump denied the report in a statement, saying the meeting 'never happened.' 
But Schiff seized on it in making his argument for witnesses. 
'The facts will come out,' he said. 'They will continue to come out. And the question before you today is whether they will come out in time for you to make a complete and informed judgment as to the guilt or innocence of the president.'
Also citing Bolton's manuscript, the Times reported Sunday that in a conversation with Bolton in August, Trump directly tied his hold on $391-million of military aid to investigations into Democrats. 
New revelations have also come from Lev Parnas, the ex-Giuliani associate now facing campaign finance charges, who submitted a letter to McConnell on Friday offering to testify about his participation in an effort to oust former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and gather damaging information about Joe and Hunter Biden. 
The letter, written by Parnas's lawyers, stated that the efforts involved a large group of top Republican officials and operatives, including Vice President Pence, then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Attorney General William P. Barr, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.).
Parnas had disclosed much of the information included in the letter in recent media interviews. His claims have been disputed by various Republican leaders, including Pence and Barr.
Trump's former chief of staff, John F. Kelly, who said earlier in the week that he believed Bolton, called the Senate trial 'half a trial' if no witnesses are called. 
'In my view, they kind of leave themselves open to a lot of criticism,' Kelly said in an interview with N.J. Advance Media. 'It's a job only half done. You open yourself up forever as a Senate that shirks its responsibilities.'
As Friday night drew to a close, it appeared Trump would deliver his State of the Union address before his expected acquittal, a small messaging coup for Democrats that was played down by the White House. 
'The president is gratified that finally, at long last, after multiple delays, the Senate will set a schedule for his acquittal next week,' said White House director of legislative affairs Eric Ueland. 'We do not believe the schedule interferes with his ability to deliver a strong and confident State of the Union message next week in the House of Representatives to the country.'

DES MOINES "" Jane Bloodworth will attend her first Iowa caucus on Monday night, and like many Iowans, she has taken seriously the responsibility that goes with being among those who will cast the first votes of the 2020 election. In this campaign year, making a decision has been harder than ever, for her and for so many others in this state.
Never in recent years have there been so many Iowa voters who are either undecided or who say they could change their minds before Monday night, whether activists or sometime caucus attendees. Iowans are weighing head versus heart, ideology versus electability, issues versus character and experience. It has kept everyone on edge on the eve of the caucuses.
Some of these undecided voters may forgo the caucuses on Monday night, willing to let others winnow the field further and prepared to support the eventual nominee against President Trump in November. Others will enter still trying to decide which candidate they should get behind, and some of those will try to read the room as the caucus process unfolds, looking for the best way to make a mark. Should they go for a front-runner or throw their support behind someone who needs some help to gain a delegate? 
Among half a dozen or so Iowans who identified as undecided in early January, most, like Bloodworth, know what they plan to do "" but in some cases only after agonizing over the choice.
On the first weekend in January, Bloodworth was one of the thousands and thousands of Iowans who were still making up their minds. On that Saturday, she was at an event for Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in the town of Manchester, population 5,200. 

She was looking for a candidate who could address the two biggest issues of concern to her: climate change and 'the issue of people left behind' and struggling to have a full life with economic security. She can see in her own family, she said, the economic strains that many middle- and working-class families face today.
'I'm fine,' said Bloodworth, 70, who moved to Iowa in the summer of 2018 after 15 years at the World Bank in Washington. 'I'll get through this, but I worry about those who come after us. The gap [between the rich and the middle class] is bigger than ever.'
Warren was not the only candidate she was looking at. Over months, she went to events featuring Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), former vice president Joe Biden, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), businessman Tom Steyer and entrepreneur Andrew Yang. She went once to see John Delaney, the former Maryland congressman who quit the race last week. 
'I had a pretty good sampling of all of them,' she said on Sunday morning. As she spoke, Bloodworth was in her car, heading to spend the day as an extra in a movie about girls six-on-six basketball. 

Though she started the year undecided, by Sunday, she was a decided voter "" or at least a mostly decided voter. 'I think I'm going to go for Warren,' she said. 'I like her ideas. I like her platform. I love her enthusiasm and I feel like she's got the history to get things accomplished.'
Bloodworth considers herself a conservative liberal and was drawn to the ideas of both Warren and Sanders. But Sanders's demeanor left her with reservations, particularly how he handled the dust-up with Warren over whether a woman could be elected president. 'The way he responded to that, to me, was, well . . . like an angry old man,' she said.
She thought Buttigieg has good ideas but lacks the experience needed to get things done in Washington. As for Biden, she said, 'He brings experience and has done all kinds of things, but I don't know that what we need is more of the Obama era, which he seems to talk about a lot. And Obama's not going to be there. He would have to do it on his own.'
Joyce Steffen, 70, who lives in Cedar Rapids and works in real estate, began the year undecided. As the campaign unfolded over the past year, she looked seriously at Biden and Warren before settling on Klobuchar in the past few days. 'I think it's because I decided to go with what's in my heart,' she said. 
Steffen said she believes Klobuchar can beat Trump, that she has been consistent and has more experience than some others, like Buttigieg. She said that Warren's liberal policies worried her, as did Biden's age. 'It would it have been better the last time,' she said, referring to Biden's decision not to run for president in 2016. 
Deb Tunwall, 52, of Cedar Rapids, has been thinking about what candidate could win over her husband, who has voted Republican in the past and whom she hopes to persuade to vote for the Democrat in this election year. They are considering Klobuchar and Yang. She is drawn more to Klobuchar but her husband finds Yang's ideas appealing.
'Amy I feel like can just walk in there on day one,' she said. 'I feel like she can definitely reach across the aisle. I feel like she's less polarizing than Elizabeth Warren. I feel Amy doesn't have that polarization, that she could gather a lot of moderates. My husband is my litmus test.'

She worries about Biden being strong enough to take on Trump. 'I do feel he had his time,' she said. 'The Obama supporters who voted for Trump did so because they didn't want to go back to the Obama era.' 
Tunwall raised another concern about the former vice president: that Trump will pummel him over Ukraine, despite the fact that many of Trump's claims have been debunked, the same way candidate Trump attacked Hillary Clinton over emails in 2016 "" 'a repeat of 'lock her up,' ' she said.
Asked whether she would support the Democratic nominee, whoever it is, she replied, 'Absolutely. I'm just worried my husband won't.'
Bob and Jo Rod, both 88, live in Ames. Both had supported Sanders 'big time' four years ago. 'We worked really hard for him,' she said. This time around, they see Sanders as too old, and they plan to caucus for Buttigieg, the youngest candidate in the field. Their decision came on Friday and only after 'a real struggle.'
Warren has been a favorite of theirs for some years. They attended an event for her when she was running for Senate, and 'she blew us away.' But Buttigieg's vigor and intellect ultimately led them to him. 'I like his energy and his ideas,' she said. 'He can talk off the top of his head very quickly and answers questions well.'
Sanders, who got nearly half the vote here four years ago, has lost some of those supporters, like the Rods. But of all the candidates, his loyalists might be the most committed, which is why other campaigns worry that he could turn out the most people on Monday, although the turnout battle will rage all through the day.
Margaret Damge, 72, a retired farmer who also worked for a phone company, came to see Biden in Independence the first weekend of the new year. Then, she said, she was undecided. This weekend, she settled on the former vice president. 'He's pretty consistent,' she said. 'He doesn't flip-flop, and he doesn't promise more than he's going to deliver. He's got a record.'
But Damge said she won't be able to caucus for Biden on Monday, as she is in Florida. 'I've done it every year,' she said. 'I'm going to the beach.' Asked what her absence might mean for her candidate, she laughed. 'I think Biden's going to do just fine. People are going to be saying, 'Who can beat that orange-faced guy?' '

Move by Va. former governor, DNC chair could show establishment support
The campaign of former vice president Joe Biden is making plans to recast him as the clear favorite of party leaders after his expected win Saturday in South Carolina, hoping to create momentum that will allow him to outperform moderate rivals on Super Tuesday and position him as the only viable alternative to Sen. Bernie Sanders. 
A major focus of the effort is securing endorsements from prominent Democratic figures before Tuesday, when 14 states cast their primary votes. Former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe has told associates he may endorse Biden on Sunday if Biden can pull off a strong first-place finish Saturday, according to a person familiar with McAuliffe's thinking. 
McAuliffe would join Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and former defense secretary and California congressman Leon Panetta. Both announced their support of Biden on Friday, hoping to give him a boost since Virginia and California both hold primaries March 3, also called Super Tuesday.
Their endorsements came shortly after that of Rep. James E. Clyburn, the most powerful Democrat in South Carolina, who announced Wednesday he was backing Biden. A person familiar with the Biden campaign's thinking said officials expect to see a stream of endorsements if Biden performs well in South Carolina.
The campaign's hope is to create the clear sense for voters that Biden is the consensus alternative among party leaders to Sanders (I-Vt.), a democratic socialist who some party leaders believe would have a narrower electoral college path against President Trump, potentially putting the Democratic House majority at risk and making it harder to recapture the Senate. 
""We're at an inflection point in this race and, as Joe Biden has said, he's not a socialist or a plutocrat - he's a Democrat,"" said Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman. ""The vice president's in very good company in that respect, and the stakes of beating Donald Trump in crucial battleground states are drawing them off the sidelines.""
A second Biden adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the campaign hopes the South Carolina result will mark a clear pivot in the race.
""We anticipate and hope to see momentum coming out of South Carolina, not just because we win, which we hope we will, but because we've put a damper on Bernie's momentum,"" that person said. ""No other candidate has shown an ability to put a stop on his momentum.""
There is little evidence that voters take their cues from the preferences of party elders. Rather, the Biden campaign's goal is to generate a sense of momentum and end a stretch of the campaign that has seen Sanders take a clear lead in the nomination fight, winning or coming close in the first three contests, while the party's centrists have been unable to rally around a single alternative.
Even if Biden prevails in South Carolina, however, he probably would struggle to catch up to Sanders. The senator from Vermont is polling strongly in many Super Tuesday states, including the big prize of California, forcing any would-be competitor to play catch-up. 
At a recent retreat for Senate Democrats in Baltimore, one participant described the mood as ""like a funeral"" because of concerns that Sanders is headed to the nomination. That person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions, said the broad expectation was that Biden would try to cast himself as the only person who could stop Trump's reelection if he wins big on Saturday. 
The other Democratic candidates are also preparing strategies to frame the South Carolina results, given the stakes the following Tuesday, when 34 percent of the party's convention delegates will be awarded. 
Sanders's campaign released a memo Friday describing him as ""by far - the candidate who is best positioned to defeat Donald Trump in the general election."" The memo appeared aimed at making the case that even if Sanders does not win Saturday, he remains the Democrats' best choice.
Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, whose steady rise in public polls has stalled since a disappointing debate performance in Nevada, said in an interview with MSNBC that he is committed to staying in the race ""as long as I have a chance."" 
""Yeah, I'm running a race, and I'm behind with one lap to go. What, am I going to quit? No, you run harder,"" Bloomberg said. 
Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have been boosted by significant recent television advertising investments on their behalf by supportive super PACs, which can take unlimited donations but do not coordinate directly with the campaigns. A separate group backing Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) is spending money in key states such as Colorado. 
The Biden campaign has bought $2.2 million in broadcast and digital advertising across the Super Tuesday states, according to the campaign's data. The tracking firm Advertising Analytics reports that overall, Democrats have spent $247 million in advertising in the Super Tuesday states, driven by a massive investment by Bloomberg. 
After leading national polls for a year, Biden notched deeply disappointing performances in the first two contests, finishing fourth in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire.
But after the Clyburn endorsement and a second-place finish in Nevada, Biden is now favored to win South Carolina, according to recent polls, although the size of his expected victory remains uncertain. His margin of victory will be a factor in McAuliffe's decision, said the person familiar with his thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. 
A Biden campaign spokesman declined to comment on McAuliffe, while a McAuliffe spokesman said the former governor ""has not made a decision on an endorsement.""
McAuliffe is an influential figure among Democratic leaders, and in some ways, he embodies the party establishment. McAuliffe chaired the Democratic National Committee and has close ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, holding top positions with their presidential campaigns. He also contemplated a presidential run himself this year.
He has been neutral in the race so far, although he held a fundraiser in November for Biden at his home in McLean. About 115 guests stood around McAuliffe's pool as the former governor described how Biden had helped Virginia as vice president, securing grants for the state and fighting to clean the Shenandoah River. 
""We've got to get America back to where people get along, where we have alliances around the world and everybody loves the United States of America,"" McAuliffe said, adding that Trump's ""insanity"" had led the country ""off the rails."" 
McAuliffe's wife, Dorothy, is backing Biden and is kicking off a get-out-the-vote event Saturday in Alexandria. At the November fundraiser she called Biden ""a great man,"" a ""great public servant"" and the Democrat who has ""the best chance of beating Donald Trump.""
Biden is scheduled to attend a rally at Booker T. Washington High School in Norfolk on Sunday evening, which could provide a platform for a McAuliffe announcement.

The Tyrannosaurus rex emerges from the men's room and almost runs smack into Michelle Kwan. It's just another morning in Manchester on the weekend before the New Hampshire primary. Kwan, the former figure-skating champion, is here at the aptly named Rex Theater to stump for former vice president Joe Biden; the T. rex "" or to give his full name, 'Rx T. Rex' "" is here to stomp for AARP, against the outrageous cost of prescription drugs.
Inside the T. rex is a 24-year-old named Adrian Ramos, who, because his field of vision is limited, does not realize he almost collided with Kwan. His job is to get outside to work the line of voters waiting to enter the event. Ordinarily, Rex would go roaring up and down beside them wearing a red T-shirt that says 'Stop Rx Greed,' but it's freezing this morning and the sidewalk outside the theater is narrow and icy, so Rex moves gingerly, escorted by a pair of AARP staffers. He bends low for selfies, gives high-fives and poses for photographers, most often in a stance that resembles Usain Bolt's trademark lightning-bolt pose, if Usain Bolt had tiny, stumpy arms.
'I give a roar, and Todd provides a subtitle,' Ramos explained to me when we met up the day before. He was referring to Todd Fahey, AARP's New Hampshire state director, who accompanies the T. rex on his outings as interpreter and guide, chanting slogans and making sure Ramos doesn't get hit by a car. Fahey's subtitles don't vary much: 'Rex wants candidates to hold Big Pharma accountable!' he'll say. 'Lower the cost of prescription drugs!' It's all part of AARP's massive nationwide effort to hold candidates' feet to the fire over health care. AARP has deployed red-shirted volunteers to numerous candidate town halls and rallies, getting there early to make sure they're down in front when Q-As start. And at the tip of the spear "" or claw "" is seven wobbly feet of dinosaur. On Oct. 30, in a coordinated show of force, red-shirted T. rexes appeared outside statehouses in all 50 states.
AARP hired Ramos in August as a temporary contractor to work through the end of the New Hampshire primary. His main job consists of social media, videography and photography, but he thoroughly enjoys playing AARP's saurian mascot, which he says he's done about 10 to 15 times. 'It's about putting yourself aside and letting people interact with the symbol,' he says of his approach to portraying Rx T. Rex. In adopting this strategy, he didn't have much choice; he can barely see or hear in there, and the state's sharp wind gusts can turn the head into a windsock, blinding him entirely. Often, he listens to music with one ear bud, which helps him focus and stay calm. 'I'm an introvert at heart,' he said earlier in the bathroom as he zipped up the suit, which began to inflate thanks to a small battery-operated fan at his waist. Getting into costume is a production; often when he arrives at a venue, he has to change in the bathroom ('like Superman,' he jokes). But AARP's vast army of volunteers loves him, and so "" this part is crucial "" do press photographers. That's what he's there for. AARP is quite serious about its campaign to lower drug prices and safeguard Medicare, which is why it has resorted to the patently absurd. Rx T. Rex's purpose is simple, says Fahey: 'Cut through the noise.'
Yet that is easier said than done "" in part because there's a deafening amount of noise in American politics in 2020, and in part because Rx T. Rex is far from the only costumed mascot roaming the land. This is an election year in America, which means that in states with early presidential primaries like New Hampshire and South Carolina "" or with hotly contested Senate races like Maine "" moose, chickens and polar bears have started to appear outside union halls, high school gyms and truck stops, clutching signs that read: 'Stop Hiding Trump's Taxes' and 'Fossil Fuels = Climate Crisis = Extinction.'
Whether feathered or furred, all of these animals belong to the same political species: the bird-dogger. Bird-dogging is an ancient art in itself: The term refers to a dog sent by hunters to charge into the brush and flush concealed birds into the open, where they can be shot. Political bird-doggers are people who have been dispatched by advocacy groups and rival campaigns to raise specific issues at public events. Among this broad group of troublemakers are a subset who dress as mascots for the purpose of challenging, flustering or somehow embarrassing politicians. Over the years, the bobble-headed antics of these bird-doggers have become as much a part of the American political circus as corn dogs at the Iowa State Fair.
To keep pace with the competition for America's eyeballs, the costumes of bird-doggers have been getting increasingly baroque. In 2015, the group NextGen America, founded by 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer, towed an inflatable iceberg behind a speedboat on New Hampshire's Lake Winnipesaukee. Two staffers in moose costumes clung to the iceberg as they floated alongside a dinner cruise, which was slated to host, among others, presidential hopeful Scott Walker. (The moose, according to Brian Rogers, NextGen's New Hampshire state director, fell in the water multiple times as the ship's passengers screamed things like, 'I hope you drown!') In January, the Republican National Committee in New Hampshire trotted out beds and volunteers in sleep masks and nightcaps at Biden events, with signs saying 'Sleepy Joe' "" President Trump's insulting nickname for the candidate. The Committee to Defend the President (formerly Stop Hillary PAC) has crafted a giant box of 'Biden Corn Pops,' in reference to Biden's claim that, in the '60s, he confronted a Delaware gang leader named Corn Pop. Recent years have brought forth Big Birds, Miss Piggies, tires, handmaids, giant EpiPens, mariachi bands, the Monopoly man and, in one case in April, someone dressed as Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg whipping Jesus Christ while Satan looked on, appalled.
But animal costumes remain the most popular because they are versatile, relatively cheap and, for those Iowa and New Hampshire winters, toasty. Temperatures were subzero the night of the recent Democratic debate in Manchester, but a jarringly realistic polar bear from the Center for Biological Diversity, an advocacy group working to protect endangered species, stayed very warm "" 'too warm,' argued the polar bear, who was there to press candidates to discuss climate change, 'because our planet is melting.' NextGen's Iowa state director, Murphy Burke, keeps a pig costume in the trunk of her car so she is always prepared to protest Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa), who is up for reelection. (The group also has billboards with King's face that read: 'The only pig from Iowa who doesn't make us proud,' a reference to the congressman's racist comments.)
And this is only the beginning. The 2020 general election is shaping up to be a historic war for voters' attention, and on the front lines there will, inevitably, be somebody dressed as swine.


Candidates have learned to be leery of ludicrously costumed interlopers ever since 'Chicken George.' In 1992, Bill Clinton's campaign sent volunteers dressed as giant chickens to then-President George H.W. Bush's campaign stops, protesting Bush's initial reluctance to debate. Eventually, Bush began fighting back, going as far as releasing live ducks at a Clinton event, in reference to Clinton's having avoided the draft during the Vietnam War. But the sitting president made an unforced error when he engaged one of the chickens, a move that elevated the stunt beyond Democratic hopes. The media said the president 'snapped' at the bird and that he was 'rattled.' Eli Attie, a writer and former aide to Al Gore who based an episode of 'The West Wing' on the incident, sums up Bush's mistake: 'You can't win an argument with a chicken.'
Hillary Clinton was slightly savvier when she welcomed a giant orange squirrel in 2014, but even then, the interaction still brought joy to Republican hearts. The former secretary of state was on a highly publicized tour promoting her memoir, 'Hard Choices.' She hadn't yet announced her 2016 presidential bid, but everyone knew she was running. The Republican National Committee had come up with a slogan: 'Another Clinton in the White House is nuts.' T-shirts were made. Then, according to Sean Spicer, who was the RNC's communications director at the time, they realized that 'in the storage area … was a giant squirrel' left over from 2008 efforts to attack the voter-registration group ACORN.
Spicer, who later served as Trump's first White House press secretary, tells me he considers himself a devotee of stunts 'that can drive messages without having to have a big budget, because in politics, you don't have a budget.' (Spicer himself has never worn a costume on the campaign trail, although he has dressed up as the Easter Bunny at the White House Easter Egg Roll.) A summer intern named Justin Giorgio was tapped for squirrel duty. 'There were only two or three other people who were tall enough to wear it,' Giorgio recalls. 'I was more or less volunteered by the other interns.' For two weekends, Giorgio's job was to haunt Clinton outside her events, mostly walking up and down the line of people waiting to get inside. 'I'd get in costume at RNC headquarters, then get in the Uber,' holding the heavily padded orange head in his lap. But it was mid-June in Washington, when the sun is like a hammer on an anvil. The squirrel costume was suffocating, and the head offered little range of vision. 'It was like 95 degrees, super humid. I had other interns and a staffer with me, and their job was basically to make sure I didn't walk into traffic, and hand me water bottles. I'm pretty sure that week I lost 15 pounds. ... I was just pouring sweat in that costume.'
But the squirrel was a triumph. 'We got ABC News to do an entire evening segment on the f---ing squirrel,' Spicer says. The media had taken the bait. And then, a few days later, Clinton did too. Giorgio was outside an event, perspiring. Clinton's limo rounded the corner. But instead of passing him, the car pulled over and Clinton stepped out. Giorgio had 'a moment of panic' because, he says, 'I'm a 21-year-old kid ... never have I ever encountered a former secretary of state or former first lady, so I don't know how to act. And I'm in an orange squirrel costume.'
Spicer succinctly describes what happened next: 'Hillary walks over to the f---ing squirrel and hands him a signed copy of her book.' It was inscribed: 'Squirrel "" Please make a hard choice and read my book. "" Hillary.' 'The Colbert Report' did a seven-minute segment on the squirrel. Host Stephen Colbert, in character, called it 'the best use of a mascot in politics since Stephen Douglas dressed up as a banana and said Lincoln was 'un-a-peel-ing.' ' Spicer concedes that from Clinton's standpoint, it made sense to show that 'you get the joke.' But from an operative's perspective, it was 'gold' to have a presidential candidate 'engaging with a furry squirrel.' For his part, Giorgio, who has since left politics, was genuinely shocked that Clinton was so pleasant to him. 'It's one of those moments where you realize that each candidate is a person, too, with a sense of humor,' he says. 'I would hope that she got a giggle out of it at least.'


Almost as important as picking the right costume is picking the right person to wear it. A good bird-dogger needs the kind of devotion required to sprint after a candidate in knee-deep snow while dressed like a moose, but they also need judgment. 'I don't pick the craziest person,' says Morgan Finkelstein, an associate director at the Center for American Progress and a veteran mascot dispatcher. 'I pick the person with self-control.'
Jon Favreau, former speechwriter for President Barack Obama and current co-host of 'Pod Save America,' was 20 or 21 and working as a press intern on Jeanne Shaheen's unsuccessful 2002 Senate campaign, when the Democratic National Committee wanted to protest the GOP's 'trash attacks' against her. 'So, they had me just walk out from behind a dumpster wearing a trash bag,' he recalls. 'It was unbelievable.' A local TV channel filmed a segment on it. Favreau's friends have tried doggedly to find the footage, especially before his wedding, but came up short.
Michael Zona was not as lucky: He wound up with a mug shot. In August 2014, Shaheen, who by then was running to be reelected to a Senate seat from New Hampshire, was in Londonderry, N.H., for the Old Home Day parade, and a 23-year-old Zona was there waiting for her in a bright yellow chicken suit. The RNC had sent him to draw attention to Shaheen's failure to hold town hall meetings. Shaheen was marching with Gov. Maggie Hassan when Zona stepped out from the crowd and made straight for them, yelling and flapping. Police felt he got a little too close "" he had been cautioned already "" and arrested him for disorderly conduct. The police report notes that he was contrite and 'elected to remove his chicken costume' before being placed in handcuffs.
The charges were eventually dismissed. Not only did the RNC offer a robust defense of Zona, so did the New Hampshire ACLU. Zona's reputation was also made. He received two promotions over the next year, and, three years later, at 26, he was named the communications director for a GOP senator, a job he still holds. In fact, a lesser-known side effect of bird-dogging is what it does for the careers of young, ambitious staffers. 'A lot of political leaders today would be very angry with me if I revealed to you the various costumes that they wore when they were young organizers,' says Ray Buckley, the long-tenured chair of the New Hampshire Democratic Party. He calls getting into costume 'a rite of passage.'
This rite of passage isn't limited to the United States, either. In the United Kingdom, the Daily Mirror, a left-leaning tabloid, has frequently set loose a staffer in a very elaborate chicken suit to pester Tory politicians it deems to be dodging them. In 2010, a Mirror staffer named Lee Cain put on the suit to taunt then-Prime Minister David Cameron. The Mirror reported that Cain 'attacked the role with real zeal and passion.' Today, Cain "" having evidently had a change of political heart "" is the director of communications for Prime Minister Boris Johnson.


Some instances of bird-dogging are the result of meticulous, long-term planning. Others take shape, literally, overnight. On a frigid evening in February 2016, Eddie Vale and Kevin McAlister, strategists for the liberal political action committee American Bridge 21st Century, were holed up in a hotel room outside the Manchester airport, drinking beer and watching the last Republican debate before the New Hampshire primary. They watched as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), whom Vale had considered to be a grave potential threat to Clinton, said, 'Let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that Barack Obama doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing.'
Then, they watched him say versions of those lines again and again. After the third time, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie attacked: 'There it is!' he crowed. 'The memorized 25-second speech.' It was the kind of moment that can cripple a candidacy, but still Rubio couldn't stop himself. As if programmed, he uttered the cursed phrase one final time.
The next morning, Londonderry voters waiting to get into Rubio's town hall were greeted by Marco Roboto and the Rubio Talking Point 3000: McAlister and Vale in robot costumes slapped together with cardboard boxes and a Sharpie. Vale wore a stainless-steel colander on his head, with foil antennae sticking out.
'We just pulled it out of our a--,' says Vale. It wasn't supposed to be anything more than a finger in the eye of the Rubio campaign. Mostly they hoped to take advantage of the fact that after months of tailing a candidate, political reporters tend to be pretty bored. Top-tier campaigns are often rigorously scripted and stage-managed. The 'Groundhog Day'-like monotony combined with a 24-hour news cycle means that if something 'new and stupid,' as Vale puts it, happens on the trail, the media seize upon it.
Thus, when Marco Roboto and the RTP3000 pulled up at Londonderry High School, jumped out of the car and started sprinting across the parking lot in colander and cardboard "" like, Vale says, 'the world's stupidest SWAT team' "" reporters pricked up their ears. So did Rubio's advance team. Even though the robots had American Bridge's web address written on them, a Rubio staffer raced out with a large sign that read: 'Another desperate attack by Jeb Bush.'
Seeing that Rubio's staff was annoyed, McAlister and Vale kept the gag going. They followed Rubio's bus to the next event, a polling place in Manchester, where robotic reinforcements showed up unprompted: Aaron Black from the liberal group Americans United for Change arrived in a shiny fabric store-bought costume and a sign reading '#ROBOTRUBIO.' Black even got within a few feet of the senator, but this time, Rubio's supporters rose up against their robot tormentors. First, staff and volunteers began trying to physically block the robots from coming near the candidate, throwing large 'New Hampshire is Marco Rubio Country' signs in their way. Someone shoved Vale to the snowy ground, knocking off his colander. 'I was in a box and I couldn't really get up,' he remembers. Another person grabbed McAlister and tore off his cardboard boxes. Finally, just a few feet from the candidate, in full view of the press corps, a man put Black in a headlock and tried to haul him away. In videos, Black can be heard saying, 'Why do you have your hands on me? Look at all these cameras!'
By midday, the images were everywhere. Vale and McAlister kept it up for a few more days (and later, American Bridge sent more mascots "" the 'Absentee Manatees' "" to troll Rubio in Florida). 'It worked. The media had a heyday with it,' concedes a source familiar with Rubio's campaign who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
A few days later, at a stop in Nashua, Rubio repeated one sentence multiple times in a row, and the media narrative that he was just a programmed, glitching machine became inescapable. He finished a distant fifth in the primary. A month later, he ended his campaign. Vale still has the colander in his house.


Strategists are under no illusions that putting someone in a costume is going to change anyone's mind. Sending out mascots 'is not a persuasion campaign,' says Finkelstein. 'I don't think you're bird-dogging anyone to persuade them to do anything different.' Rather, the point is just to be there. To plant the flag for a candidate or a set of ideas. To get attention by making people laugh "" or at least smile.
And so, Rx T. Rex continues roaring across America, an absurd ambassador for a deadly serious message. Todd Fahey (who points out that AARP also uses poignant testimonials in its messaging strategy) understands the power of humor to cut through noise: 'If you can concentrate your message in one iconic, if absurd creature that has come back from prehistoric times, if it works, and if it's potent, and if it brings about change, absurd or not, it's worthwhile.'
All of which might make bird-dogging seem like an odd fit for politics in 2020: a time when politics feels anything but fun or whimsical. 'This campaign is horrendous,' says Jim Cole, who was for 35 years the Associated Press photographer in New Hampshire, and is glad to have retired this year. Where once candidates spent time on the trail doing silly stunts "" Bill Clinton calling bingo, Gary Hart throwing an ax "" Cole says that, now, 'all they're doing is going to large function rooms with a microphone. That's it.'
Campaigns reflect the mood of voters, and the mood of voters today is grim. 'Part of the problem is, [costumes] aren't funny anymore,' says Finkelstein. 'It's sad and it's scary out there. So what am I supposed to do, have someone [dressed as] a fake missile? That's not funny, that's f---ing terrifying.' In an atmosphere like this, a campaign that resorts to humor or stunts to get attention risks being accused of frivolity.
Yet it doesn't have to be this way. We may have forgotten this in our current circumstances, but presidential campaigns are inherently ridiculous. Organizationally, they most closely resemble a traveling circus. At heart, they consist of a single person, attended by a sleep-deprived, underpaid retinue of dozens, traveling the country imploring people to make them the most powerful person on earth. A healthy democratic politics would make room for occasional reminders of this fundamental absurdity.
That is why the people in mascot costumes matter. They aren't just there to harry candidates. They are there to signal that, as seriously as our politicians take themselves "" especially at a moment when the very future of democracy appears to be in peril "" those same politicians are also, at some level, deeply silly. To forget that would be a grave error "" because the alternative is seeing them as saviors. Right now, the stakes of this election may seem too high for stupid stunts. Which is exactly why, strange as it sounds, we need Rx T. Rex and his weird, whimsical cousins more than ever.

A day after another string of dominant victories that moved him closer to the Democratic presidential nomination, Joe Biden's campaign was working to reboot amid broad concerns within the party that his current operation is ill-equipped to match President Trump's behemoth reelection effort. 
Biden pulled off the most stunningly swift turnaround in modern political history with a relatively small staff, underwhelming fundraising and a campaign occasionally marked by dysfunction and turmoil.
After he finished fifth in New Hampshire just four weeks ago, there were questions about how his campaign could gracefully end. But Biden now has won at least 15 of the last 21 voting states, making him the candidate likeliest to face Trump in a highly polarized, extremely expensive general election. 
Biden's advisers are taking steps to expand virtually all parts of his shoestring campaign operation, from finance, field and communications departments to the senior leadership team, answering the concerns of senior Democrats who are bracing for a new wave of assaults from Trump. 
That effort will occur even as Biden continues to battle for delegates with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who announced Wednesday that he would stay in the race as he issued policy demands to Biden on issues like health care.
""We will be building out every team here,"" Biden senior adviser Anita Dunn said Wednesday, after making clear that the primary mission of the campaign remains acquiring enough delegates to win the nomination. She suggested that would be done at least in part by embracing aides to former candidates, many of whom have endorsed Biden in recent days. ""We are seeing an enormous amount of talent from people on other campaigns. We would hope that we would be able to have some of those people joining this campaign.""
Dunn took on new management and strategic responsibilities shortly before the New Hampshire primary. She is likely to shift out of some of that responsibility in the coming months, leaving open the possibility of changes at the top of the operation, according to a person familiar with the campaign's discussions who was not authorized to speak publicly.
In recent weeks, the campaign has relied on Jen O'Malley Dillon, the campaign manager for former congressman Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.), who helped Biden's team retool ahead of the Nevada caucuses and has offered strategic advice on a volunteer basis. No announcement has been made about her taking on a formal role.
At the same time that he tries to finish off Sanders and bulk up his campaign, Biden also is planning for a vice presidential selection process later this spring, following the recommendation of the Bipartisan Policy Center that any vetting begin at least two months before a nominating convention. 
Throughout the primary race, even some of Biden's top allies have been confounded by the struggles of his campaign operation and worried about this period, when the nomination is not yet secured but the incumbent president can aim his firepower at the leading opposing candidate. 
Several Democrats involved in the campaign had front-row seats in 2012 when President Barack Obama used a massive spring and summer advertising offensive to define his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, in swing states as a predatory businessman who was not in touch with the concerns of regular Americans.
Unlike Romney, Biden will be assisted by a constellation of outside Democratic groups, including Priorities USA and American Bridge, which announced this week a strategic decision to defend Biden this spring in key swing states, even though he has not yet locked up the nomination.
As it stands now, the campaign's senior leadership remains a kitchen cabinet of new and old advisers, a setup Biden has used throughout a political career that spans more than four decades. His former chief of staff, Steve Ricchetti, functions as campaign chairman; his longtime adviser Tom Donilon is the strategist; the candidate's sister Valerie Biden Owens is a close adviser; and the campaign apparatus is overseen by Dunn, a veteran of the Obama campaigns, and Greg Schultz, the campaign manager.
""He has a very loyal group around him, and that group gives him comfort, and that group is still going to be there,"" said David Axelrod, a former strategist for Obama who has worked closely with Dunn. ""But there has to be room for a more formal and developed campaign structure that does all the very complex blocking and tackling."" 
The new planning has been enabled by a windfall in campaign contributions and endorsements that have effectively put the bulk of the party apparatus at his disposal. The organizers for Unite the Country, the super PAC backing Biden, said they raised $10 million over the past 10 days and have $30 million in additional commitments. 
""The good news is, the entirety of the Democratic Party and the Democratic Party establishment is available to them and willing to help them,"" said one senior adviser to a onetime Biden rival, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations. ""The question is, can they retool and bring in a second wave of talent and leadership?""
But the campaign's abilities continue to face criticism. Even as Biden won every county in Michigan this week, local Democrats voiced concern that his light footprint in the state foretold a fall repeat of 2016's disaster for Democrats, when Hillary Clinton counted Michigan as a safe bet for her campaign until it was too late. Biden also has only a scattered presence in three states that will vote next week and that his campaign says will play roles in the general election - Florida, Arizona and Ohio.
Donors who had been sitting on the sidelines or supporting other candidates have complained in recent weeks that they are unable to connect directly with Biden or top campaign officials, saying there are not enough finance directors to field the incoming requests. 
Millions of dollars in donor commitments have flowed to the campaign since Super Tuesday. Endorsements are coming so quickly that campaign officials are learning about some of them on Twitter. 
""This was a campaign that was running in a very lean fashion. It's great because it saved the money they needed. But now it's created kind of a logjam for people like me,"" said Alan Kessler, a longtime Biden donor and Democratic fundraiser. ""I'm not the only one getting these emails and calls. People are a little anxious."" 
Just this week, Rufus Gifford, who ran Obama's 2012 reelection finance operation, emailed hundreds of donors and fundraisers in his network to help the campaign counter Trump's fundraising machine and to help direct donations to the national and state Democratic parties.
""Now it's about building a long-term infrastructure, making sure the money continues to flow,"" Gifford said Wednesday. ""You have the recipe for a real success and a real coalition to pull the voters across the finish line. The campaign has got to scale [up]. You can't do this on a shoestring.""
As part of his march toward the nomination, Biden also is planning to offer Americans a fuller picture of how he might govern, part of his effort to draw a sharp contrast between his hypothetical tenure and Trump's polarizing and unorthodox politics. The aim is to convey the potential for renewed stability, an emphasis on competent governance and a restoration of American leadership around the globe.
""At this moment, there's so much fear in the country,"" he said in remarks Tuesday night that served as a template for his future pitch. ""There's so much fear across the world. We need presidential leadership that's honest, trustworthy, truthful and steady.""
On Thursday, during a speech from his hometown in Wilmington, Del., Biden is planning to address the coronavirus pandemic to provide a counterpoint to a White House that has downplayed the severity of the global crisis. 
Campaign leaders say they are not yet focused on planning for the early days of the administration, should Biden win the White House. But among a broader group of outside allies, conversations that were previously unthinkable have started quietly taking place, including when Biden may form a transition team and how he would craft an agenda to implement in the first 100 days of a presidency.
Biden himself has from time to time begun openly ruminating about a potential Cabinet - last week telling O'Rourke, seemingly off-the-cuff, that he could lead the effort on gun-control policy - and about finding a vice president who could be to him what he was to Obama. 
""For me, I think the most important thing in choosing a vice president is whether or not the person is simpatico with me,"" he told MSNBC on Monday. He stopped himself, to say it was presumptuous to talk about it. And then he continued to talk about it.
""We can disagree on tactic, but not on strategy,"" he said of a potential partnership. ""That's the first test - and there are a number of women, and African Americans as well, who meet that criteria for me.""
He is almost certain to pick a woman to be his running mate, according to allies in close contact with the campaign. During the MSNBC interview, Biden also said it was ""very important"" that his pick will have been tested on the presidential campaign stage, which could narrow his options. 
Those close to several of his former rivals - including Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) - said that no conversations have taken place. 
""It wouldn't shock me at all if he welcomes former rivals,"" said former senator Chris Dodd, who remains in close contact with Biden. ""He doesn't hold grudges. Biden's been around too long to understand that doesn't get you too far. His instincts would be to be inclusive.""
The overriding goal for now, however - one that has taken on new urgency amid the coronavirus scare and a tumbling stock market - is casting Biden as a president who could allow the country to exhale and worry less about what the government was doing.
""He's emerging as that stable figure that the country needs,"" said Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), a former presidential candidate who has backed Biden. ""It's not going to be the circuslike atmosphere that is happening right now.""

Senate Republicans on Sunday acknowledged that President Trump was wrong to pressure Ukraine for his own political benefit, even as they defended their decision to prohibit new evidence in his impeachment trial while pressing ahead with the president's all-but-certain acquittal.
The remarks from key Republicans "" including Sens. Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) and Joni Ernst (Iowa) "" came after the Trump administration revealed the existence of emails that could shed light on the president's reasons for withholding military aid to Ukraine.
'I'm going to vote to acquit,' Alexander said in an interview on NBC News's 'Meet the Press.' 'I'm very concerned about any action that we could take that would establish a perpetual impeachment in the House of Representatives whenever the House was a different party than the president. That would immobilize the Senate.'
One Republican senator, a close ally of Trump, suggested a sweeping GOP counterattack following Wednesday's vote to acquit the president.
'It's going to happen in the coming weeks,' Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) said of the counteroffensive in an interview on Fox News's 'Sunday Morning Futures.'
Graham outlined a plan that would include an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden, who is running for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, and a pursuit of the whistleblower whose account triggered the probe into Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine.
It was unclear whether other Senate committee leaders were on board with Graham's proposal, however. Graham used his Sunday television appearance to make a direct appeal to Sen. James E. Risch (R-Idaho), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
'Jim, if you're watching the show, I hope you are . . . let's call these people in. Eventually, we'll get to Hunter Biden,' Graham said, referring to the former vice president's son. He added: 'We're not going to let it go. Jim Risch, you need to start it.'
Risch's office and the Foreign Relations Committee did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The crux of the impeachment case against Trump is whether he used $391-million in military aid and a coveted White House meeting for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky as leverage to force the foreign leader to conduct political investigations, including one focused on Joe Biden.
In a July-25 call, Trump asked Zelensky to 'do us a favor.'
Trump and administration officials repeatedly stonewalled House investigators, refusing to allow certain witnesses to testify and to provide requested documents.
The House voted in December to impeach Trump, and in recent weeks, new evidence against him has emerged, including reports that former national security adviser John Bolton says there was a quid pro quo conditioning the aid on investigations by Ukraine that could help the president politically.
In an interview Sunday with Fox News host Sean Hannity, Trump said he has no plans to delay his annual State of the Union address, which is scheduled for Tuesday.
'No, I'm going to have it,' Trump said in the interview, which aired on Fox ahead of the Super Bowl. 'It's going to be done. We're going to talk about the achievements that we've made.'
He added that the impeachment process and the Russia probe led by former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III were 'unfair to my family.'
'I mean, my family suffered because of all of this, and many other families suffered also,' he said.
Over the weekend, the administration acknowledged the existence of two dozen emails that could reveal the president's thinking about withholding the aid to Ukraine.
Some Democrats had been looking to Alexander last week as a potential crossover vote in favor of subpoenaing key witnesses and documents in the Senate trial. But the lawmaker said Sunday that while Trump's behavior was 'inappropriate,' it was 'a long way from treason, bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors.'
'I think he shouldn't have done it,' Alexander said of Trump's alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine. 'I think it was wrong. Inappropriate was the way I'd say "" improper, crossing the line. And then the only question left is who decides what to do about that.'
'Well, who decides what to do about that?' host Chuck Todd asked.
'The people,' Alexander responded.
On CNN's 'State of the Union,' Ernst said she, too, will vote to acquit the president. 
Ernst, who is facing a tough reelection race this year, said she would not have handled the Ukraine matter in the way Trump did. But she offered only gentle criticism of the president's actions. 
'Maybe not the perfect call,' Ernst said, referring to Trump's oft-repeated claim that his phone conversation with Zelensky was 'perfect.' 'He did it maybe in the wrong manner.'
'I think he could have done it through different channels,' such as the Department of Justice, she added.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (Calif.) and other leading Democrats have argued that any acquittal without the inclusion of witnesses and documents is meaningless "" a point Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) reemphasized Sunday.
'Senate Republicans keep voting for a sham trial without witnesses or documents,' Schumer tweeted. 'Make no mistake: The full truth will eventually come out, and Senate Republicans will have to answer for their cover-up.'
Harvard Law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz, a member of Trump's legal team, pushed back against the notion that the trial was a sham, saying that Pelosi and others are at fault 'for failing to charge an impeachable offense.'
'If they haven't charged an offense, then maybe he hasn't been acquitted, but he also hasn't been charged,' Dershowitz said on 'Fox News Sunday.'
Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), meanwhile, took a victory lap of sorts. In an appearance on CBS News's 'Face the Nation,' Schiff, the lead impeachment manager, pointed to the recent comments by Republican senators as proof that the House successfully made its case that Trump 'did withhold hundreds of millions of dollars from an ally to try to coerce that ally into helping him cheat in the next election.'
'I think it's enormously important that the country understand exactly what this president did, and we have proved it,' Schiff said.
Even so, he added, to simply call Trump's actions inappropriate 'doesn't begin to do justice to the gravity of this president's misconduct.'
Schiff also declined to say whether the House will subpoena Bolton, saying only that, 'whether it's in testimony before the House or it's in his book or it's in one form or another, the truth will continue to come out.'

The top-polling Democratic presidential candidates spent their campaign money at a rapid clip in the final three months of 2019, and they each entered 2020 with less than one-fifth of the money they had raised all year, according to financial reports filed Friday night.
The new filings show candidates were in need of a quick infusion of cash as they entered the final stretch leading up to the costly early contests, the first of which begins Monday in Iowa.
The primary campaign is expected to get even more expensive as it nears Super Tuesday on March 3, when 14 states have Democratic presidential nominating contests. And those who make it to Super Tuesday would face a rival with virtually unlimited funds: multibillionaire Mike Bloomberg.
The leading candidates spent heavily in the final quarter of 2019, buying millions of dollars of advertisements, paying for a sprawling staff and traveling from state to state. 
Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, former vice president Joe Biden and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg spent all the money they raised in the final quarter, filings show. 
And each entered January with less cash on hand than the previous quarter. Sanders had $18.2-million; Buttigieg had $14.5-million; Warren had $13.7-million; and Biden had $9-million, according to the new Federal Election Commission filings, which covered Oct. 1 through Dec. 31, 2019. 
The 11 Democrats currently running in the race together spent $517 million in the fourth quarter alone, which includes the spending of two billionaires self-funding their campaigns.
The biggest spender of the quarter "" aside from the two billionaires "" was Sanders. His campaign spent nearly $50 million in the final quarter, pouring $20 million of that money into advertising. 
Sanders's heavy investments coincided with his ascent in the campaign "" marking a dramatic revival for a candidate who struggled to gain traction over the summer and then suffered a heart attack in October that prompted some supporters to wonder if he would even continue his campaign.
Most other Democratic candidates had millions of dollars less than the top-polling candidates, such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota ($5 million), businessman Andrew Yang ($3.7 million) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii ($2.8 million). 
Meanwhile, President Trump continued to raise and spend record amounts of money for his reelection. Trump's campaign, the Republican National Committee and two joint fundraising committees had a massive war chest of $196 million entering 2020, filings show. 
Trump's fundraising haul in the fourth quarter was fueled by backlash to the House impeachment of the president, campaign and party officials said. 
Trump drew $57 million in the final six months of 2019 from donors giving in low amounts online to the campaign, the party and two affiliated fundraising committees, according to data from WinRed, the online fundraising platform for Republican candidates and groups. Of that, nearly $22 million came from 14 battleground and Rust Belt states, data shows, representing nearly 40 percent of donations that came in during the period. In comparison, 27 percent of the money donated to 2020 Democrats via the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue came from those 14 states, data shows. Democratic presidential candidates raised $180 million on ActBlue in the second half of 2019, and $49 million came from the 14 battleground and Rust Belt states, records show. 
The WinRed records, which cover the period from July 1 through Dec. 31, 2019, provided the first in-depth look at Trump's base of online donors, who have driven massive amounts of money to Trump's campaign since the 2016 election.
In the second half of 2019, the Trump campaign, Republican Party and two joint fundraising committees drew $5.6 million from Florida; $2 million from Pennsylvania; $1.9 million from Arizona; $1.8 million from Georgia; $1.7 million from Michigan and $1.6 million from North Carolina, WinRed data shows.

In an effort to help cash-strapped Democrats in the primaries, independent groups that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money are stepping in with their own ad campaigns in early states. Despite candidates' promise early on in the campaign to reject support from such groups, several presidential candidates are nonetheless being boosted by them. 
For example, the pro-Biden super PAC Unite the Country raised $3.8 million in 2019 since it launched in late October, new filings show. The group's fundraising was boosted by a $1 million donation from a single donor: San Francisco-based billionaire real estate broker George Marcus. 
The super PAC raised another $3.8 million in January for a total of $7.6 million and plans on spending most of that on ads and research to help Biden in Iowa, officials said. 
Bloomberg, who is running an ad-driven campaign with the hope of winning enough delegates on Super Tuesday, spent $200 million in the first six weeks of his campaign "" exceeding the amount of money the rest of his Democratic rivals spent altogether in the fourth quarter. 
His campaign spent about $188-million from mid-November through December, with the vast majority going to ads and advertising firms. 
Trump's huge reelection machine continued to drive money to his family business. In the final quarter of 2019, Trump's reelection committee paid $193,000 to Trump-related properties.
As the president faces mounting legal bills from his impeachment trial, he is relying on money raised through the national party committee. In December, the RNC paid an additional $60,000 in legal fees to the law firm Raskin - Raskin, which is representing Trump in the impeachment proceedings.

Supporters wonder if qualifications can beat 'elephant in the room'


CAMBRIDGE, Mass. - Elizabeth Warren attracted big crowds. She won rave reviews in nearly every debate. Her organization was second to none. She developed plans, a strategy and a message. Yet when voting started, she not only lost, she lost by a lot. 
Now as Warren, who ended her presidential campaign Thursday, decides whether to endorse either of the two male candidates remaining, her supporters are left to contemplate a factor that many believe contributed significantly to her loss: She's female. 
""Gender in this race, you know, that is the trap question for every woman,"" Warren told reporters gathered outside her house Thursday. ""If you say, 'Yeah, there was sexism in this race,' everyone says, 'Whiner!' And if you say, 'No, there was no sexism,' about a bazillion women think, 'What planet do you live on?' ""
It felt like an echo from 2016, when a high-profile female candidate with strong qualifications fell short, and the loss renews questions about the perceptions of women in American politics and if, or how, those perceptions can be changed. 
It's not that Warren ran an error-free campaign. She had to apologize for previous claims of a Native American identity and struggled to explain her health-care plan and how it would be paid for, and her efforts to bridge the party's liberal and centrist camps fell flat.
But her male counterparts made big mistakes as well. And Warren was among six accomplished women who got little traction in a party that recaptured the House in 2018 with a record number of female candidates, elevated a woman as House speaker who regularly goes toe-to-toe with President Trump, and ostensibly has a new sensitivity to gender issues. 
The exit by Warren, who spent much of 2019 leading in many polls, was a reminder of four years ago, when Hillary Clinton's loss sparked a national debate over whether a woman could ever win election to the country's highest political office. Her departure came just days after another prominent female senator, Amy Klobuchar, dropped out.

""Women will not be perceived by some as electable until we're elected,"" said Valerie Jarrett, a top adviser to former president Barack Obama and a friend of Warren's. ""I often say progress always seems impossible until it's inevitable. There was certainly a time when our country might have thought that an African American man was not electable. And what happened? We just kept trying.""
After campaigning energetically for more than a year, Warren finished no higher than third in any primary or caucus, and on Tuesday, she finished behind former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders in her home state of Massachusetts.

Voters repeatedly told Warren's campaign workers that Clinton's shocking loss to Trump had spooked them, suggesting they blamed it Clinton's gender, rather than other factors like her moderate ideology failing to excite the Democratic base. 
Warren's campaign tried a variety of tactics to win support from voters who embraced her policies but could not quite believe that enough people would choose her over Trump, which her staff referred to as the ""electability problem."" 
She held massive rallies in New York, Seattle and St. Paul, Minn., intended to showcase her popularity. She disassembled a billionaire presidential candidate on a debate stage, effectively ending former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg's White House bid, partly as a way to show how she'd potentially eviscerate Trump in the fall. 
Her campaign trained volunteers about how to talk about what aides called the ""elephant in the room"" when they campaigned door-to-door. 
Warren herself on occasion sought to defuse the issue by speaking about it bluntly.
""Look at the men on this stage. Collectively they have lost 10 elections,"" Warren said during a January debate. ""The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in are the women, Amy and me!""
None of it worked.

""We're comfortable with women leaders in the abstract,"" said Jennifer Palmieri, who was Clinton's communications director in 2016 and has written two books on gender in politics. ""But once they actually start winning or getting close to power, that is when all of the sexism and unconscious gender bias kicks in.""
She recalled hearing Democrats four years ago talk about how they disliked Clinton but adored Warren. Once Warren was poised to take power, however, new questions arose about whether she lacked some intangible attribute needed to win the White House, Palmieri said. 
 ""It's an unsatisfactory answer for people because it sounds so ridiculous to say, but we are not comfortable with women having very big ambitions,"" Palmieri said.
Clinton's defeat in 2016 devastated her supporters, and Warren's withdrawal was similarly greeted Thursday with disappointment and frustration.
""The best candidate of them all had to quit,"" former tennis star Martina Navratilova said via Twitter. ""She had a plan for everything with one major thing missing - the 'right' sex... Let's be real. This is not playing the gender card, it's just a fact."" 
Warren's withdrawal also prompted other leading women in Washington to reflect on why the ""highest and hardest"" glass ceiling that Clinton once talked about was still intact. 
""Every time I get introduced as the most powerful woman in the United States, I almost cry, because I'm thinking, 'I wish that were not true,' "" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told reporters. ""I so wish that we had a woman president of the United States, and we came very close to doing that - [a] woman who was better qualified than so many people who have sought that office and even won it.""
Pelosi added that she believes there is ""a certain element of misogyny"" preventing women from rising. 

Still, the Democratic primary has been unusually complicated this year, and many argue that other factors besides sexism were at play in Warren's fate. Her initial strategy rested on quickly consolidating the left, for example, but many liberals, such as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), were more drawn to Sanders's brand of fiery democratic socialism. 
Then Warren sought to present herself as a bridge-builder, challenging the notion that there were only centrist and a liberal ""lanes"" in the primaries. ""I thought that wasn't right, but evidently I was wrong,"" she said Thursday. 
Warren was the remaining woman among a group that included Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) along with self-help guru Marianne Williamson. Only Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) remains in the race, but she lags far behind Biden and Sanders.
The next big task facing Warren is deciding whether to endorse another candidate. She would have to choose between the two men remaining, both of whom have had their own issues with treatment of women. 
On one side is Sanders, an ideological ally whose leadership style and management ability are questioned by many in Warren's orbit. In 2016, Sanders faced complaints about how women on his staff were treated, and he ultimately apologized for that.
Or she could back Biden, who some women have accused of inappropriate touching and who has ties to the same corporate interests she reviles. She also could decide not to endorse.
Both camps have been reaching out to Warren's team in some fashion since Wednesday, when she signaled she was reassessing her candidacy. 

At a news conference Thursday outside her home in Cambridge, Warren told reporters she would not immediately make an endorsement in the presidential race but may do so in the future. She urged people to ""take a deep breath"" before moving on and pledged to keep battling for middle-class families.
""I have to think a lot about where is the best place for me to go to keep fighting those fights,"" Warren said. ""My job is to fight them as smartly and effectively as I can.""
 Warren initially kept her messaging about gender low-key when on the campaign trail: She made ""pinkie promises"" with young girls who came to her town halls, for example, telling them she was running for president ""because that's what girls do."" 
But late last year, as she lost some momentum and the number of women in the field dwindled, Warren began to talk more directly about gender, focusing on the wave of women who ""came off the sidelines"" after Trump's inauguration and helped elect female candidates to Congress and other offices in 2018. 
In January's Democratic debate, moderators poked at a dispute that had been brewing for days between Warren and Sanders over a private meeting in 2018 during which Sanders reportedly said a woman could not win the presidency.
Onstage, Sanders flatly denied making any such remarks. ""How could anybody in a million years not believe that a woman could not be president of the United States?"" Sanders said.
Warren, who insisted she was ""not here to try to fight with Bernie,"" said she disagreed with Sanders - suggesting he had in fact made those remarks - adding that she wanted to address head-on the question of a woman's electability.
In February, Warren was asked whether she thought women were judged by a double standard on the debate stage.
""This is what women face all the time - it's always 'too much of this' or 'too much of that,' "" Warren told MSNBC. ""But you put your head down, do your job and you keep on going. Or, you might say, 'We persist.' "" 
The ""persist"" slogan reflected her self-described identity as a relentless fighter who never gives up. In 2017, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) warned Warren that she was violating Senate rules during a floor speech, saying: ""She was warned. She was given an explanation. Nevertheless, she persisted."" Warren and her supporters eagerly seized on the phrase.
And last month when a group of women decided to form a super PAC to support Warren's candidacy, the crusader against big money used gender as a reason to accept the help of a committee that could raise unlimited amounts of cash.
""We reached the point a few weeks ago where all the men who were still in this race and on the debate stage all had either super PACs or they were multibillionaires,"" Warren said, explaining her reversal. ""It can't be the case that a bunch of people keep them and only one or two don't.""
Warren's super PAC spent more than any of the other Democratic candidates' outside group this year. Ultimately, it didn't make a difference.

Alleges Trump directly
tied withholding Ukraine aid to probe of Bidens
Congressional Democrats called for former national security adviser John Bolton to testify in President Trump's impeachment trial following a new report that the president told Bolton last August that he wanted to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless it aided investigations into the Bidens. 
The New York Times reported Sunday evening that in last summer's conversation, Trump directly tied the holdup of nearly $400 million in military assistance to the investigations of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. That is according to an unpublished manuscript of Bolton's forthcoming book, the Times said. 
The book, 'The Room Where It Happened,' is scheduled for publication March 17, but a White House review could attempt to delay its publication or block some of its contents.
Two people familiar with the book, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the project, confirmed that it details Trump tying aid to the desire for Biden probes and details a number of conversations about Ukraine that he had with Trump and key advisers, such as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. They said Bolton is ready to testify in the Senate impeachment trial. 
In a joint statement, the seven House impeachment managers called the report 'explosive' and urged the Senate, controlled by Republicans, to agree to call Bolton as a witness in Trump's trial, which kicks off its second full week on Monday. Bolton has said that he would testify before the Senate if subpoenaed. 
'The Senate trial must seek the full truth and Mr. Bolton has vital information to provide,' the managers said in a statement Sunday. 'There is no defensible reason to wait until his book is published, when the information he has to offer is critical to the most important decision senators must now make "" whether to convict the president of impeachable offenses.' 
Trump is on trial, facing two charges "" abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
The assertion from Bolton could undermine one core defense that has repeatedly been laid out by Trump, his defenders and his legal team: that there was no explicit quid pro quo involved when the administration withheld the military assistance, as well as a White House visit coveted by Ukraine. 
The White House has said that Trump's request for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate the Bidens, as well as a discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 elections, was because he was interested in rooting out corruption and that he did nothing improper. 
The president's legal defense team is expected to mount a vigorous defense on Monday when they deliver a full day of arguments against the impeachment charges. 
The revelation from the Bolton book was certain to roil the dynamics of the trial this week, when the Senate was expected to face a critical vote on whether to allow witnesses at all.
Charles Cooper, a lawyer for Bolton, said he submitted the manuscript to the National Security Council's records management division on Dec. 30 for a standard review process to examine potentially classified information. Cooper said they believed that the book manuscript did not include any classified material and that its contents would not be shared with officials outside that review process. 
'It is clear, regrettably, from The New York Times article published today that the prepublication review process has been corrupted and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those properly involved in reviewing the manuscript,' Cooper said in the statement. 
Sarah Tinsley, a spokeswoman for Bolton, added: 'The ambassador has not passed the draft manuscript to anyone else. Period.'
 Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and many Senate Republicans would prefer the Senate avoid witnesses, but at least four GOP senators are seen as potential votes for favoring more testimony: Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Mitt Romney (Utah) and Lamar Alexander (Tenn.). 
Romney and Collins have already indicated that they are likely to support hearing from witnesses and getting more evidence, and Romney has also said that he would like to hear from Bolton. 
'The odds of deposition for new witnesses is certainly rising dramatically,' one senior Republican official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly assess party dynamics, said Sunday evening after the publication of the Times report. 
 'John Bolton has the evidence. It's up to four Senate Republicans to ensure that John Bolton, Mick Mulvaney, and the others with direct knowledge of President Trump's actions testify in the Senate trial,' Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a tweet.
Earlier Sunday, Trump escalated his attacks on Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), issuing what appears to be a veiled threat against the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
'Shifty Adam Schiff is a CORRUPT POLITICIAN, and probably a very sick man,' Trump tweeted Sunday morning. 'He has not paid the price, yet, for what he has done to our Country!'
Schiff is the lead impeachment manager in the Senate trial.
Schiff responded in an interview on NBC News's 'Meet the Press,' saying he believes that Trump's remarks were intended as a threat.
'This is a wrathful and vindictive president; I don't think there's any doubt about it,' Schiff said in the interview. 'And if you think there is, look at the president's tweets about me today, saying that I should 'pay a price.' '
'Do you take that as a threat?' host Chuck Todd asked.
'I think it's intended to be,' Schiff replied.
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said it was 'ridiculous' for Schiff to claim that Trump was threatening him. In an appearance on Fox News Channel's 'Media Buzz,' she accused the California Democrat of 'grandstanding,' although she acknowledged that she had not had an opportunity to ask Trump what he meant by the tweet.
'I think he means . . . [Schiff] hasn't yet paid the price with the voters,' Grisham said.
She also echoed Trump's attack earlier Sunday on Schiff, saying: 'I mean, it seems he's having a little bit of a mental issue when you sit on the floor for hours and hours and hours. He's obsessed with this president and trying to take him down.'
Democrats contend that Trump has continued to publicly solicit foreign interference in U.S. elections and that the integrity of the 2020 race is at risk. The president fired back Sunday by leveling the same accusation at his political opponents.
'The Impeachment Hoax is a massive election interference the likes of which has never been seen before,' he said in a tweet.
Some Republicans on Sunday defended Trump's remarks about Schiff. In an interview on CNN's 'State of the Union,' Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.) said he was not troubled by Trump's declaration that Schiff 'has not paid the price.' 
'I don't think it's a death threat. I don't think he's encouraging a death threat,' Lankford said.
Host Jake Tapper responded by saying that 'people who are supporters of the president have heard his rhetoric and then actually tried to bomb and kill politicians and the media.'
This prompted Lankford to refer to the 2017 congressional baseball shooting that targeted Republicans and injured several people, including House Minority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.).
'So to be able to say the president's trying to be able to spur this on would be able to say Democrats were trying to spur on the killing' of Republicans, Lankford said.
Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), who is also an impeachment manager, called Trump's tweet about Schiff 'really unfortunate' and said the president has said things before 'that seem threatening to people.' 
'He really ought to get a grip and be a little more presidential,' she said on 'State of the Union.'
In a tweet later Sunday morning, Trump also took aim at Todd, accusing the 'Meet the Press' host of holding a 'softball interview' with Schiff and 'never even calling Shifty out on his fraudulent statement to Congress, where he made up ALL of the words of my conversation with the Ukrainian President!'
Both sides continue to spar over the question of whether the Senate trial will include witnesses. Some key Senate Republicans, already hesitant on the issue, became even more so over the weekend after Schiff referred to a CBS News report in which an anonymous Trump ally was quoted as having warned lawmakers, 'Vote against the president and your head will be on a pike.'

Operations raise new fears of foreign influence on 2020 election

SAN FRANCISCO "" Facebook on Wednesday said it had taken action against malicious actors in Russia, Iran and Myanmar that had deployed fake accounts and other efforts to manipulate social media users, illustrating anew its vast, global challenge to police the platform for an ever-widening array of disinformation.
A small network of accounts with ties in Iran targeted U.S. users, particularly on religious and geopolitical issues, Facebook said in a blog post, while an operation with links to the Russian military focused its efforts on Ukraine and other neighboring countries. The Kremlin-aligned campaign sometimes relied on private messages to steer pro-Russian narratives to influential social media users, a development that worried researchers, who warned the tactics 'could be turned towards US targets.'
Facebook said it removed all of the suspect accounts, pages and groups, pointing to its policy prohibiting government interference and coordinated inauthentic behavior. Even though the disinformation campaigns largely occurred abroad and operated on a small scale, the revelation that Russia in particular continues to try to weaponize the social media site is likely to unnerve U.S. leaders. Many in Washington fear the Kremlin could take aim at the 2020 presidential election, much as its online army did four years ago.
'We are making progress rooting out this abuse, but as we've said before, it's an ongoing challenge,' said Nathaniel Gleicher, the company's head of security policy. 'We're committed to continually improving to stay ahead. That means building better technology, hiring more people and working closer with law enforcement, security experts and other companies.'
With Iran, Facebook said roughly a dozen Facebook and Instagram accounts "" which it did not directly tie to the nation's government "" shared content on U.S. elections and U.S.-Iran relations, sometimes attempting to contact public figures in the process. They had small followings, and Facebook associated the operation to a network of hundreds of accounts with vast reach that it disabled in January 2019. That effort sought to amplify the reach of content produced by Iranian state media. 
The takedowns arrived the same week that digital researchers laid bare the full extent of Iran's efforts to shape political conversations online. So-called sock puppets of the country and its government had more than 2,200 assets on Facebook, including accounts and pages, that directly affected 6 million users globally, according to data compiled by the Atlantic Council. On Twitter, 8,000 accounts produced roughly 8 million messages, their report found. The analysis did not include the latest instances of inauthentic activity on the two sites.
Unlike Russia, which has sought to promote social discord, Iran's online barrage has aimed to advance 'a distorted truth,' wrote lead researchers Emerson T. Brooking and Suzanne Kianpour. The campaign 'exaggerates Iran's moral authority while minimizing Iran's repression of its citizens and the steep human costs' of its foreign policy, they said. Such efforts have typically peaked when the United States and Iran have been at odds "" such as when Washington launched the military strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, one of Tehran's military leaders.
Still, researchers warned that Iran, like Russia, 'may attempt direct electoral interference in 2020 and beyond.' 
Facebook also removed about 80 accounts that primarily targeted Ukraine and that Facebook said had 'links to Russian military intelligence services.' The operation generally relied on 'realistic-looking accounts' to extend the reach of pro-Russian narratives on outside blogs, according to an analysis of the content by Graphika, a research firm that had access to Facebook data.
Facebook's new discovery about malicious Russian activity arrives nearly four months after it found the first signs of Kremlin-aligned interference in the 2020 race. The tech giant discovered accounts appearing to be run by locals weighing in on political issues in swing states, attacking former vice president Joe Biden, pitting Democrats against one another and praising President Trump.
Facebook also announced Wednesday it had disabled a novel kind of disinformation operation: an effort by telecom providers in Myanmar and Vietnam to disparage competitors online.
The company Mytel was behind Facebook pages that took aim 'at the company's own competitors as an indirect means of boosting its own brand and profit,' according to the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. That included a coordinated campaign to get Facebook users to dial a special code that had the effect of disabling some outbound calls. A day before it surfaced, though, Mytel's own Face book page 'conveniently' offered viewers the fix for the problem.

The White House's newest budget plan revealed the pressure President Trump faces to curb spending while protecting popular programs, constrained by his decision to significantly increase defense spending and largely wall off money for Medicare and Social Security.
At the same time, Democratic presidential candidates are far from united on an alternative to Trump's plan. They are battling over competing visions for how to use the federal budget to expand the economy and lift American families.
Trump's budget proposal, released Monday, would allocate a record $4.8-trillion in spending for the fiscal year that begins in October, and White House officials said it would result in a $966-billion deficit because tax revenue continues to lag. But the deficit will probably be even higher than that, in part because Congress is expected to reject the White House's call for major cuts to housing, education, environmental protection, foreign aid and other programs. 
Although Democrats have not unified around an alternative budget, many of them have seized on the broad range of cuts Trump is pursuing nine months before the presidential election.
'The president of the United States thinks we're suckers,' Pete Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Ind., said Monday. 'We know, we know, there will be accountability for all those broken promises.'
One of the biggest reductions in the Trump budget would affect Medicaid, a health program for low-income Americans, which Trump seeks to cut by $920-billion over 10-years. It was one of several social-safety-net programs the White House targeted for cuts, and one the Obama administration fought to expand.
Even with the proposed cuts, Trump's decision to wall off Social Security, Medicare and the Defense Department from big reductions would keep the government's fiscal picture largely out of balance. If all the proposals were enacted by Congress and the economy grew at a much faster clip than many economists say is possible, a gap between spending and revenue would continue for the next 15 years, White House officials said. During the Obama administration, Republicans insisted that the deficit be eliminated within 10-years, but those calls have faded since Trump's inauguration.

Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have called for major spending on health-care and education programs. Former vice president Joe Biden has warned Democrats not to embrace an agenda that calls for unrealistic social policy goals, and Buttigieg declared at a town hall event in Nashua, N.H., on Sunday that it was time to get serious about the rising deficit, even though 'it's not fashionable in progressive circles to talk too much about the debt.'
The dispute comes as the 2020 campaign shapes up to be a sprawling debate about the size and scope of government for Americans of all backgrounds and income levels. Trump's budget offers Democratic candidates big targets, including major cuts to Medicaid, food stamps and domestic programs such as those involving education and environmental protection. Some Democrats, in turn, are proposing huge spending plans that Trump is likely to brand as 'socialist,' as they wrestle with multiple contradictions of their own over how best to handle government spending.
Because the GOP under Trump has largely abandoned the focus on deficit reduction that was a central theme for Republicans during the Obama administration, some Democratic candidates see a vacuum to fill. Moderate members of the party want to seize the deficit-hawk mantle "" as Buttigieg has sought to do "" while the liberal wing wants to significantly expand government programs, which they can justify in part by pointing to Republicans' abdication on the issue.
'Both parties are juggling whether to embrace their expensive priorities and build a dream government, or responsibly reduce the deficit but give up on some of their dreams,' said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank.

Despite the president's lack of public focus on the budget, the document spares cuts to politically sensitive targets Trump had sought to slash in the past. 

These include the Special Olympics and the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative "" a program important to Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin, critical states in the presidential election. 




As Biden has campaigned in New Hampshire, he has argued that Trump is morally and economically unfit. On Monday, Biden tried to cite Trump's budget as an example of why the Republican is unfit for office. He contrasted Trump's efforts to cut safety-net programs, including Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits, with his experience on Saturday handing out food to needy families in New Hampshire.
'It's the United States of America,' Biden said. 'We're standing there handing out bread and food. Some of the little kids couldn't even pick the boxes up. . . . And this president of the United States, as I speak, is cutting SNAP, food stamps. What in God's name is happening to us?'


The leading Democratic presidential candidates have proposed between $5-trillion and $50-trillion in new federal spending, with Biden on one end of the spectrum, Sanders on the other and most of the remaining candidates in between. All the Democratic hopefuls have said their plans would be paid for with tax increases on individuals and corporations, although Sanders said his Green New Deal legislation would be paid for in part by new tax revenue created by the economic growth generated by massive federal investment.
Buttigieg's nod to reducing the deficit was denounced by many liberal economists, who pointed to historically low inflation as a reason to remain focused on spending priorities rather than deficit reduction. Stephanie Kelton, a former Sanders economist, wrote on Twitter that 'cutting the deficit should NEVER be a policy goal.'

ROME "" Vice President Pence, in Israel, marked the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. He slipped a prayer into Jerusalem's Western Wall and bowed his head. And he visited with Pope Francis here in Rome before gazing upward at the Sistine Chapel.
But Pence's whirlwind, 77-hour trip abroad was nearly as notable for what he didn't do "" and didn't say "" as for what he did.
Over two full days and two stops "" the first in Jerusalem, the second in Rome "" the vice president largely escaped the impeachment vortex consuming the nation's capital some 5,000 miles away.
President Trump spent his foreign sojourn to Davos this week obsessing over the Senate trial back home "" tweeting more than a dozen times before dawn on his final day in Switzerland and railing against what he called 'the hoax' focused on his alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine for political gain. Pence, by contrast, cut a calmer and more sanguine visage, ostensibly unconcerned by the constitutional controversy raging back home.
Pence never brought up impeachment unprompted, weighing in only when asked by reporters, including during a short news conference at the end of his day in Rome.
Pence reiterated his previous claims that he had no awareness of a push by Trump and his associates, including personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, to withhold critical U.S. aid from Ukraine in exchange for an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
'What I've said over and over again is I was never aware of the allegations that there was some pressure campaign for investigations against the Bidens that was underway until those matters became public,' he said.
The vice president also added that while he had initially said he had no problem releasing a transcript of his own phone conversation with Ukraine's president, he was now more reticent after coming to believe that the Democrats' impeachment inquiry was simply a 'sham investigation.'
'The outcome here is that the president should be acquitted,' Pence said. 
Outside those brief remarks, the most tangible reminder of the latest scandal engulfing the Trump presidency followed Pence abroad in the form of the screens of Fox News "" the in-flight entertainment choice that aired parts of the impeachment proceedings as Air Force Two knifed through a darkening sky.
On Thursday, at the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, the vice president extended an invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "" as well as to Benny Gantz, his rival in the country's upcoming elections "" to travel to Washington next week for the unveiling of the administration's new peace plan.
Earlier in the day, speaking alongside other world leaders at the Holocaust remembrance site Yad Vashem to commemorate the anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation, Pence condemned the 'vile tide of anti-Semitism that is fueling hate and violence all across the world.' He also singled out Iran, calling on other nations to 'stand strong against the leading state purveyor of anti-Semitism, against the one government in the world that denies the Holocaust as a matter of state policy and threatens to wipe Israel off the map.'
The vice president, who last year visited the concentration camp in Poland where more than 1.1-million men, women and children perished under Nazi control during World War II, recounted how moving the experience was for him.
'One cannot see the piles of shoes, the gas chambers, the crematoriums, the lone boxcar facing the gate to the camp and those grainy photographs of men, women and children being sent to their deaths without asking, 'How could they?' ' he said.
Pence's latest foreign trip is another reminder of the vice president's uncanny knack for seeming to sidestep the morass of the Trump administration, often through unintentionally well-timed travel out of town.
In August 2017, Pence left for a week-long trip to Latin America immediately after deadly violence at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville. He was still abroad when Trump held a much-criticized news conference in the lobby of Trump Tower declaring that 'both sides' were to blame.
Pence did weigh in at the time from Chile but largely sidestepped a question about whether he agreed with Trump that both sides were responsible, instead simply affirming that he stood with the president. He cut his trip short by a day, returning to Washington early for a strategy meeting with Trump and his national security team at Camp David.
In early 2018, Pence was in Japan, en route to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, when news broke that staff secretary Rob Porter was being pushed from the White House amid allegations of domestic abuse from his two ex-wives.
'I learned as I awoke this morning of those developments,' Pence said, prompting a follow-up question from his traveling press corps about why he often seemed 'a little bit out of the loop on some of this major news.'
Later that year, in November, Pence again traveled to Asia, just days after Democrats won control of the House in the midterm elections, when Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, installing loyalist Matthew G. Whitaker atop the Justice Department.
In February 2019, Pence flew to Colombia to announce new sanctions against Venezuela at the beginning of the week that Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney and fixer, testified before Congress about the president's alleged misdeeds. His trip also coincided with Trump's failed summit in Hanoi with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
And throughout much of last year "" as special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's Russia probe reached its culmination and the impeachment inquiry began to boil "" Pence was hopscotching the country, helping promote Trump's trade deal with Mexico and Canada.
Pence's far-flung travels are partly a function of the unconventional Trump White House. The president is a homebody reluctant to travel abroad, frequently delegating foreign trips to his No. 2. 
On Friday in Rome, Pence appeared both geographically and mentally removed from the spectacle of impeachment.
He began his day at the Vatican, deploying his standard opening line with the pope "" an offering of his 'warmest greetings' from Trump "" before the two men exchanged gifts, with Pence, a self-described 'evangelical Catholic,' giving the leader of the faith a wooden cross.
During the meeting, Pence and the pope discussed the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, displaced religious minorities in the Middle East and the antiabortion March for Life, Pence said. 
'I won't forget "" you made me a hero,' Pence told Francis before departing through the Clement VIII door, in a possible reference to Pence's mother's admiration for the pontiff.
Pence then entered the Sistine Chapel, which was already thick with tourists, some of whom momentarily averted their eyes from Michelangelo's fresco to gape at the vice president. One woman pointed at Pence, offered a thumbs up and requested a picture.
The vice president smiled before turning back to his tour guide, who made a good-natured gesture to signify that the eager tourist was just another one of the 'Americans' "" like Pence, far from home.

President Trump on Friday endorsed a tweet comparing the top Senate Democrat to Iran, the United States' longtime adversary, suggesting neither could be trusted, as Democratic leaders criticized the White House for ordering a military strike to kill a powerful Iranian commander without congressional input.
Amid a flurry of reactions from U.S. lawmakers, Trump retweeted conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, who, in response to a headline about Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) not receiving advance notice of the military operation, wrote: 'Neither were the Iranians, and for pretty much the same reason.'
Trump made similar insinuations about Democrats' trustworthiness after the October raid that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. At that time, Trump said he didn't tell House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), a former member of the Intelligence Committee, because 'he wanted to make sure this kept secret.'
Trump ordered the U.S. drone strike that killed Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani, whom the United States regarded as a war criminal responsible for hundreds of American deaths.
Republicans and Democrats were united in calling Soleimani an enemy of the United States and a terrorist.
'This morning, Iran's master terrorist is dead,' said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in remarks on the Senate floor. 'The architect and chief engineer for the world's most active state sponsor of terrorism has been removed from the battlefield at the hand of the United States military.'
Schumer called Soleimani a 'notorious terrorist,' and added: 'No one should shed a tear over his death.'
But as Republicans celebrated what they described as Trump's decisive action, Democrats criticized the president's order to act unilaterally while expressing grave concern that this action would move the United States closer to an in trac table war with Iran. 
'No matter how good it may feel that Qasem Soleimani is no longer alive, he likely will end up being more dangerous to the United States, our troops and our allies, as a martyr than as a living, breathing military adversary,' said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).
Trump, in brief remarks Friday afternoon about the attack, said he targeted Soleimani to 'stop a war,' not to start one.
Presidents typically inform the so-called Gang of Eight "" the House speaker and minority leader, the Senate majority and minority leaders, and the chairmen and ranking minority-party members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees "" about high-level military operations.
Top Democratic leaders in Congress received no advance notification of the strike, aides said. Pelosi spoke to Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper after the attack for about 13 minutes, said an aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly.
'I'm a member of the Gang of Eight, which is typically briefed in advance of operations of this level of significance. We were not,' Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor, adding that the administration must be 'asked probing questions not from your inner and often insulated circle, but from others, particularly Congress, which forces an administration before it acts to answer very serious questions.'
It was unclear which congressional leaders were given advance notice of the strike. 
McConnell said only that he had spoken to the defense secretary and was arranging a classified briefing for all senators early next week, but he provided no details on when he first learned about the strike.
Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump ally, said Friday morning on Fox News that he was 'briefed about the potential operation when I was down in Florida' and appreciated 'being brought into the orbit.'
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) posted a photo on Instagram of himself and Trump at the president's Mar-a-Lago estate late Thursday, though it was not clear whether he, too, was briefed ahead of time.
McCarthy praised the killing of Soleimani as a 'statement to those seeking to attack America.' Trump, McCarthy said, had responded appropriately to violence by Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, including an attempt to storm the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
'In a display of resolve and strength, we struck the leader of those attacking our sovereign U.S. territories,' he said. 
Most Democrats focused their ire on Trump's unilateral action that they said could propel America into another conflict in the Middle East, yet Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) directed a more personal blow at Trump. 
'The Occupant was JUST impeached for abuse of power for political gain - now he is leading us to the brink of war because he believes it will help his re-election. We are sick of endless wars. Congress has the sole authority to declare war and we must deescalate. #NoWarWithIran,' Pressley tweeted.
Many of Trump's possible Democratic opponents in the presidential election also offered stern rebukes of Trump's handling of foreign policy. 
Calling the strike against Soleimani an assassination, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted that the United States was 'on the brink of yet another war in the Middle East.' She added: 'We're here because a reckless president, his allies, and his administration have spent years pushing us here.'
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called it a 'dangerous escalation,' and former vice president Joe Biden said in a statement that Trump 'just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox.'
In New Hampshire, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, who was an intelligence officer in Afghanistan, echoed many congressional Democrats who have wondered what the strategy is now. 'If we have learned nothing else from the Middle East, in the last 20 years, it's that taking out a bad guy is not a good idea unless you're ready for what comes next,' Buttigieg said. 
In Iowa, Sanders condemned Trump's action and emphasized his long record of opposing many U.S. military interventions abroad, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq. 
 'It gives me no pleasure to tell you at this moment we face a similar crossroads fraught with danger,' he said, adding that Trump's decision 'now puts us on the path to another war, potentially one that could be even worse than before.'

Senator could ease up on Biden, go all-in for the nomination, or drop out
Sen. Bernie Sanders has convened a series of weighty discussions about the future of his presidential campaign with his closest confidants, according to two people with direct knowledge of the conversations, and at least three potential paths forward have come up in the private talks.
One option that has been raised: Keep the campaign technically active with a goal of winning votes and accumulating delegates to the July nominating convention, but forgo attack ads aimed at delegate leader Joe Biden. Another: Stay in the race and aggressively compete for the nomination. A third choice: End the campaign. 
The people with knowledge of the talks spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive conversations. They cautioned that other options or nuances may also be on the table and stressed that Sanders (I-Vt.) had not yet made up his mind and was still trying to reach out to supporters. A campaign spokesman did not dispute their account. 
Few if any dilemmas in recent political history have been fraught with so many variables and such significant potential consequences. 
Before the coronavirus crisis, Democrats were anxious that disputes in the party would persist long into the general election, as they did after Sanders squared off against Hillary Clinton in 2016. That concern has only intensified as the pandemic has upended daily life across the globe, thrown the presidential race into uncertainty and created an urgent appetite for Democratic unity. 
With Biden staked to a solid lead and the future of the remaining primaries in doubt, many in the party are calling for Sanders to bow out, in recognition of the destructive divisions that could deepen if he sticks around. They are eager to pivot to a general election posture against President Trump and want to empower Biden to get started as soon as possible.
At 78, Sanders, a democratic socialist who long toiled on the fringes of the national political debate, might well be in his final national campaign. Unlike four years ago, when there was a clear incentive to keep running against Clinton and build a still-budding movement, he came into this race as a known entity with a proven following - making his current political aspirations less clear.
After suffering decisive losses in three more primaries Tuesday, and standing almost no chance of catching Biden in the race for the Democratic nomination, Sanders decided to return home to Vermont last week to assess his future. 
The senator is expected to reach a decision about the way forward in consultation with his wife and closest adviser, Jane Sanders. Campaign officials have signaled that he is not in any rush.
In a sign of how close Sanders is keeping his deliberations, even longtime friends and associates have said in recent days that they have little idea of where he will come down. Those with knowledge of the private discussions said the conversations have been substantive and thoughtful and that they reflect how intensely the senator is grappling with his options. 
Outside supporters have publicly suggested a range of different options, underlining the dilemma Sanders is confronting.
Larry Cohen, a close ally who helms a nonprofit aligned with the senator, is advocating that Sanders do three things: Push for mail-in balloting for the remaining primaries to curb the risk to voters from the coronavirus; stay in the race to accumulate enough delegates to influence the party platform; and forge a working conversation with Biden that acknowledges that the former vice president, not him, has the path to a majority of pledged delegates.
""Just a dialogue with Biden, not attacks,"" said Cohen.
RoseAnn DeMoro, a close Sanders friend and former nurses' union head, said Sanders should not approach the race as a done deal and ought to treat a come-from-behind victory in future contests as a possibility given the volatility of the times.
""I think there'll be openings that we don't know"" about, said DeMoro, warning that it would be foolish to concede to Biden.
Biden has made entreaties to Sanders and his supporters, embracing policies the senator has championed and nodding to his youthful movement in recent speeches. Aides from the two campaigns have been in close touch over the coronavirus, officials from both sides said recently, outlining a potential path for negotiations that could lead to an exit more acceptable to Sanders.
It's not clear he would take it, however. Sanders appears as keen as ever on using his platform to advance his own ideas about how to combat the impact of the coronavirus, as he did Friday evening when he convened a virtual discussion.
""This a moment that history will look back on and say: How did the people of the United States respond?"" Sanders said in his opening remarks. He has put forward a plan that draws on his longtime calls for a universal health care system and calls for sweeping new protections for working-class people.
On Saturday, Sanders continued to focus his campaign's energy on the coronavirus. As he took to social media to renew his calls for $2,000 emergency cash payments to help Americans cope with economic setbacks, the campaign broadcast online a live ""teach-in"" on the virus.
The campaign also announced that its robust fundraising operation was still churning, collecting more than $2 million in 48 hours for five charities trying to mitigate the effect of the virus.
Those close to the senator say that in recent days he has immersed himself in finding ways to address the crisis. Many of his supporters point to the economic and public health problems arising from it as justification for the far-reaching reforms he has long advocated.
In other words, they say, it's a moment that calls out for Sanders to stay onstage, not exit.
Some in the senator's orbit pointed out another potential thicket: the disconnect between the officials spearheading the campaign and the legions of fans who have powered a movement that started when he rose to prominence in the 2016 campaign. 
The two domains don't always operate on the same wavelength, and in this case, some feel, there is far more passion among average supporters for him to stick around than there is among the campaign professionals around him. 
On Saturday, Sanders was sounding like a candidate who was not yet ready to relinquish his platform to promote his ideas.
""Suspend evictions, foreclosures, and utility shut-offs nationwide,"" he tweeted.

DES MOINES "" Conflict between Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is a story that has been waiting to happen. What no one expected is that their first clash of the 2020 Democratic president race would come over issues of gender, class and electability.
Everything you need to know about the debate: winners and losers and the Fact Checker's rundown. Sign up for the Trailer for campaign news and insight.
Contradictory versions of what happened during a private dinner more than a year ago as both were preparing to enter the race "" Warren says Sanders told her a woman could not win the White House; Sanders says he said no such thing "" brought them to the brink of open conflict. Significantly, the flash point underscored the broader reality that success for one could mean the undoing of the other.
When the two met on the debate stage Tuesday night, neither appeared eager to air the details of what happened at their dinner in December 2018. Sanders stoutly denied again that he said or believes that a woman can't win the presidency. Warren stood by her version of events and used the moment to state forcefully why she is confident a woman can win and might do better than a man against President Trump.

But even if the two appeared ready to declare a truce about their dinner onstage, there is little doubt that they remain on a collision course as voters begin to cast their first votes of the campaign, with the Feb.-3 Iowa caucuses and the Feb.-11 New Hampshire primary the testing grounds that will shape the futures of both.
After the debate wrapped up, Warren appeared to avoid shaking hands with Sanders, and the two appeared to have a testy exchange.
Tuesday's debate at Drake University was the last such event ahead of the caucuses, and it came days before the Senate begins the impeachment trial of the president. The debate highlighted that at a time when any of four candidates appear to have a chance of winning the caucuses, there are two pairings in competition with one another.
Former vice president Joe Biden and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg are appealing to those looking for more modest policy initiatives and calls for unity, with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) trying to break into that competition. Meanwhile, Sanders and Warren are appealing to voters looking for big policy changes and a candidate with a fighting posture. 
Neither Sanders nor Warren is thinking or talking about small-bore politics. Sanders wants a grass-roots revolution to overturn the current power structure. Warren has said, 'We have a better chance of winning a big fight than we do a small fight.' 
For the past year, the two have avoided taking on each other, preferring to focus on those larger visions. In part, that's because they are longtime friends, having met years before Warren moved from academia to politics. They found common cause over the concerns about the hollowing out of the middle class and a shared belief that the economic and political systems are rigged against ordinary Americans.
They still share those assessments of the economy and of the political system. Sanders attacks the billionaire class at every turn. Warren describes the system as one that has been corrupted by money and power. Each has made that message the foundation of their presidential campaigns. And each is wary of alienating voters that are loyal to the other but at some point may be up for grabs.
For the past few months, Warren found herself looking at Buttigieg as a more immediate threat in Iowa. She took a lead in a September Iowa poll by the Des Moines Register and CNN, only to see Buttigieg overtake her in the November poll. 
She and the mayor seemed to be competing in Iowa for the support of more-affluent voters with college degrees. Sanders's campaign saw that as an opening and seized it. Over the weekend, Politico reported that volunteers in the Sanders campaign were being urged to tell voters that Warren was a candidate of the elite "" of the rich and well educated. 
Warren expressed disappointment, and Sanders noted that he had not personally approved the script used by the volunteers, emphasizing that he had not directly attacked Warren at any point since the campaign started. But that hardly resolved the matter. The Sanders campaign criticism appeared designed to cast Warren as a candidate with a narrower appeal.
Then came the story, first reported by CNN, about Sanders's ostensible comments during the dinner conversation in December 2018. Whatever competition exists between Warren and Buttigieg "" and there is some "" the new story was a reminder of the inevitability of the competition between Sanders and Warren.
The biggest issue that has shadowed the candidacies of both Sanders and Warren is whether any nominee who is as liberal as they are, whose agendas would enlarge the role of government as much as each has proposed, can win a general election against Trump. 
But the other question, heard from voters along the campaign trail, is whether any female candidate can capture the White House. It is a question understandably resented by female candidates, but one they nonetheless must confront. Warren did so cogently when the question arose in the debate.
'This question about whether or not a woman can be president has been raised, and it's time for us to attack it head-on,' she said. 'And I think the best way to talk about who can win is by looking at people's winning record . . . Look at the men on this stage. Collectively, they have lost 10 elections. The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in are the women, Amy and me.'
Warren also sought to harness her candidacy to earlier Democratic pathbreakers, noting that in 1962 some questioned if a Catholic could win the presidency and that in 2008 they asked the same about an African American "" but that John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama proved them wrong. 
Sanders said that 'of course' a woman can win the presidency, but added that the central question for Democrats is who is best equipped to defeat Trump, and argued that the energy surrounding his candidacy gives him the strongest chance.
A major factor contributing to the inevitability of a Sanders-Warren clash is the political calendar, with the first two states "" Iowa and New Hampshire "" potentially decisive in determining which one has the support to move to the later contests with momentum.
Iowa has turned into a free-for-all. Sanders was leading in the latest Iowa poll, considered the most reliable indicator of voter attitudes here. Biden is leading in a Monmouth University poll released this week; Warren and Buttigieg both have led in earlier surveys. The order of finish in Iowa now becomes extremely important for all four candidates. 
New Hampshire could be even more consequential, especially for Warren and Sanders, given political history. Both come from states adjacent to New Hampshire, which historically has proven an advantage. 
That gives both of them a potential edge, and whoever finishes behind the other will have suffered a significant setback.
For the next three weeks, the fluidity of the competition in Iowa will consume all the campaigns. The major candidates will be looking at one another, aware that the order of finish, however close, will shape perceptions in ways that all the polls and commentary cannot do.
Sanders sees an opportunity to seize an advantage with a victory here and then in New Hampshire. Biden knows that a victory in Iowa could set him on a course to the nomination. Buttigieg knows that a strong finish here, especially one that puts him ahead of Biden, could be the springboard for his hopes. And Warren counts on her deep organization to surprise those who believe she has fallen back.
There have been surprises over the past year with the ebbs and flows of the polls and candidate performances. But there are some things about the Democratic race that have been clear from the start. One of those is the Warren-Sanders dynamic, and as the days before Iowa continue to dwindle, that has come into clearer focus.

Fiery debate underscores incentive for candidates to remain in the race


LAS VEGAS "" The final question at Wednesday's candidate debate in Nevada provided a telling summary of the state of the Democratic nomination contest. It's now Bernie Sanders against the field.
The question for the six candidates onstage was straightforward. Should the person who wins the most pledged delegates during the primaries, even if he or she does not have a majority, be nominated at the national convention in Milwaukee to become the party's challenger to President Trump? 
Sanders, alone, said yes. The five other candidates said that, in that scenario, the decision of who becomes the nominee should be left to all the delegates at the convention, including the roughly 770 superdelegates "" the party committee members, lawmakers and other high-ranking Democrats who can only vote if the contest goes to a second ballot.
But if there is agreement that Sanders will lead the delegate race, there is similar agreement that he is not likely to be able to win a majority. If that turns out to be the case, Democrats could he headed for a chaotic national convention, one that could split the party and weaken Democrats in the general election, regardless of who ends up as the nominee.
'What's clear out of [Wednesday] night is, it's hard to see what forces will stop Bernie from becoming the front-runner and just as hard to see how there will be any consolidation into a single candidate to oppose him,' Robby Mook, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign manager in 2016, said Thursday morning.
The dawning realization for many in the party is that what Democrats had envisioned as a jubilant national convention in Milwaukee, ground zero in a critical general-election battleground, has the potential to turn into a pitched battle among multiple candidates and their supporters, each representing dueling ideological wings of the party and convinced that the other side would lose to Trump.
Top campaigns have not only staffed up with delegate experts to guide them through the intricacies of the primaries, but they also have built legal teams preparing to challenge any results that don't go their way, according to interviews with 16 top party officials and strategists.
And in preparation for a contested convention, some campaigns have started to reach out to superdelegates, in an attempt to secure support for a second ballot when they would come into play.

'This is going to go to the convention,' said Melvin Poindexter, a Democratic National Committee member from Massachusetts. 'It's going to be a brokered convention. I just don't see any of the candidates coming in and winning the first ballot. Particularly looking at the number of candidates who are running.'
If anything, Wednesday's debate provided incentive for all the candidates trying to become the alternative to Sanders to stay in the race as long as possible. Party strategists agreed that the poor performance by former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg probably eliminated any hopes that he could easily consolidate the moderate-to-center-left wing of the party in opposition to Sanders.
At the same time, the fiery performance by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who not only hammered Bloomberg but also took on many of the others onstage, could give her the encouragement to see the race through to the end, despite third- and fourth-place finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire, respectively. 
Her ability to continue on ultimately will depend on how well she does over the next two weeks and whether she raises enough money to sustain her candidacy. But Wednesday's debate provided a needed jolt. Her presence could affect Sanders's ability to enlarge his coalition.
Warren also took steps to make herself more competitive "" providing tacit approval for the super PAC that has been formed to back her candidacy, effectively contradicting her past comments criticizing groups that take unlimited contributions. And Warren's campaign announced Thursday that it has raised $7-million since last week's New Hampshire primary, setting a new goal to raise another $3-million by Saturday. 
The focus Wednesday night on Bloomberg, and his inability to counter the attacks, proved to be a gift to Sanders. The senator from Vermont did come in for criticism, especially from former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and from Bloomberg, but overall, he avoided the kind of scrutiny and attacks normally aimed at a front-runner.
Still, Sanders left open the question of just how broad his support is or can become. Some strategists saw the debate as potentially pushing Sanders into a narrower ideological corner of the Democratic electorate that could, in time, play to his disadvantage. 
Democratic pollster Stan Greenberg said Sanders's support has come mostly from those who identify themselves as 'very liberal,' a group that constitutes far less than half of the Democratic electorate. 
'Sanders is robustly and self-confidently the most progressive candidate,' Greenberg said. 'The question is, does he have voters beyond the very liberal part of the Democratic electorate?'
All the candidates must get through Saturday's Nevada caucuses, in which Sanders is favored, and the South Carolina primary a week later, an event that is critical to the candidacy of former vice president Joe Biden. 
But the real focus now is on what follows three days after South Carolina, which is Super Tuesday and the beginning of a nationalized campaign for delegates. Sanders is seen as best positioned to do well because he has the money, organization and experience to navigate through a nationalized campaign.
The arcane process that Democrats use to pick nominees puts a premium on candidates who have broad support to win statewide contests, which award a portion of the delegates, and also win individual congressional districts, which account for the rest of the delegates. The process also benefits campaigns that can pinpoint the areas where they can either win a few extra delegates "" or potentially deny an opponent from doing so.
Because there are no winner-take-all contests, delegates are awarded proportionally to any candidate who hits a threshold of 15 percent of the vote. In a field in which there are several candidates competing and reaching that threshold, it becomes difficult for anyone to reach a majority by the end of the primaries. But those same rules give a big advantage to the candidate who gains even a modest lead. For those running behind, making up that ground becomes more and more difficult.

The Las Vegas debate was more evidence that this nominating contest is not like others, in which candidates quickly fall away after poor finishes in early states. At almost every stage so far, events have conspired to keep the field large and fluid. That helps Sanders for now but means the other candidates probably will seek ways to win delegates and stay in the race until the convention.
'I don't see how this is not going to be a brokered convention,' said Nathan Smith, a DNC member from Kentucky. 'Let's be honest: It's a made-for-TV event now.'
Pledged delegates are supposed to vote on the first ballot for the candidate who won in their state or district. But they are freed up on the second ballot to do as they wish, and at that point, the superdelegates are also able to vote for whichever candidate they choose.
'I don't think it's going to be a chair-throwing fiasco,' said Grace Carrington, a committee member from Florida. 'But we know there's going to be a second, maybe a third vote.'
Party leaders worry they could be heading toward a convention collision. 
'I fear divisions within the party might be our biggest problem,' said Cynthia Busch, a committee member from Florida, who was a Sanders delegate in 2016 and is currently uncommitted. 
Wendy Davis, a committee member from Georgia, said she would urge everyone to remain positive and not fall into needless conflict. 
'I'm very troubled that we're setting up for a circular firing squad,' she said.
Sheikh Rahman, a committee member from Georgia, said he has heard from the Buttigieg, Biden and Sanders campaigns recently but is making no commitments. If it comes to a contested convention, he plans to survey scores of state committee members to help him determine which candidate to support at the convention.
'I'm trying to stay on the sideline at the moment and see what happens,' he said. 'I'm just taking the safe route.'
Former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, also a former DNC chair, predicted that any candidate who enters the convention with a large plurality would win the nomination. 'If it's close,' he added, 'that's a different reality.' 
Rahm Emanuel, the former mayor of Chicago, warned that the convention could descend into chaos unless steps are taken soon to assure that those in charge in Milwaukee are experts on the rules and with personalities and stature strong enough to wield a gavel effectively.
'The chair of the convention is not for the fainthearted,' he said. '[DNC Chair Tom] Perez had better organize it, because you're going to need it. There's going to be a fight. The chairman of the party better have a war room for the convention.'

Ten days from the Iowa caucuses, several Democratic presidential candidates are seeking to temper expectations in the early nominating states, casting the primary race as a long-haul slog that will inevitably play out in elections across the nation.
In other words: Don't pay too much attention to what happens in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina, some of the campaigns now seem to be suggesting "" unless, of course, their candidates are the ones who emerge with clear wins.
The efforts to shift the focus to a national one come as four candidates "" former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg "" remain in a tight cluster in Iowa. Sanders and Biden are holding a narrow advantage in New Hampshire. 
'The four early states contests are just the beginning,' Warren's campaign manager, Roger Lau, wrote in a memo distributed to supporters Friday. The text appeared under a graphic showing images of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, which all caucus or vote in February, under a caption noting those states award only 155 delegates, or '3.9% of the total,' a statistic that was underlined in red.
The memo was particularly striking because of the importance the Warren campaign has long placed on a strong showing in Iowa, where it has worked for a year to build what even other campaigns have acknowledged is the strongest organization.
Lau made no predictions about Warren's finish in Iowa or New Hampshire, but instead forecast that the contest will be competitive through at least March 3, or Super Tuesday, when 14 states will vote in primaries and roughly 34-percent of the pledged delegates are awarded.
To clinch the Democratic nomination, a candidate will need to win a majority of the 3,979 pledged delegates up for grabs this spring. (The Democratic Party has an additional 760 or so superdelegates who can vote if no candidate wins the majority on the first ballot at its July convention.)
'We expect this to be a long nomination fight and have built our campaign to sustain well past Super Tuesday and stay resilient no matter what breathless media narratives come when voting begins,' Lau wrote.
Biden's camp has similarly tried to convince would-be supporters of his national strength, in case he demonstrates early weakness. Last year, his campaign sought to make a case that he did not have to win Iowa or New Hampshire, pointing to his strengths in more diverse Nevada and South Carolina, the third and fourth states to vote.
In New Hampshire on Friday, the former vice president asked the crowd to look beyond the early states. He insisted he is the candidate most likely to beat Trump in general-election battlegrounds, and that his coattails would help Democrats across the country get elected.
'And we not only have to beat Donald Trump, as was pointed out earlier, we have to win in states that will win us back the United States Senate,' Biden said in Claremont. 'Because, folks, we can do that. We have to be able to win in North Carolina. We have to be able to win Georgia Senate seats. And in Arizona. Not just in my home state of Pennsylvania.' 
A new 30-second Biden ad, which began airing Friday in Iowa, devoted several seconds to screens of polling data and graphs showing Biden leading Trump in battleground states "" perhaps the most visual appeal yet to undecided Iowans who have become pundit-like as they weigh whom to support on Feb. 3.
'This is no time to take a risk. We need our strongest candidate,' the ad stated. 'So let's nominate the Democrat Trump fears the most. Vote Biden. Beat Trump.'
Sanders, who last fall rolled out 'Bernie Beats Trump' messaging focused on the general election, also has a robust operation for the next phase of the primary race, particularly in California, which awards more than 400 delegates. He and any other candidates who stay in the race past February also will have to contend with former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who sidestepped the early contests but is spending hundreds of millions of dollars from his own fortune to be competitive starting in the March primaries.
While some of his competitors have downplayed the role Iowa could have in their candidacies, Buttigieg has been open about the need to do well there. Asked about his struggles to build support in South Carolina and early voting states beyond Iowa, Buttigieg said Wednesday that he knows his success elsewhere is tied directly to what happens in Iowa. 
'A lot can happen in those final days, especially because there are going to be a lot of folks there looking to see what we candidates can demonstrate and prove right here [in Iowa],' Buttigieg said. 'It's a whole new chapter of the campaign on the ground in South Carolina "" in Nevada for that matter, too "" after we've been able to demonstrate our strength in a place like Iowa and New Hampshire.'
Asked many times if he needs to win in Iowa to demonstrate that strength, Buttigieg said, 'I'm not going to create a goal post.' 
In town halls, Buttigieg has emphasized that the idea he is contending at all is remarkable, regardless of what happens next "" often recalling the days when no one could pronounce his name "" while also in recent weeks explicitly telling voters that 'winning the Iowa caucuses' is possible. 

Perhaps more than any other candidate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) is banking on a strong finish in Iowa to remain competitive in the race "" not only for the boost it would give her, but also because she has repeatedly marketed herself as a pragmatist who can win over both rural and suburban voters in Midwestern states. However, the latest Des Moines Register poll showed her with only 6 percent support in Iowa, significantly below the four front-runners, who are all clustered between 15 and 20 percent.

How many candidates are still in this for the Democrats?

Even longtime campaign reporters have to pause and silently count on their fingers whenever the question comes up. As of this writing, a dozen Democrats are still running for president.

Not all of them will be on every state's ballot. For example, billionaire Mike Bloomberg, a former mayor of New York, entered the race in November, and immediately said he would skip the early nominating states to focus on Super Tuesday states and beyond "" to the grumbling of some voters and party officials in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina.
Is President Trump guaranteed to be the Republican nominee?
With all due respect to Republican challengers such as Joe Walsh and Bill Weld, President Trump will almost certainly be the Republican presidential nominee.
Some states, including Arizona, Nevada and South Carolina, have canceled their GOP primaries or caucuses, citing an opportunity to save taxpayer money in the face of, they say, an inevitable Trump win. Of course, with Trump's impeachment trial underway in the Senate, there's always a chance that the Republican nominee could end up being someone other than Trump.
What about third-party candidates?

How much time do you have?

On the Democratic side, what are the story lines we should be watching as the voting begins? Why pay attention to Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire and South Carolina "" four states without a lot of delegates?
The ultimate 'story line,' of course, is which Democratic candidate emerges from the primary with the majority of the party's 3,979 pledged delegates, making him or her the party's nominee to challenge Trump in this fall's general election.
It's true that the four early-nominating states account for only 155 delegates, or less than 4-percent of the total. But traditionally, a win in Iowa "" the first state to caucus, on Feb. 3 "" can turbocharge a campaign and convince nervous voters that a particular candidate is electable.
Having a strong showing in Iowa has been a clear priority for some Democrats, such as Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.); Pete Buttigieg, a former mayor of South Bend, Ind.; and businessman Andrew Yang. Others, including former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) have tried to play down the importance of Iowa and New Hampshire, focusing in turn on a longer-haul national race. Bloomberg, as mentioned earlier, is skipping the first four nominating states entirely. 
What is Super Tuesday, and what should we be looking for on that day? Are there other days with large numbers of delegates at stake?
'Super Tuesday' "" Tuesday, March 3 "" is the day that 14 states will vote in Democratic primaries, and 1,357 of the pledged delegates are up for grabs. That makes up one-third of the total available pledged delegates, and it has the potential to shift the race.
The Super Tuesday states include Alabama, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, and Virginia. American Samoa will also hold a Democratic caucus on Super Tuesday, while some Democrats living abroad will be able to vote starting March 3.
There are other dates on which multiple states vote and large numbers of delegates are at stake, but none has as catchy a nickname.
On Tuesday, March 10, 352 delegates will be up for grabs from Idaho, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota and Washington.
On Tuesday, March 17, Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio will vote, awarding 577 delegates.
And on Tuesday, April 28, voters in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island will decide how 663 delegates are divvied up.
How long will it all last? Is it possible that we will not know who the Democratic nominee is when the convention begins? What are 'superdelegates,' and do they still exist after 2016?
Democratic primaries in states and U.S. territories will stretch into early summer; the last one will be held in the U.S. Virgin Islands on June 6, when seven delegates will be awarded. Presumably the Democratic nominee "" the person with a clear majority of pledged delegates "" will be clear by then. Or clearer, at least.
Or not clear at all! It is possible, especially if few candidates drop out along the way, that no one will have more than half of the pledged delegates by the time the Democratic National Convention is held in mid-July.
In that case, myriad scenarios could play out: For instance, on the first vote, pledged delegates "" who can technically vote for whomever they want "" could align themselves differently from their statewide distribution numbers, perhaps based on behind-the-scenes dealmaking between the campaigns.

There will still be 'superdelegates' "" mostly party insiders "" who can vote at the Democratic convention, but under new Democratic National Committee rules, they will do so only if a second round of ballots is required.
How long will the process last? Well, technically, the beauty of living in a democracy means that the next election cycle is never far away. 
We'll do this all again in four years.

Leader quells budding revolt in ranks
Both sides take Senate floor to press issue of fairness
The first substantive day of President Trump's impeachment trial opened Tuesday with unexpected internal GOP dissension over its structure, as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) was forced to revise his proposed rules at the last minute to accommodate a brewing rebellion in his ranks.
Under the updated guidelines, both sides will receive more time to present their cases, and findings from the House impeachment probe will automatically be entered into evidence as part of the trial.
The concerns over the rules underscored the narrowness of the majority that McConnell will have to tend to as Trump's impeachment trial proceeds, while also balancing the demands of a White House that has repeatedly pushed for a swift acquittal of the president.
The Republican dispute unfolded as the House impeachment managers and the president's legal team took to the floor of the Senate chamber to lay out their cases on the two charges against Trump: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to his alleged attempts to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on a political rival.
Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told senators that the most important question confronting them was whether to accept a structure that Democrats said would not produce a fair trial as he argued for Trump's removal from office.
'If the House cannot call witnesses or introduce documents and evidence, it's not a fair trial,' Schiff said. 'It's not really a trial at all.'
In response, the president's lead lawyers also pressed the issue of fairness, arguing that House Democrats had rushed through a process that deprived Trump of his due process rights and that Trump should not have been impeached at all.
'A partisan impeachment is like stealing an election. And that's exactly what we have,' White House Counsel Pat Cipollone said. 'Talk about the framers' worst nightmare. It's a partisan impeachment that they delivered to your doorstep in an election year.'
Two points in McConnell's initial resolution that established how the trial would be run drew concern from several Republicans: a provision that would have compressed 24-hours of opening arguments into two days for each side, and language that would not automatically admit evidence from the House impeachment probe unless there were a formal vote to include it. In a closed-door party lunch before the trial day began Tuesday afternoon, a number of Republican senators protested those portions of the resolution, according to multiple officials familiar with the meeting.
GOP senators who raised questions about the evidence issue were concerned that it would give Democrats easy ammunition to portray Republicans as being unfair, according to two of the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the senators' sentiments. Many Republicans were also upset that pushing 24-hours of opening arguments into two days for each side "" a restriction that was not included in the rules for President Bill Clinton's trial in 1999 "" would give the appearance that the GOP was rushing the trial.
Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) said Republicans thought that 'if we did try to rush it or compress it, that that might not be the best thing to do.'
One of the senators most upset about the initial provisions was Susan Collins (R-Maine), who will be a key swing vote on procedural matters during the trial. But the concerns spread beyond a closely watched core of potential GOP swing senators, with Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) also among those voicing objections in the closed-door lunch about the two-day timetable. That provision didn't please Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), either. One Republican official with direct knowledge of the discussion described it as 'lots of dissension and chaos.'
Democrats seized on the changes as proof that a small clutch of GOP senators facing public opposition to any component of the highly contentious trial could force McConnell to reverse course, though the Republican leader was expected to win all 53 GOP votes in favor of his measure by the end.
'The public realizes how unfair the McConnell proposal is, and the pressure that we have put on them and on Republican senators has gotten them to change,' Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters. 'There are still many other things that are unfair, particularly in relationship to witnesses, particularly in relationship to documents.'
Now, both the Democratic impeachment managers and Trump's defense team will have up to three days each to make their case, and evidence from the House will be entered automatically unless there is an objection. 
The White House had initially requested condensing the opening arguments into two days for each side, according to several people familiar with the drafting. One senior administration official said it had done so while cautioning that the language could change depending on the needs of Trump and various senators, and that the number of days for opening arguments was a lower priority for the White House.
On other issues, Republicans killed attempts from Democrats to modify the parameters of the proceedings to allow for an assortment of documents and a slate of witnesses at the outset.
In a sign of fatigue, at least on the GOP side, McConnell (R-Ky.) halted the trial proceedings shortly before 9:30 p.m. in a bid to negotiate an end to the hours-long debate that seemed destined to go on for much longer. But after a brief recess that allowed for senators to talk, the two sides did not reach a deal to speed things up. 

'There will be a good number of votes,' Schumer said. 'We are willing to do some of those votes tomorrow. There is not reason we have to do them all tonight and inconvenience the Senate and the chief justice. But we will not back off on getting votes on all of these amendments, which we regard as extremely significant and important to the country.'
Earlier in the debate, Schumer and Senate Democrats forced an attempt to subpoena documents kept by the White House "" including the National Security Council "" as well as separate efforts to obtain records from the State Department, the Pentagon and the Office of Management and Budget. Democrats also pushed to summon acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and other administration witnesses that Democrats had demanded for weeks. All were rejected on party-line votes.
Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), one of the seven House impeachment managers, argued that the White House was sitting on hundreds of pages of relevant materials. She played video of key House witnesses who said they had submitted notes about discrepancies in the rough transcript of Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on July-25 that has been at the heart of the case against the president "" as well as a core part of his defense.
'Attorney-client privilege cannot shield information about misconduct,' Lofgren said.
Trump was impeached Dec.-18 by the House on charges that he held up nearly $400-million of congressionally appropriated aid to Ukraine and a coveted White House visit for Zelensky as a condition for the Eastern European nation launching an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden "" a potential 2020 rival for the White House "" and his son Hunter.
The president's attorneys have argued that the requests from Trump were related to his concerns about corruption. Hunter Biden had served on the board of Burisma, Ukraine's largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment, although Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing.
Amid the vigorous debate about his Ukraine dealings, Trump was in Davos, Switzerland, meeting with other global leaders and touting U.S. economic prosperity at the World Economic Forum. In brief remarks to reporters in Davos, Trump dismissed his impeachment as a 'hoax.'
'It goes nowhere because nothing happened. The only thing we've done is a great job,' Trump said. 'That whole thing is a total hoax, so I'm sure it's going to work out fine.'
About 45 minutes after the Senate trial began, Trump tweeted: 'READ THE TRANSCRIPTS!' "" part of his persistent argument that the record of his call with Zelensky absolves him of wrongdoing.
Through the hours of arguments, all 100 senators sat silent at their desks, barred from their smartphones and with many of them taking prodigious notes. Among the members of the public that were spotted in the half-full galleries in the Senate chamber were former senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and actress and activist Alyssa Milano.
At one point, Cipollone sought to focus attention on four senators who are seeking the Democratic presidential nomination but who must be in attendance at the trial, saying that 'some of you are upset because you should be in Iowa right now.' Several senators cast glances toward one of those candidates, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who was watching Cipollone's remarks with his elbows on the arms of his chair, hands folded in front of his face.
Both Cipollone and Jay Sekulow, one of Trump's outside attorneys, relayed inaccurate statements during the trial.
Sekulow claimed that the White House was not allowed to have a lawyer present during the impeachment hearings spearheaded by the House Judiciary Committee; the White House was allowed to participate but declined to do so. Cipollone also falsely argued that House Republicans had no access to the secure facilities where closed-door depositions of key House witnesses were taken late last year.

The Justice Department in the Trump era has repeatedly tasked U.S. attorneys from far-flung offices to parachute into politically explosive cases in Washington, raising concerns among current and former officials that agency leaders are trying to please the president by reviewing and reinvestigating cases in which he is personally or politically invested. 
After a tumultuous week for federal law enforcement in which Attorney General William P. Barr declared he could not do his job if the president kept tweeting about criminal cases, and officials revealed they had dropped one politically charged case while adding new prosecutors to others, several current and former officials expressed alarm at what they characterized as a troubling pattern.
'The power to investigate is the power to destroy,' said Gregory A. Brower, a former U.S. attorney and former senior FBI official. The current approach to sensitive cases, he said, 'gives the appearance of politics coming into play whenever the president has a perceived political enemy. . . . The ability to simply point to a pending investigation against a person can have devastating effects on that person and can have a potential political benefit to the person orchestrating the investigation.'
On Friday, prosecutors said they would no longer pursue a criminal case against Andrew McCabe, the former acting FBI director who has long been a target of Trump's vitriol. 
The decision infuriated the president, according to a senior White House official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail internal discussions. Trump ranted privately to associates about the announcement, telling one he's always known McCabe was a 'bad guy.' 
While the president is angry over the decision not to charge McCabe with lying to investigators during a leak investigation, he is unlikely to fire Barr over the matter, people familiar with the matter said. 

Aides have urged the president not to say much publicly about the McCabe decision, and so far he has mostly heeded that advice. On Saturday morning, Trump fired off a tweet summarizing the Justice Department inspector general's findings that McCabe misled investigators on four separate occasions about authorizing a media disclosure and stating, incorrectly, that the 'IG RECOMMENDED MCCABE'S FIRING.'
Inspector General Michael Horowitz made a criminal referral of McCabe's conduct to prosecutors, but did not specifically advise that he be fired. McCabe was fired in 2018 just as he was about to retire, costing him significant pension benefits.
Trump advisers viewed the president's tweet as the best they could have hoped for on the subject, the senior White House official said. 
Shortly after the McCabe announcement on Friday, officials said that Barr had assigned Jeff Jensen, the U.S. attorney in St. Louis, to review and 'assist' prosecutors currently handling the case of Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who is still awaiting sentencing after having pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI during its investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The Jensen appointment marks the latest iteration of an unusual trend inside the Justice Department of tasking outside U.S. attorneys with reviewing, managing, or reinvestigating work that would otherwise not be in their portfolio. Much of the effort seems aimed at re-examining the work of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, whose probe of possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign infuriated the president, or at targeting the president's foes.

In 2017, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions appointed Utah's U.S. attorney, John Huber, to investigate old corruption allegations against Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and Trump's opponent in the 2016 campaign, on issues that had been covered previously by other federal prosecutors. That assignment came amid pressure from Republican lawmakers for appointment of a second special counsel. 
The next year, the Justice Department tasked the U.S. attorney in Chicago, John Lausch, to oversee the turnover to Congress of internal FBI documents about Clinton. 
Last year, Barr tapped Connecticut's U.S. attorney, John Durham, to investigate how U.S. intelligence agencies investigated Russian interference in the last presidential election.
More recently, Barr assigned Scott W. Brady, the U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh, to take information from Trump's personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who wants to provide the Justice Department with material alleging wrongdoing related to former vice president Joe Biden and his family. 
And now, the top federal prosecutor from St. Louis is working on the Flynn case that has long been handled by federal prosecutors in D.C.
Taken together, the moves have fueled suspicion inside and outside the department.
Such decisions are not unprecedented. In 2009, President Obama's first attorney general, Eric Holder, expanded an investigation Durham was conducting into the treatment of detained terror suspects, and at the time, many in the intelligence community bristled at the idea that conduct that had been investigated once already would be investigated again.
But it is highly unusual to do this as often as the Trump administration has.
'If this Justice Department had done it once, you might understand, but they have done it over and over, and it's only ever to re-examine an outcome that the president didn't like,' said Matthew Miller, a former spokesman for Holder, who said the practice does 'enormous harm' to the department's reputation. 'When you are constantly launching politically motivated probes, the public can't tell which investigations are legitimate and which are political, and ultimately they question everything. And that is clearly part of the goal.'
​A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Inside the Justice Department and U.S. attorney's offices around the country, career employees took a wide range of views on Barr's recent actions "" particularly his extraordinary Thursday interview with ABC News, when he said Trump's commentary makes it 'impossible for me to do my job.'
Some inside the department were heartened by his remarks. 'Finally,' one career Justice Department employee told The Washington Post.

But others were more skeptical "" wondering if Barr and Trump had orchestrated the interview as a means to provide the attorney general with political cover to continue executing influence over the cases Trump has fixated on most. That cynicism only grew deeper when it was revealed new prosecutors had been added to the Flynn case.
People close to the attorney general say his frustration with Trump is genuine, and that Barr had privately expressed his concerns to the president more than once in recent weeks. When those efforts did not seem to have the desired effect, Barr decided to speak out publicly, these people said.
Current and former officials said the move to add new prosecutors to the Flynn case seemed to be part of a new pattern of Justice Department political leadership spinning up inquiries that might help Trump and his friends and hurt their perceived foes.
David Laufman, a former chief of the Justice Department's Counterintelligence and Export Control Section, said such reviews are 'enormously demoralizing, certainly for the U.S. attorney's office in D.C., and I would imagine throughout the Department of Justice and U.S. attorneys offices nationwide.'
Laufman said he was baffled at why the various U.S. attorneys accept such missions. 'Why would they be associating themselves with investigations that are evocative of the manner in which repressive regimes throughout history have behaved?'
Representatives for Durham and Jensen did not respond to questions for this report. A spokeswoman for Brady declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Huber also declined to comment.

Move by Va. former governor, DNC chair could show establishment support
The campaign of former vice president Joe Biden is making plans to recast him as the clear favorite of party leaders after his expected win Saturday in South Carolina, hoping to create momentum that will allow him to outperform moderate rivals on Super Tuesday and position him as the only viable alternative to Sen. Bernie Sanders. 
A major focus of the effort is securing endorsements from prominent Democratic figures before Tuesday, when 14 states cast their primary votes. Former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe has told associates he may endorse Biden on Sunday if Biden can pull off a strong first-place finish Saturday, according to a person familiar with McAuliffe's thinking. 
McAuliffe would join Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and former defense secretary and California congressman Leon Panetta. Both announced their support of Biden on Friday, hoping to give him a boost since Virginia and California both hold primaries March 3, also called Super Tuesday.
Their endorsements came shortly after that of Rep. James E. Clyburn, the most powerful Democrat in South Carolina, who announced Wednesday he was backing Biden. A person familiar with the Biden campaign's thinking said officials expect to see a stream of endorsements if Biden performs well in South Carolina.
The campaign's hope is to create the clear sense for voters that Biden is the consensus alternative among party leaders to Sanders (I-Vt.), a democratic socialist who some party leaders believe would have a narrower electoral college path against President Trump, potentially putting the Democratic House majority at risk and making it harder to recapture the Senate. 
""We're at an inflection point in this race and, as Joe Biden has said, he's not a socialist or a plutocrat - he's a Democrat,"" said Andrew Bates, a Biden campaign spokesman. ""The vice president's in very good company in that respect, and the stakes of beating Donald Trump in crucial battleground states are drawing them off the sidelines.""
A second Biden adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the campaign hopes the South Carolina result will mark a clear pivot in the race.
""We anticipate and hope to see momentum coming out of South Carolina, not just because we win, which we hope we will, but because we've put a damper on Bernie's momentum,"" that person said. ""No other candidate has shown an ability to put a stop on his momentum.""
There is little evidence that voters take their cues from the preferences of party elders. Rather, the Biden campaign's goal is to generate a sense of momentum and end a stretch of the campaign that has seen Sanders take a clear lead in the nomination fight, winning or coming close in the first three contests, while the party's centrists have been unable to rally around a single alternative.
Even if Biden prevails in South Carolina, however, he probably would struggle to catch up to Sanders. The senator from Vermont is polling strongly in many Super Tuesday states, including the big prize of California, forcing any would-be competitor to play catch-up. 
At a recent retreat for Senate Democrats in Baltimore, one participant described the mood as ""like a funeral"" because of concerns that Sanders is headed to the nomination. That person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions, said the broad expectation was that Biden would try to cast himself as the only person who could stop Trump's reelection if he wins big on Saturday. 
The other Democratic candidates are also preparing strategies to frame the South Carolina results, given the stakes the following Tuesday, when 34 percent of the party's convention delegates will be awarded. 
Sanders's campaign released a memo Friday describing him as ""by far - the candidate who is best positioned to defeat Donald Trump in the general election."" The memo appeared aimed at making the case that even if Sanders does not win Saturday, he remains the Democrats' best choice.
Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, whose steady rise in public polls has stalled since a disappointing debate performance in Nevada, said in an interview with MSNBC that he is committed to staying in the race ""as long as I have a chance."" 
""Yeah, I'm running a race, and I'm behind with one lap to go. What, am I going to quit? No, you run harder,"" Bloomberg said. 
Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) have been boosted by significant recent television advertising investments on their behalf by supportive super PACs, which can take unlimited donations but do not coordinate directly with the campaigns. A separate group backing Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) is spending money in key states such as Colorado. 
The Biden campaign has bought $2.2 million in broadcast and digital advertising across the Super Tuesday states, according to the campaign's data. The tracking firm Advertising Analytics reports that overall, Democrats have spent $247 million in advertising in the Super Tuesday states, driven by a massive investment by Bloomberg. 
After leading national polls for a year, Biden notched deeply disappointing performances in the first two contests, finishing fourth in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire.
But after the Clyburn endorsement and a second-place finish in Nevada, Biden is now favored to win South Carolina, according to recent polls, although the size of his expected victory remains uncertain. His margin of victory will be a factor in McAuliffe's decision, said the person familiar with his thinking, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations. 
A Biden campaign spokesman declined to comment on McAuliffe, while a McAuliffe spokesman said the former governor ""has not made a decision on an endorsement.""
McAuliffe is an influential figure among Democratic leaders, and in some ways, he embodies the party establishment. McAuliffe chaired the Democratic National Committee and has close ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, holding top positions with their presidential campaigns. He also contemplated a presidential run himself this year.
He has been neutral in the race so far, although he held a fundraiser in November for Biden at his home in McLean. About 115 guests stood around McAuliffe's pool as the former governor described how Biden had helped Virginia as vice president, securing grants for the state and fighting to clean the Shenandoah River. 
""We've got to get America back to where people get along, where we have alliances around the world and everybody loves the United States of America,"" McAuliffe said, adding that Trump's ""insanity"" had led the country ""off the rails."" 
McAuliffe's wife, Dorothy, is backing Biden and is kicking off a get-out-the-vote event Saturday in Alexandria. At the November fundraiser she called Biden ""a great man,"" a ""great public servant"" and the Democrat who has ""the best chance of beating Donald Trump.""
Biden is scheduled to attend a rally at Booker T. Washington High School in Norfolk on Sunday evening, which could provide a platform for a McAuliffe announcement.

Bernie Sanders signaled Wednesday that he was open to ending his presidential run after another round of landslide losses to Joe Biden, and new signs emerged of communication between the two camps as some Democrats hoped for a swift end to a bruising primary.
Sanders campaign officials said the senator from Vermont planned to leave Washington and return home, where he and his wife, Jane, would talk to supporters and determine the future of his presidential run. The campaign also suspended its Facebook ads and, uncharacteristically, made no request for donations in an email to backers updating them on the situation. 
Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said that aides to the two candidates have been in touch regularly to discuss the public health crisis that has gripped the country, disclosing talks that could form the basis of a broader agreement on policies and might make Sanders more comfortable leaving the race.
The two campaigns ""have been in regular contact at a senior level"" since last week to discuss how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting the campaigns, Bedingfield said in a statement to The Washington Post, ""as well as to discuss both Vice President Biden's and Senator Sanders' ideas on policy responses to the virus.""
She added: ""While the two campaigns obviously have their differences, they are working together to try to promote the health and safety of their teams, those who interact with the campaigns, and the American people."" Sanders communications director Mike Casca confirmed her characterization of the talks. 
Biden campaign officials have also adopted an internal policy of no longer attacking Sanders, according to one of them, even as some surrogates for the former vice president increased public pressure on the senator to step aside. This person spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.
The moves are the clearest signs yet that Sanders is giving serious thought to ending his campaign, which fell further behind on Tuesday night after a drubbing in three more primaries, and that Biden's team is eager to offer olive branches to ease a potential departure. 
If Sanders does exit, the Democratic Party will immediately confront the challenge of avoiding the type of bitter split that damaged the party in 2016, when the Sanders and Hillary Clinton camps remained at odds after she captured the nomination. Many Democrats think that dispute contributed to Clinton's loss in the general election and hope to unify more fully this time as they prepare to take on President Trump.
Sanders officials cautioned Wednesday that the senator had made no final decision and remained a candidate, leaving open the possibility that he might continue his campaign in the months ahead despite having little chance at the nomination. And tensions between supporters of both candidates raised doubts about their ability to come together quickly or smoothly. 
""No sugarcoating it, last night did not go the way we wanted,"" Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir said in an unusually solemn email to supporters that requested no money. After flying to Vermont, Sanders and his wife intend to consult supporters and seek ""input and assess the path forward for our campaign,"" Shakir added. 
Biden won double-digit victories in Florida, Arizona and Illinois on Tuesday, continuing a dominant three-week stretch in which he has built a nearly insurmountable lead in delegates to the Democrats' nominating convention in July. 
Adding to Sanders's challenges, those three contests could be the last in the near future, giving him little opportunity to change the narrative or trajectory of the campaign. The novel coronavirus has hampered the primary season and cast a cloud of uncertainty over the coming weeks. 
Several states have pushed back their nominating contests in an effort to avoid large gatherings, and the candidates have suspended rallies and town halls.
Many Biden allies were anxious on Wednesday to bring an end to the competition, fearing that a prolonged battle would undermine the party's ability to win in November and create unnecessary health risks for prospective voters. 
""Bernie is the person - the one person - who can essentially give the Biden campaign permission to start the general election, to start talking to the [Democratic National Committee], to start building the general election operation we need,"" said Rufus Gifford, a former ambassador to Denmark and a top Biden fundraiser. ""That's why it matters sooner rather than later.""
Sanders spent the day in Washington attending to business in the Senate, where lawmakers were working on legislation to soften the blow of the pandemic. He told reporters on Capitol Hill that he planned to evaluate his future, echoing the statement from his campaign. 
Sanders brushed aside a question from a CNN reporter about his potential departure, snapping that he was dealing with a ""global crisis"" and appending an expletive at the start of his words. 
Rather than speak about the primaries Tuesday night, Sanders had unveiled a plan to combat the coronavirus, laying out a $2 trillion proposal he later posted on his campaign website that would enable Medicare to cover all related medical bills and force the government to provide $2,000 monthly payments to Americans. 
For many Sanders supporters, the crisis has become a real-life example of why the suite of liberal policies he has long championed - including a Medicare-for-all government insurance program - is so urgently needed. 
If anything, they say, the coronavirus gives him more justification to stay in the contest and promote his ideas. And regardless of Sanders's decision, his most fiery supporters may be slow to join the Biden bandwagon.
""Just think about the difference it would have made had we had single-payer health care in this country when coronavirus hit,"" said Derrick Crowe, a spokesman for the pro-Sanders group People's Action. ""We need to see [Biden's] platform rise to that occasion.""
Some Sanders confidants have said that beyond the policy pulpit an extended campaign would give them, there is an added incentive: collecting delegates and building leverage at the national convention to shape influential committees and press for the party to adopt liberal positions on health care, climate change and the economy. 
But other Democrats said that continuing the campaign could undermine Sanders's credibility, particularly as the delegate math is so daunting. Biden has opened up a lead of 234 pledged delegates over Sanders, with fewer than half of the total left up for grabs. 
""I think there's every reason in the world for Bernie to assess and get out,"" said Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.), a Biden supporter, including the health and safety of older voters more susceptible to the coronavirus. 
""I definitely think it is"" irresponsible if Sanders stays in, Beyer added. 
Former congressman Steve Israel of New York, who once headed the House Democrats' campaign organization, said that prolonging the party's divides could endanger its efforts in the fall. ""The bigger risk is that we go into the fall facing Donald Trump with an unlimited checkbook and as a dispirited and divided Democratic Party,"" Israel said.
Some Democrats said that instead of Sanders remaining a candidate, he could assert his influence by securing an agreement from the Biden campaign to adopt some of his positions before pulling out. Already, Biden has embraced a Sanders plan to make public colleges and universities tuition-free for students whose families make less than $125,000.
And Biden extended an olive branch to Sanders supporters in a Tuesday speech: ""Let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders, I hear you. I know what's at stake,"" Biden said as the results came in. ""I know what we have to do.""
Rep. Andy Levin (D-Mich.), who endorsed Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts in the primary, said bringing together the two wings of the Democratic Party would require careful choreography. He said Biden's recent announcement that he'd select a woman as his running mate, and endorsing Warren's recommended overhaul of bankruptcy rules, were a good start. 
But Levin said he was disappointed that Biden told progressives that he knew what needed to be done. ""That's not it,"" Levin said. ""This is work that needs to be done to bring people together."" Levin added that he wanted Biden to ""back away from"" attacks on Medicare-for-all and frame it at least as a goal.
The Biden and Sanders camps, representing the final two major candidates in the race, opened lines of communication some time ago. Before the last Democratic debate, Anita Dunn and Jeff Weaver, senior advisers to Biden and Sanders, respectively, discussed the arrangements, according to a person with knowledge of the talks. This person also spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations. The pair decided not to have an audience and discussed how the stage would be set up.
The coronavirus outbreak has given the campaigns an area for negotiation that encompasses many of the fights Sanders cares most passionately about - providing health care to more Americans, reducing economic inequality and curbing the power of wealthy corporations. 
Still, many Sanders supporters are distrustful of Biden, citing his history of working with Republicans. They have been unimpressed by his coronavirus response, favoring the more dramatic measures Sanders has advocated. Some Sanders supporters signaled that they are beginning to accept the reality of Biden's likely victory.
Alan Minsky, executive director of the pro-Sanders group Progressive Democrats of America, said Biden has a history of ""not coming down on the progressive side of the party."" Still, he added, ""Biden is a savvy politician, so it's not hopeless to think that he might really shift his approach."" 
Shakir, the Sanders campaign manager, indicated in a statement that Sanders was in no rush to decide. ""The next primary contest is at least three weeks away,"" he said, adding that Sanders would be laser-focused on the coronavirus.

Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg has vowed to spend what it takes from his billionaire bankroll to help Bernie Sanders win the White House if the senator secures the Democratic nomination. 
But Bloomberg is also on record saying Sanders (I-Vt.) has no hope of victory. 'I don't think there's any chance of the senator beating President Trump,' he said Wednesday in the Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas.
The contradiction points to the twisted logic that is set to dominate Tuesday's debate in South Carolina. The six other candidates onstage have about a week left to blunt Sanders's momentum, according to multiple analyses by rival candidates. They say Sanders is on track to emerge from the Super Tuesday primaries on March 3 with an insurmountable lead in the delegate hunt.
But after giving Sanders a pass for most of the year, any attacks Democrats launch on the self-described democratic socialist could undermine the party's chance of beating Trump in November if Sanders becomes the nominee. They also risk a backlash from voters who have repeatedly punished candidates who go negative on other Democrats in this race.
'There is always a reticence to want to get on the bad side of someone who is going to be the potential nominee and president,' said Tim Miller, who advised former Florida governor Jeb Bush when he found himself in a similar position with Trump in the 2016 GOP primary. 'With Trump looming, I think Democrats are going to be especially skittish to want to be seen as doing anything that is helping an absolutely loathed incumbent president.' 
The result is that Sanders's rivals have been moving gingerly to shift their messages since he swept the Nevada caucuses Saturday, winning about 34-percent of the vote and 67-percent of the national delegates. Rather than target him over the underlying concern about whether he is capable of beating Trump, they have largely been attacking him from the left, arguing that he is not sufficiently aligned with the Democratic Party's core values. 
Bloomberg and former vice president Joe Biden have circulated archival
video in recent days that shows Sanders defending his votes in Congress to protect gun manufacturers from liability for mass shootings. Biden has also hit Sanders for his past consideration of a primary challenge against 'our first African American president,' Barack Obama, during the 2012 cycle.
'When it comes to building on President Obama's legacy, Bernie Sanders just can't be trusted,' says an online video distributed Monday by the Biden campaign. 
At a rally in Denver on Sunday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) went after Sanders over the more obscure topic of Senate procedure. 
'Bernie supports the filibuster,' she said to loud cheers from a crowd of about 7,000 people. 'I'm going to get rid of the filibuster.'
The other billionaire in the race, Tom Steyer, who is in third place in a South Carolina polling average by The Washington Post after spending more money on the state than anyone else, is expected to make a more targeted attack on Sanders at the debate and in paid advertising before the Super Tuesday primaries. 
'Tom is going to aggressively make the economic case against the socialist policies of Bernie Sanders this week in South Carolina "" in particular, that Sanders policies are bad for the country and bad for working people,' said one aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss campaign strategy. 
The rapid ascent of Sanders, who won the popular vote in Iowa and the next two contests in New Hampshire and Nevada, seems to have taken many of his rivals by surprise. They spent much of past year privately arguing that Sanders had a ceiling of support that would prevent his nomination in a party where a majority of voters consider themselves moderates. 
But Sanders has shown he can broaden his coalition from the 2016 election, winning strong support among Nevada Latinos, who previously opposed him. A broad field of rivals has made it impossible for an anti-Sanders vote to coalesce. The fact that many of them are polling below the 15-percent threshold needed to win delegates has also helped him to outperform his own popular-vote share in the election result that will matter at the convention in July. 
There remains significant suspense over whether Bloomberg will pivot his huge paid advertising budget, now aimed at Trump, to go negative on Sanders. Bloomberg's top advisers view a sustained negative attack on Sanders as one of the only remaining ways to stop him from winning the nomination, especially if Warren does not rise in the polls to take away some of his support on the left and some of the more-moderate candidates do not drop out before March 3.
But the campaign has so far only pivoted with digital or unpaid messaging. Bloomberg's campaign on Monday accused Sanders of being the easiest candidate for Trump to beat and condemned him for not calling out recent vandalism against one of Bloomberg's offices, which was sprayed with the word 'oligarch,' language that echoes Sanders's rhetoric. 
'Trump himself and now the Russians are indicating that Senator Sanders is the candidate they want to run against,' Bloomberg states director Dan Kanninen said on a call with reporters. 'We can't get it done if we nominate a candidate like Senator Sanders, who has just attacked his own party.'
Other Democrats in the party have spoken out more forcefully about the danger they see presented by Sanders, who in an interview with CBS's '60 Minutes' on Sunday praised the literacy programs of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. 
Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg condemned those comments Monday in a tweet. 
'After four years of looking on in horror as Trump cozied up to dictators, we need a president who will be extremely clear in standing against regimes that violate human rights abroad,' Buttigieg wrote.
Sanders's advisers replied by sharing video of Obama praising the level of medical care and education in Cuba. But that did not mollify leaders of the Democratic Party in Florida, a traditional swing state where immigrants from Latin America hold significant sway.  

'Florida Democrats condemn dictators who toppled democracies across the globe and stand in solidarity with the thousands of people who have fled violent dictatorships in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua,' Terrie Rizzo, the state party chair, said Monday in a statement.
Though most party strategists say it is too soon to tell whether Sanders will be able to compete against Trump in the electoral college, there is little doubt that his nomination would prove a boost to Trump's chances of winning in Florida. 
'There is no question that Bernie Sanders is the least likely Democrat to win Florida's 29-electoral votes,' said Fernand Amandi, a Democratic pollster who worked for Obama's successful 2008 and 2012 campaigns in the state. 'Avowed socialists who have openly praised Daniel Ortega, Fidel Castro, Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro don't tend to do well in Florida.'

In August 2016, the conservative pundit Laura Ingraham brought an unassuming, 50-year-old corporate attorney to a presidential debate-prep session for then-candidate Donald Trump.
Long before that day, In graham had grown close to Pat Cipollone. He'd been her spiritual mentor as she converted to Catholicism and had become her godfather, a special honor in the church meant to forge a lifelong bond. But in her professional world "" the realm of high-octane, highly public political combat "" Cipollone had made no footprints.
'No one knew who he was,' said a person close to Cipollone, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe a closed-door campaign gathering.
Here was a Washington Everyman, one of the faceless masters of the universe in the capital city who quietly turn the wheels of power, influence, the law and business "" pointedly, and by design, without ever generating a headline. 
That brief encounter would set in motion one of the more curious pairings in modern American politics, something approaching the knitting of a sinner and a saint. A twice-divorced president with a penchant for extramarital dalliances, name-calling and celebrity magazine spreads aligned with a preternaturally private father of 10 whose great passions trend more to devotional trips to the Vatican and Catholic charitable endeavors.
The impression Cipollone made on the day of Trump's debate prep "" the future president and his team viewed this unknown quantity as a man of discretion, of 'judgment, intellect and modesty, not a leaker,' as one attendee put it "" would linger. Nearly 2
1/2
years later, Trump would select Cipollone as his White House counsel and more recently as the lead attorney in the impeachment trial that has played out for the past two weeks in the Senate chamber.
Cipollone's central role in the defense has placed him on televisions screens across America, though he would have preferred it was not so. He'd argued before the trial that cameras should be banned from the chamber. He believed that Trump's case could be damaged by the re-airing of comments made by the president and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who'd said at a news conference that the media should 'get over it' because quid pro quos 'happen all the time' in U.S. foreign policy, according to people familiar with Cipollone's thinking who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential strategy sessions. But keeping cameras out also would have had the effect of maintaining his carefully nurtured below-the-radar profile. 
Until Jan. 21 at 1:27 p.m., when Cipollone stepped onto the podium on the second day of Trump's trial and said, 'Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice,' he had never uttered a word recorded by C-SPAN's ubiquitous cameras. As if to underscore his near-anonymity in Washington, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. initially mispronounced Cipollone's name "" as, at various times, would House impeachment managers Adam B. Schiff, (D-Calif.), Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) and Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.). (It's SIP-uh-loan-ee.) Prior to Cipollone's name emerging as a contender for Trump's White House counsel job, he'd never even appeared in the news pages of his 
hometown newspaper "" The Washington Post.
Yet, he was now America's most visible attorney.
'Pat Cipollone is doing a fantastic job, made easier by the fact that the other side has no case "" and it is a Total Hoax,' Trump said Thursday in a email to The Post. 'He has been a Great White House counsel.'
'Biblical perspectives'
Cipollone, who did not respond to interview requests, and Trump came from different universes. The president was born into privilege, the scion of a real-estate empire. Cipollone, whose given name is Pasquale, is the son of Italian immigrants of modest means. While Trump was the product of an exclusive Eastern boarding school, Cipollone had attended a conservative institution far from the power centers on the East Coast, Covington Catholic High School in Kentucky. His family had moved to the state from the Bronx when his father transferred to Kentucky for his factory job. (A Covington student is now embroiled in a lawsuit against The Post based on the newspaper's coverage of his role in a confrontation during last year's March for Life.)
In temperament and style, Cipollone seemed to be the president's opposite. At the University of Chicago law school, he'd been known as the quiet one, 'not the kind to engage in a lot of huge Socratic debate. Not a particularly outspoken person,' said Melanie Sloan, a classmate.
Early on, he worked at the large firm Kirkland - Ellis, but he took a detour to become a top lawyer at the Knights of Columbus, a Catholic fraternal organization, where he held the title supreme advocate. While there, he filed a brief in a Supreme Court abortion case in support of a Nebraska law that outlawed a procedure dubbed by critics 'partial birth' abortion.
The practice, he wrote, amounts to 'the killing of a human child during an already occurring live birth.' The high court ultimately struck down the law.
Later, he became a name partner in the D.C. firm Stein, Mitchell, Cipollone, Beato - Missner "" which made him a wealthy man. Cipollone earned more than $6.7-million in 2017 and 2018, according to a financial disclosure form filed when he took the White House job. 
His recent client list has included the construction giant Bechtel, Sony Entertainment Group and the Recording Industry of America. He also once served on a legal team for Johnny Depp in a lawsuit against one of the actor's previous attorneys.
Over the years, Cipollone naturally fell in with the city's circle of well-connected Catholics, like-minded influencers with firm positions on issues such as abortion and same-sex marriage. 
'Pat puts biblical perspectives on everything,' said former senator Rick Santorum (R-Pa.). Both men have children who attended the Heights School in Potomac, Md., which is affiliated with Opus Dei, an ultraconservative Catholic institution. 
He also forged a deep bond with Leonard Leo, then the vice president of the Federalist Society, the influential conservative legal group that has played a major role in shaping the judiciary. Along with Leo, Cipollone was one of the founders of the National Catholic Prayer Breakfast, formed in 2004 'in response to Saint John Paul II's call for a New Evangelization,' according to its website. 
The friends traveled to Rome together two summers ago and visited the Vatican with a priest from the Catholic Information Center, a D.C.-based educational organization on whose board Leo and Cipollone have both served. Cipollone has also served on the board of the Solidarity Association, an organization that supports Catholic evangelization and education. 

Cipollone cares about 'religious freedom, the culture of life,' Leo said in an interview. 
Leo and Cipollone are close with William P. Barr, who served as President George H.W. Bush's attorney general and now holds the same post in the Trump administration. Cipollone worked for a time as a speechwriter under Barr in Bush's Justice Department.
'Pat and Bill come from the school that believes executive power is actually very important to the preservation of individual freedom, because the branch that is most susceptible to abusing the public is the legislative branch,' Leo said. 'Since the legislative branch by far is the most powerful of the three branches, there has to be a check from both other branches.' 
Cipollone has generally avoided electoral politics, but in 2012 he jumped in to help Santorum's presidential campaign, flying on small planes with the candidate and one other volunteer. The operation was so stripped down that the high-powered lawyer ended up doing tasks normally handled by pimply interns "" grabbing coffee or lunches for Santorum or doing advance work.
'Nothing was beneath him,' said David Urban, a consultant and Republican campaign operative who was the third member of the small campaign team.
In an interview, Santorum said he and Cipollone meshed on most issues but 'didn't always see eye to eye on immigration.' Cipollone urged him to moderate his hard-line tone, hewing to Catholic tenets about helping the poor. 
On policy, 'Pat's just not a heavy hand,' said Santorum, who has been a client of Cipollone's to handle contracts in the years since the campaign. 'When it comes to legal [strategizing], he can be a very heavy hand.' 
'Strong, silent type'
When Trump was elected, Cipollone again took a step toward politics, angling to become deputy attorney general in the Justice Department headed by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Barr "" then in private practice "" was among those who recommended Cipollone, according to a person who is close to both men. Santorum and Leo also recommended him. 
Cipollone didn't get the job, a turn of events that irked Barr and other supporters. But he remained on the president's radar, and in 2018 his name surfaced as possible White House counsel. He wasn't the only finalist, according to an outside adviser who was consulted on a competition that he described as a photo finish. 
'There was a tremendous amount of confidence in both his ability as an attorney and that he brought a lot to the table as somebody who understood the larger conservative project,' the outside adviser said.

Having secured the job, he sought input from Melanie Sloan, his University of Chicago classmate. 
'I expressed my surprise that he would want to work in this White House. He just doesn't see the president as I do,' said Sloan, who is a senior adviser to American Oversight, a nonpartisan ethics watchdog that has been critical of Trump. 'I think of Pat as a very moral and ethical guy and a devoted family man. All of these values seem at odds with the president.'
At a White House event the month after Cipollone took the job, Trump told the audience that his new top attorney was the 'strong, silent type.'

Yet last autumn, Cipollone "" the man who doesn't make headlines "" spoke loudly, blasting out an almost Trumpian bolt that dominated the news cycle. In a brusquely worded, eight-page letter to House leaders, he declared that the White House would not cooperate with the House impeachment inquiry. The inquiry was prompted by allegations of a quid pro quo in which Trump threatened to withhold military aid to Ukraine unless it announced an investigation of a leading political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, and his son Hunter, who held a lucrative seat on the board of a Ukrainian oil and gas company.
'Never before in our history has the House of Representatives "" under the control of either political party "" taken the American people down the dangerous path you seem determined to pursue,' Cipollone wrote. 'Put simply, you seek to overturn the results of the 2016 election and deprive the American people of the President they have freely chosen.'
The defiant approach was cheered by conservative tastemakers.
'Cipollone's letter lays it straight out: You're invalid. Illegitimate. The hell with you,' Lou Dobbs said on his Fox Business Network program.

Two days later, 21 of Cipollone's former law school classmates, who said they represented a wide range of political views, asked him to withdraw the letter, arguing that it 'flouts the traditions of rigor and intellectual honesty that we learned together' and that it 'distorts the law and the Constitution for other purposes, including cable news consumption.' 
But those who are close to Cipollone were not surprised at the content or tenor. Cipollone has a visceral disdain for this House and how it works, according to people who know him well but spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.
Internally, Cipollone's arrival in the White House has, at times, caused friction. He has complained frequently about Mulvaney and questioned his performance as chief of staff, according to multiple officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private conversations.

Political instincts questioned
Even some of his allies say he does not share enough information with anyone except the president, because he is too fearful of leaks to the media. During meetings, he often has said he wants to speak with Trump one-on-one after the group leaves, a habit that some White House advisers say has left them out of the loop on what he believes is the correct course of action. White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham has complained repeatedly that he doesn't keep the communications staff informed.
But publicly the White House has only good things to say about the counsel. 'Pat Cipollone has done a masterful job leading the president's defense team on impeachment and he has widespread support throughout the White House,' Grisham said in a statement emailed to The Post. 'The president trusts his counsel on a wide range of issues and counts him as one of his closest advisers.'
Cipollone has proved to be a deft infighter. His powers of persuasion were tested during a fierce debate about whether Trump should release the rough transcript of the phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Communications aides told him it would make things worse for Trump, according to officials involved in the discussions. But Cipollone prevailed.
Even then, it wasn't an easy path. Cipollone tried to manage the media strategy for the transcript release without involving the communications office, arguing that he would provide the best briefings for reporters and lawmakers. He ended up doing the briefings.
The internecine squabbles did not subside. Some inside the White House viewed him as lacking political instincts and repeatedly giving Trump rosier predictions than other advisers. Several days before the impeachment vote, Cipollone was still telling the president that the House might not vote to impeach him, according to advisers who listened in on the discussions. Others told Trump, 'Listen, you're going to get impeached.' They urged the president not to put stock in Cipollone's analysis.
The others were right. On Dec.-18, a House vote made Trump just the third president in American history to be impeached.
Cipollone was in line to take the lead at the Senate impeachment trial that everyone knew was coming. But with a client as mercurial as the president, he wasn't going to get to make all the decisions about who else would be at the defense table. 
On Christmas Eve, Trump approached Alan Dershowitz, the famed O.J. Simpson defense attorney and emeritus Harvard law professor, in the buffet line at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Fla. Trump told Dershowitz that he wanted him to join the impeachment defense team, Dershowitz said in a recent interview.
Dershowitz demurred, telling the president that his wife, Carolyn Cohen, would not be pleased. That sent Trump off to find Dershowitz's wife elsewhere in the room. The president convinced her, and just like that, Trump had added some star power to his defense team.

The heat of the spotlight
Going into the trial, Cipollone also told officials at the White House that he did not want to appear on television news programs and talk shows during impeachment. Instead, he said, he preferred to defer that task to others, including Pam Bondi, a staunch Trump supporter who recently left office as Florida's attorney general.
'I always hoped that he would do press,' said Ingraham, who has hosted a Fox News Channel program since 2017. 'Many times along the way it was clear to me he had no desire to be a television lawyer. He likes to get his job done behind closed doors.'
But there was no avoiding television last week when Cipollone was the first attorney to take the podium to debate the proposed rules for the trial. He adjusted the microphone. A slender man with graying, exquisitely parted hair, he wore a dark suit and a simple red, striped tie. The Washington Everyman in uniform.
His voice dripping with disdain, Cipollone flung many of his remarks at the president's main antagonist, Schiff, the California Democrat and lead House manager who had just finished his presentation.
'It's too much to listen to almost,' Cipollone said, 'the hypocrisy of the whole thing.'
He invoked the nation's founders, saying the trial was 'their worst nightmare.'
'It's a partisan impeachment that they delivered to your doorstep,' he said.
'They're not here to steal one election,' he said. 'They're here to steal two elections.'
He closed by urging senators to 'end this ridiculous charade' so 'we can go have an election.' With that he clapped his folder shut, punctuating the moment, and walked back to his seat.
Cipollone's client was an ocean away, communing with some of the world's richest people at the World Economic Summit in Davos, Switzerland. But Trump was paying attention and wanted a fiery performance, people familiar with the president's thinking said. Trump had hoped for even more of a flamethrower "" someone more like himself.
In the past year, the unassuming lawyer now arguing to keep Trump in office had ensconced himself deep into the volatile president's inner sanctum. 
One of Cipollone's two predecessors, Donald McGahn, was known for staying in his lane, steering clear of the staffer danger zone that surrounds Trump and that has been a factor in so many White House departures.
'Don was very much focused on the judicial enterprise and deregulation,' said Leo, Cipollone's friend. 'Pat has focused some time on that, but he has broadened his interest areas. He gets himself involved in other things in the building with greater intensity than Don might have.'
Inserting himself in policy matters and palace intrigue carries risk. But Cipollone, who has traveled with Trump more than his predecessors, had staked ground as near as possible to the president.
His friends worry he is playing a little too close to the fire.

Democratic Party elders are bewildered. Don't voters understand how unpopular Sen. Bernie Sanders is in Washington? ""Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done,"" Hillary Clinton, still smarting from the wound he inflicted on her 2016 presidential campaign, said in January. ""It's all just baloney, and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it."" The consequences, the party establishment fears, could be dire: Sanders will be George McGovern all over again - roundly thrashed in the general election by a sinister incumbent, just like the unexpected lefty winner of the 1972 primaries.
Sanders does have a historical forerunner, but it isn't McGovern. It's Ronald Reagan.
The comparison looks implausible. The genial, soothing, archconservative Reagan, with his Hollywood polish, script-reading skills and two terms as governor of California, seems a long way from the cantankerous socialist senator, with his accent scraped off the Brooklyn sidewalks and his following formed in tiny, remote, hippie Vermont.
But Reagan was also labeled a fringe figure - of the right, not the left. Mainstream Republicans viewed him with alarm and ridiculed his proposals as simple and kooky. Like Sanders, Reagan shrugged off his detractors. Like Sanders, he bore little allegiance to the party. Like Sanders, he was said to appeal to only a narrow slice of voters. The two have something else in common. Both waged a hard-fought battle in a previous presidential primary contest, seeding their insurgent movements and building bases of young voters undeterred by the candidates' advanced ages. Reagan was a spoiler turned tribune to a new Republican Party. Sanders, a spoiler in 2016, is on his way to remaking the Democratic Party, no matter how this year's campaign ends.
Reagan emerged as a national figure in the 1960s and '70s, a proud debunker of ""the Washington establishment."" His checkered political history included fundraising for an official in the far-right John Birch Society, sharing platforms with Southern segregationists and warning that Medicare (soon to become law) would put the nation on the road to serfdom. Mainstream Republicans were horrified. ""Extremist fringe elements seek to expel the rest of us from the GOP,"" John Anderson, a high-ranking Republican congressman, warned when Reaganites began to make inroads into the party. ""If the purists stage their ideological coup d'etat, our party will be consigned to the historical junk heap.""
Anderson's warning came in 1977, a year after Reagan's insurgent challenge to a sitting Republican president, Gerald Ford, went all the way to the Republican convention, splitting the party in two. Reagan was the leader of a movement, not a GOP loyalist. He had nothing at stake in Ford's victory and was looking ahead. When 1980 came, he was the front-runner, but the GOP, still fearful, looked for alternatives. ""Anyone but Reagan"" was a popular refrain.
Forty years later, this history looks familiar. Sanders the provocateur has bashed the establishment and even now won't retract his praise of Fidel Castro (or, at least, his literacy programs). His ""Bernie Bros"" seem eager to cast out party regulars and stage their own version of an ideological coup. Yet he joined the race in 2020 with the same advantage Reagan had in 1980: the support gained four years earlier, when people flocked to his rallies, thrilled to his call for democratic socialism and delivered their votes. Sanders very nearly upset Clinton in Iowa, routed her in New Hampshire and harried her all the way through the primaries, refusing to quit even after it was clear that she would win the nomination. Subtract the ""superdelegates"" awarded to Clinton, and the totals were surprisingly close: 2,205 pledged votes to Clinton and 1,846 to Sanders.
The message should have been clear. Sanders was no mere spoiler but the emerging leader of a movement to wrest the Democratic Party from its longtime leaders. One who saw this was David Axelrod, the architect of Barack Obama's two victories. In 2015, Axelrod, who runs a political institute in Chicago, invited Sanders to speak there. ""Got a first-hand look at the @BernieSanders phenomenon today,"" Axelrod tweeted. ""2,000 in hall. 500 in overflow. And 2500 couldn't get in.""
Still, Sanders's appeal seemed limited in reach. His followers were mainly young - college students, in many cases - and predominantly white. Despite his achievements in Iowa and New Hampshire, he underperformed in South Carolina and Georgia, where Clinton won more than 70 percent of the vote. Reagan, too, was seen as appealing to a subset of his party. ""He's never demonstrated substantial national appeal,"" George Will wrote in 1974, when Reagan's followers were urging him to run. ""His hard-core support today consists primarily of the kamikaze conservatives who thought the 1964 Goldwater campaign was jolly fun.""
There was also the problem of Reagan's age. It made him an unlikely choice to lead the GOP into a new era. ""Reagan is 63 and looks it,"" Will pointed out. ""He looks like an old man."" Elected six years later at 69, Reagan was the oldest president in history (since surpassed by Donald Trump). His age made no difference to young voters. In 1980, he split the youth vote evenly with the much younger incumbent, Jimmy Carter, and did even better in 1984. The pollster Lou Harris found that ""younger voters seem to have something of a fascination with and attraction to a President who is approaching 74 years of age."" And they chose him over the Democrat, Walter Mondale, by a wide margin; Reagan won more than 60 percent of the 25-and-under vote. His famous quip about Mondale's ""youth and inexperience"" was for the benefit of older voters.
Sanders's following is also young. He did best with these voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, and in South Carolina he won those under 30, continuing to win that demographic in Super Tuesday states. These voters don't seem to care that he's 78.
One reason Democratic insiders resist Sanders is that he defies the wisdom that ""the party decides."" They know that this thesis was discredited for the GOP in 2016, when Trump swamped the field, but they prefer to think this is a distinctly Republican problem, a result of ideological bankruptcy. It's hard for them to accept that their own party is undergoing a similar revolution from below; the idea persists that Sanders is not the leader of the party, but the Pied Piper of an extremist faction and not even really a Democrat. This second proposition is true - Sanders remains an independent who caucuses with the Democrats in the Senate - but it doesn't delegitimize him in the eyes of voters. It enhances his prestige.
Reagan blazed a similar trail. For much of his life, he was not a reliable party man. He was a New Deal Democrat who didn't join the GOP until 1962, when he was 51. This mattered little to conservatives. They responded to the things Reagan said and saw him as the leader of a Republican Party closer to their idea of what it should be.
The same is true of Sanders. The spoiler of 2016 is now the tribune of the new Democratic Party. Even detractors acknowledge that he has moved the party to the left. His working-class message and issues - free college, universal health care, a $15 minimum wage - are now standard Democratic talking points. They reflect the concerns of a rising generation that thinks the economic odds are stacked against them, even if they have checked all the right boxes. ""The 21st century is basically defined by nonessential human beings, who do not fit into the market as consumers or producers or as laborers,"" as a host of the ardently pro-Sanders Chapo Trap House podcast has said. Most Americans think that the health-care system isn't working and that the federal government should do more to help them. Even those who are leery of Sanders's Medicare-for-all proposal recognize that he understands the depth of the problem and isn't content to tinker at the edges. And while raising taxes on the ""billionaire class"" won't pay for all the costly programs Sanders wants, a large majority of Americans agree with the principle that the wealthy don't pay enough in taxes.
Reagan, too, was much bolder than party regulars when it came to taxes. His embrace of ""supply-side economics"" - the theory that reducing taxes on the wealthy would stimulate growth and expand the economy, resulting in greater tax revenue - was ridiculed in 1980. George H.W. Bush, his rival in the primary race, called it ""voodoo economics."" Wall Street insiders who normally voted Republican worried that Reagan's ""radically new policies,"" as The Washington Post described them, such as slashing income taxes by as much as 30 percent, could ""destroy his candidacy."" But the economy had stalled, with high unemployment and rising inflation, and Carter's more conventional proposals hadn't worked.
Reagan's foreign policy beliefs also seemed dangerous at a time when the two Cold War superpowers appeared locked in permanent conflict. His avowed anti-communism struck experts as needlessly belligerent, ""tragically wrong and blind to the long-range opportunities for a better East-West relationship,"" said Carter's national security adviser, Zbigniew Brzezinski. But voters too young to remember the high-flown rhetoric of a president like John F. Kennedy, who spoke of a ""twilight struggle,"" heard in Reagan the first leader of their own era who spoke of American promise, who wasn't afraid to call the Soviet Union an ""evil empire,"" who didn't seem to sag under the country's accumulated defeats, including the Vietnam War. The confidence came in part from the long years Reagan spent honing his message, dating all the way back to his time as a General Electric spokesman in the 1950s.
The same is true of Sanders. The message he delivers so relentlessly seems fanatical to some in the Democratic establishment. But among younger voters who have come of age at a time when politics seems cynical and transactional, a game rigged for insiders, Sanders has built a deep reservoir of credibility. He has also worked diligently to attract new followers. His base consisted of more than enthusiastic young, white men as he entered the race last year. ""Sanders is more popular with people of color than white people, and women like Sanders as much as men do, if not more,"" Vox pointed out then. He won 27 percent of the African American vote and an overwhelming 51 percent of the Latino vote in Nevada. He has been courting both groups. Latino caucus-goers wearing Sanders buttons were heard to say that his was the only campaign they ""ever heard from,"" the New York Times reported. He met with overlooked Hispanic voters in California and in Iowa, as well, and on Super Tuesday was the overwhelming choice of Latinos in Texas and California. He began connecting with African American voters in 2018, when he spoke at a Black Lives Matter rally in Los Angeles. Even in South Carolina, where Joe Biden won easily on the strength of support from African American voters, Sanders did as well or better with black voters under 30, according to exit polls, as he did with black voters under 30 in Texas.
As Democrats study the electoral college map, they are intent on winning back the 40,000 white working-class voters in battleground states who defected to Trump in 2016 after, at least in some instances, voting for Obama in 2008 and again in 2012. The Sanders campaign's answer is that he doesn't need those people, because he will turn out waves of new voters - a progressive version of what was once called the ""woodwork theory of hidden conservatives."" Here, history is not on his side. And the early returns in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada have not been encouraging. There was a large increase in voter turnout in South Carolina, but it went to Biden, and a huge turnout of young voters did not materialize on Super Tuesday.
Once again, Reagan suggests an answer. He didn't uncover legions of new voters. Instead he found them in the other party. For example, evangelical voters went for Carter by 25 points in 1976; in 1980, they went against him by 26 points. Can the ""Reagan Democrats"" of 1980 become ""Sanders Republicans"" in 2020? Not if 90 percent or more of Republicans continue to support Trump. The only hope will be to shake loose independents weary of Trump or catch the fire of Sanders's truly populist crusade. In the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the number of Sanders primary voters in 2016 who chose Trump in the general election exceeded Trump's margin of victory in those states by large margins.
Older Democrats remember the defeats the party met when it went too far left. The term ""democratic socialist"" frightens them, and Sanders's gleeful class warfare does, too. But to younger voters, Sanders's uncompromising attitude feels fresh and candid, while ""pragmatic"" calls for moderation and ""working across the aisle"" feel hollow and stale. Even if he fails to win the nomination or, if he gets it, the general election, he will have remade the party in anticipation of the time when demographics catch up with his vision and turn important red states blue. Then the new Democratic Party may look back at the spoiler and outlier Sanders, the ""extremist"" whom ""nobody likes,"" as the most persuasive voice for a politics of hope in an age dominated by fear.
The paradox of Reagan was that his radical message, while it sounded new, revived beliefs and values that had defined the GOP of an earlier time, when it cast itself as the party of Main Street and what later came to be called ""middle America."" His radicalism was really a form of reinvention, and he was its best exemplar. Like Sanders, whose own crusade is rooted in venerable principles of economic and social justice, he seemed to personify the vision he projected.

President Trump, a leading critic of the Obama White House's handling of the Ebola outbreak in 2014, is under increasing political pressure to mount a coordinated federal response to the threat of the new strain of coronavirus "" amid fears of a global health crisis with economic ramifications in an election year.
The White House has sought to tamp down criticism from Democrats in recent days by projecting an air of confidence and competence, with Trump presiding late Wednesday over an interagency briefing in the Situation Room. He also announced a new task force of senior aides to lead the government's response, including screenings at 20 U.S. airports, the repatriation of U.S. citizens from China and efforts to develop a potential vaccine to treat the novel virus.
The disease, dubbed a 'public health emergency' by the World Health Organization, has left more than 200 dead and infected more than 9,000 people in China and Taiwan, along with about 100 confirmed cases outside that country, including six people in the United States. 
'This is no cause for urgent panic in any way in the United States,' Adm. Brett Giroir, assistant secretary of health, told reporters at the White House on Thursday. 'This is currently under control. But really, this is a dynamic and rapidly changing event, and the news can change at any moment. But the resources are deployed, the government is mobilized and we feel confident "" we know the right steps to take to contain it.'
Yet the vast uncertainty over the contagiousness and lethality of the coronavirus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, and the complicated geopolitics given Beijing's poor record of transparency in handling infectious diseases, have increased the stakes for the Trump administration. So has the president's interest in an election year of restoring more normal trade relations with China after years of tariff battles.
Democrats, including 2020 presidential candidates Joe Biden, the former vice president, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), have warned that the president's policies have made the United States more vulnerable to an infectious disease crisis.
They pointed to the dismantling of a global health security team in 2018 during a reorganization of the White House's National Security Council. And in an op-ed published in USA Today on Monday, Biden called Trump the 'worst possible leader' to oversee the government's response, citing his call for then-President Barack Obama to implement a travel ban on West African countries during the Ebola crisis even though public health experts opposed such a move. 
'I remember how Trump sought to stoke fear and stigma. . . . He called President Barack Obama a 'dope' and 'incompetent' and railed against the evidence-based response our administration put in place,' Biden wrote.
Trump has been uncharacteristically muted on the coronavirus. On Wednesday, he tweeted out photos of his Situation Room briefing and professed that his administration is working closely with China. 'We have the best experts anywhere in the world, and they are on top of it 24/7!' he wrote.
One senior administration official said Trump has been hesitant to speak out because some aides have cautioned that he could unnecessarily cause public alarm "" and assured him that China is working hard to keep the virus under control. But increasingly, there is a feeling among aides that the president must say more, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
Heath and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who is leading the new task force, provided Trump with a briefing on China's response that prompted the president to issue a more positive tweet last week about Beijing's performance than other officials, believed was warranted, the senior aide said. 
This week, acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney began holding daily meetings focused on the issue, officials said, and aides have begun discussing how they could safely evacuate people from China, along with where they could be placed in the United States.
Some administration officials and members of Congress have expressed concern over how transparent Beijing has been in accounting for the breadth of the virus and its failure so far to share full data with the United States and other countries.
Meanwhile, some U.S. lawmakers have pressed for a targeted travel ban from China, which Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Okla.), a close White House ally, said in a letter to the administration was 'warranted to protect Americans until we know more about the virus and the outbreak is under control.' 
Trump's 2020 campaign countered Biden's criticism by pointing to remarks he made in April 2009 during an outbreak of swine flu that he would counsel his own family not to ride the subway or airplanes, which a White House spokesman later said might have caused people to be 'unduly alarmed.'

'This is another attempt by a failing candidate to gain credibility on an issue where he has almost none,' Trump campaign spokeswoman Sarah Matthews said of Biden. 
Experts said the new coronavirus appears to be more contagious but far less deadly than Ebola, which is thought to have infected more than 28,000 people and killed more than 11,000 during the 2014 outbreak. But China already has confirmed more cases of coronavirus than of SARS, a more deadly coronavirus, during an outbreak that spread through Asia in 2002 and 2003. 
As the midterm elections approached in fall 2014, Trump and numerous GOP leaders faulted Obama for his response to Ebola. Obama appointed Ron Klain, who has worked in multiple Democratic administrations in several roles, as the administration's Ebola czar.
All told, four people in the United States were found to have contracted the disease, including a Liberian national who died while visiting Dallas. The other three recovered, and Obama declared a qualified victory in early 2015 during an event at the White House with public health professionals. 
In an essay in the Atlantic on Thursday, Klain said Trump's 2014 criticism amounted to a 'virulent, xenophobic, fearmongering outburst.' He cited a study from the Obama White House's Office of Digital Strategy that concluded Trump's tweets were a driving factor in instilling a sense of unfounded fear over Ebola among the American public. 
Trump 'will have to trust the kind of government experts he has disdained to date, set aside his own terrible instincts, lead from the White House, and work closely with foreign leaders and global institutions "" all things he has failed to do in his first 1,200 days in office,' wrote Klain, who is advising Biden's campaign.
Some global health security experts said that a more senior White House official should be in charge of the Trump administration's response given that Azar has little authority over other agencies. Critics pointed to the 2018 restructuring at the NSC that led to the departure of Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer, who had overseen a team dedicated to the U.S. response to a deadly pandemic, as weakening the senior-level attention.
'This is much bigger than HHS,' said J. Stephen Morrison, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'There's a sluggishness built into the system by the way they have structured themselves.'
But Tim Morrison, who served on the NSC from 2018-2019, said Ziemer's team was merged with another NSC department and experts remain on the White House staff. He cited the administration's handling of an Ebola outbreak in the Congo in 2018 as evidence that the White House remains capable of coordinating an effective response to an international threat. 
White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien and his deputy, Matthew Pottinger, a fluent Mandarin speaker, are also on the president's task force. Vice President Pence has been involved in interagency meetings. 
'I think the administration is actually running a very effective process,' said Morrison, now a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute. 'They don't need an Ebola czar the way the Obama administration needed one. They've got the apparatus in place.' 
 On Capitol Hill, lawmakers have been in touch with Azar and other senior administration officials, and Democrats have mostly refrained from overt criticism of Trump, even as they pressed the administration to devote sufficient resources to managing the situation. 
'A global pandemic is like a meteor coming out of the sky,' said a Democratic congressional aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
The White House 'recognizes the risk of the appearance of not being on top of the situation in case it does turn out this is worse or more problematic than it initially appears,' the aide added. 'There's very little political price you pay for overreacting because people will forget. There's a huge potential vulnerability for underreacting.'

Sharp attacks replace wonky policy contrasts ahead of N.H. vote


MANCHESTER, N.H. ""
The Democratic campaign grew newly combative Friday as the party's candidates attacked each other on a debate stage with blistering policy critiques and arguments over who was best positioned to beat President Trump in November.




With no clear frontrunner and four days to go before the New Hampshire primary, the party's leading candidates abandoned the wonky policy contrasts and opaque tonal
critiques that had filled the race before Monday's caucuses in Iowa. The debate stage became a free-fire zone instead, the candidates seizing the moment to call each other out.


They harped on age and gender differences, turned each other's words against each other and warned about their rival's policy prescriptions. Multiple candidates warned that the polling leader, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), would not be electable given his identification as a democratic socialist. 

Pete Buttigieg, the 38-year-old former mayor of South Bend, Ind., attacked former vice president Joe Biden's longevity in politics, suggesting the party should not 'fall back on the familiar' and urging voters to 'finally allow us to leave the politics of the past in the past.' 
'The politics of the past were not all that bad!' Biden interjected, pointing toward measures on violence against women, arms control and other legislation he shepherded through over the course of nearly five decades as a U.S. senator and vice president. 
'I don't know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden that were so bad,' he said.
Buttigieg also turned toward Sanders, saying a nominee can't be someone 'dividing people with a politics that says if you don't go all the way to the edge, it doesn't count. A politics that says it's my way or the highway.'
'Politics should be one of addition and inclusion and belonging,' he said, 'not one that beats people over the head and says they shouldn't even be on our side. If we don't agree 100 percent of that.'
Asked if he was referring to Sanders, Buttigieg said yes. 
'I've never said that,' Sanders responded. 'But let me tell you what I do say. The way you bring people together is by presenting an agenda that works for the working people of this country, not for the billionaire class.' 
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) went up against both Sanders and "" in another chapter in what has been an ongoing dispute "" Buttigieg. 


She reminded Buttigieg of a line he used regularly in Iowa during the impeachment trial in which he called the proceedings 'exhausting' enough to make him want to
change the channel and watch cartoons instead.


After a lively and rambunctious start, however, the candidates also tried to show some form of unity. Buttigieg defended Biden, saying that Democrats should not worry about Republican threats to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. 
'We're not going to let them change the subject. This is not about Hunter Biden or vice president Biden or any Biden,' he said. 'This is about abuse of power by the president. The vice president and all of us are competing, but we've got to draw the line somewhere.' 
Biden also went over to hug Sanders at one point, both of them displaying wide grins. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tried to cast herself as a unifying candidate, as she has in recent weeks, and generally refrained from some of the intraparty squabbling. 
'Bernie and I've been friends for a long time,' she said. 'We have a lot of things in common. We have a lot of things that we differ on. But, you know, this fundamental question about how we bring our party together, we have to think about it in new ways.'




The debate came just three days before the second nominating contest and amid a potential reordering of the race, with signs that Sanders and Buttigieg "" the two top finishers in Iowa "" were pulling ahead in New Hampshire. Biden and Warren entered the evening looking to break out of their sudden second-tier status, as billionaire former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, while not on the ballot or on the debate stage here, continues to increase his campaign spending in the hopes of upsetting the race next month. 
The sudden shift of dynamics after Monday's Iowa caucuses has raised concern among party leaders that there will be no quick conclusion to the nominating process, potentially forcing a drawn-out contest that deepens party divisions and leads to a weakened nominee. 
'I don't think there's any question, after this week, that Donald Trump can get reelected,' business executive Tom Steyer said, repeatedly returning the anxiety coursing through the party. 'We have got to win or we are in deep trouble.' 
Even Sanders, who had more initial support in the Iowa caucuses than any other candidate, admitted that the turnout in the state did not reach the levels of the 2008 election. 'That 's a disappointment,' Sanders said. 'And I think all of us probably could have done a better job turning out our supporters.'

Parts of the party are worried about Buttigieg's limited experience and Sanders's self-identification as a Democratic socialist. At the same time, Biden's claim on electability was undercut by his fourth-place finish in Iowa, and Warren was working to avoid an embarrassing finish next door to her home state of Massachusetts.
Biden, 77, took critical time away from the campaign trail to spend two days without events at home in Wilmington, Del., this week, as he prepared for the debate, met with advisers and restructured his campaign.
Since his drubbing in Iowa, Biden has shifted his message, from one of near-certain electability and broad opposition to Trump to a more traditional focus on fighting for the middle class. Other candidates, however, have been positioning themselves in that role.
'I took a hit in Iowa and I will probably take a hit here,' Biden said in his first answer of the evening.
Sanders started the day criticizing Buttigieg in newly sharp terms, reading aloud headlines that depicted his rival as too cozy with big-money donors.
'I like Pete Buttigieg, nice guy,' Sanders said during a morning event in Manchester. 'But we are in a moment where billionaires control not only our economy but our political life.'






In the weeks since Buttigieg last took a debate stage, his stature in the race has changed dramatically. His surprisingly strong Iowa finish lifted him into a collision course with Sanders here, though by and large, they appeal to different groups within the party.

Buttigieg argues that his movement is more inclusive than Sanders's 'Not me, us' approach, because he reaches out to independents and Republican voters. In the hours before the debate, Buttigieg's campaign announced it had raised $1 million in the previous 24 hours "" a time period, as a campaign spokesman pointed out, in which Sanders upped his attacks.
Buttigieg also challenged Biden's assertion that the party needs to nominate a safe bet "" which Biden defines as himself "" arguing that the bigger risk would be to nominate someonewho represents the old ways of doing things.

'The perspective I'm bringing is from somebody whose life has been shaped by the decisions made in those big white buildings,' Buttigieg said. 'We need a perspective ... that will allow us to leave the politics of the past in the past.' 
While he argues that he is not of Washington "" so he can disrupt the bad political habits that have developed there "" his opponents cast him as naive.

'We have a newcomer in the White House right now and look where it got us,' Klobuchar said. 'I think having some experience is a good thing.' 
Steyer piled on. 'You need to be able to go toe to toe with this guy on the debate stage and take him down or we're going to lose,' he said. 

Business executive Andrew Yang, who has run a cheerful campaign and drawn outsized crowds to his economy-infused message, has limited time left to make an impact. 
'Let me say America it's great to be back on the debate stage,' Yang said, after missing the qualifications for the previous debate. 'I'm so excited. I want to give every American $1,000 a month.'

Klobuchar staked much of her campaign on a strong Iowa finish, but a fifth-place showing means she will need to convince New Hampshire moderates that she is a better alterative than Buttigieg or Biden. 
Biden's campaign, desperate to calm skittish donors and supporters by showing that the former vice president grasped the need for a significant course correction, said Friday it was giving greater responsibility to adviser Anita Dunn. 
Dunn, who has been heavily involved from the start of the campaign, is seen as a potential bridge between two warring factions inside the campaign.

Ten days from the Iowa caucuses, several Democratic presidential candidates are seeking to temper expectations in the early nominating states, casting the primary race as a long-haul slog that will inevitably play out in elections across the nation.
In other words: Don't pay too much attention to what happens in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada or South Carolina, some of the campaigns now seem to be suggesting "" unless, of course, their candidates are the oneswhoemerge with clear wins.
The efforts to shift the focus to a national one come as four candidates "" former vice president Joe Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg "" remain in a tight cluster in Iowa. Sanders and Biden are holding a narrow advantage in New Hampshire. 
'The four early states contests are just the beginning,' Warren's campaign manager, Roger Lau, wrote in a memo distributed to supporters Friday. The text appeared under a graphic showing images of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina, which all caucus or vote in February, under a caption noting those states award only 155 delegates, or '3.9% of the total,' a statistic that was underlined in red.
The memo was particularly striking because of the importance the Warren campaign has long placed on a strong showing in Iowa, where it has worked for a year to build what even other campaigns have acknowledged is the strongest organization.
Lau made no predictions about Warren's finish in Iowa or New Hampshire, but instead forecast that the contest will be competitive through at least March 3, or Super Tuesday, when 14 states will vote in primaries and roughly 34-percent of the pledged delegates are awarded.
To clinch the Democratic nomination, a candidate will need to win a majority of the 3,979 pledged delegates up for grabs this spring. (The Democratic Party has an additional 760 or so superdelegates who can vote if no candidate wins the majority on the first ballot at its July convention.)
'We expect this to be a long nomination fight and have built our campaign to sustain well past Super Tuesday and stay resilient no matter what breathless media narratives come when voting begins,' Lau wrote.
Biden's camp has similarly tried to convince would-be supporters of his national strength, in case he demonstrates early weakness. Last year, his campaign sought to make a case that he did not have to win Iowa or New Hampshire, pointing to his strengths in more diverse Nevada and South Carolina, the third and fourth states to vote.
In New Hampshire on Friday, the former vice president asked the crowd to look beyond the early states. He insisted he is the candidate most likely to beat Trump in general-election battlegrounds, and that his coattails would help Democrats across the country get elected.
'And we not only have to beat Donald Trump, as was pointed out earlier, we have to win in states that will win us back the United States Senate,' Biden said in Claremont. 'Because, folks, we can do that. We have to be able to win in North Carolina. We have to be able to win Georgia Senate seats. And in Arizona. Not just in my home state of Pennsylvania.' 
A new 30-second Biden ad, which began airing Friday in Iowa, devoted several seconds to screens of polling data and graphs showing Biden leading Trump in battleground states "" perhaps the most visual appeal yet to undecided Iowans who have become pundit-like as they weigh whom to support on Feb. 3.
'This is no time to take a risk. We need our strongest candidate,' the ad stated. 'So let's nominate the Democrat Trump fears the most. Vote Biden. Beat Trump.'
Sanders, who last fall rolled out 'Bernie Beats Trump' messaging focused on the general election, also has a robust operation for the next phase of the primary race, particularly in California, which awards more than 400 delegates.He and any other candidates who stay in the race past February also will have to contend with former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who sidestepped the early contests but is spending hundreds of millions of dollars from his own fortune to be competitive starting in the March primaries.
While some of his competitors have downplayed the role Iowa could have in their candidacies, Buttigieg has been open about the need to do well there. Asked about his struggles to build support in South Carolina and early voting states beyond Iowa, Buttigieg said Wednesday that he knows his success elsewhere is tied directly to what happens in Iowa. 
'A lot can happen in those final days, especially because there are going to be a lot of folks there looking to see what we candidates can demonstrate and prove right here [in Iowa],' Buttigieg said. 'It's a whole new chapter of the campaign on the ground in South Carolina "" in Nevada for that matter, too "" after we've been able to demonstrate our strength in a place like Iowa and New Hampshire.'
Asked many times if he needs to win in Iowa to demonstrate that strength, Buttigieg said, 'I'm not going to create a goal post.' 
In town halls, Buttigieg has emphasized that the idea he is contending at all is remarkable, regardless of what happens next "" often recalling the days when no one could pronounce his name "" while also in recent weeks explicitly telling voters that 'winning the Iowa caucuses' is possible. 

Perhaps more than any other candidate, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) is banking on a strong finish in Iowa to remain competitive in the race "" not only for the boost it would give her, but also because she has repeatedly marketed herself as a pragmatist who can win over both rural and suburban voters in Midwestern states. However, the latest Des Moines Register poll showed her with only 6 percent support in Iowa, significantly below the four front-runners, who are all clustered between 15 and 20 percent.

Operation aimed to stoke racial tensions among African Americans
Facebook and Twitter have disabled a sophisticated Russian-linked operation designed to stoke racial tensions among African Americans in the United States, the companies announced Thursday, raising fresh alarms about Kremlin interference ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
The malicious campaign relied on a mix of fake accounts and real people, who lived in Ghana and Nigeria, some of whom appear to have been duped into thinking they were aiding a nongovernmental organization. Instead, they helped amplify a network of inauthentic accounts, pages and groups on Facebook and Twitter that shared polarizing content related to social issues including race and civil rights, the tech giants said.
None of the so-called coordinated, inauthentic activity focused on the 2020 election or sought to ""promote or denigrate political candidates,"" said Nathaniel Gleicher, the head of security policy at Facebook. But Facebook and Twitter linked the operation to some of the same Russian actors that employed similar tactics four years ago to spread falsehoods during the 2016 presidential race.
The takedowns Thursday are likely to rattle Washington at a moment when U.S. intelligence leaders once again are sounding the alarms about suspected Russian interference. This week, a senior Trump administration official told Congress that Russia's online efforts did not explicitly seek to benefit a particular candidate. In earlier briefings, intelligence leaders told lawmakers that Russia's online efforts had ""developed a preference"" for President Trump.
Four years ago, so-called Russian trolls seeded posts, photos and videos on major social-networking sites in support of Trump, and in opposition to then-Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Many of those Facebook posts, tweets and YouTube videos also sought to stoke social and political discord, including by trying to discourage black and Latino users from voting in the first place.
In response, tech giants including Facebook and Twitter raced to bolster their digital defenses, hiring more workers to review content and investing more heavily in artificial intelligence that could spot coordinated fake accounts. But Russia's tactics also have evolved, reflecting a better understanding of American politics and a heightened ability to take advantage of social media sites to spread falsehoods at scale.
In October, Facebook said it had removed a network of Russian-backed accounts that had posed as locals to weigh in on political issues in swing states, at times praising Trump and attacking former vice president Joe Biden. The disinformation operation - discovered in its early stages - also sought to sow divisions among a then-packed Democratic primary field.
On Thursday, Facebook and Twitter leaders said they could not speculate on whether the Russian-linked network they removed might have eventually pivoted into politics. ""We know we caught this early enough on that these accounts were broadly unsuccessful in obtaining a large scale audience,"" said Yoel Roth, the head of site integrity at Twitter.
The campaign disabled Thursday spanned 49 accounts and 69 pages on Facebook, with another 85 accounts on Instagram. More than 13,000 users followed one or more of the pages, and 265,000 followed one or more of the since-suspended accounts on Instagram. Twitter, meanwhile, said it discovered 71 accounts associated with the operation on its platform.
In an unusual turn, though, malicious Russian-linked actors essentially helped set up a nongovernmental organization, called EBLA, based in Ghana. Gleicher said Russia's approach aimed to make it ""harder for us to find them.""
Much of the operation's efforts appear to have been directed at U.S. social media users, the tech giants said. At one point, the group tried to hire a staff person in Charleston, S.C., but didn't succeed, said Darren Linvill, a communications professor at Clemson University, who initially found some of the suspect Twitter accounts.
An archived version of one of the closed Facebook pages, EBLA, shows that it was created Oct. 1 and posted on a range of issues apparently targeting African Americans, including on the subjects of racial violence. The contact information showed a phone number in Ghana. The page is no longer available.
A post from Feb. 5 read, ""There is always a justification for the violence a white man committed on a black man. This is because our history was thwarted the very first day we refused to put down the history by ourselves. You cannot tell someone to write your history when that person is guilty of those crimes and yet expect them to write them to suit you. #blackcommunity #martinlutherking #socialissues #BlackHistoryMonth #BlackLove.""
Several researchers studied the disinformation campaign along with the tech companies. They noted the sophistication of the operations, which resembled previous efforts in themes but relied on new techniques for delivering them.
""Information operations' increasingly creative use of proxies, including of real groups and organizations wittingly or unwittingly participating in these campaigns, is a clear and problematic trend, we've observed over the last few months,"" added Camille Francois, chief innovation officer for Graphika, a network analysis firm that studies disinformation.
The firm issued its own report Thursday on the Ghana-based campaign, called ""IRA in Ghana: Double Deceit,"" that details the similarities and differences with efforts by Russia's Internet Research Agency during and after the 2016 presidential election.
 Both Linvill's work and the report by Graphika highlighted an apparent tactical shift. The Ghanaian accounts were tied to real people and a real organization, rather than being fake accounts.

RICHMOND - Former vice president Joe Biden won Virginia's Democratic primary contest by a large margin Tuesday, with exit polls showing that voters chose mainly based on who they thought had the best chance of beating President Trump this fall.
The broad victory confirmed Biden's renewed strength after his lackluster early showings and suggested the appeal of an establishment candidate to a wide swath of voters anxious to find a winner in the fractious Democratic field.
Biden was powered by African American voters, who accounted for about a quarter of those casting ballots in Virginia on Tuesday, according to exit polling conducted by Edison Media Research. Roughly 6 in 10 black voters chose Biden - similar to the outcome in his victory last weekend in South Carolina.
But Biden also won among white Virginia voters, thanks primarily to those older than 45 - 6 in 10 of whom voted for the former vice president, polling showed. Voters younger than 30 went for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) by a margin of nearly 3 to 1, but he still trailed Biden by about 30 points, according to unofficial returns.
Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who saturated the state with advertising and spent heavily in last year's legislative races, was a distant third, barely ahead of Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. Turnout was above 23 percent, breaking the record for a Virginia Democratic primary set in 2008, when Barack Obama won the nomination.

Voters across the state said Biden emerged as their pick late in the game. Many settled on him after preferred candidates dropped out. Others didn't decide until they stood in the voting booth. But most shared one goal:
""I want to get Trump out of office by all means necessary,"" said Josephine Stewart, 66, a cook in Richmond public schools. She opted for Biden.
How Virginians made their choices will shed light on the challenge facing the party nationwide. Gains in recent elections have energized the state's Democrats, but they've been powered by an uneasy combination of ethnically diverse young liberals and more cautious suburbanites who once leaned Republican.
In other words, Virginia is still deciding its shade of blue. And that uncertainty followed voters to the polls. 
Walking into Lynbrook Elementary School in Springfield, stay-at-home father Oscar Trejo, 34, said his choice was Biden.

""Really? I'm for Bernie,"" said his wife, Alejandra Trejo, 33, who viewed Sanders as a stronger force for change.
The dilemma mirrors what the Democratic nominee will face nationwide, making Virginia's choice on Super Tuesday significant beyond the 124 delegates the state offers at the nominating convention. 
Ninety-nine of those delegates were at stake Tuesday; the remaining 25 are superdelegates not beholden to the outcome at the polls.
Most Virginia voters opted for pragmatism. A majority sought a candidate who they think can beat Trump over one who agrees with them on major issues, according to exit polls. Biden won about 6 in 10 of those votes, while Sanders got about 2 in 10.
Among Virginia voters who prioritized issues, Biden ran almost even with Sanders. That's a contrast with earlier contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, where Sanders had a clear edge on issues.
Biden also benefited from the decisions of Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg to quit the race and endorse him. Most of their Virginia supporters turned to Biden, the exit polling found.
At Rosemont Forest Elementary in Virginia Beach, Biden voters Jermel McLean and Alisha Weeks - both 43 and engaged to be married - said they liked some things about Sanders but ""figured Joe would beat Trump.""
Ashley Hubbs, 34, also turned to Biden - reluctantly - after enthusiastically supporting and volunteering for Buttigieg's campaign. She said she almost voted for Warren, until she learned that Buttigieg had endorsed Biden.
""It didn't give me a lot of pleasure, but we have to unify the party,"" Hubbs said outside Windsor Oaks Elementary in Virginia Beach. ""It would have been nice to have a couple days to mourn how hard we worked for Pete, but eyes forward.""

In an affluent Richmond suburb in Henrico County, Anna Lauher was so conflicted about her choice for president that she considered leaving it to chance.

""At first, I was going to [decide by] eenie meenie miney moe,"" she said on her way out of Tuckahoe Elementary School. But that approach landed her on Sanders, the democratic socialist whom Lauher's Trump-loving father had urged her to support on the theory that ""Trump would chew him up and spit him out.""
Rejecting that option, she considered Bloomberg, who she thought did a good job of rebuilding New York City after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. But ultimately, Lauher picked Warren on the advice of a friend.
""I like the idea of trying to see a woman succeed,"" said Lauher, 32, a stay-at-home mother who voted with her baby daughter, Margaret, in a pouch on her chest.
Virginia's establishment Democrats came out hard for Biden in the past few days. Former governor Terry McAuliffe led the charge, pumping up crowds and rallying other leaders, including Sen. Tim Kaine, Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney and Del. Lamont Bagby (Henrico), head of the legislature's Black Caucus.
At a polling place in a largely black neighborhood in South Richmond, most voters interviewed said they were backing Biden.
""He's for the people that are struggling,"" Angela Williams, 33, said. But more than that, she said, Biden is the one ""to get Trump out of the chair. . . . As a businessman, I love [Trump]. But as president? No.""

Sanders had not amassed many endorsements in Virginia. But he held big rallies in Northern Virginia, Richmond and Hampton Roads. Warren made several trips to the state and picked up endorsements but did not seem to tap as much liberal fire as Sanders, whose likeness has been on a giant mural along a busy Richmond thoroughfare since he ran for the nomination in 2016.
Elido Reyes, 25, who is black and Latino, said Sanders was the only candidate talking about issues that matter to him, such as universal health care, making education affordable to all and addressing police violence. 
The Norfolk resident said he isn't sure he'll vote this fall if the nominee isn't Sanders. 
""I'm not going to just be the minority who votes Democrat,"" Reyes said. ""The institutional Democratic Party isn't something I appreciate, and it doesn't seem to have done much for people like my family and friends.""

At the Lyles-Crouch Traditional Academy polling place in the Old Town area of Alexandria, Lawrence McKnight, 28, said he wanted a Democratic presidential candidate who would bring change. After mulling Sanders and Warren, he backed the senator from Vermont as the more disruptive choice. 
""I feel like for the past 200 years or so, we've been a country with the status quo of thought,"" said McKnight, who recently returned to the United States after several years working abroad. ""We're only even more stratified with the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, and no one seems to be taking it seriously. It's not going to get solved in four years or eight years, but at least Bernie can get the work started.""
At Yorkshire Elementary School in Manassas, Tim York cheerfully announced that he, too, chose Sanders in the open primary - in hopes of helping Trump get reelected in November.
""He's the weakest candidate,"" York, 39, said of Sanders, predicting that the senator's calls for Medicare-for-all and free college tuition would turn off moderate voters. ""I think the president has a good chance, regardless, but especially against Bernie.""

Concern that Sanders is vulnerable to Trump drove many voters to settle on Biden as the safer bet.
Monica Moore, 55, was among many suburban voters still torn between candidates on voting day. She said she likes Sanders's policies, but Biden seems more electable. At Yorkshire Elementary, she picked Biden.
""I walked in, and wherever my hand went first, that's who I was voting for,"" Moore said. 
In Henrico, Kate Giska, 39, a small-business owner and political independent, described Sanders as ""just too extreme, just like Trump is a little too extreme. We're kind of, like, in the middle, just, like, status quo, just get along.""
She voted for Biden, someone she said has appeal for ""the middle voter, a candidate that can attract the masses.""
None of more than 50 voters interviewed at three Virginia Beach precincts on Tuesday said they planned to vote for Sanders, even if they liked some of his positions. Many said they simply thought Biden had a better chance of winning in November.
""This is a tough, tough year,"" said Donnell Burton, 68. 
""I know we need change, but I don't know if we need Bernie,"" he said. ""One thing I do know is, Trump has to go.""

About 6 in 10 Democrats at the Iowa caucuses on Monday reported that they support eliminating private health insurance as part of establishing a single-payer health-care system, according to preliminary poll results, suggesting that most of the party's voters agree with Sen. Bernie Sanders on the divisive issue.
The Vermont independent has campaigned on a Medicare-for-all health-care system in which every American would be placed with a single government insurer, regardless of whether they want to be or not.
Critics, including numerous moderate Democrats, have said the single-payer plan could prove politically toxic by forcing the more than 150-million Americans who receive their insurance through their employers to switch to the government plan.
Medicare-for-all supporters say their plan would give Americans security by guaranteeing that they have a government health plan, even if they get fired or lose their job.
The debate has proved to be a defining fissure throughout the Democratic presidential campaign and led to repeated clashes at the debates, with the moderate presidential candidates accusing Sanders of adopting a dangerously unpopular position. 
Several Democratic presidential candidates backed Medicare-for-all at the outset of the race but eventually backed off amid heavy criticism and polling suggesting people like the private insurance they have. 

The preliminary exit polls, conducted by Edison Research, found that 57-percent of Iowa Democratic caucus-goers support a single-payer plan, and 38-percent oppose the proposal to eliminate private health insurance, leading some single-payer supporters to claim they were vindicated. 
'The conservative wing of the Democratic Party has been telling us voters won't swallow Medicare-for-all once they learn they will lose their insurance,' said Matt Bruenig, founder of People's Policy Project, a socialist think tank. 'But these results show voters are ready for Medicare-for-all. What more is there to say?'
About 4 in 10 Democrats also said health care was the most important issue for them, making it the leading issue, followed by climate change. Health care also rates consistently as a top issue for voters in a general election.
Sanders led among supporters of single-payer health care, with about one-third of this group saying he was their first choice. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) was in second position, with about one-quarter of their support. 
Three years ago, several top Democratic lawmakers threw their support behind Sanders's single-payer proposal. Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (N.Y.), Cory Booker (N.J.) and Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), who all ran for president, appeared at a news conference backing Sanders's legislation.
One by one, however, each of the Democratic senators who had co-sponsored the Medicare-for-all legislation distanced themselves from its least-popular provisions, such as the elimination of private health insurance. Harris, who faced accusations that she flip-flopped on the issue, has dropped out of the race, as have Booker and Gillibrand. 
Warren initially aligned herself more closely with Sanders, saying 'I'm with Bernie' when pressed on eliminating private health insurance. 
Later, she released a plan that would first create an optional government public option and not advance a single-payer system for three years. That alleviated criticisms from centrists who said she wanted to move too aggressively, but garnered new attacks claiming she had waffled on the issue.
For conservatives, the move away from Sanders's position remains a smart one regardless of the results from Iowa. A Washington Post-ABC News poll this summer found support for single-payer drops significantly, to less than half of Americans, when respondents were told that it would mean eliminating private insurance.
Another poll of Iowa voters by CBS News/YouGov last summer found that two-thirds of Democrats said they preferred a government health program that competed with private insurance instead of getting rid of it outright. Polling among all Americans has found that an optional government public option would be more popular than a single-payer plan.
'There is always a danger in listening to one half of one party when trying to win a general election. The lessons of 30 years of health-care reform are that incrementalism is really the only path,' said Brian Riedl, an economic policy expert at the Manhattan Institute, a right-leaning think tank.
A big chunk of the Democratic Party appeared to agree. Among those who opposed single-payer, former vice president Joe Biden and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg led, with each garnering support from about 3 in 10 among this group. Sanders and Warren received support from fewer than 1 in 10 in this group.
Opponents have also argued that single-payer would require prohibitive tax increases, with some think tanks finding that the government would have to raise an additional $30-trillion in revenue over 10-years to pay for the program. 
Sanders's plan proposes moving every American in the country to a single government-run insurer that charges no deductibles or premiums. Doing so would significantly increase government expenditures, while offering health insurance to Americans who lack it and preventing millions more from being forced into medical bankruptcy. 
Sanders has said that his plan would be paid for in part with higher middle-class taxes but has said any tax increases would be offset by savings on insurance premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs.

The Senate voted to bar new evidence in the impeachment trial Friday, paving the way for President Trump's acquittal even as several top Republicans acknowledged that his actions toward Ukraine were not appropriate.
Eleven days into the trial, the highly anticipated vote, which was decided 51 to 49, revealed the partisan divisions in the chamber over whether to subpoena witnesses and documents, a step Democrats argued was crucial to weighing whether Trump abused his power in pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations of his political rivals. Among Republicans, only Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Mitt Romney (Utah) supported the resolution. 
In declining to add to the case presented by House Democrats, the Senate delivered a victory for the White House that all but guaranteed that Trump will remain in office. With a final vote on the articles of impeachment set for Wednesday at 4-p.m., Democrats argued that Trump's expected acquittal will be illegitimate, an acknowledgment of their looming defeat.
'If [a] judge or president believes that it is to his or her advantage that there shall be a trial with no witnesses, they will cite the case of Donald Trump,' said Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), one of the House impeachment managers. 'They will make the argument that you can adjudicate the guilt or innocence of the party without hearing from a single witness, without reviewing a single document. . . . I would submit that will be a very dangerous and long-lasting precedent that we will all have to live with.'
Soon the questions surrounding Trump's actions toward Ukraine will move from the Senate floor to the campaign trail, where voters instead of lawmakers will weigh the evidence in the heat of the 2020 presidential election. 
House Democrats have promised to continue investigating Trump, and new, potentially damaging information could emerge as it has at times during the trial from an indicted former associate of Trump's personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani and a forthcoming book by John Bolton, the former national security adviser.
But on Friday, Senate Republicans said they had finished weighing the matter "" united in their decision to move on, even if members offered varying and at times conflicting reasons for their impending votes to acquit.
Trump is accused of withholding military aid and an Oval Office meeting to push Ukraine's leaders into announcing probes of Democrats, including former vice president Joe Biden, now a presidential candidate, and his son Hunter. The House impeached Trump in December on two counts "" abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. 
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) called the result of the trial 'one of the worst tragedies that the Senate has ever overcome.'
'Americans will know that this trial was not a real trial. It had no witnesses, no documents,' Schumer told reporters after the vote. 'It is a tragedy on a very large scale.'
As the Senate concluded its business for the weekend, Trump accused Democrats of 'scamming America.' 
The Senate approved a resolution setting up closing arguments Monday. Senators will have an opportunity to give speeches Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday about how they plan to vote. 
Postponing the final stage of the trial until next week will allow senators to have a full weekend and was a relief for many who have complained about long hours and uncomfortable conditions in the Senate chamber. 
But extending the timetable into next week also means the trial will collide with two other major events on the political calendar "" the Iowa caucuses on Monday, in which four Democratic senators are competing, and Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday night. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called Trump on Friday evening to brief him on the updated timetable, and the president signed off on it, according to an official familiar with the conversation. 
Trump left for Mar-a-Lago, his Florida estate, on Friday afternoon without taking questions from reporters.
The impeachment managers' effort to persuade Republicans to support calling witnesses was confirmed as a failure earlier in the day when pivotal swing vote Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said she would oppose the motion. 
In a sharply worded statement, Murkowski decried the impeachment process that started last fall in the House, while declining to weigh in on Trump's actions. 
'Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate,' Murkowski said. 'I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything. It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed.'
While Murkowski said her decision was based on her distaste for the process, other Republicans acknowledged to varying degrees that the president was culpable "" a shift in position for some that distanced them from the White House and served as an attempt to inoculate themselves if new incriminating details emerge.
Among the Republicans who argued Trump's behavior was wrong or problematic but not impeachable were Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.), Rob Portman (Ohio), Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.) and Lamar Alexander (Tenn.).
'Just because actions meet a standard of impeachment does not mean it is in the best interest of the country to remove a President from office,' Rubio wrote Friday in a Medium post. 
'I believe that some of the president's actions in this case . . . were wrong and inappropriate,' Portman said Friday in a statement. 'But I do not believe that the president's actions rise to the level of removing a duly-elected president from office.' 
Alexander told The Washington Post on Friday, after announcing the previous night that he would not support calling witnesses, that 'there's a difference between inappropriate conduct, which that clearly is, and treason, bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors. There's a big gap between this conduct and impeachable conduct.'
Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said he had hoped Alexander would have a 'Howard Baker moment,' referring to the Tennessee Republican senator who played a key role in ending Richard M. Nixon's presidency during Watergate and for whom Alexander was a protege.
'But it appears he will not,' Durbin said. 
Republicans staked out their positions as new revelations from Bolton's unpublished manuscript seemed to undercut key elements of Trump's defense. 
The New York Times reported Friday that Bolton writes in his forthcoming book that Trump told him in early May to call newly elected Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and ask him to meet with Giuliani, who was pushing for investigations into the Bidens and a widely contested theory that Ukraine worked with Democrats to undermine Trump during the 2016 election. 
The directive to Bolton was reportedly given during a meeting that included Giuliani, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, who has led Trump's defense on the Senate floor. If true, it would represent the earliest reported example of Trump's direct involvement in the pressure campaign against Ukraine. 
Trump denied the report in a statement, saying the meeting 'never happened.' 
But Schiff seized on it in making his argument for witnesses. 
'The facts will come out,' he said. 'They will continue to come out. And the question before you today is whether they will come out in time for you to make a complete and informed judgment as to the guilt or innocence of the president.'
Also citing Bolton's manuscript, the Times reported Sunday that in a conversation with Bolton in August, Trump directly tied his hold on $391-million of military aid to investigations into Democrats. 
New revelations have also come from Lev Parnas, the ex-Giuliani associate now facing campaign finance charges, who submitted a letter to McConnell on Friday offering to testify about his participation in an effort to oust former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch and gather damaging information about Joe and Hunter Biden. 
The letter, written by Parnas's lawyers, stated that the efforts involved a large group of top Republican officials and operatives, including Vice President Pence, then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Attorney General William P. Barr, Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) and Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.).
Parnas had disclosed much of the information included in the letter in recent media interviews. His claims have been disputed by various Republican leaders, including Pence and Barr.
Trump's former chief of staff, John F. Kelly, who said earlier in the week that he believed Bolton, called the Senate trial 'half a trial' if no witnesses are called. 
'In my view, they kind of leave themselves open to a lot of criticism,' Kelly said in an interview with N.J. Advance Media. 'It's a job only half done. You open yourself up forever as a Senate that shirks its responsibilities.'
As Friday night drew to a close, it appeared Trump would deliver his State of the Union address before his expected acquittal, a small messaging coup for Democrats that was played down by the White House. 
'The president is gratified that finally, at long last, after multiple delays, the Senate will set a schedule for his acquittal next week,' said White House director of legislative affairs Eric Ueland. 'We do not believe the schedule interferes with his ability to deliver a strong and confident State of the Union message next week in the House of Representatives to the country.'

CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. "" The 12th-richest person in the world decided to bet more than $500-million late last year on the long-shot notion that Democrats would defy history and fail to elevate a front-runner after Iowa's and New Hampshire's nominating contests. 
Three months later, Mike Bloomberg's jackpot is about to come due, as the former New York mayor, who has yet to appear on a ballot, emerges from the chaos of early February as a legitimate contender for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Bloomberg has benefited from a cascade of good luck "" a botched and inconclusive Iowa caucuses process, the collapse of the former vice president Joe Biden's polling dominance and the Democratic Party chairman's decision to provide the mayor a path to the next debate. His potential to reshape the race has led his Democratic opponents, as well as President Trump, to begin focusing on him in earnest, even though he is not contesting Nevada and South Carolina, the next two states to vote.
'You have a billionaire literally trying to buy an election, and that's not the politics we believe in,' said Ari Rabin-Havt, deputy campaign manager for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Sanders called Bloomberg's self-funded candidacy 'precisely what the corruption of the American political system is all about' during a Saturday stop in Dover, N.H. 
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) echoed that sentiment in a discussion Sunday with reporters on her campaign bus in Rochester, N.H. 'Are we going to be an America where you've got to be a billionaire or suck up to billionaires to become the party's nominee?' she asked. 
With the exception of Sanders, who finished strong in the Iowa caucuses and won Tuesday's New Hampshire primary, Bloomberg's rivals are heading toward the biggest voting day of the primary "" Super Tuesday on March 3 "" with no clear momentum. Biden and Warren have been hobbled with two embarrassing losses. Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who finished second and third, respectively, in New Hampshire, face the challenge of winning over nonwhite voters who have not yet embraced their campaigns. 
Bloomberg, who has been dominating the airwaves unchallenged in many states, said Wednesday that he does not want to engage directly with his rivals at the moment. He is not, however, above more oblique references.
'We don't need a revolution. We want evolution,' he told a mostly white crowd of hundreds at a rally in Tennessee on Wednesday, a nod to Sanders. 'And we need a nominee who can deliver it.' 
Yet it became clear in recent days that the scrutiny is coming from all directions.

As New Hampshire voters went to the polls Tuesday, the Biden campaign joined with Trump in trying to spread around a 2015 audio clip in which Bloomberg defended the targeted frisking of black and Latino New Yorkers during his time as mayor, a policy he has since renounced and apologized for promoting. 
'Ninety-five percent of your murders, murderers and murder victims fit one M.O. You can just take the description, Xerox it and pass it out to all the cops,' he was recorded saying at Aspen Institute event.
The quotes caught fire after they were posted online Monday by a liberal podcast host, though the Republican opposition research firm America Rising claimed Tuesday that it had previously flagged the clip and that there were others like it to come. Biden's director of African American engagement, Trey Baker, emailed the audio around to allies on Monday night. 
'Feel free to share with your networks,' Baker wrote in the email, which was obtained by The Washington Post. Symone Sanders, an adviser to Biden, went on Fox News to call the clip 'sad' and 'despicable.' 'Mayor Bloomberg is unvetted,' she later warned. 
Trump retweeted and then deleted the footage on his account Tuesday morning, and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, subsequently posted another clip of Bloomberg defending 'stop and frisk' with the hashtag #Bloombergisaracist. As president, Trump has been a vocal defender of stop-and-frisk policing, even announcing in 2018 that he wanted the Justice Department to encourage the practice in cities.

'I don't think those words reflect how I led the most diverse city in the nation,' Bloomberg said in a brief news conference Wednesday. 'And I apologized for the practice and the pain that it caused.'
His campaign also announced the endorsements of three more black lawmakers, Reps. Lucy McBath (D-Ga.) and Gregory W. Meeks (D-N.Y.), and Del. Stacey Plaskett (D-Virgin Islands). 
Bloomberg's advisers expect more incoming over the coming weeks as his profile rises. Rivals have previously taken issue with his past positions on financial regulatory reform, the allegations of sexual harassment at his eponymous media company and his strong support for charter schools. 
'It became crystal clear today that we are the opponent that Trump least wants to face,' Bloomberg adviser Howard Wolfson said in response to the Trump tweet Tuesday. 'The entire apparatus has engaged against us, which is a sign that we are doing well.' 

Rival campaigns have also begun to raise concerns about whether Bloomberg's strength could help speed Sanders's path to the nomination by further splitting the moderate vote in the party. Under Democratic rules, candidates can only accrue delegates if they clear 15 percent support thresholds, which are measured on both statewide and congressional district levels. 
Two national polls this week, by Monmouth University and Quinnipiac University, found that Sanders was the only candidate comfortably clearing that bar, raising the possibility that he would win a disproportionate number of delegates if his rivals remain bunched up below 10 percent.
'Right now, it looks like he is undermining his stated goal for getting in the race, which is preventing Bernie Sanders from being the nominee,' said a senior strategist for a rival Democratic campaign, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy. 'Just as we do see moderates starting to surge, whether it is Pete or Amy, he is stepping in to stop the momentum.' 
Bloomberg's aides, who privately share the same concern about the moderate vote splitting in a way that helps Sanders, said the burden is on other candidates 'to get out' if they have failed to perform in the early contests. The aides spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy. 
'Everybody has got to make a decision,' Bloomberg said Wednesday about the dilemma presented by a crowded field. 'You have to balance between what you think is right for the country/party, to get a candidate to beat Donald Trump, and on the other hand your personal aspirations.' 
Behind the scenes, Bloomberg, who is worth more than $50 billion, has stepped up his debate preparations, which began last year, as he faces what is likely to be the next major test of his campaign. He needs one more party-approved national poll over a 10 percent threshold before Tuesday to qualify for the Feb. 19 debate in Las Vegas. 
The Bloomberg strategy for winning the nomination depends heavily on him earning the support of nonwhite voters in the March primary states, where most of the party's delegates will be awarded. Those voters consistently voiced support for Biden in polling last year, and Biden's aides have expressed confidence in recent weeks that they will be able to maintain the support, despite the New Hampshire and Iowa setbacks.

Democratic strategists unaffiliated with the current campaigns say the next big question for Bloomberg is whether his growing support, which has been buffeted by a massive investment in television advertising, will convert into a base of voters who retain real enthusiasm for his campaign. Polls continue to show Bloomberg trailing other Democratic contenders in favorability.
'He needed to draw an inside straight, and so far he has,' Barack Obama's former campaign manager Jim Messina said. 'The question is: When it is snowing in a Midwestern state on March 3, are voters going to get up and wade through the snow to vote for Mike Bloomberg?' 
In broadcast and digital advertising, Bloomberg has already spent more than $344 million, according to Advertising Analytics, a tracking firm. 
Bloomberg argued that he needs to spend the money because he got in the race so late. 'I'm not trying to buy the election,' he said. 
That advertising includes a range of different approaches, from conventional spots attacking Trump on health care and boasting of Bloomberg's working relationship with Obama to viral social media attempts to attack Trump in a space where he is often dominant.
One recent social media spot redubbed a Trump address from the White House to make it look like he was just repeating the words 'lie' and 'unfair' over an electronic beat. The campaign superimposed graphics on the video of a dancing gingerbread cookie with its legs on fire. The 2 minute and 30 second video has been viewed more than 2.1 million times on Twitter. 
Almost to a person, attendees at his rally in Chattanooga said they were familiar with his paid advertising.
 'I love his ads,' said Annette Allen, a voter from Signal Mountain, Tenn., who said her only priority was finding a Democratic candidate to beat Trump. 'My vote is for sale.'

Former vice president Joe Biden continued Tuesday night on his trajectory toward the Democratic presidential nomination with wins in Michigan, Mississippi and Missouri.
The wins meant Biden would extend his delegate lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) one week after initially gaining it on Super Tuesday, even as three states voting Tuesday had yet to be called: Idaho, North Dakota and Washington.
Here are some takeaways.
1. The delegate gap widens
We don't yet know the full results, but we can say with confidence that Biden's delegate lead will grow substantially once we get them all. That's because of both the trio of early wins - in states making up 63 percent of the delegates available Tuesday - and the margins of victory.
Michigan and Missouri were very close between Sanders and Hillary Clinton in 2016, but the margins Tuesday were so big that Biden was called the winner in both shortly after polls closed. There was also an outside shot that Sanders would fail to clear the 15 percent threshold for delegates in Mississippi, which would be yet another big setback for him, despite the state's relatively small number of delegates (36).
When you throw all of that on top of the fact that the slow-counting California primary hasn't produced the kind of delegate comeback Sanders was hoping for in the days after Super Tuesday, you start to see a yawning gap in the delegate race. All that remains to be seen now is how much the margin increased.
2. Michigan giveth, and Michigan taketh away
The Wolverine State was Sanders's ticket to the party in 2016, with his shocking upset there - after polls showed him down by double digits - serving notice after Super Tuesday that Democratic voters weren't quite ready to anoint Clinton. On Tuesday, it may have served the opposite function.
One of the more interesting findings in the early exit polls was this: Among voters who decided on their candidate before this month, Sanders took a majority of voters, compared with Biden's 4 in 10. But about half of voters said they decided this month - i.e., after Biden began his comeback with a big win in South Carolina - and they went for Biden more than 2 to 1.
In other words, Sanders was arguably primed to win the Michigan primary just 11 days ago, and then things changed significantly.
It's an especially big win for Biden because he did it statewide and with surging turnout. While 1.2 million people voted in the state in the 2016 Democratic primary, that number was estimated at 1.7 million Tuesday. Part of that could have been that there was no competitive Republican primary. In a state that Democrats badly need to win in the general election after losing it narrowly in 2016, expect Biden to make that part of his pitch: I can get voters to the polls in Michigan, because I just did it.
3. Sanders hits his demographic wall again
It was incumbent upon Sanders at the start of this race to build on his 2016 coalition - or hope for the crowded race to last longer. But now that the field is down to two candidates, two very familiar and potentially fatal problems remain for Sanders.
The first is his performance among black voters. His inability to win them over in 2016 was pretty much fatal in his race against Clinton. And now that it's just him and Biden, the story is virtually the same. In Mississippi, he took 11 percent of the black vote in 2016 and was taking 13 percent on Tuesday, according to exit polls. In Missouri, he took 32 percent in 2016 and was taking 28 percent on Tuesday. In Michigan, he moved from 28 percent four years ago to 29 percent on Tuesday.
The other is his reliance upon younger voters. Sanders's campaign has argued that he can win in the general election because of his unusual appeal to this low-turnout group, but thus far that hasn't panned out in the earliest contests. And it deserted him again on Tuesday. Voters between 18 and 44 were 40 percent of the vote in Mississippi in 2016, but just 31 percent on Tuesday. In Missouri, they were 41 percent in 2016 and 33 percent on Tuesday. In Michigan, youth turnout was the reason he pulled a shocking upset in 2016, but 18-to-44-year-olds' share of the vote dropped from 45 percent then to 38 percent on Tuesday.
Given that, Sanders needed to expand his appeal to older people and to working-class white voters, but he's regressed on both of those, too.
4. The calendar is turning in Biden's direction
As ominous for Sanders as what happened on Tuesday night was this: It might have been his best shot at actually getting back in the race this month.
In 2016, Sanders carried four of the six states that were up Tuesday - the three yet-to-be-determined states and Michigan. He also came within 0.25 percent in Missouri. The opportunity was there, but he lost ground.
Next week, by contrast, the primaries will be Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio. Sanders lost all of them in 2016, including three of the four by double digits. All of them are demographically tough for him, for varying reasons, and all of them are relatively big delegate prizes, with about 200 more delegates at stake than there were on Tuesday night.
Then the week after that comes Georgia, a state with a large black population and many delegates.
In other words, it becomes very difficult to see how Biden doesn't come out of this month with a very large delegate prize. Sanders needs to do something to change the race in a big way, but it's not clear that he has the opportunity over the next two weeks.
Also consider this: The only states Sanders has won east of the Mississippi River are his home state of Vermont and the neighboring state of New Hampshire, which was very close. There simply aren't enough people in the western part of the country for Sanders, especially with California out of the way.
5. Biden's electability case grows
It wasn't just the surge in turnout in Michigan. Biden's wins also spanned the Democratic electorate in one very significant way.
The following is true in all three states that Biden won early Tuesday night: He won nonwhites who both went to college and didn't - no surprise there - but he also won both whites who went to college and those who didn't. The closest he came to losing any of them was in Michigan, where non-college whites were somewhat close.
You can't directly translate primary results to the general election, but for a Democratic Party that is twitchy about putting forward an electable candidate, you could do a lot worse than showing that kind of appeal to all corners of the party.

Facing reelection battle, majority leader plays to base


FLORENCE, Ky. "" It is not easy these days to lose as a Republican running in ruby-red Kentucky. But that is what happened here in November in the governor's race, when the caustic incumbent managed to alienate enough of his base to fall just short.

This year, another polarizing and unpopular Republican will be up for reelection in the Bluegrass State. But Mitch McConnell has at least one key advantage that former governor Matt Bevin did not: As perhaps the most powerful man on Capitol Hill, he is positioned to drive a stake through efforts to oust a Republican who remains indisputably admired among Kentucky voters: President Trump.
The Senate majority leader's insistence that he will coordinate Trump's impeachment trial with the White House "" and that he has no intention of being impartial "" has provoked howls of protest from Democrats. On Sunday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) accused McConnell of orchestrating a 'coverup' of Trump's actions.
It has also prompted speculation that he could jeopardize his slender majority by exposing Republicans in swing or Democratic-leaning states to accusations that they went along with a rigged process running counter to the Constitution.
But here in Kentucky, it just looks like savvy politics.
The 77-year-old is expected to face a vigorous challenge in November from a decorated Marine fighter pilot with a record of big-dollar fundraising. Yet McConnell has shown an unerring instinct for self-preservation across six Senate terms and a record stint as Republican leader.

Analysts say his impeachment strategy is just more evidence that he is playing to win.
'It's the safest move he could make,' said Ryan Salzman, a politics professor at Northern Kentucky University. 'Anything that even appears he's going against President Trump on impeachment, in any way, would be the worst thing he could do for his reelection.'
So far, there is no suggestion that he will. Over weeks of negotiation, McConnell has refused to bow to pressure from Senate and House Democrats "" or even from more moderate members of his own caucus "" over how he will manage the process. The majority leader has instead vowed 'total coordination' with the White House.
With the trial expected to begin as soon as this week, there is no assurance that the Senate will subpoena witnesses or documents related to the Trump administration's campaign to force Ukraine to open an inquiry into presidential rival Joe Biden.
As the process unfolds, the pressure on McConnell is expected to intensify. Several Republican senators "" including Mitt Romney (Utah), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) and Susan Collins (Maine), the latter of whom is expected to face a tough reelection fight "" have either expressed misgivings about their leader's intentions or said directly that they want key witnesses, including former national security adviser John Bolton, to testify.
'We have to take that step back from being hand-in-glove with the defense,' Murkowski told an Alaska radio station late last month, adding that she was 'disturbed' by McConnell's coziness with the administration on impeachment.
But for now, McConnell "" who can afford to lose up to three votes while retaining a working majority "" has the support he needs to call the shots. The political calculus on McConnell's home front offers him little room to compromise, even if he wanted to.
To Trump's backers here in northern Kentucky "" the small cities, affluent suburbs and rolling hill country that fans out just across the muddy Ohio River from Cincinnati "" that is just how they like it. Many have long been wary of McConnell, deeming him overly willing to cut a deal and insufficiently committed to the president's agenda. His management of the president's trial, they say, will be a test.

'How he handles this impeachment is going to be the big determinant of whether people get behind him,' said Kevin Gordon, a talk radio host and activist.
Impeachment, Gordon said, was tantamount to 'an active coup' and should be given as little credence as possible.
'They should dismiss the charges outright. It's a sham,' Gordon said. 'If McConnell runs the trial the way the Democrats want, people here are not going to be happy.'

So far, conservatives said they like what they have seen.
State Sen. John Schickel credited McConnell for his 'steady hand' and for staying, by and large, in the good graces of Trump voters who are 'very, very, very passionate' in their defense of the president. But he also said McConnell is 'walking a tightrope.'
'He definitely has to watch his right flank. He's always had to,' said Schickel, who recently penned an opinion piece describing 12-weeks of paid parental leave for federal workers, which was agreed to by McConnell's Senate, as 'another step toward socialism.'
'The party leadership in northern Kentucky is very conservative and doesn't always like what he does,' Schickel said.
Last year's gubernatorial race offers a cautionary tale of what happens when a Kentucky politician, even a Republican one, takes the state's conservative voters for granted.
Bevin was infamous for his insults and bullying "" especially of opponents, but even of Republican allies. That caught up to him as the governor sought a second term. Bevin won the primary, but in the general election, matched against a relatively moderate Democrat with a deep pedigree in Kentucky politics, many steadfast Republicans sat the contest out.
'Bevin treated his conservative supporters terribly,' said Phyllis Sparks, a 58-year-old Republican activist who declined to vote for either of the top contenders in the governor's race. 'He didn't represent me or my values.'
Because of voters like Sparks, Bevin's support collapsed statewide, but most notably in northern Kentucky.
In Boone County, the suburban area outside Cincinnati where Sparks lives, Bevin's margin was cut by 20-percentage points compared with his first run. In the adjacent counties of Kenton and Campbell "" places Bevin had won handily in 2015 and Trump had carried by 25-points a year later "" the Democrat, Andy Beshear, flipped them en route to a 5,000-vote squeaker of a statewide victory.
The result galvanized Democrats, especially the campaign of Amy McGrath, the Marine veteran who is the favorite to win the party's primary and to challenge McConnell in the fall.
'It gave us momentum,' McGrath said in an interview. 'Matt Bevin was incredibly unpopular, and Kentuckians got rid of him. Mitch McConnell is also very unpopular.'

According to one poll last year, the majority leader has less support in his home state than any other senator, with just 37 percent of Kentuckians backing him.
Yet most prognosticators say McConnell's chances of winning reelection are strong, and even Democrats acknowledge that the comparison to Bevin has serious limitations.
For one thing, 'McConnell doesn't insult everyone on a daily basis, which Bevin did,' said Linda Nesbitt, chair of the Campbell County Democrats.
For another, McConnell will be running on a ticket with Trump, a president who enjoys a plus-14 net favorability in Kentucky, at the top. Though the two got off to a rocky start "" Trump's early months in office featured a presidential tweetstorm against the senator for his failure to repeal and replace Obamacare "" they have since found an accommodation.
'They're a team,' said Josh Holmes, a former McConnell chief of staff whose political consulting firm handles the senator's digital advertising. 'The president's agenda requires somebody like Mitch McConnell to get it done.'
Tax reform and judicial appointments are central pillars of Trump's record that were enabled by McConnell. Now impeachment will offer the senator a fresh, high-profile chance to showcase his value to the president "" and to Trump's supporters.
'He's handling impeachment like a surgeon would "" with precision,' said Sparks, who said she will eagerly volunteer for both Trump's and McConnell's campaigns this fall. 'McConnell's been a good ally of the president, and Trump's coattails are very long.'
An October poll found that just 29-percent of Kentuckians favor impeaching and removing Trump. That has made the issue a tricky one for McGrath, who came up short in a 2018 House election.
After the House voted to impeach the president in December, McConnell's campaign knocked the Democrat for releasing a lengthy statement that did not say specifically whether she supported the House's move. (She later clarified that she did.)
McGrath said in the interview that impeachment is rarely what voters most want to discuss with her, and that her message to them is focused far more on 'kitchen table' issues such as health care and education. To the extent that voters do bring up impeachment, she said, 'you get this feeling of, 'Let's move on.'-'
Still, she said she would continue speaking out against McConnell's handling of the trial, which she described as 'going against your oath under the Constitution.'
'Most Kentuckians want a fair trial,' she said.
Many Kentuckians, of course, do not even think it is worthy of a trial. Around the bar at PeeWee's "" a dimly lit but highly spirited watering hole popular among local Republicans "" even mention of the 'i-word' elicits sputtering condemnations of Democrats for daring to try to take down 'the best president we've ever had.'
In quieter corners, some offer more nuanced views. Paul Fiser, a 60-year-old lawyer, faulted Pelosi for going ahead with impeachment despite saying she would not proceed without bipartisan support. But he also criticized McConnell for saying he could not be an impartial juror.
Fiser said he had backed Trump 'reluctantly' in 2016 and would probably do so again in 2020. But he drew a distinction between the president "" still an outsider, even after three years in Washington "" and the Kentuckian who has walked the halls of Congress for more than three decades.
'McConnell has become the ultimate insider. But people are tired of business as usual. They're looking for unconventional candidates,' said Fiser, who described himself as undecided in the Senate race. 'He's not a lock like he's been in the past.'

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. - Bernie Sanders has massively stepped up efforts to woo female voters since Joe Biden took the lead in delegates and Elizabeth Warren dropped out of the race. 
The independent senator from Vermont unveiled a ""reproductive health care and justice for all"" plan on Saturday evening. He's attacking the former vice president for supporting the Hyde Amendment, which banned Medicaid funds from being used to cover abortions, until reversing himself under pressure last year. He's reading aloud a quote from the 1970s in which Biden said that Roe v. Wade ""went too far."" 
""Women have a right to control their own bodies, not the government,"" Sanders said during an outdoor rally on a sunny Sunday afternoon. ""Here is my promise to you: I will never nominate anyone to the Supreme Court or the federal bench who is not 100 percent pro-Roe v. Wade. . . . We're in this together.""
The Rev. Jesse Jackson told the crowd of 7,600 that he endorsed Sanders only after receiving an ironclad commitment that he would nominate an African American woman to the Supreme Court and a promise that he would give ""serious consideration"" to naming a black woman as his running mate. ""Bernie can win, will win and must win,"" Jackson said.
Michigan is the most populous and symbolically significant of six states voting Tuesday. An EPIC-MRA poll released this week showed Biden leading Sanders 51 percent to 27 percent in the state, with 13 percent undecided and 9 percent saying they plan to vote for another candidate. But this should be taken with a grain of salt. The pre-primary polls four years ago showed Hillary Clinton with a similarly huge lead, and Sanders pulled off an upset. Clinton's weakness foreshadowed Donald Trump narrowly carrying the state in November. 
The Sanders campaign rushed resources and staff to Michigan over the weekend, going all in on the Wolverine State the way that Biden did before South Carolina's primary. The other states with primaries on Tuesday are Missouri, Washington, Idaho, Mississippi and North Dakota.
Women are the centerpiece of Sanders's comeback strategy here, including an effort to win over former supporters of Warren. Biden led Sanders among women by 12 points on Super Tuesday, 37 percent to 25 percent, based on median support in available exit polling, with Warren (D-Mass.) pulling 15 percent and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg getting 13 percent. Biden led Sanders among men by a narrower 4 points, 36 percent to 32 percent, with Warren in single digits.
""My heart wants to vote for Bernie. My gut wants to vote for Biden,"" said Melissa Courtade, 46, who sits on the Kenowa Hills school board. She had planned to vote for Warren on Tuesday and remains undecided after watching Sanders speak. Courtade likes Sanders's plan to raise teacher pay to a minimum of $60,000 per year but doesn't think it's realistic. She likes the idea of Medicare-for-all, but she isn't sure that's realistic, either. She really likes Sanders personally, and many of her friends support him, but she's not sure he can beat Trump. 
Courtade, who voted for Clinton in the 2016 primary, said her 19-year-old daughter is supporting Biden because she thinks Sanders is too liberal to carry Michigan in the general election. ""She jokingly teases me and says you're ADD when it comes to this election, and I really am,"" Courtade said. ""I just don't know where my head is at right now.""
She was one of about two dozen women I spoke with at Sanders's rally on Sunday afternoon. Several said they had planned to back Warren or one of the other female candidates but now reluctantly needed to decide between Sanders and Biden. A February Washington Post-ABC News poll found that while Sanders was ranked higher as a second choice by many Warren voters, a significant chunk favored moderate candidates, including Biden. 
Kim Sapkowski, 55 of Belmont, had planned to vote for Warren but will now support Sanders because, in her view, Biden's plans are too incremental. Her position as an administrative assistant at a local university was eliminated last month because of budget cuts. Now she's unemployed and has two kids in college. She worries a recession is looming, which bolsters her conviction that this is no time for ""the half-measures."" 
""I'm disappointed that we still are hesitant about electing a woman as president, but we've just got to beat Trump,"" Sapkowski said. ""The biggest response that the crowd gave Bernie was when he said that the government should get its hands off women's bodies. That was the strongest response he got, and you're in maybe the most conservative part of Michigan.""
Biden will hold his own rally in Grand Rapids on Monday in a bid to blunt Sanders's strength in Western Michigan. 
Carolyn Ferrari, the regional manager for a theater company and one of the relatively few black faces at Sanders's rally here, had leaned toward supporting Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). But she decided to support Sanders on Sunday after hearing him commit to nominate a black woman to the Supreme Court. A hundred years after the ratification of the 19th Amendment granted women the right to vote, she said she assumed all along over the past year that no women would be left in the race at this stage because sexism remains so endemic in American politics. ""I'm almost 50, and I don't know that it's going to change in my lifetime. But to be honest, I also didn't think we'd see a black president in my lifetime,"" she said. 
Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) remains in the race, but she has only two delegates from American Samoa. 
Women, especially in the suburbs, powered the Democratic takeover of the House in the 2018 midterm elections. And indeed, Sanders fares better among women than the saturation coverage of the ""Bernie Bros"" might lead you to believe. 
""His main supporters are teachers,"" said Sanders supporter Nichole Biber, 45, an elementary school librarian in East Lansing. ""Every time I go canvassing, it's women and men. The grass-roots movements that endorse him are made up of a lot of mothers. All the women I know voted for him four years ago. too.""
Sanders has flushed out what once seemed like a box-checking afterthought toward the end of his stump speech with a robust commitment to make fighting for women a top priority. He now says one of his top legislative goals would be codifying the protections of Roe into federal law and ""significantly"" increasing funding for Planned Parenthood. His reproductive health-care plan pledges to use executive authority to reverse ""Trump's anti-choice actions,"" require pre-clearance by the Justice Department for all new state abortion laws, block any federal funding for ""crisis pregnancy centers"" that don't perform abortions, make birth control available over-the-counter - it would also be free under Medicare-for-all - and ban abstinence-only sex education in schools. 
The plan includes an emphasis on increasing access to reproductive services in communities of color, with provisions for eliminating ""contraceptive deserts"" and increasing funding to hospitals where most patients are African American. Discussing this plan in Grand Rapids, Sanders said: ""We're tired of black mothers dying at three times the rate of white mothers.""
Biden has been trying to stay above the fray. His campaign didn't respond directly to the abortion-focused attacks. Instead, he is running a commercial here that touts past praise from former president Barack Obama, as well as a response ad to a Sanders attack that he once supported cutting Social Security benefits. 
Biden released a lengthy statement commemorating International Women's Day on Sunday. ""Four years after more than 65 million Americans proudly cast their ballot hoping to elect our first female president, we are fighting for the very soul of our nation and to rid the White House of a man who has fostered misogyny, bigotry, racism, and division all across our country,"" he wrote. 
On the other hand, many feminists remain angry at Biden for his treatment of Anita Hill during Clarence Thomas's confirmation hearing to the Supreme Court in 1991. Biden, who was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has expressed regret over his handling of her allegations of sexual harassment. Lucy Flores, a former Nevada state legislator, accused Biden last spring of smelling her hair and kissing the back of her head at a 2014 rally in Las Vegas.
After Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) backed Biden on Sunday, her aides told reporters that she waited to support him until there were no other major female candidates left in the race. 
""Like many women, I watched with sadness as women exited the race one by one,"" she said in her video announcement. ""This is something we must reckon with, and it is something I will have more to say about in the future. But we must rise to unite the party and country behind a candidate who reflects the decency and dignity of the American people and who can ultimately defeat Donald Trump.""

Former vice president Joe Biden named Jen O'Malley Dillon as his new campaign manager Thursday, a major shake-up that comes as the party's leading candidate plans an organizational expansion to prepare for the general election.
The move is intended to quell concerns raised in recent weeks by senior Democratic strategists about the leadership structure of the Biden campaign, which has been beset by underwhelming fundraising, scant staffing resources and organizational miscues during the early nominating contests.
""She will be a tremendous asset to a campaign that is only growing and getting stronger as we prepare to take the fight to Donald Trump this fall,"" Biden said in a statement accompanying the announcement.
The campaign shuffle is an acknowledgment that while Biden has had a remarkable recent run of victories - at least 15 of the past 21 contests - his operation was not up to the challenge posed by President Trump if Biden were to win the nomination.
After Biden performed well below expectations in the Iowa caucuses, Anita Dunn, a senior adviser who previously worked for President Barack Obama, took operational control of the campaign, sharing responsibilities with Biden's original campaign manager, Greg Schultz.
Dunn, who helped Biden prepare for a possible 2016 run for president, will also continue with the campaign, returning to her role as a senior adviser to Biden. Schultz, who prepared and built the Biden campaign and oversaw initial hiring and delegate strategy, will stay on in a new role. ""I will value his continued input on this campaign,"" Biden said in the announcement.
""I look forward to building out the Biden coalition and doing the necessary preparations for a possible general election and making sure we coordinate with the local, state, and national Democratic infrastructure,"" Schultz said in a statement to The Washington Post.
In the wake of multiple victories in Tuesday's presidential primary contests, Biden's advisers acknowledged taking steps to expand virtually all parts of his shoestring campaign operation, from finance, field and communications departments to the senior leadership team, answering the concerns of senior Democrats who are bracing for a new wave of assaults from Trump.
""Jen is in a league of her own,"" said Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, a super PAC that has committed to helping Biden. ""She is smart, strategic and a terrific team builder. I can't imagine a better person to lead us into November.""
Robby Mook, who managed Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign, also praised the new leadership structure.
""She comes to this with all the different pieces of the tool kit,"" Mook said of O'Malley Dillon. ""The best campaign managers are talented and prepared, and she is coming with both.""
He also favored Schultz's new role as one of the point people for coordinating with the Democratic National Committee.
""You want someone heading up that operation who has the deep trust of the candidate and of the inner circle,"" Mook said. ""And you want someone with deep experience running the state operations, and Greg has both of those things.""
Biden's new campaign manager also has deep ties across the party. O'Malley Dillon, 43, served as battleground states director for Obama's 2008 campaign and deputy campaign manager for his 2012 reelection effort. She was also executive director for the Democratic National Committee during his first term, putting her in the inner circle of Obama's political advisers.
More recently, she helped to lead an early 2019 Democratic effort to create a new for-profit data exchange to allow for greater information sharing between Democratic campaigns and affiliated groups, an effort party leaders see a crucial for catching up with the Republican data program.
O'Malley Dillon later served as the presidential campaign manager for former congressman Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.), relocating to El Paso. After O'Rourke's campaign ended, she volunteered as a campaign adviser for Biden before the Nevada caucuses, and then continued on as an informal adviser to senior Biden campaign officials in recent weeks.
O'Malley Dillon will work out of the campaign's Philadelphia headquarters.
""Vice President Biden is turning out voters at record levels and building the broad coalition we need to ensure Donald Trump doesn't get a second term,"" O'Malley Dillon said in a statement. ""It's an honor to help make him the 46th President and I'm ready to get to work.""

Lev Parnas said he arrived for his May meeting in Kyiv with a top aide to Ukraine's president-elect, Volodymyr Zelensky, with a clear directive from Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump's personal lawyer: Unless Zelensky announced an investigation into former vice president Joe Biden, one of Trump's possible 2020 rivals, his country's relationship with the United States would sour. 
Among the consequences he threatened, Parnas said in interviews this week: that Vice President Pence's expected attendance at Zelensky's inauguration later that month "" a high-level recognition that the Ukrainians urgently sought "" would be canceled. 
When Ukrainians were unresponsive, Parnas said he relayed the bad news to Giuliani. 'Okay, they'll see,' the president's lawyer responded, Parnas told MSNBC. 
The very next day, Trump instructed Pence to cancel his trip to Ukraine for Zelensky's inauguration, according to a whistleblower complaint and congressional testimony from one of Pence's own aides. 
The rapid sequence of events in mid-May marks one of the earliest known moments when Guiliani's shadow campaign to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations that would benefit Trump inextricably merged with official U.S. foreign policy "" and, if Parnas's account is accurate, appeared to move the levers of the American government. In the process, the vice president was dangled as a bargaining chip "" perhaps unwittingly "" to exert leverage over a foreign government, according to Parnas, a Soviet-born businessman who functioned as Giuliani's fixer in Ukraine.
Trump's supporters have attacked Parnas's credibility, noting that he is under indictment in New York for campaign finance violations. In a statement, White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham called Parnas 'a man who is currently out on bail for federal crimes and is desperate to reduce his exposure to prison.'
Giuliani, who denied to the New York Times last year that he directed Parnas to deliver a warning to the Ukrainians, did not respond to requests for comment Thursday. The aide to Zelensky who met with Parnas, Serhiy Shefir, and an attorney for Igor Fruman, another Giuliani associate in attendance, have also disputed aspects of Parnas's account.
However, text messages and other documents released by the House this week, as well as congressional testimony during the impeachment inquiry, corroborate the timeline that Parnas detailed in interviews with MSNBC and CNN about the episode "" and show how a rogue operation engineered by Giuliani began subsuming official U.S. policy. 
'A very harsh message'
The takeover did not happen immediately. Beginning in 2018, Giuliani and two associates "" Parnas and Fruman "" spent months pursuing material in Ukraine to benefit Trump and agitating for the ouster of U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, whose removal was sought by a top Ukrainian prosecutor who promised to help Trump in exchange.
By the spring of 2019, Giuliani's campaign finally seemed to be paying dividends. Yovanovitch was abruptly recalled back to the United States in late April. And Ukrainian government officials appeared willing to cooperate with Trump's lawyer "" particularly Yuri Lutsenko, at the time Ukraine's top prosecutor and a close political ally of then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. 
But when Zelensky "" a comedian and political neophyte "" trounced Poroshenko in the final round of Ukraine's presidential election in late April, Giuliani's project was thrown into doubt. 
In early May, as Zelensky prepared for his inauguration later that month, Giuliani tried to make inroads with the new Ukrainian leadership and planned a trip to Kyiv with the hope of meeting the president-elect. The former mayor told the Times on May-9 he was planning to ask Zelensky, among other things, to investigate the involvement of Biden's son on the board of a Ukrainian gas company. 
Giuliani asserted that his mission to Ukraine was a personal one, being undertaken to assist the president's personal defense in the special counsel investigation "" even though that probe had concluded.
'This isn't foreign policy,' Giuliani told the Times. 
In a letter dated May-10, sent through Interior Minister Arsen Avakov, Giuliani asked Zelensky for that meeting so he could make a 'specific request' in his 'capacity as personal counsel to President Trump and with his knowledge and consent.' He didn't mention Biden by name.
After Giuliani's travel plans became public and prompted an outcry, he scrapped the trip. Giuliani went on Fox News the night of May-10 and said he wasn't going to Kyiv because Zelensky was surrounded by enemies of Trump and enemies of the United States. The comments irked Zelensky's team in Kyiv, which wanted to secure Trump's support but saw his personal lawyer calling them enemies on cable television.
At that point, Parnas told MSNBC's Rachel Maddow in an interview that aired Wednesday, he was tapped by Giuliani to convey 'a very harsh message' "" that the U.S.-Ukrainian relationship 'would be sour' unless the Zelensky administration announced the investigations Giuliani wanted.
'The most important was the announcement of the Biden investigation,' he said. Without that, 'Pence would not show up' at Zelensky's inauguration.
While Giuliani emphasized his Ukraine trip was intended for Trump's personal benefit, Parnas said he went to Ukraine empowered to invoke core powers of the U.S. government "" military aid, official travel, a White House visit "" to force the Ukrainians' hand.
Messages exchanged on Whats App between Parnas and Shefir, the top Zelensky aide, show that the Giuliani associate introduced himself to the Ukrainian hours later on May 11. 
'I am mayor rudy Giuliani's friend please call me,' he wrote in Russian.
As his calling card, Parnas sent a copy of the letter Giuliani had sent to Zelensky to prove his association.
Shefir responded and agreed to meet Parnas on May-12 at an upscale restaurant in Kyiv. 
Parnas told Maddow that the meeting was tense. He said Shefir told him he would have to get back to Parnas with an answer to his demand. But when Parnas tried to message the Ukrainian aide that night for an update, he said he got no response.
The text messages show that evening, Parnas messaged Shefir saying, 'Serhiy good evening is there any news!'
Shefir didn't respond to any of Parnas's text messages after that, according to the cache of messages released by House Democrats.
In a statement to the Times in November, Shefir did not directly address what was discussed at the meeting but said that the Zelensky team did not view Parnas and Fruman, who accompanied him, as official representatives who 'could speak on behalf of the U.S. government.'
On the night of May-12, Parnas said, he called Giuliani and told him things were a 'no-go.'



Pence's top Russia adviser, Jennifer Williams, said she was surprised the following morning to receive a call from an assistant to Pence's chief of staff informing her that preliminary plans for Pence to travel to Ukraine for the inauguration had been canceled, she later testified to Congress.


Williams said the news was curious, because preparations were already underway. She testified that when she asked about the sudden change, she was told that Trump had directed Pence to skip the event "" but not the reason why. 
'My understanding from my colleague "" and, again, I wasn't there for the conversation "" was that the president asked the vice president not to attend,' Williams testified.
Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv were also taken aback by the change in plans, according to congressional witnesses.
David Holmes, an official in the U.S. Embassy, testified that he, too, had been told that Pence would be leading the delegation for Zelensky's inauguration. Later, he said he was informed that the White House had 'whittled down an initial proposed list for the official delegation to the inauguration from over a dozen individuals to just five,' led by then-Energy Secretary Rick Perry.
Zelensky's team had expected Pence to come because Biden led the delegation at Poroshenko's inauguration five years earlier. The Ukrainians were hoping Pence would attend to show continuity in U.S. support for Ukraine.
Marc Short, Pence's chief of staff, said that Parnas's account is not credible and should not be believed. 
'This is very simple: Lev Parnas is under a multi-count indictment and will say anything to anybody who will listen in hopes of staying out of prison,' he said in a statement. 'It's no surprise that only the liberal media is listening to him.' 
 Asked about Parnas by reporters as he traveled through Florida on Thursday, Pence said, 'I don't know the guy.' The vice president also dismissed as 'completely false' the speculation by Parnas that Pence was aware of the goal to get Zelensky to announce an investigation into Biden. 
A senior administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal knowledge, said that Pence and his team had no awareness of the meeting between Parnas and Shefir, nor was the vice president's office aware of any conversation between Giuliani and Trump immediately before Trump's directive to Pence that he skip Zelensky's inauguration. 
The official would not share what reason Trump gave Pence for canceling his trip, citing the White House's long-standing policy to not comment on private conversations between the president and the vice president.
A sudden change in tone
The Ukrainians desperately needed Trump's support as they faced a continuing war with Russian-backed proxies in the east, which since 2014 has left some 13,000 people dead. They were particularly eager to ensure a White House visit for Zelensky "" as a potent symbol of the United States' support for Ukraine and its untested new president in its ongoing struggle with powerful Russia. 
Weeks earlier, Zelensky had appeared to be on good footing with the Americans. In an April 21 phone call, Trump congratulated him on winning Ukraine's presidency in a warm conversation. 
'I think you will do a great job,' Trump told Zelensky, according to a transcript of the call released by the White House. 'I have many friends from Ukraine who know you and like you.'
After that call, Williams, the Pence aide, said she received an email from Pence's chief of staff, informing her that Trump had asked Pence to attend the Ukrainian president's inauguration. And on April 23, Pence congratulated Zelensky in a phone call of his own. According to Williams, who was listening to the call, Zelensky invited Pence to attend his inauguration and Pence accepted, provided the dates worked out.
The Ukrainians appeared startled by the sudden rebuff, Parnas said.
'Now they get word, because obviously, when Pence cancels, they get word that Pence is not coming,' he told MSNBC. 'So, now, they realize that what I "" what I was telling them was true.'
By the end of May, Trump's attitude toward Ukraine and Zelensky was hostile. 
During a meeting in the Oval Office, he told Perry, then-special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker and then-U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland "" three top government officials he had tasked with leading U.S. policy toward Ukraine "" that he was skeptical that Ukraine was committed to anti-corruption efforts, according to congressional testimony.
Sondland testified that Trump also griped that Ukrainians had 'tried to take him down' in the 2016 election.
As the group pushed Trump to invite Zelensky to the White House, Sondland said, the president made it clear who was driving the U.S. posture toward Ukraine: 'He just kept saying: Talk to Rudy, talk to Rudy.'

DES MOINES "" A handwritten sign posted inside a Bernie Sanders campaign office tells volunteers how to respond to concern about something that sets Sanders apart from all of his presidential rivals "" his identity as a socialist.
'Affirm ""> I get that! Labels can be intimidating,' the sign instructs them to say, especially 'those unfamiliar to us.' It encourages them to say Sanders stands for 'social equality' and 'equal opportunity for all' and ends with a suggestion to 'redirect' prospective supporters to other topics.
Three miles across town, in a Thursday-night rally here, President Trump was eager to talk about socialism, bringing it up in the first two minutes and returning to the theme over and over. 'This November, we're going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats that are right down the street,' he blared.
As Sanders closes in on a potential win in Monday's Iowa caucuses and Trump sharpens a general-election message designed to portray Democrats as radical leftists, a heated debate is emerging over whether America is ready to embrace at least some aspects of socialism "" if not a socialist president.
Sanders is portraying his agenda as a modern liberal movement, while Trump wants to conjure images of the old Soviet Union and oppressive foreign leaders such as Nicolás Maduro and Fidel Castro.
The president intends to return to the topic during his State of the Union address on Tuesday, according to a senior administration official.
The conflict over socialism is far from settled "" even within the Democratic Party. Former vice president Joe Biden, one of Sanders's top rivals, alluded this past week to Sanders's political affiliation, which critics have long used to portray the senator from Vermont as disloyal.
Pressure on both fronts has prompted Sanders and his allies to mount an aggressive defense of his worldview and clarify his positions in the closing days before Iowa holds the first nominating contest.
Sanders's lead in recent polls has forced members of both parties to more seriously contemplate the possibility of something unusual "" a Democratic nominee who does not officially belong to the party. Such an outcome could have far-reaching implications in the battleground states that will be fiercely contested in November.
Sanders, the most liberal candidate in the top tier of the Democratic field, has long identified as a democratic socialist, a philosophy he detailed in a speech last year. 'Democratic socialism means to me requiring and achieving political and economic freedom in every community in this country,' he said in June. He often emphasizes the 'democratic' to distinguish it from authoritarian socialism.
Although he is officially an independent, Sanders caucuses with Democrats in the Senate and has pledged to support whomever the Democratic Party nominates for the presidency. But he has distanced himself from party leaders more than his opponents have done, and he has frequently lambasted the 'Democratic establishment.'
His posture has prompted some criticism. 'I'm a Democrat,' Biden said Thursday. 'He says he's not. He says "" you know, he's not registered as a Democrat, to the best of my knowledge. And Bernie has a different view.'
The tension was evident Friday morning at a Des Moines coffee shop where Sanders's wife, Jane Sanders, campaigned for him as he tended to his duties in Washington as a juror in Trump's impeachment trial.
'I noticed that just recently, one of our chief opponents in the race started talking about how Bernie isn't a Democrat,' Sanders supporter Michael McKinley, 68, told Jane Sanders and her son, David Driscoll.
'What do we say when they come right back and they say, 'Well, he's not a Democrat'?' he asked.
Driscoll encouraged party unity. 'Let's try to keep it as positive as possible,' he said.
Jane Sanders offered a more robust defense of her husband's politics.
'In Vermont, we don't have party registration,' she said. 'So, you just say what you are.' She pointed out that Sanders has belonged to the Democratic caucus for years and was appointed by Senate Democrats to represent them in leadership on two committees.
'So, I don't know how else to do it,' she said. 'If he had been in another state, he would have had to register as a Democrat. We can't as a Vermonter.'
Still, other lawmakers from Vermont, such as the state's other senator, Patrick J. Leahy, explicitly identify as Democrats.
Asked after the event about Trump's attacks on socialism, she declined to engage him.
'I don't give President Trump a lot of thought,' she said. 'I think that he's a very dangerous president for our country.'
Sanders has sought aggressively to distinguish his brand of socialism from the ideas practiced by oppressive leaders abroad. The sign in the Des Moines campaign office, which was on a wall near supporters making phone calls to caucus-goers Tuesday, said that Sanders wants health-care and education systems, as well as the government more broadly, to be 'reliable, accessible, and effective.'
'That's what he means by 'socialism,'-' it concludes.
Sanders campaign officials said they are not focused on labels but on the issues that Sanders has been pushing as he tries to appeal to working-class people. Micah Uetricht, an editor at the socialist magazine Jacobin who canvassed for Sanders two weekends in a row in Iowa, said that no one at the doors he knocked on brought up socialism.
'What's more common is that we talk to someone who's dependent on Medicaid, which brings up a discussion on Bernie's record defending those programs,' he said.
Polls show socialism remains largely unpopular, though how it plays politically among Democrats remains an open question.
A Fox News poll from December found 57-percent of Americans said they were unfavorable toward socialism while 32-percent were favorable. Fifteen-percent said that they couldn't say.
But Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), a Sanders supporter and fellow democratic socialist, has quickly become one of the most electrifying politicians in the country. The Democratic Socialists of America saw its membership increase dramatically after her 2018 upset primary win.
Advocates say that the world is no longer gripped by the paranoia of the Cold War era and that younger voters are not put off by the idea as their parents and grandparents were.
Sanders is pushing an ambitious policy agenda, including enacting a Medicare-for-all health-care system and a Green New Deal climate initiative, both of which would mean sweeping changes to current laws.
Not all Democrats favor those proposals, which would complicate the Republican pitch if the nominee is someone more moderate than Sanders. Biden, for example, favors expanding the Affordable Care Act, not introducing Medicare-for-all.
GOP officials said they are determined to portray the nominee as too far left, no matter who it is. This strategy reprises what the party did in the 2018 midterms, when it sought to cast Democratic congressional candidates as soft on immigration, crime and other highly charged topics.
'Is it going to be Bernie, who has Medicare-for-all, who says, outright, 'I'm going to eliminate private insurance?'-' said Trump campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany. 'Or is it Biden, who has a public option "" the logical endpoint of that being that private insurance is crowded out?'
But the 2018 GOP blueprint was largely unsuccessful. Democratic candidates, mostly running on noncontroversial platforms, flipped dozens of seats, which returned control of the House to Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.).
Nevertheless, there were a few key examples of success for the Republican Party. In Florida, where many Hispanic voters have roots in Latin American countries with a history of authoritarian leftist regimes, Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee for governor, fell in defeat amid attacks casting him as a socialist.
Some Democrats are concerned that if Sanders is the nominee, the prized swing state may be difficult to pry away from Trump's grip. Democrats have also warned that socialism could be a liability in other battlegrounds.
Over the past year, Trump's campaign has come up with different events and gimmicks aimed at branding the full Democratic field as socialist. 'Socialism destroys Ohio Jobs. Vote Trump!' read a banner flying above the Democratic debate site in Ohio last October.
The attacks serve a dual purpose for Trump: rallying his GOP base and inflaming internal tensions in the Democratic Party, said Republican strategist Doug Heye.
'It very smartly drives a very blunt wedge into the Democratic debate in the days leading up to the kickoff for really the whole campaign,' he said.
Trump has never specifically defined what he is referring to when he talks about socialism, regularly using the term broadly to discuss Democrats' positions on energy, health care, taxes, immigration and more.
'This election is a choice between American freedom and democratic socialism, and in some cases, in my opinion, it's worse than socialism,' Trump said in one of 10 mentions of socialism during his speech in Des Moines on Thursday. 'Socialism's a kind word by comparison. The Democrats will lose because America will never be a socialist country.'
Trump's own policies, including a $28-billion bailout program for farmers struggling under the effect of his trade war, have led to charges of government intervention in the free market.
During the Iowa rally Thursday, Trump appeared to acknowledge the sensitive nature of the massive bailout, saying that he had to use his words carefully as he described it.
'I said to this group of farmers that came in, 'Subsidy.' I used the word subsidy,' he said. 'That was the worst word. 'Sir, we don't want subsidy! Please don't ever use that word. 'I said, 'I won't, I promise.'-'

The season of Democratic dread is here.
As the party alights in Nevada's Mojave Desert for Saturday's caucuses, the angst and unease of its faithful are tightly spring loaded. Voters are twitching with thoughts of dire unknowns and mulling the complicated realities facing their party.
Outside a Chinese restaurant, where former vice president Joe Biden "" once the 'inevitability candidate' "" struggles to be heard, his dwindling fans utter words that called to mind a hospital ward. 'Resuscitate.' 'Recover.' 'Pull through.' 'Survive.' 
In the horizonless, low-slung neighborhoods on the northeast side of town "" a place where Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has a base of support "" there are worries that former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, freshly unveiled in the top tier with his debut debate appearance Wednesday, could use his vast fortune to buy the election.
The dread among Democrats is unfolding here in full view of their political nemesis, President Trump, who trolled his would-be opponents this week by sleeping in splendor at the Las Vegas hotel that bears his name "" just up the street from the stage where Democrats debated "" and by scheduling a rally here for the afternoon before their caucuses. As if on cue, pigeons wearing miniature Make America Great Again hats have been fluttering around town, released from their coops, according to the Las Vegas Review Journal, by a shadowy Democratic-needling group that goes by the acronym P.U.T.I.N. "" Pigeons, United to Interfere Now.
Trump has mocked the Democrats for their bumbling rollout at the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3, when a glitchy vote-counting app snarled everything, including the results, the careers of some local politicos and the party's reputation. Fearful of a repeat, Nevada dumped the app company, which also had been poised to handle the caucuses here. Still, there has been a lingering queasiness among Nevada caucus volunteers.

On Tuesday night, the last day of an early-voting period that has drawn large crowds, there was no sign outside the caucus site at the Chinatown Mall, a few steps from the Harbor Palace Seafood Restaurant, where Biden was speaking. But inside the mall, with less than an hour to go before voting closed, a long line snaked past vendors selling Chinese lucky cats with perpetual-motion paws and a foot-massage video on a continuous loop.
'I'm worried, very worried,' says Linda Luebeck, a Vegas lounge singer and Biden fan who had found herself a seat to rest on the sidewalk.
On this warm evening, Luebeck is making a little breeze by waving a paper fan bearing a picture of Biden.
'He reminds me of my dad,' she says with a hint of wistfulness in her voice to the woman sitting beside her. Dad, it turns out, suffered from cancer a few years back in his early 80s.
'I just hope he recovers,' Luebeck says.
She's talking about the recovery of Biden now "" not her dad. Dad's already gone.
Luebeck does not find it ironic that she is wearing rose-colored glasses.
To her left, beneath a sign that says 'Dim sum daily,' another Biden supporter is handicapping outcomes.
'If Bernie gets it we're doomed,' says Theresa 'Cheech' Yanni, who owns a business that sells aromatherapy rice bags and doggy bandannas. 
She can't imagine an avowed democratic socialist winning a national presidential election.
On the other hand, 'if Bernie doesn't get it we're screwed,' she says, fretting that the Vermont senator's supporters won't vote for whomever defeats him.
Across town, voters queue up outside a union hall and dig each other deeper and deeper into a tangle of guidelines. A tall man in a baseball cap is certain that he can name just one candidate on his ballot "" which is essentially a list of ranked preferences "" and leave the second and third choices blank or uncommitted. A woman in a red union T-shirt thinks she can fill in the same candidate's name on each line of her ballot.
'I've heard people say you can do that,' Shannon Bilbray, a Las Vegas consultant, says with a shrug. 'But I don't know if you can do that.'



In a strip mall, half an hour from the riot of casinos that defines Las Vegas for outsiders, the kids are chanting and stomping their feet. Call and response.
'We have nothing to lose but our chains!'
'Our chains.'
'We have nothing to lose but our chains.'
These teenagers and a few early 20-somethings "" products of the Mexican and Central American diaspora whose families pray the Catholic rosary "" have found a hero in a white-haired, Brooklyn-born Jew from Vermont who is older than some of their grandparents. They gather each afternoon "" some of them children of deportees, others at risk of deportation themselves "" to get their canvassing assignments in the offices of Make the Road, an immigrant political mobilization group. The group has endorsed Sanders, who has been atop the polls here in Nevada, a state with a large Latino population that is the first barometer of that key demographic.
Before they leave to knock on doors, they tell their stories. The teenage girl whose single mom cleaned houses to make ends met. The teenage boy who once lived in a house with no walls in Mexico, but whose parents named him Kevin Justin "" an homage to the American boy-band stars Kevin Richardson and Justin Timberlake. 
To them, Sanders represents a kind of idealized future "" or at least the promise of something approaching it "" with his advocacy of humane immigration policies, free health care via Medicare-for-all, free schooling.
They look with wariness at their television screens, fat with paid political ads. They've heard neighbors and some of their peers opening their minds to Bloomberg and his bottomless pockets.
'They keep saying Bloomberg is going to beat Trump to death with his money,' says Ulises Romero, an 18-year-old electrical trade school student whose family is from Mexico.
But as he walks through streets lined by humble houses, some with cars on blocks in the driveways and barred windows, he doesn't have to do much to sell his candidate. Maria Beltran, an aproned woman who interrupts making a batch of tamales to answer the door, declares, 'Yo soy puro Bernie,'"" I'm pure Bernie.
Across the street they find another Sanders fan in Destiny Armendariz. She's got $9,000 in student loans and can only keep up with the interest payments on that debt. Sanders, she hopes, could make it all disappear.
Such hopes worry establishment Democrats who fear Sanders is unelectable in a general election.
'I for one am increasingly concerned that if Democrats go ahead and nominate Senator Sanders, we will be looking at four more years of the crazy Trump train on steroids,' says Jim Manley, a Democratic political strategist who served as communications director for former senator Harry M. Reid, an unparalleled Nevada kingmaker. 'Medicare-for-all is a political loser, as are several of his other grow-the-government ideas like the Green New Deal. Trump will have a field day with him, because no matter what some of his supporters say, we are not, and will never be, a socialist country.'
(Reid set the political world ablaze Thursday when he told The Washington Post that Sanders "" or any other candidate "" shouldn't be handed the nomination if he finishes first, but falls short of the required number of delegates.)
And so, a conundrum, a nagging question, rises for Nevada Democrats, the same facing Democrats across the nation: Who am I?
'Donald Trump burned the playbook, and this year the Democrats buried the ashes. There's no conventional wisdom anymore,' says Billy Vassiliadis, the legendary Las Vegas marketing guru whose firm developed the Las Vegas tourism slogan, 'What happens here, stays here.' 
Vassiliadis and his high-powered business friends are worried, he says, that Sanders not only can't be elected, but will bust the U.S. economy with expensive government programs.
'The party is in the process of figuring out if it is the party of AOC [Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez 0f New York], or Nancy Pelosi [the House speaker from California] or Barack Obama. Is it the party of Pete Buttigieg [the former South Bend, Ind., mayor and top-tier presidential candidate]?' Vassiliadis says, over lunch at his sprawling offices at the foot of Red Rock Canyon. 'I don't think we know.'




To get to the Democratic debate here, you had to wind through the smoky windowless clatter of the Bally's casino, where you might forget whether it was night or day. At the top of one set of escalators, a giant black X touts the 'Sexy, Topless Revues,' which come in various forms, including burlesque and 'Country Kick'n.'
Burlesque holds itself out as a front-runner, having been voted best in the city three years in a row, we're told.
The contest held down the hall was far less clear. The billionaire candidate on the Nevada caucus ballot (businessman Tom Steyer) was not on the debate stage; the billionaire who is not on the ballot (Bloomberg) was.
On the debate stage, the presence of Bloomberg, who is not participating in the early caucuses and primaries, was not welcome. The five other candidates greeted him in a manner reminiscent of children who don't want to make room in the sandbox for the new kid who has arrived on the shiniest, fanciest bicycle they've ever seen.
Right from the beginning, Sanders blasted him on stop-and-frisk, the law-enforcement policy from Bloomberg's time as mayor that has been criticized for targeting African Americans. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar accused Bloomberg of trying to bully her and the other two moderates onstage, Biden and Buttigieg, to drop out.
Buttigieg was fretful about Bloomberg and Sanders leaving them all in the dust: 'Most Americans don't see where they fit if they've got to choose between a socialist who thinks that capitalism is the root of all evil and a billionaire who thinks that money ought to be the root of all power.'
Bloomberg's halting, widely panned performance did little to quell the interest of the media horde in the spin room after the debate. They welcome him to the sandbox, jamming seven-deep to listen to Howard Wolfson, a top Bloomberg adviser, do damage control.
While Wolfson went on, two women with a Biden campaign sign stood alone on the red carpet of the spin room.
'Are you the Biden spinner?' a lanky journo asks one of them after nearly an hour had passed.
'Ohhhh, no. We're waiting. Waiting, waiting, waiting.'
When Biden's ever-polished spinmeisters finally arrives, the horde mostly wants to talk about Bloomberg and the rough treatment he got onstage.
Cedric L. Richmond, the Louisiana congressman and Biden spinner par excellence, pounced on that.
'I will say, 'Welcome to the party.' '

Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), on the strength of his performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, has surged nationally and now holds a sizable lead over all his rivals for the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.
Former vice president Joe Biden, who led Sanders in a Post-ABC national poll in January, has seen a sharp drop in his support after finishing fourth in the Iowa caucuses and fifth in the New Hampshire primary. Biden is now in a battle for second place with former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.).

Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, who won the state-delegate-count battle in the Iowa caucuses and came a close second to Sanders in New Hampshire, is in single digits nationally, roughly even with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), whose surprise third-place finish in New Hampshire further scrambled the Democratic contest.

The poll underscores how quickly support for candidates can change in national polls on the strength of results from individual primaries and caucuses. The findings came on the day of a Democratic debate in Las Vegas that was to include Bloomberg on the stage for the first time and represented a high-stakes gamble for all the candidates.
The poll also comes just days ahead of the third contest on the calendar, Saturday's Nevada caucuses, with the South Carolina primary to follow on Feb.-29. After South Carolina, the campaign goes national, with 14-states holding contests on March-3, Super Tuesday, and crucial primaries in a variety of big states later in the month. 
On the basis of the new national poll, Sanders appears well-positioned to accumulate delegates in those states and, possibly, emerge by the end of March with a delegate advantage over his rivals. He is aided in his bid to accumulate more delegates by the fractured support among the more moderate candidates in the field. All are jockeying to become the principal rival to the senator representing Vermont, who has a firm hold on the party's liberal wing.

The Post-ABC poll shows Sanders, who got more votes in Iowa than any other candidate ahead of his narrow win in New Hampshire, with the support of 32-percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning registered voters. That is an increase of nine percentage points since January. He holds double-digit leads among both women and men, as well as among those who say they are certain to vote in their state's primary or caucuses.
Biden, who was at 32-percent support in January, has fallen to 16-percent in the new survey. He faces significant hurdles as he attempts to mount a comeback, with his hopes pinned on success in Nevada and especially South Carolina, where he had long been the favorite of African American voters who make up a hefty majority of the Democratic electorate there.
Bloomberg, who is skipping the first four states but has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into television ads in states with primaries in March, stands at 14-percent, up from 8-percent in January. He has only recently begun to receive significant criticism from the other candidates, how ever.
Warren saw no change in her national support, remaining at 12-percent. Buttigieg, despite his strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, runs fifth nationally at 8-percent, ticking up from 5-percent a month ago. Klobuchar stands at 7-percent in the new national poll, up from 3-percent. Buttigieg and Klobuchar face a similar challenge, which is to appeal to a broader coalition of voters in the coming two early-state contests.
Biden's poor finishes in Iowa and New Hampshire appear to have robbed him of his image as the most electable against President Trump in November "" the chief attribute he has used to define his campaign. 
By a wide margin, 58-percent to 38-percent, Democrats say they would rather nominate a candidate who can defeat Trump than one who agrees with them on major issues. 
Electability is a subjective judgment, however, and the former vice president is paying the price for his failure to draw more significant backing from voters in the first two states. A month ago, 38-percent of Democratic-leaning adults cited Biden when asked which candidate has the best chance to defeat Trump, making him their top choice in that regard. Today that has dropped by half, to 19-percent. 
In the new poll, Sanders is seen as the most electable, cited by 30-percent of Democratic leaners as best situated to beat Trump. Bloomberg is cited by 18-percent on this question, with no other Democrat close to double digits.

In the past month, Biden has lost support among three key constituency groups: African Americans, older voters and whites without college degrees, previously the bulwarks of his campaign. In a Post-Ipsos poll this year, Biden was backed by 48-percent of African American voters. Today that has fallen to 31-percent. Compared with January's Post-ABC poll, his support has been cut nearly in half among voters over age 50 and stands at 20-percent; among non-college whites, support for Biden plummeted from 33-percent to 11-percent.
Sanders has seen a big jump in support among voters under 50 and is now backed by 50-percent of that group, up from 34-percent in January. He holds a 3-to-1 lead over his rivals among these voters. Sanders also has more than doubled his support among black voters and has gained among whites without college degrees.
Bloomberg's growth was fueled by more support among older voters and among white voters with college degrees. Buttigieg, Warren and Klobuchar saw no significant shifts in their coalitions.

Many establishment Democrats fear that Sanders, a democratic socialist, would be considered too far left to win a general election and that he could cost Democratic candidates for House or Senate their elections if he were at the top of the ticket.
Democrats nationally appear to be much less concerned about Sanders's ideological stances than voters in New Hampshire's Democratic primary last week. In a New Hampshire exit poll, 50-percent of Democratic primary voters said Sanders's positions on the issues were 'too liberal,' an opinion shared by only 17-percent of Democratic-leaning adults in the national Post-ABC poll.
In the Post-ABC poll, 62-percent of Democratic-leaning adults say Sanders is 'about right' ideologically, almost 20-points higher than the share who said the same in the New Hampshire exit poll. Comfort with Sanders's positions is roughly on par with Biden's (63-percent), Warren's (63-percent) and Buttigieg's (60-percent).
In a measure of how Democrats see Sanders as a candidate against Trump, 72-percent say they believe he would defeat the president. Among Democrats, 69-percent think Bloomberg would win against Trump, and 68-percent say that of Biden. Perceptions of Warren and Buttigieg as general-election candidates are also positive but not as strong as the others. Democrats are roughly split on whether Klobuchar or Trump would prevail in a hypothetical matchup.
If Sanders were to become the nominee, about half of all Americans say it makes no difference in their vote that he is a socialist, including about 7-in-10 Democrats. But nearly 4-in-10 adults say that fact makes them more likely to oppose him, including 37-percent of independents and 79-percent of Republicans. Just under 1-in-10 adults say it makes them more likely to support him. Views of Sanders's identification as a democratic socialist are slightly less negative.
The president's approval rating stands at 43-percent, with 53-percent disapproving, showing no real change in the past month. His approval on handling the economy remains net positive, with 52-percent saying they approve of the job he is doing and 40-percent disapproving. Last month, 56-percent gave him a positive rating.
Looking ahead to November, the poll tested six Democrats in hypothetical general-election matchups. Biden, Sanders and Bloomberg fare best, edging Trump by five to seven points, with Trump receiving 45-percent support against each. Buttigieg, Klobuchar and Warren are within the margin of error of Trump in these measures. Across all matchups, Trump is in a similar position as January, but better off than last October. 
The Post-ABC poll was conducted by telephone from Feb.-14-17 among a random national sample of 1,066 adults, 65-percent of whom were reached on cellphones and 35-percent on landlines. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5-percentage points; the error margin is four points among the sample of 913 registered voters and six points among the sample of 408 Democrats and Democratic-leaning registered voters.

LEAVING HIM IN PLACE A DIRE RISK, THEY SAY
Impeachment managers assail president's character
House prosecutors finished their opening arguments in President Trump's impeachment trial on Friday, arguing that his conduct toward Ukraine reflected a dangerous reflex toward political expediency and a lack of character that will backfire on Republicans if they do not help remove him from office.
Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) and his colleagues attempted to drive this argument home Friday to sway a handful of Republican senators whose position on gathering further evidence will determine the arc and scope of the trial. Yet there were few signs that any Republican was persuaded, leaving open the matter of possible witness testimony and further dampening Democrats' already meager hopes of a conviction in the GOP-controlled Senate. 
Schiff's pointed and increasingly personal approach was an attempt to go beyond the specifics of House Democrats' case to make the broader argument that Trump is an untrustworthy president who is likely to repeatedly flout the Constitution if allowed to stay in office.
'It goes to character,' Schiff said. 'You don't realize how important character is in the highest office in the land until you don't have it.' 
The Democrats' closing statements were their final appeal to senators before the next phase of the trial: an aggressive rebuttal from Trump's lawyers that will kick off Saturday and continue in earnest on Monday.
Speaking Friday on the Senate floor "" hours after new evidence emerged of Trump's campaign to oust the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine starting in 2018 "" Schiff predicted that Trump's future behavior would vindicate Democrats' claim that he abused his power, and he warned Republicans the president, now their ally, could ultimately turn on them.
'Do you think for a moment that any of you "" no matter what your relationship with this president, no matter how close you are to this president "" do you think for a moment that if he felt it was in his interest, he wouldn't ask you to be investigated?' he asked.
The remarks concluded the House managers' case for the first article of impeachment, which charges Trump with abuse of power over allegations he withheld military aid and an Oval Office meeting from Ukraine to pressure the country's leaders into announcing investigations into Trump's political rivals. These included former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, while his father was in office. The managers spent the rest of the day detailing their case for the second article of impeachment "" obstruction of Congress, following Trump's barring the executive branch from cooperating with the House investigation. 
The Senate will reconvene Saturday at 10 a.m. for several hours of what Trump's lawyer Jay Sekulow described as 'coming attractions' from his side "" a preview of the pro-Trump case before the full-scale presentation begins Monday. The timetable is aimed at garnering peak television viewership "" a priority for Trump as he faces the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history "" though Sekulow said that his side would not use its full 24-hour time allotment for defending Trump. 
'We're not going to try to run the clock out,' he said this week.
Democrats faced continued criticism from Republicans that their presentations were tedious and difficult to follow.
'I just thought yesterday was like, too much,' said Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), calling the remarks repetitive and 'mind-numbing.' 'This needs to end. They've had an opportunity to make their case.'
While many Republicans echoed the view that the trial has been repetitive, every member of the Senate GOP caucus has voted against hearing from new witnesses or collecting new evidence.
It was clear when the trial resumed at 1 p.m. Friday that Schiff heeded some of Republicans' complaints: rather than speaking for hours at a time, the managers presented in shorter spurts, rotating more often and punctuating their remarks with more video clips. 
After Trump's defense concludes, mostly likely on Monday, the trial will enter a question-and-answer phase that will last for up to 16 hours. This is expected to take place Tuesday and Wednesday, followed by a debate Thursday over whether to seek testimony from witnesses. Democrats are pushing for former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney to appear, while most Republicans have shot down the idea of hearing from witnesses. But they have said that if Democrats secure the votes to subpoena any of their choices, the GOP will push for Joe or Hunter Biden to appear.
Democrats need four Republicans to join them in any attempt to secure new testimony or evidence, and the senators being targeted have been careful to say that they have made no decision "" while giving no indication they are moving closer to supporting any subpoenas.
Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), one of the most closely watched Republican senators, said Friday that the House managers had 'presented us with a mountain of overwhelming evidence,' though it was unclear which way he was leaning on the question of hearing more. 
Alexander told reporters that he will make his decision on admitting witnesses and other new evidence only after the White House defense team makes its case.
'I think that question can only be answered then,' he said. 'We've been polite to the House managers, listened to them carefully, and now we're going to do the same with the president's lawyers. I think the House managers have done a good job of making their arguments. But that doesn't mean I will agree with them.'
Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) raised the prospect that a Senate trial could drag on for months if Trump administration witnesses are called, arguing that the issue of executive privilege would have to be litigated in the courts.
'This could tie up the Senate through the election and even beyond as the courts litigate these claims,' Cornyn said during an appearance on conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt's syndicated radio show. 'We'll wait and see, but right now, I'm not for extending this for months and months while claims of privilege and the like are litigated in the courts.'
The question of whether the Senate will seek more evidence was heightened Friday by a new Washington Post-ABC News poll revealing that a majority of American adults, 66 percent, support the Senate calling new witnesses to testify, as opposed to 27 percent who don't.
ABC News also reported Friday that it reviewed a recording of Trump at a private dinner telling associates that he wanted then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch gone, a reminder of the evidence yet to be uncovered about Trump's actions. 
'Get rid of her! Get her out tomorrow. I don't care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. Okay? Do it,' Trump is heard saying, according to ABC News.
Schiff challenged the Senate to call the administration's bluff on whether witnesses would be limited from testifying by executive privilege and let Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is presiding over the trial, make those calls.
Calling executive privilege 'the last refuge of the president's team to conceal the evidence from the American people,' Schiff argued that Roberts should 'decide issues of evidence and privilege' whenever witnesses or the president claim it, but that the assumption Trump will try to silence certain witnesses by claiming executive privilege should not keep the Senate from calling them to testify.
'The Senate will always have the opportunity to overrule the justice,' Schiff said to reporters, adding that 'you cannot use executive privilege to hide wrongdoing or criminality or impeachable misconduct, and that is exactly the purpose for which they seek to use-it.' 
After Roberts scolded both sides for overheated rhetoric late Tuesday night, Democrats took pains to tone down their accusations against Trump and his supporters in the Senate. 
Yet Schiff also sharpened his case on Friday, arguing that Republicans trust Trump at their own peril. 
He invoked the late senator John McCain (R-Ariz.) in arguing about the strategic importance of Ukraine as a U.S. ally and quoted him as saying, 'We are all Ukrainians.'
And he made a lengthy case that Trump's skepticism about the conclusions of U.S. intelligence services "" particularly about Russian interference in the 2016 election "" represents a 'coup' for Russia. 
'Has there ever been such a coup? I would submit to you that in the entire length of the Cold War, the Soviet Union had no such success. No such success,' Schiff said. 'I hope it was worth it. I hope it was worth it for the president. Because it certainly wasn't worth it for the United States.'
Trump's defenders are focused on Biden's push to oust former Ukraine prosecutor-general Viktor Shokin, who was overseeing a probe of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma and its owner at the same time that Biden's son was serving as a member of the company's board. 
Biden's actions were in line with official U.S. and European policy at the time "" a consensus that Shokin was involved in corrupt schemes and needed to be removed. 
Democrats detailed these facts on Thursday with the awareness that Trump's legal team was likely to focus on them during their defense of the president.
The president's aides and allies continued to portray the trial as a waste of time and one that is not capturing the public's attention. 
'As you've seen, the ratings keep going down every day in terms of viewers,' White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said on Fox News. 'I think that next week, we need to get this over with so we can get on with the business of the country.'
Schiff concluded his remarks Friday night with a different message as he urged senators to support hearing more evidence.
'I ask you. I implore you: Give America a fair trial,' he told senators. 'Give America a fair trial. She's worth it.'

President Trump on Friday endorsed a tweet comparing the top Senate Democrat to Iran, the United States' longtime adversary, suggesting neither could be trusted, as Democratic leaders criticized the White House for ordering a military strike to kill a powerful Iranian commander without congressional input.
Amid a flurry of reactions from U.S. lawmakers, Trump retweeted conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, who, in response to a headline about Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) not receiving advance notice of the military operation, wrote: 'Neither were the Iranians, and for pretty much the same reason.'
Trump made similar insinuations about Democrats' trustworthiness after the October raid that killed Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. At that time, Trump said he didn't tell House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), a former member of the Intelligence Committee, because 'he wanted to make sure this kept secret.'
Trump ordered the U.S. drone strike that killed Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani, whom the United States regarded as a war criminal responsible for hundreds of American deaths.
Republicans and Democrats were united in calling Soleimani an enemy of the United States and a terrorist.
'This morning, Iran's master terrorist is dead,' said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in remarks on the Senate floor. 'The architect and chief engineer for the world's most active state sponsor of terrorism has been removed from the battlefield at the hand of the United States military.'
Schumer called Soleimani a 'notorious terrorist,' and added: 'No one should shed a tear over his death.'
But as Republicans celebrated what they described as Trump's decisive action, Democrats criticized the president's order to act unilaterally while expressing grave concern that this action would move the United States closer to an in trac table war with Iran. 
'No matter how good it may feel that Qasem Soleimani is no longer alive, he likely will end up being more dangerous to the United States, our troops and our allies, as a martyr than as a living, breathing military adversary,' said Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.).
Trump, in brief remarks Friday afternoon about the attack, said he targeted Soleimani to 'stop a war,' not to start one.
Presidents typically inform the so-called Gang of Eight "" the House speaker and minority leader, the Senate majority and minority leaders, and the chairmen and ranking minority-party members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees "" about high-level military operations.
Top Democratic leaders in Congress received no advance notification of the strike, aides said. Pelosi spoke to Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper after the attack for about 13 minutes, said an aide who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly.
'I'm a member of the Gang of Eight, which is typically briefed in advance of operations of this level of significance. We were not,' Schumer said in remarks on the Senate floor, adding that the administration must be 'asked probing questions not from your inner and often insulated circle, but from others, particularly Congress, which forces an administration before it acts to answer very serious questions.'
It was unclear which congressional leaders were given advance notice of the strike. 
McConnell said only that he had spoken to the defense secretary and was arranging a classified briefing for all senators early next week, but he provided no details on when he first learned about the strike.
Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump ally, said Friday morning on Fox News that he was 'briefed about the potential operation when I was down in Florida' and appreciated 'being brought into the orbit.'
House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) posted a photo on Instagram of himself and Trump at the president's Mar-a-Lago estate late Thursday, though it was not clear whether he, too, was briefed ahead of time.
McCarthy praised the killing of Soleimani as a 'statement to those seeking to attack America.' Trump, McCarthy said, had responded appropriately to violence by Iranian-backed groups in Iraq, including an attempt to storm the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
'In a display of resolve and strength, we struck the leader of those attacking our sovereign U.S. territories,' he said. 
Most Democrats focused their ire on Trump's unilateral action that they said could propel America into another conflict in the Middle East, yet Rep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) directed a more personal blow at Trump. 
'The Occupant was JUST impeached for abuse of power for political gain - now he is leading us to the brink of war because he believes it will help his re-election. We are sick of endless wars. Congress has the sole authority to declare war and we must deescalate. #NoWarWithIran,' Pressley tweeted.
Many of Trump's possible Democratic opponents in the presidential election also offered stern rebukes of Trump's handling of foreign policy. 
Calling the strike against Soleimani an assassination, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted that the United States was 'on the brink of yet another war in the Middle East.' She added: 'We're here because a reckless president, his allies, and his administration have spent years pushing us here.'
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) called it a 'dangerous escalation,' and former vice president Joe Biden said in a statement that Trump 'just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox.'
In New Hampshire, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, who was an intelligence officer in Afghanistan, echoed many congressional Democrats who have wondered what the strategy is now. 'If we have learned nothing else from the Middle East, in the last 20 years, it's that taking out a bad guy is not a good idea unless you're ready for what comes next,' Buttigieg said. 
In Iowa, Sanders condemned Trump's action and emphasized his long record of opposing many U.S. military interventions abroad, including the 2003 invasion of Iraq. 
 'It gives me no pleasure to tell you at this moment we face a similar crossroads fraught with danger,' he said, adding that Trump's decision 'now puts us on the path to another war, potentially one that could be even worse than before.'

President Trump is preparing to push out a national security official who testified against him during the impeachment inquiry after he expressed deep anger on Thursday over the attempt to remove him from office because of his actions toward Ukraine.
Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman "" a National Security Council aide who testified during House Democrats' impeachment hearings "" will be informed in the coming days, likely on Friday, by administration officials that he is being reassigned to a position at the Defense Department, taking a key figure from the investigation out of the White House, according to two people familiar with the move who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss personnel decisions. 
Vindman had already informed senior officials at the NSC that he intended to take an early exit from his assignment and leave his post by the end of the month, according to people familiar with his decision, but Trump is eager to make a symbol of the Army officer soon after the Senate acquitted him of the impeachment charges approved by House Democrats.
Trump made clear on Thursday that he is ready to make his impeachment a key part of his reelection strategy and highlight his anger at Democratic leaders who led the charge to remove him from office, as well as Republicans who did not embrace the defense of his actions even though he was acquitted by the Senate on Wednesday.
At an event in the East Room of the White House, he called Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) a 'horrible person' and derided Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) as a flip-flopping Republican with 'no sign of principles' whose vote to convict Trump on abuse of power charges was born not out of principle but bitterness over his failed 2012 presidential bid.
And he kicked off the day at the National Prayer Breakfast by questioning the two lawmakers' claims about the role religion plays in their public lives.
'I don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong. Nor do I like people who say, 'I pray for you,' when they know that that's not so,' he told a room full of religious leaders.
Trump and his allies are considering doing more than just launching verbal fusillades at his perceived enemies over impeachment as the decision regarding Vindman shows. Some of the president's aides are discussing whether to remove or reassign several administration officials who testified during the impeachment inquiry, according to aides and advisers who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the plans. Meanwhile, Senate committee chairmen are ramping up their investigation into Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine while his father, Joe, was vice president.
'Lieutenant Colonel Col. Vindman and his twin brother "" right? "" we had some people that "" really amazing,' Trump said during an event at the White House, mocking the national security counsel aide who testified during hearings investigating the White House's actions toward Ukraine.
Trump has complained about Vindman in private, mocking the way he spoke, wore his uniform and conducted himself during the impeachment inquiry, according to people familiar with his remarks. He has discussed with aides removing other national security officials who testified or cooperated with House Democrats, with Trump calling them disloyal and asking whether he should further cull his national security staff after impeachment. He remains incensed that so many people in his administration testified last year, according to allies of the president. No final decisions have been made on what to do with the officials, these people said.
 But the White House is not hiding from the fact it would like to see Democrats and Romney to feel some pain for their role in his impeachment.
Stephanie Grisham, the president's press secretary, said making people pay for their conduct was a reason Trump held an event Thursday in the East Room of the White House, which Trump later said was not a speech but a 'celebration' of his acquittal by the Senate a day earlier.
Advisers to the president said Trump is already thinking about a scorched-earth nine-month campaign and how Democrats might attack him next "" and how he can land punches of his own.
'He's keenly aware of the fact that the Democrats only have one play: to destroy him personally every single day … until November,' said Jason Miller, an informal adviser and former campaign aide.
 Additionally, Trump sees it as valuable to frame previous investigations as witch hunts because he expects more probes, Miller and other Trump allies said, and the president has told his aides that Democrats will continue to investigate his finances, his Cabinet officials and his interactions with foreign leaders. 
Trump was not in a reflective mood about his conduct on Thursday.
He was impeached by the House on charges that he abused his office and obstructed Congress. The crux of the case against him is the allegation that he withheld military aid and a White House meeting to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden "" who served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, while his father was vice president "" as well as a widely discredited theory that Ukrainians interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Trump has denied any wrongdoing and "" despite some Republican senators calling his action wrong even if not impeachable "" he has shown no remorse.
That was evident from the time he left the White House on Thursday morning on his way to the prayer breakfast being held at a nearby hotel.
He rewrote parts of his speech for the event, scribbling en route, to highlight his impeachment and attack his foes at a traditionally staid, nonpartisan affair, according to officials. When Arthur Brooks, a conservative columnist, encouraged guests at the breakfast to 'love your enemies' and set aside contempt, Trump pointedly said that he did not concur.
'I don't know if I agree with you. I don't know if Arthur is going to like what I'm going to say,' he said, before attacking both Pelosi and Romney from the dais at the Washington Hilton. 
His event in the East Room later in the day was part celebration, part tirade as he thanked his supporters and laid into his critics.
'They are vicious and mean, vicious. These people are vicious,' he said of Democrats before focusing specifically on Pelosi and House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who led the impeachment inquiry.
He brought up Hunter Biden, criticizing his role in Ukraine and mocking him for being discharged from the Navy Reserve after allegedly testing positive for cocaine.
Trump plans to repeatedly bring up the younger Biden on the campaign trail, according to White House officials, hoping to use it against Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, and to argue that Democrats are corrupt. Neither Biden has been charged with any wrongdoing by Ukrainian officials.
Trump has continued to suggest to aides that his personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, could have valuable information and that Hunter Biden resonates with the general public.
He may get help on this topic from Senate Republicans.
In a letter sent Wednesday to the head of the Secret Service, two Senate committee chairmen wrote that they are 'reviewing potential conflicts of interest posed by the business activities of Hunter Biden and his associates during the Obama administration, particularly with respect to his business activities in Ukraine and China.'
Sens. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa) and Ron Johnson (Wis.) said they are seeking information on any instances when Hunter Biden traveled with a protective security detail during the time his father was vice president, as well as when he flew on government planes.
Trump has been convinced by polling and rallies in recent months that relentlessly attacking Pelosi is key to his reelection success, and he has shown flashes of anger when discussing her, according to aides. 
Republican lawmakers and Trump have also discussed ways to exact revenge on Schiff for his leading role in the president's impeachment, according to people familiar with the conversations.
Some White House, campaign and congressional officials are pushing Trump to move on from talking about impeachment or attacking Romney, the lone Republican to vote for his conviction. RNC and campaign officials said they were happy Thursday that Trump did not seem to have a specific plan to take on Romney, even as the White House lashed into him in a long page of talking points. 
'There's a lot of anger there. But I think this, too, shall pass,' said Rep. Chris Stewart (R-Utah), a Trump ally. 

Trump's allies said he is in his strongest political position in years. His poll numbers rose during impeachment, with Gallup showing him at 49 percent approval, and the economy is performing well overall. Voters have not yet coalesced around a candidate in the splintered Democratic presidential field. And with the impeachment probe and the Russia investigation over, no investigative threat currently appears to loom over the president.

Aides said the mood in the West Wing is brighter than it has been in many months. 

'Look at the successes we've had. Contrast that to the Democrats,' House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said.

A growing number of Republicans are working to fix the party's most fundamental electoral problem, its rapidly diminishing support in suburbs that once were GOP strongholds. 
The talks and proposals are happening outside the bounds of formal leadership circles and beyond the Republican National Committee, entities that, for now, are heavily focused on President Trump's short-term interest of winning reelection with his continued style of pugilistic insults that alienates many suburban voters. 
Inside the Capitol, more than 40 House Republicans have rebooted the Suburban Caucus, a group that is focusing on building out policy proposals that resonate with higher-income, college-educated voters who have broken sharply from the GOP in the Trump era. 
That the caucus went dormant for almost a decade is the perfect metaphor for Republican struggles in localities outside Philadelphia, Atlanta, Phoenix and Denver. 
Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.), who narrowly survived a tough race in the St. Louis suburbs, woke up the morning after the 2018 midterm elections with a sense of fear and fury. ""We've lost the majority, and I'm looking at so many of my friends that lost seats in majority-suburban districts,"" Wagner said, recognizing that Democrats won a huge chunk of their 40-seat gain by defeating her GOP allies. 
""We cannot be the majority party if we are going to be a party that appeals only to rural America,"" she said. Within a few months, she relaunched the GOP's Suburban Caucus. 
On Monday, Wagner and other members of her caucus will be onstage at a summit arranged by N2 America, a new nonprofit started by a trio of female Republican strategists who are trying to work on both policy proposals and communications strategy for rehabilitating the GOP brand in the suburbs. 
One key factor, according to the lawmakers and strategists, is that Republicans are hemorrhaging suburban votes because of Trump's tone, which has been adopted by a growing number of rank-and-file GOP lawmakers in the Capitol. These suburban voters are often tuning out good economic news in their region because the political news is dominated by put-downs and counterpunches. 
""Suburban voters are discerning and sophisticated. We've just got to get the personalities out of it and focus on policy,"" said Liesl Hickey, a former executive director for the National Republican Congressional Committee who served as chief of staff to former congressman Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), who founded the Suburban Caucus 15 years ago.
The group's board is a collection of top strategists for the past 15 years from the Bush administration, the Republican Governors Association, congressional leadership and unsuccessful presidential candidates such as Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.).
The degree of difficulty keeps getting more pronounced with each election held in one of these former bastions of Rockefeller Republicans. Twelve years ago, in the Democratic presidential primary, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton's epic clash drove up record turnout in many places, including propelling 1 million voters to Virginia's primary. 
On Tuesday, in a race that previously seemed to lack energy among the top Democrats, more than 1.3 million voters turned out, delivering a blowout victory for former vice president Joe Biden. 
The Virginia suburbs told the story. In Fairfax County, Democratic turnout jumped from about 161,000 voters in 2008 to roughly 245,000 in 2020. Neighboring Loudon County, once more of a conservative exurb, saw an even sharper tilt, with its Democratic turnout more than doubling from 35,000 voters 12 years ago to almost 72,000 on Tuesday.
That followed a pair of devastating elections for Republicans at the state and local level in 2017 and 2019, turning Virginia from the quintessential swing state into a commonwealth with Democrats holding every statewide office and majorities in the state legislature as well as a majority in its congressional delegation. 
Republicans who have survived these suburban waves are trying to preach a new religion to a party that has drifted further to the right. ""I worked my butt off,"" said state Sen. Siobhan S. Dunnavant (R), who won reelection by less than 1,400 votes in her suburban Richmond district last fall. 
Dunnavant, who will be on hand at Monday's suburban summit, said every Republican in these regions needs to work on ""practical things"" that relate to these neighborhoods and communities in ways that cut through the permanent echo chamber of national news. In her first term, she worked on laws to make it easier for community college credits to transfer to four-year colleges, workforce training and battling the opioid epidemic. 
She found a ""voter fatigue"" throughout her suburban district in the national news of Trump clashing with congressional Democrats. So, Dunnavant said, ""I brought the conversation back to what I was doing.""
Suburban Republicans will try to make the self-described democratic socialist policies of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) part of their 2020 strategy, even if Biden continues his surge to the Democratic nomination, arguing the race will pull the former vice president in Sanders's direction. 
""These socialist policies that Bernie Sanders and others have gotten on board with do not resonate in a suburban district like mine,"" Wagner said. 
Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Tex.), whose district does a 270-degree turn around Houston, won with less than 53 percent in 2018 but said he appeals to suburban voters with pitches that find middle ground, particularly on climate change. 
""They want to care about the environment but they want to do it in a smart way,"" Crenshaw said. ""They want solutions that are based on science and engineering, not fantasy,"" Crenshaw said. 
Rep. French Hill (R-Ark.), who helped relaunch the Suburban Caucus with Wagner, said he is focusing on legislation designed to improve ""financial literacy"" for parents and students taking out loans for higher education, as well as tax incentives for employers to pay off those loans when they hire college graduates. 
Wagner said her caucus was working on a next round of policy proposals that would serve as ""niche issues"" that, assuming the Democratic majority does not take them up in the House, GOP candidates could use as a menu of options in the fall elections. 
""It's kind of like our 'Contract with Suburbia,' "" she said, a play on the GOP's ""Contract with America"" that propelled Republicans to the House majority in 1994. 
If they can find these issues that resonate in the suburbs, Republicans argue that they can overcome the Trump bombast at the top of the ticket in down-ballot races, avoiding the din of the 2018 election when presidential behavior, not the growing economy, seemed to overwhelm the suburbs. 
""Certainly his tone and style were issues,"" Hill said. ""As we go into 2020, I think we need to talk about the results of the Trump administration.""

Democratic candidates delve into conflict abroad, gender and health care in last faceoff before caucuses

DES MOINES "" A whittled-down field of Democratic presidential candidates on Tuesday focused on their shared disdain for President Trump and elaborated on a host of policy differences domestic and foreign in an Iowa presidential debate whose most animated moment turned on whether a woman could become president.
With the Democratic voting beginning in less than three weeks "" and knotted among a quartet of leading contenders "" the candidates differed over the suddenly topical decision of whether to commit troops abroad or remove them from the Middle East, their disparate views on trade deals and their starkly different proposals to remake the country's health-care industry.
Coming on the heels of President Trump's decision to kill Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, the debate opened up with a relitigation of the war in Iraq, and a renewed discussion over how and whether the candidates would commit troops in the Middle East. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) committed to bringing combat troops home, while former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg pointed to his own experience in the military. Former vice president Joe Biden cast his experience in that office as invaluable, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) suggested Biden's vote in favor of the Iraq War was disqualifying.
'Joe and I listened to what Dick Cheney and George Bush and [Donald] Rumsfeld had to say,' Sanders said, speaking of the debate after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to give Bush authority to strike overseas. 'I thought they were lying. I didn't believe them for a moment. I took to the floor. I did everything I-could to prevent that war. Joe saw it differently.'
Biden, while focusing on the work he did during the Obama administration to wind down U.S. military involvement in Iraq, did not defend the vote. 
'It was a mistake to trust that they weren't going to go to war,' Biden said about the Bush administration's assurances in 2002. 'They said they were not going to go to war.'

The candidates agreed on the need to reduce the U.S. military footprint in Iraq and Afghanistan, though they differed slightly on timetables and other details. 
'No one has a solution and an endpoint. We need to get our combat troops out,' Warren said. 'They are not helping.' 
Biden and others struck a more nuanced note, arguing that Special Operations forces should remain in the region to guard against a resurgence of the Islamic State and to protect U.S. interests.
The former vice president also said he would not meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, with whom Trump met to-much-orchestrated drama but-with whom he has been unable to strike a deal on nuclear weapons. 
'No. Not now. I wouldn't meet with him without preconditions,' he said, blaming Trump for giving the North Korean legitimacy by meeting with him. 
He also noted that the leader had called him 'a rabid dog who should be beaten to death with a stick.'
'Other than that, you like him,' Sanders joked.
Gender politics, which subsumed the campaign in recent days, provided one of the sharpest exchanges of the night as Warren and Sanders clashed over whether Sanders said in a private 2018 meeting that a woman could not be elected against Trump in 2020.
Sanders denied the claim outright. 'Does anybody in their right mind believe that a woman can't be president?' Sanders said. 'I don't think anybody believes that.'
But Warren, as part of an apparent pivot to embrace her role as the highest-polling woman in the race, stuck to the claim she first made the day before the debate. 
'I disagreed,' she said of her conversation with Sanders in 2018. 'Bernie is my friend, and I am not here to try to fight with Bernie. But look, this question about whether or not a woman can be president has been raised and it's time for us to attack it head-on.'
She went on to divide the stage by gender, saying that she and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) were the only two candidates to have won all of their elections, while the men onstage had collectively lost 10 races. 
Klobuchar laughingly agreed, and later noted that she had an unbroken record of winning in areas similar to those in which Trump had defeated Hillary Clinton.
As the debate ended, Warren could be seen approaching Sanders but declining his offer of a handshake. They both appeared to be testy, Warren wringing her hands and Sanders making frequent gestures. 
The extended confrontation was remarkable, coming four years after the party selected Clinton as its first female nominee. Her loss to President Trump amid what many felt were misogynistic attacks helped energize women who came out for massive marches the day after he was inaugurated, helped fuel the election of record numbers of women to Congress and handed the House speaker's gavel back to Nancy Pelosi.
But Democratic anxiety over Trump, and whether he could defeat another woman, has been one of the looming questions over the primary contest for the-past year, asked everywhere from top party leaders to Democrats attending rallies in early states. 
Biden chimed into the discussion to argue that he alone had the longevity and the experience to knit together a coalition of the whole party. 
'I agree women can win,' Biden said, touting the number of female candidates he helped in 2018 and calling it 'the best group I've ever campaigned for in terms of competence.'
'But the real issue is who can bring the whole party together, represents all elements of the party,' he said. 'I would argue that in terms of endorsements around the country, endorsements, wherever we go, I am the one who has the broadest coalition of anyone running up here in this race.'
The debate came just 20 days before the Iowa caucuses, the results of which are likely to be pivotal in the 2020 nomination fight. 
The major Democratic candidates have gone all-in on the state, and with polls showing a multicandidate tie, with about 1-in 5 voters favoring Biden, Sanders and Buttigieg. Warren is close on their heels with 16-percent support, according to an average of two Iowa polls over the past week. 
The two other candidates on the stage, Klobuchar and the billionaire activist Tom Steyer, have been ranking in the single digits, well below the 15 percent threshold required by party rules-to acquire convention delegates. 
Steyer, who has gained ground in several new polls after a barrage of television ads, made one of his most aggressive arguments around the need to combat climate change. 
'We're going to come to the rescue of Americans who are in-trouble. But this is why climate is my number one priority,' he said. 'And I'm still shocked that I'm the only person on this stage who will say this: I would declare a state of emergency on day one.'
For several of the candidates onstage, the debate marked the final highlighted moment before the Senate impeachment trial diverts the nation's attention and demands their presence in Washington. While Warren, Sanders and Klobuchar will have to serve as jurors, Biden too 
could be roped into the proceedings; some Senate Republicans are seeking to force his son Hunter to testify about his activities in Ukraine when his father was vice president.
Biden said Tuesday night that he had no concern about his family being dragged into the Senate trial. There has been no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of either Biden, but it has been a topic the campaign has generally tried to avoid.
'It doesn't really matter whether he goes after me,' Biden said. 'I have got to be able not-only to fight but also to heal, and as president of the United States that's what I will attempt to do.'
Some of the debate reprised earlier such gatherings. For the seventh straight faceoff, the candidates cast different visions on health care, with Sanders continuing to push for Medicare-for-all, which would abolish the private health-care industry. 
'Again, I think it is much better to build on the Affordable Care Act,' Klobuchar said. 'And if you want to be practical and progressive at the same time and have a plan and not a pipe dream, you have to show how are you going to pay for it.'
Several of the candidates tried to address some of their shortcomings. 
Buttigieg responded to concerns in the party, shown in a recent Washington Post poll, that black voters do not support his campaign, even after they learn more about him.
'The black voters who know me best are supporting me,' Buttigieg said, before listing off several recent endorsements. 'The biggest mistake we can make is to take black votes for granted. And I never will.'
In the opening minutes of the debate, Sanders also tried to address the concerns that he is too divisive and wouldn't have enough appeal to a general electorate. 

'I am able to work with Republicans,' he said, citing unsuccessful legislation he co-sponsored with Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah). 'I am able to bring people together to try to create a world where we solve conflicts over the negotiating table, not through military efforts.'

Elizabeth Warren's biggest applause line at Tuesday night's Democratic debate had all the road-tested messaging appeal of a pink-pussyhatted women's march. Gesturing to the male candidates on the stage, she whipped out some math: 'Collectively [the men] have lost 10 elections. The only people who have won every election . . . are the women!' 
The audience ate it up. The future is female! Nasty women! Nevertheless she persisted, and so did Amy Klobuchar!

Surely the moment was planned. Memorizing each of your opponents' loss records could be read as petty, but it got the job done. It dispensed with the sexism question the way we like to see the sexism question dispensed with onstage: breezily, and with a girl-power flourish.
Many female candidates have a go-to line, something capable and Annie Oakleyish that they can pull out for such an occasion; Klobuchar likes to say that of course a woman can beat Donald Trump, 'Nancy Pelosi does it every day.' What else are the candidates supposed to do? In debate after debate, moderators wedge sexism somewhere between Medicare-for-all and the Iran nuclear deal, then set their timers. I
n 45 seconds or less: Is America ready for a female president?
As if that question could be answered in 45 seconds, or 75 seconds. As if we haven't been trying to answer it for years.
The hook this time around was a Rashomon-like conversation that took place between Warren and Bernie Sanders more than a year ago as both were considering White House runs, and which CNN had revealed on Monday. Warren says Sanders told her that a woman couldn't win in 2020, and 'I disagreed.'
In the debate, Sanders denied he'd ever said such a thing, highlighting his track record for supporting female politicians, including Warren herself. Earlier that day, his campaign had outlined his version of the conversation in a statement: 'What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could.' 
Pundits had 


teed this up as a conflict, as if one of the candidates were lying. In 45 seconds or less: how quickly can
 you throw your longtime friend and colleague under the bus?

It's entirely possible that both of them were telling the truth, though. It's possible Sanders believed he was merely warning Warren that the race would be even harder for her, and it's possible Warren believed he was saying something more forceful: that President Trump's skill with weaponizing misogyny made Sanders doubt a female candidate's viability.
It's possible we still prefer our discussions of sexism in politics to be peppy, upbeat one-liners, because the alternative is for them to be messy rehashings of 'whether a woman can be president.' That question isn't ever about the woman but about her potential voters and the moral fantasies we spin about ourselves.

Presumably, whatever Bernie Sanders said or didn't say, he wasn't trying to imply that a woman wasn't good enough to win "" which would be a judgment about women "" but rather that any woman running for president would face a country that wasn't good enough to vote for her. Which is a judgment about society.
In that case, Sanders wasn't saying anything that worried Democrats, including many women, haven't said for months "" the 'electability' argument via which hordes of voters apparently plan to vote for Joe Biden not because they like Joe Biden but because they think their neighbors do. That argument says: I'm not sexist, but in order to defeat Donald Trump, we have to live in the real world, which is.
That argument is reasonable, sort of. If your primary goal is putting out a fire, then your instinct is to hand the hose to the firefighter wearing the most flame-retardant gear. In this case: the candidate protected by his age, sexual orientation and XY chromosomes. That argument is also utterly exhausting. Because it's also saying: I'm not sexist, but my position is that we should capitulate to the sexists by nominating only male candidates until the problem miraculously fixes itself. I'm not sexist, but rather than trying to make the world better, I think we should meet the world where it is, which is to say, in hell.
When is someone acknowledging sexism, and when is someone just being sexist?
That's actually the conversation that should have happened on the debate stage. 
Not Elizabeth Warren firing up a women-take-care-of-business sound bite, but Elizabeth Warren admitting that, yeah, it's actually heartbreaking to have even your good friends tell you that the country won't believe in you enough to vote for you. Yeah, you worry that if you lose, people are going to say it's because you're a woman, and the loss will unfairly impact female candidates for years to come.
Not Bernie Sanders denying that he'd ever even thought such a thing but Bernie Sanders admitting that of course he'd thought such a thing, just like many voters had. He worried that the country would eviscerate a female candidate, as had happened many times before, and he was trying to balance that fear against his very real desire for gender equality in politics.
Not two candidates trying to convince the country that it isn't sexist "" Look at how many times you've voted for ladies! "" but two candidates talking frankly about sexism and our fears surrounding it. 
That's what America needs if it's going to stop enacting the same hackneyed psychodrama over and over. Something like: The only sexism we have to fear is the fear of sexism itself.
Which might be too clunky to work as a rah-rah T-shirt slogan, but it does fit into 45 seconds.

Former vice president Joe Biden is far and away the favored candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination among black Americans, boosted by his personal popularity, his service in the Obama administration and perceptions that he is best equipped to defeat President Trump, according to a national Washington Post-Ipsos poll.
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) occupies second place in the Democratic field among African American voters, easily outdistancing the remaining candidates in the race. Sanders is leading among black voters under age-35, replicating his success with-younger white voters in other national polls. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) runs third.
The survey finds meager support for former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, who is among the leaders in polls in the predominantly white states of Iowa and New Hampshire but stands at 2-percent among Democratic black voters nationally. A lack of familiarity with him and concerns about his experience and sexual orientation appear to be contributing to his current standing. Buttigieg has said that as African Americans get to know him, he will gain more support, but the poll undercuts that assertion. He receives only 3-percent support among black voters who are familiar with him.

The results, highlighting the views of a group that historically has played a significant role in determining the outcome of the Democratic nominating contest, help to explain the enduring strength of Biden's candidacy. Despite questions about his age, his past positions on forced school busing and his relationships with Southern segregationist senators, the poll shows that 48-percent of black Democrats favor him for the nomination "" a 28-point advantage over Sanders.
Biden 'is the candidate that can try to get this country back on track, because we are way out of control,' said Eula Woodberry, a retired school district budget analyst in Dallas, where she still lives. 'He's levelheaded. I think he's experienced, and I think he will look at the big picture. . . . He's the type of person who can serve as the nucleus to bring people back together.'
Edward Phillips, 52, a former legal assistant who lives in New York City, called Biden a 'known face,' adding, 'You know he was vice president under [President Barack] Obama. You know his experience. I trust him. I believe him. I think he's the only person among the Democrats who can defeat Trump.'

The survey, conducted by The Post and the nonpartisan research firm Ipsos, is one of the most extensive studies to date of views on the 2020 campaign among black voters, who, like other minority groups, are often represented by only small samples in customary national polls. It was conducted among 1,088 non-Hispanic black adults, including 900 registered voters, drawn from a large online survey panel recruited through random sampling of U.S. households.
More than 8 in 10 African American adults say the outcome of the 2020 election is important to them, and 79-percent say it is important to them personally that Trump not win a second term, with 66-percent saying that is 'extremely' important to them.
Trump performs poorly among black voters when matched against any potential Democratic nominee. He wins just 4-or 5-percent of black voters when tested against eight Democratic candidates individually. But there is a 25-point variation in the levels of support for individual Democrats in these hypothetical contests against the president, an early measure of which candidates could more easily consolidate black support and who might struggle to turn out black voters in November.
In the competition for the Democratic nomination, Sanders is at 20-percent among black Democrats, followed by Warren at 9-percent. Buttigieg's 2-percent support ties him with wealthy businessman Tom Steyer but slightly behind Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg at 4-percent each and the entrepreneur Andrew Yang at 3-percent.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who is looking for a breakthrough in Iowa, receives less than 1-percent support among black voters, as does former Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, the other African American candidate tested along with Booker.
When second choices are combined with first choices, Biden stands at 64-percent, Sanders at 42-percent, Warren at 28-percent and Booker at 12-percent. No other candidate rises to double digits in the combined first- and second-choice rankings of African American voters.
The Post-Ipsos survey's large sample size illuminates the contours of Biden's support among different subsets of the black electorate.
Age is the sharpest dividing line among black Democratic voters. Though Biden leads his rivals by more than 2 to 1 overall, he trails Sanders by 42-percent to 30-percent among black Democrats ages 18 to 34.
Sanders's support falls to 16-percent among black Democrats ages 35 to 49, far lower than Biden's 41-percent support in this group. Biden's support strengthens among older Democrats, rising to 68-percent among those 65 and older.

While Democrats boasted the most racially diverse field of candidates in history at the start of the presidential campaign, all six of the candidates who have gained enough support in polls and campaign donations to qualify for the next candidate debate, set for Tuesday in Iowa, are white. If a white candidate wins the nomination, 27-percent of black Democrats say it is 'very' or 'fairly' important that the person choose a vice-presidential running mate who is black, while 35-percent say this is 'not so important' and 38-percent say it is 'not at all important.'
But Caroline Bivins, a teacher in her 40s in the Atlanta area, said a ticket that includes a black candidate would motivate African Americans. 'Let's just say Elizabeth Warren chooses [Georgia's] Stacey Abrams, I think more blacks would go to the polls,' she said.
The survey offers insights into the ideological diversity of the black community, which has long been a core element of the Democratic base but is far from uniformly liberal in a party that has shifted leftward in recent years.
Six in 10 black Democratic voters identify as moderate or conservative, and Biden gets 58-percent support among this group, compared with 14-percent for Sanders and 8-percent for Warren.
Biden is favored by 53-percent of black Democratic voters in the South, a region where the concentration of African Americans helped both Obama and Hillary Clinton amass delegates in their successful nomination campaigns and could do the same for Biden if his support holds.
A majority of Democratic-leaning blacks (57-percent) say the most important thing they are looking for in a Democratic nominee is a likelihood of beating Trump. One-third say they want someone closest to them on issues, and 9-percent say they are looking for the candidate who has the strongest personal character. Biden leads on all of those.

On the question of which Democrat has the best chance to defeat Trump in November, Biden is cited by 53-percent of African American Democrats, compared with 18-percent who name Sanders. All the other candidates are in single digits. Biden has a large lead as well on the question of which Democrat would unite the country, cited by 43-percent of black Democrats compared with 19-percent for Sanders. The other candidates are in single digits.
Lawrence Taylor, 76, a retired educator and coach in Belleville, Ill., agreed with the view that Biden is best equipped to defeat Trump. Taylor said he thinks highly of many of the Democrats who entered the race, including the two most prominent African Americans, Booker and Sen. Kamala D. Harris (Calif.), who dropped out last month.
But he doesn't think the same country that elected Trump would elect a black president four years later, if his personal experience is any indication. 'I've lost some friends over things that they've posted on Facebook that seem just outright racist to me,' he said. 'I also have some people that I've gone to church with for 25-years that, behind the voter curtain, I think whiteness checks the boxes.'
Della Anderson, a retiree who lives in West Point, Tex., also supports Biden. 'I think he's my choice for every subject,' she said. 'Health care, everything. I would go with him. I have confidence in him. He's a seasoned politician, he's fair, I just have confidence in him. I would support him because he has been vice president and I feel like he knows the ropes. He's very diplomatic, I feel like he's the guy, he's the man.'

Many younger African Americans, however, are drawn to Sanders rather than to Biden. Terrel Askew, 33, a community organizer in Baltimore, said that in 2016, he believed Sanders was the candidate with the best policies but felt then that the Democratic Party wasn't ready for someone like Sanders. Today, Sanders is his preferred choice.
'I prefer his track record, particularly around housing, which is a major issue,' Askew said. 'And the conversations that he's had around debt, student debt and things like that. And addressing the economic disparities between the poor and wealthy individuals in our country.'
He sees problems that weren't addressed aggressively enough by Obama and wonders whether Biden would be more of a status quo candidate, rather than someone who would take on conditions in the country that he thinks contributed to Trump's victory four years ago.
Asked whether he would definitely vote no matter whom the Democrats nominate, Askew cited Buttigieg as one that would give him pause. 'From what I've seen of him, I get a feeling of ivory tower politics, a person telling impacted people, like poor people, what's good for them,' he said.
New Yorker Edward Phillips also raised doubts about Buttigieg. 'I'm a gay man, but I'm not a supporter of Mayor Pete,' he said. 'I don't think he's ready yet. I prefer we elect a woman before we elect a gay man to the presidency. It's just time we open up our horizons.'

Asked about supporting a gay man for president, 62-percent of black Democrats say they would be comfortable or enthusiastic doing so, while 36-percent say they have some reservations or would be very uncomfortable. Buttigieg receives 3-percent support among those who are at least comfortable and no support among those who say they are not.
And in general-election matchups against Trump, Buttigieg is getting 57-percent support to Trump's 4-percent, with the rest saying they would support another candidate, wouldn't vote or have no opinion. By contrast, Warren receives 71-percent support in a matchup with Trump, Sanders wins 74-percent, and Biden fares best with 82-percent support.
Brandon Gray, 38, who lives in St. Louis, backs Warren. 'She seems to be speaking more to the things I think are most important, like wage inequality. I kind of feel like she's been in politics long enough that she can get things done. She has the clout and is progressive enough without being outlandish. . . . When Elizabeth Warren is questioned on any of her promises or policies, she actually sounds like she has a plan or a road map more than Sanders.'

Biden leads on other attributes beyond who is best able to defeat Trump, but by smaller margins. Nearly one-third (32-percent) say he would best handle issues important to black Americans, compared with 19-percent for Sanders and 14-percent for Booker.
One-third also say Biden has the strongest personal character, followed by Sanders at 20-percent and Warren at 10-percent.
Biden's service as vice president under the country's first black president also gives him entree to many black voters. Fifty-six percent of African American Democrats say that fact makes them more likely to support him for the 2020 nomination, and 61-percent say the next president should generally continue Obama's policies.

The Post-Ipsos poll finds black Americans are highly interested in the 2020 election, with 83-percent saying the outcome matters to them a great deal or a good amount, and 71-percent of voting-age adults saying they are 'absolutely certain to vote.'
But certainty about voting dips to 61-percent among black adults with a high school diploma or less formal education, 57-percent among those with household incomes under $35,000 and 57-percent among those under age 35. All three groups typically turn out at lower rates, regardless of race or ethnicity.
Many respondents said they would be voting in November no matter what. For many, even if they weren't spurred on by a particular candidate, they were motivated by general antipathy toward Trump.
'I'll be voting in [the primary] and November. . . . I would never stay home,' said Steven Mellerson, 35, a sergeant with the New York Police Department.
Gray said he worries that some of the Democratic candidates do not have 'the clout or experience to be taken seriously' in a race against Trump. Still, he said he will vote in November for whoever emerges as the Democratic nominee.
'Either way it goes, whatever opponent is going up against Trump is who I'm going to vote for,' he said. 'I want somebody I believe in, but I also want somebody who will get that idiot out of office.'
The Post-Ipsos survey was conducted Jan. 2-8, 2020. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5-percentage points. The error margin is plus or minus four points among the sample of 769 Democratic-leaning registered voters.

Each side in the trial sees his House testimony as vital to its case 

Brussels "" As his name surfaced again and again this week during the start of the impeachment trial of President Trump, Gordon Sondland carried on here, almost 4,000 miles away, as if nothing unusual was underway.
Trump's ambassador to the European Union held meetings with the E.U. official in charge of emergency management. He hosted the Korean ambassador at the U.S. mission. And, he sat with the E.U.'s Brexit negotiator. Sondland had hoped that by staying quiet and going about his business that he could stay 'out of the spotlight' of the impeachment drama unfolding at the U.S. Capitol, according to a close associate. 
But that spotlight was unavoidable as the colorful character at the center of the House impeachment probe reemerged this week as one of the most important figures in the Senate trial to determine whether Trump will remain in office. The House Democrats prosecuting the case and the White House lawyers defending the president have cast Sondland as their side's 'critical witness.' Together, the two have invoked Sondland's name more than 200 times since Monday in legal briefs and statements on the Senate floor.
House Democrats "" who are still unable to question officials in the president's inner circle, such as former national security adviser John Bolton "" remain dependent on Sondland's November testimony to establish Trump's motive and intent when he withheld aid and a coveted White House invitation last year from Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's new president.
Sondland, a business executive who gave $1 million to Trump's inaugural committee and liked to tout his relationship with the president, testified before the House that Trump had conditioned a White House meeting on Zelensky's announcing investigations, including one that could have been used to damage 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden. 'Was there a quid pro quo?' Sondland testified. 'The answer is yes.'
On the question of withholding aid, Sondland testified that he had come to believe that the administration was also tying almost $400-million of security assistance for Ukraine to the sought-after investigations. It added up, Sondland said, like 'two plus two equals four.'
But the president's legal team has pointed to Sondland's testimony as evidence of the opposite of what House Democrats contend, arguing that he also told lawmakers that Trump denied that he wanted any 'quid pro quo' with regard to Ukraine.
'House Democrats' critical witness "" Sondland "" actually destroys their case,' Trump's lawyers wrote in a brief filed Monday.
Trump's team isn't planning to end its case there concerning Sondland, according to a senior White House official. Trump's attorneys are also preparing to impugn his credibility as the trial unfolds, saying his testimony before the House showed Sondland has a tendency to portray his uninformed opinions and presumptions as fact, which in the case of Ukraine became an echo chamber.
'So many roads come into and out of Sondland,' said the official, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the ambassador's role in the trial. 'Any fair-minded observer, if you looked at what the House developed in its proceedings, so much of what was claimed turned out to be Sondland had said, or insinuated, or believed, or surmised, that had been picked up and passed around by others.'
Against the spectacle of the president's legal team undermining a sitting U.S. ambassador, Sondland remains Trump's man in Europe.
And Sondland, for his part, is still playing along, holding on to his post in Brussels with a cheerful tenacity, according to nine associates and diplomats who have interacted with him in recent months. They say Sondland's gamble appears to be that if he carries on, he might survive long enough to recast his brief and so far scandal-ridden record as ambassador, a role the longtime hotelier hoped would serve as a distinguished capstone to his successful career in business.
But it is unclear how long he will be kept on the job once the impeachment trial is over.
Trump has not spoken with Sondland in the two months since the explosive testimony, according to two senior U.S. officials. The two last saw each other at the White House on Oct. 2 for the Finnish president's visit.
The decision for Trump and Sondland not to speak since the ambassador's testimony in November might go both ways. Two acquaintances of Sondland's said they left discussions with him in recent months understanding that Sondland had stopped calling the White House on advice of his attorneys, perhaps to avoid any perception of witness tampering.
His D.C.-based attorney, Robert Luskin, said he and his client would decline to comment. Sondland's testimony, he said, 'will speak for itself.'
Sondland's severed tie to the White House has diminished the ambassador's swagger, but it's not gone, several associates said.
Sondland has continued to press Europeans to be tougher on Iranian leadership and to impose sanctions. As the two sides fight over trade, he has pushed Trump's protectionist agenda. And as Britain finalizes its preparations to split from the E.U. next week, he has met with leaders on both sides to advocate for U.S. interests.
Some critics even say Sondland has found his stride.
'I think he's found his feet,' said Radoslaw Sikorski, the head of the European Parliament's delegation for relations with the United States, who hosted Sondland at a meeting last week. 'He has in the last year found a way of forcefully arguing for American interests and point of view without giving offense.'
Sikorski, a vocal Trump critic, said that for him and his peers, Sondland still was their main channel to Washington. 'He is the U.S. ambassador, and as long he is, we assume he represents the president and the State Department,' Sikorski said. 'He is well-briefed, and states it like it is.'
Others in Europe are still trying to determine Sondland's standing.
'I don't know how strong he really is in the U.S. right now because of the impeachment trial,' said Rasmus Andersen, a German member of the European Parliament who pressed Sondland about the U.S. political turmoil at the closed-door meeting with E.U. lawmakers last week.
Sikorski said that Sondland responded that 'he wasn't at liberty to discuss it.' As chair of the meeting, Sikorski said, he had moved the conversation along, since he saw impeachment as an internal U.S. matter.
One clear development since November is that Sondland's involvement in a matter outside the E.U. "" Ukraine policy "" has all but ended, said current and former U.S. officials. 
Sondland previously loomed large over U.S.-Ukraine relations, a fact that accounts for his central role in the impeachment trial. 
In July, on a visit to Kyiv, Sondland told a Ukrainian broadcaster that Trump had given him 'special assignments including Ukraine.' 
Text messages and emails revealed in the impeachment investigation, as well as subsequently, through public records lawsuits, show that in that period, Sondland was pressing Zelensky and his aides to announce investigations into Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company where Joe Biden's son Hunter previously held a board position, as well as into a widely discredited theory that some in Ukraine interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to help Democrats.
The difference between how House Democrats and Trump's defense team plan to present Sondland and the significance of his testimony was on full display Wednesday as Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the lead impeachment manager, in his opening statement discussed the ambassador's role and called for Trump to be removed from office.
Schiff played a video of Sondland's November testimony before the House in which the ambassador described carrying out what he understood to be Trump's wishes.
'I know that members of this committee frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a quid pro quo?' Sondland said. 'As I testified previously with regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.'
But Schiff then largely treated Sondland as a hostile witness, describing him as a foot soldier in Trump's pressure campaign against Ukraine. 
Schiff also made clear that House Democrats no longer trust that Sondland was truthful about a key conversation he claimed to have had with Trump.
Sondland has maintained that in a Sept. 9 phone call, Trump told him verbatim that he wanted 'no quid pro quo' with Ukraine. Trump has held up Sondland's depictions of the call as exculpatory. 
But The Washington Post reported in November that there is no corroborating evidence such a call took place. The White House has not located a record in its switchboard logs of a call between Trump and Sondland that day, even though it has records of other calls between the two described in impeachment testimony. Also, the call would have occurred in an unusual period, between 12:47 a.m. and 5:19 a.m. in Washington.
On Wednesday, Schiff represented that the president actually used the no-quid-pro-quo phrase days earlier, on Sept. 7, during a call that had a very different thrust. In that call, Trump made clear that he in fact did want Zelensky to personally announce investigations into Trump's political opponents, according to diplomats who spoke with Sondland at the time.
Schiff argued that the phrase was an unusual one for the president to throw out in conversation, and noted it occurred days after the White House was alerted to a whistleblower complaint detailing just such a scheme.
'Hello, Mr. President. How are you today?' Schiff said. 'No quid pro quo.'
He added: 'It's the kind of thing that comes up in a conversation, if you're trying to put your alibi out there.'

Collins in favor; Alexander opposed 
Trump allies hope to bring trial to a close today
The impeachment trial of President Trump is headed for a critical vote Friday that will determine whether the Senate hears from witnesses over allegations that the president pressured Ukraine to launch investigations for his own political benefit.
But Senate Republicans are increasingly confident no new testimony will be heard and they can start on a sprint toward Trump's acquittal.
On Thursday, Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) said she will break with Republican leadership and vote to hear witnesses. But Collins still needs three other Republicans to vote with her if new evidence is to be allowed and it was unclear late Thursday night who, if anyone, in the party would join her. 
Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) was considered a possible supporter of allowing testimony, but he announced Friday that he's ready to end the trial even though he found Trump's behavior 'inappropriate' and leave the president's fate in the hands of voters during the upcoming election. 
'Let the people decide,' he said in a statement.
Some Republicans said they hope the trial will be completed Friday with a vote to acquit Trump.
'We still feel very positive about it,' said Sen. John Barrasso (Wyo.), the third-ranking Republican leader. 'More and more members are saying, 'I'm ready to go to a final [vote]. . . . I've heard enough.' '
One outside possibility is that the Senate will deadlock on the question of calling witnesses. That would put Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. in the position of breaking the tie "" a role Democrats are urging him to play. But there is little expectation Roberts would weigh in on such a politically thorny question and instead would allow the tie to result in no witness being subpoenaed.
Trump will almost certainly revel in a vote to acquit him on the impeachment charges, but House Democrats have said they will continue to investigate the president and are hoping the allegations they have made against him will resonate with voters and help make him a one-term president.
Trump was impeached by the House in December "" charged with abuse of power after being accused of soliciting the Ukrainian government's help in undermining his political rivals and obstructing the House's investigation into his actions.
The final outcome of Trump's Senate trial has never been in doubt. It takes only 34 votes to acquit. The GOP has 53 seats. And with Republican primary voters strongly supportive of Trump, these senators have shown little interest in crossing him.
Instead, the main drama has been about how much more Republican senators want to learn about what Trump may have done before deciding whether he should be convicted.
 On Thursday, the answer appeared to be: not much.
'Even if you take everything else that is levied on him by others … is it an impeachable offense?' said Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), who said she would not vote to call witnesses. 'I don't see that it rises to the level of being an impeachable offense.'
Earlier this week, the New York Times reported that Trump's former national security adviser, John Bolton, wrote in a forthcoming book that Trump told him in August that he wanted to continue freezing military assistance to Ukraine until its leaders launched investigations into former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
That revelation provided a key firsthand witness to an alleged pressure campaign at the heart of the impeachment trial. Democrats accused Trump of pressuring Ukraine's president into investigating Biden to gain an edge on his possible 2020 rival. Republicans have dismissed this account as being based on second- or third-hand witnesses. 
But Bolton said he was told directly by the president about his reason for holding the aid in a book that will be titled 'The Room Where It Happened.'
If all Democrats agreed, it would take four Republican votes to call Bolton, or anyone else, as a witness. Earlier this week, that seemed possible: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) told other Republicans the vote was in doubt.
But since then, several Republicans seen as possible swing votes "" Ernst, Cory Gardner (Colo.) and Martha McSally (Ariz.), all facing competitive election contests "" rejected the idea of hearing more testimony.
Along with Collins, Sen. Mitt Romney (Utah) is still viewed as the likeliest Republican contender to side with Democrats for more testimony, while Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) could join as well. She said late Thursday night that she is going to review her notes and reflect on the decision. It's unclear who would be the fourth vote "" Alexander was considered the most likely to join the other three before he said he was against subpoenaing witnesses.
While Alexander's announcement was cheered by Republicans, he took a swipe at Trump and contradicted the president's claim that his July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was 'perfect.'
'It was inappropriate for the president to ask a foreign leader to investigate his political opponent and to withhold United States aid to encourage that investigation,' he said. 'When elected officials inappropriately interfere with such investigations, it undermines the principle of equal justice under the law. But the Constitution does not give the Senate the power to remove the president from office and ban him from this year's ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate.'
Republicans on Thursday mused about Roberts's potential role in breaking a tie on witnesses, but appeared unconcerned he would to take any decisive action.
'If it's two [voting for witnesses], deal is over. If it's three, we don't know, because we're in uncharted territory,' said Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.).
That's because three yes votes would create a 50-50 tie. Normally, tie votes are broken by the vice president. But in an impeachment trial, the presiding officer of the Senate is Roberts, not the vice president.
Could Roberts vote to break the tie? Would he?
'There's no real certainty what the power of the presiding officer is,' said Braun, who added that Republicans consider it 'unlikely' that Roberts would intervene.
Democrats have mostly been solicitous of Roberts during the trial, but on Thursday Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tried to put the chief justice on the spot.
The presidential contender asked whether Americans would lose faith in the chief justice, the Supreme Court and the Constitution if Roberts presided over a trial where no new witnesses or evidence was allowed.
Roberts performed his duty and read the question aloud, after which House Democrats' lead impeachment lawyer came to his defense.
'It reflects adversely on us,' House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) told lawmakers concerning the lack of witnesses and new evidence being allowed. He added that Roberts has performed 'admirably.'
Republican leaders said they want to move quickly toward the vote to acquit if the Senate decides not to hear new testimony Friday.
In the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, the Senate heard a combined five hours and 28 minutes of closing arguments. Then, the Senate entered four days of closed-door jury deliberations totaling nearly 26 hours, before voting to acquit Clinton on two articles of impeachment.
In this case, some Republicans said, they want to skip the closing arguments and the deliberations and move ahead to the last step.
'If 51 [senators] say we've heard enough, we can move to that final vote,' said Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.), the second-ranking Republican.
That would leave Senate Democrats with few cards to play. They could not stop an acquittal vote. 
But they could delay it "" and force Republican senators to take uncomfortable votes against hearing more evidence or allowing more debate.
One idea proposed by Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) is a motion to require Roberts to issue a subpoena for additional documents and witnesses if he thinks they are relevant to the trial. 
It would probably fail, but the vote could be used against Gardner, Ernst and other Republicans facing reelection.
'The minority has rights, and we will exercise those rights,' Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Thursday.
Schiff on Thursday proposed allowing for one week for deposing witnesses, a time during which the Senate could conduct legislative business, but Republicans are unlikely to agree to that.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who has remained relatively quiet throughout the proceedings, previewed an attack on Republicans to come if no additional evidence is allowed to be presented.
'You cannot be acquitted if you don't have a trial. You don't have a trial if you don't have witnesses and documentation,' she wrote on Twitter. 'If Republican Senators choose a coverup, the American people and history will judge it with the harshness it deserves.'
Still, delays eventually end "" even in the Senate. Even if Democrats force extra votes, the final vote to acquit Trump could come as early as Friday night or Saturday, unless leaders decide to move it to Monday, just one day before Trump's State of the Union address.
On Thursday "" on the last day of questions and answers in the Senate "" the day was mostly devoted to softballs, lobbed by senators at their own side. At one point, Republican senators asked Trump's lawyers to, in effect, recount Trump's accomplishments in office.
Trump attorney Eric Hershmann said that, if Trump's actions are 'for his personal and political gain and not in the best interests of the American people then I say, 'God bless him. Keep doing it, keep doing it, keep doing it.' '
Democratic senators asked Schiff who was paying the legal bills of Trump's private attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani "" who served as an intermediary to Ukraine.
'I don't know who's directly paying the freight for it, but I can tell you the whole country is paying the freight for it because there are leaders around the world who are watching this, and they're saying the American presidency is open for business,' Schiff said.
At the start of the day's session, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) submitted a question for Roberts to read aloud. The question contained the name of a person who conservative media have alleged is the intelligence community whistleblower whose complaint last year about Trump's actions toward Ukraine sparked the impeachment inquiry.
Roberts didn't read it.
'The presiding officer declines to read the question as submitted,' Roberts said. 
After that, Paul stood up, gathered his papers and walked out of the Senate chamber to address reporters. He then said the name that Roberts would not.
Trump traveled Thursday night to a rally in Iowa, where he criticized House Democrats for impeaching him but said he was unfazed by the trial.
He said he was enjoying a 'happy period' unlike the 'dark' impeachment cases of his predecessors Bill Clinton, Richard Nixon and Andrew Johnson.
'This is a happy period for us,' he said. 'It's a happy period because they call it 'impeachment light.' '

Meeting seen as way for Ukraine's president to put turmoil behind him


KYIV, Ukraine "" Ukraine's precarious location "" on the friction point between Russian authoritarianism and Western democracy "" makes attention from the United States critical to politicians here. Meetings and even photo opportunities with American VIPs are invested with huge significance.
For the Ukrainian president, the holy grail is a White House meeting.
For many lower-ranking officials, just getting a selfie with an influential American is political gold, seen as 'the epitome of success,' as one former Ukrainian intelligence official put it recently.
With Secretary of State Mike Pompeo due to meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv on Friday, Ukraine's leadership is looking for a signal on its standing with President Trump.
Trump told officials in an Oval Office meeting last May, shortly after Zelensky's election victory, that Ukrainians 'are all corrupt, they are all terrible people' who 'tried to take me down,' according to testimony from Kurt Volker, the former U.S. special envoy to Ukraine, during House impeachment hearings.
Getting past the Trump problem is crucial for Zelensky, a former television comedian who ran for president on a platform of dealing with Ukraine's enduring problem of corrosive corruption and ending a war with Russian-backed separatists in the eastern region of Donbas.
But the signs for Ukraine are worrying.
Volker has not been replaced since his resignation in September. There has been no new U.S. ambassador appointed to replace Marie Yovanovitch, who was recalled by Trump last spring. And a disquieting silence has descended over U.S.-Ukraine relations amid the Senate impeachment trial over Trump's attempts to pressure Zelensky to investigate political rival Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
Another bad sign came last week. An NPR journalist, Mary Louise Kelly, said that Pompeo, furious that she asked him about Ukraine and Yovanovitch in an interview, berated her, asking whether she thought Americans cared about Ukraine.
Volker was involved in negotiations with Zelensky aide Andriy Yermak last summer for the Ukrainian president to announce the investigation Trump wanted in return for a White House meeting, according text messages released during the impeachment process.
Volker on Tuesday called on Pompeo to announce the date for a White House meeting at Friday's gathering.
'Pompeo's visit to Ukraine is an important opportunity to finally make that a reality,' he wrote in Foreign Policy, arguing that Zelensky offered the best hope for Ukraine to fight corruption, implement reform and act as a bulwark against Russian aggression.
Yermak told Time magazine in December that a White House meeting would send a message that Zelensky's new leadership had already achieved a lot.
Ukraine is seen as a crucial counterweight to Russian power in the region. It is desperately reliant on U.S. military aid, facing on ongoing war against Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine and still reeling from the loss of the strategic Crimean Peninsula, annexed by Russia in 2014.

Ukraine's political elite has been deeply frustrated at the derailment of U.S.-Ukraine relations by the impeachment hearings.
Even if Pompeo does deliver Zelensky a White House meeting, as Volker suggested, attention will inevitably turn to whether Zelensky offered something helpful to Trump in return.
Zelensky has repeatedly denied that he felt any pressure from Trump to announce the inquiry the U.S. president wanted when the two spoke on the phone on July 25 "" the phone call that helped stir the impeachment.
'There is no doubt that this visit has a significant political and psychological component that is linked to the U.S. impeachment trial,' said Makar Taran, a specialist on U.S. studies at the National Taras Shevchenko University of Kyiv.
Despite his hopes for a White House meeting, Zelensky cannot afford to be pulled deeper into U.S. politics in a U.S. election year, said political analyst Taras Semenyuk of the KyivStratPro think tank.
'The president of the United States has stooped from his legal obligations to the level of standard profit-for-profit arrangements,' Semenyuk said. 'It's Trump's logic, benefit in return for benefit. I will give you military help and you will give me incriminating evidence on Biden.'
'Zelensky will not publicly help Trump in the elections, because it would entail very unpleasant consequences for his ratings and Ukraine's ratings in general,' he added.

Zelensky's main task is a possible reset in U.S.-Ukraine relations without wading into American politics, said Andriy Buzarov, a foreign policy expert on the public council of the Ukraine Ministry of Foreign Affairs, an advisory body.
'Zelensky and his team will do everything possible to avoid getting involved in the internal political strife of the United States on one side or the other,' Buzarov said. 'Zelensky has two clear tasks "" to get continued United States support for Ukraine, no matter who is president of the United States or Ukraine, and to minimize the involvement of the Zelensky team in the internal political disputes of the United States.'
He said the U.S. impeachment drama had damaged Washington's standing in Ukraine.
'All the issues related to the impeachment and the politicization of U.S.-Ukraine relations has undermined the image of the U.S. president and the United States in Ukraine.'

ROME "" Vice President Pence, in Israel, marked the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. He slipped a prayer into Jerusalem's Western Wall and bowed his head. And he visited with Pope Francis here in Rome before gazing upward at the Sistine Chapel.
But Pence's whirlwind, 77-hour trip abroad was nearly as notable for what he didn't do "" and didn't say "" as for what he did.
Over two full days and two stops "" the first in Jerusalem, the second in Rome "" the vice president largely escaped the impeachment vortex consuming the nation's capital some 5,000 miles away.
President Trump spent his foreign sojourn to Davos this week obsessing over the Senate trial back home "" tweeting more than a dozen times before dawn on his final day in Switzerland and railing against what he called 'the hoax' focused on his alleged efforts to pressure Ukraine for political gain. Pence, by contrast, cut a calmer and more sanguine visage, ostensibly unconcerned by the constitutional controversy raging back home.
Pence never brought up impeachment unprompted, weighing in only when asked by reporters, including during a short news conference at the end of his day in Rome.
Pence reiterated his previous claims that he had no awareness of a push by Trump and his associates, including personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, to withhold critical U.S. aid from Ukraine in exchange for an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
'What I've said over and over again is I was never aware of the allegations that there was some pressure campaign for investigations against the Bidens that was underway until those matters became public,' he said.
The vice president also added that while he had initially said he had no problem releasing a transcript of his own phone conversation with Ukraine's president, he was now more reticent after coming to believe that the Democrats' impeachment inquiry was simply a 'sham investigation.'
'The outcome here is that the president should be acquitted,' Pence said. 
Outside those brief remarks, the most tangible reminder of the latest scandal engulfing the Trump presidency followed Pence abroad in the form of the screens of Fox News "" the in-flight entertainment choice that aired parts of the impeachment proceedings as Air Force Two knifed through a darkening sky.
On Thursday, at the new U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, the vice president extended an invitation to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "" as well as to Benny Gantz, his rival in the country's upcoming elections "" to travel to Washington next week for the unveiling of the administration's new peace plan.
Earlier in the day, speaking alongside other world leaders at the Holocaust remembrance site Yad Vashem to commemorate the anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation, Pence condemned the 'vile tide of anti-Semitism that is fueling hate and violence all across the world.' He also singled out Iran, calling on other nations to 'stand strong against the leading state purveyor of anti-Semitism, against the one government in the world that denies the Holocaust as a matter of state policy and threatens to wipe Israel off the map.'
The vice president, who last year visited the concentration camp in Poland where more than 1.1-million men, women and children perished under Nazi control during World War II, recounted how moving the experience was for him.
'One cannot see the piles of shoes, the gas chambers, the crematoriums, the lone boxcar facing the gate to the camp and those grainy photographs of men, women and children being sent to their deaths without asking, 'How could they?' ' he said.
Pence's latest foreign trip is another reminder of the vice president's uncanny knack for seeming to sidestep the morass of the Trump administration, often through unintentionally well-timed travel out of town.
In August 2017, Pence left for a week-long trip to Latin America immediately after deadly violence at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville. He was still abroad when Trump held a much-criticized news conference in the lobby of Trump Tower declaring that 'both sides' were to blame.
Pence did weigh in at the time from Chile but largely sidestepped a question about whether he agreed with Trump that both sides were responsible, instead simply affirming that he stood with the president. He cut his trip short by a day, returning to Washington early for a strategy meeting with Trump and his national security team at Camp David.
In early 2018, Pence was in Japan, en route to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, when news broke that staff secretary Rob Porter was being pushed from the White House amid allegations of domestic abuse from his two ex-wives.
'I learned as I awoke this morning of those developments,' Pence said, prompting a follow-up question from his traveling press corps about why he often seemed 'a little bit out of the loop on some of this major news.'
Later that year, in November, Pence again traveled to Asia, just days after Democrats won control of the House in the midterm elections, when Trump fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, installing loyalist Matthew G. Whitaker atop the Justice Department.
In February 2019, Pence flew to Colombia to announce new sanctions against Venezuela at the beginning of the week that Michael Cohen, Trump's former personal attorney and fixer, testified before Congress about the president's alleged misdeeds. His trip also coincided with Trump's failed summit in Hanoi with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
And throughout much of last year "" as special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's Russia probe reached its culmination and the impeachment inquiry began to boil "" Pence was hopscotching the country, helping promote Trump's trade deal with Mexico and Canada.
Pence's far-flung travels are partly a function of the unconventional Trump White House. The president is a homebody reluctant to travel abroad, frequently delegating foreign trips to his No. 2. 
On Friday in Rome, Pence appeared both geographically and mentally removed from the spectacle of impeachment.
He began his day at the Vatican, deploying his standard opening line with the pope "" an offering of his 'warmest greetings' from Trump "" before the two men exchanged gifts, with Pence, a self-described 'evangelical Catholic,' giving the leader of the faith a wooden cross.
During the meeting, Pence and the pope discussed the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela, displaced religious minorities in the Middle East and the antiabortion March for Life, Pence said. 
'I won't forget "" you made me a hero,' Pence told Francis before departing through the Clement VIII door, in a possible reference to Pence's mother's admiration for the pontiff.
Pence then entered the Sistine Chapel, which was already thick with tourists, some of whom momentarily averted their eyes from Michelangelo's fresco to gape at the vice president. One woman pointed at Pence, offered a thumbs up and requested a picture.
The vice president smiled before turning back to his tour guide, who made a good-natured gesture to signify that the eager tourist was just another one of the 'Americans' "" like Pence, far from home.

'The reality is, on my watch, drug arrests in South Bend were lower than the n
ational average, and specifically to marijuana, lower than in Indiana.'



"" former mayor Pete Buttigieg

Buttigieg was challenged by moderator Linsey Davis over the fact that when he was mayor, a black resident in South Bend, Ind., was four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white resident. This was a point raised in an Intercept article, which said the rate was 4.3 times for a black person than a white person between 2012 and 2018, compared with 3.5 times in the state of Indiana for that period.
His response was a non sequitur. 
The moderator quickly noted that more blacks were arrested in 2012 than in 2018 (the last year for which there is data). Data supplied to the FBI shows that 151 blacks and 75 whites were arrested in 2012, compared with 186 blacks and 96 whites in 2018.
The number of arrests dipped as low as 71 in 2013, but in every year, far more blacks than whites were arrested for marijuana possession, even though South Bend has a black population of about 27,000 and a white population of around 64,000. Between 2012 and 2018, 805 blacks were arrested vs. 449 whites. So even though blacks are about 30 percent of the population, they were arrested at twice the rate of whites. 
The Buttigieg campaign issued a statement claiming that in Buttigieg's second mayoral term, black residents in South Bend were less likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than residents of Indiana generally. The numbers were presented as arrests as a percentage of the entire population. The campaign did not respond to a question for equivalent data for Buttigieg's first term. 





'In 1988, I probably lost a race for Congress . . . because in 1988, I said that we should ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons in this country. That was 30 years ago. Furthermore, I am very proud that today I have a D-minus voting record from the NRA.'



"" Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.)

Sanders likes to talk about his D-minus rating from the NRA and his loss in his first congressional race. He says the NRA's endorsement of his opponents during his first congressional race in 1988 may have cost him the election. This was one of Sanders's repeated claims in the 2016 campaign, so we dug into this deeply then.
Sanders's most recent grade from the NRA (technically the NRA's political action committee, the NRA-Political Victory Fund) was, indeed, a D-minus. Since 1992, the first year the NRA issued a grade for Sanders, he has received between a C-minus and F.
Since 1988, Sanders has been consistent on restricting the use of certain semiautomatic firearms (often called 'assault weapons'). The evidence for whether his stance had anything to do with his 1988 loss is mixed. He could have just as easily lost the election because he split votes with a Democrat, as opposed to being the only candidate without an NRA endorsement. The NRA had endorsed one of his opponents, Peter Smith, in 1988 because Smith signed the NRA pledge to not support 'additional restrictive firearms legislation.'
But Smith changed his mind once he was in Congress and supported a ban on certain semiautomatic rifles. That angered the NRA, which actively campaigned for Sanders in 1990 to successfully oust Smith. That's how Sanders first won a seat in the House.



'Everyone on this stage except [Sen.] Amy [Klobuchar] and me is either a billionaire or is receiving help from PACs that can do unlimited spending. So if you really want to live where you say, then put your money where your mouth is and say no to the PACs.'



"" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.)

Warren has sworn off PAC money for her presidential run and said all her opponents for the Democratic nomination "" save for Klobuchar (Minn.) "" should be doing the same.
The bids of former vice president Joe Biden, Buttigieg and Andrew Yang are all benefiting from the work of super PACs, which can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money. Tom Steyer is a billionaire. Bernie Sanders is supported by a 501(c)4 group called Our Revolution.
'Our Revolution can raise unlimited sums from wealthy patrons that dwarf the limits faced by candidates and conventional PACs,' according to the Associated Press. 'Unlike a super PAC, however, the group doesn't have to disclose its donors "" a stream of revenue commonly referred to as 'dark money.'-'
Warren is not backed by a super PAC, but she gets air cover from the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a political action committee that is limited in the amount of money it can raise from individual donors. The PAC has an affiliated, politically active nonprofit entity, P Street Project, that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money.
The PCCC tweeted during the debate: 'If you believe Super PACs - anonymous wealthy donors have no place in our primary, chip in to fund @ewarren's grassroots-funded campaign for big, structural change now, - our work electing progressives who will fight for campaign finance reform.' 
(Sanders and Warren supporters say Our Revolution and the PCCC are grass-roots-funded.)

REPUBLICANS WEIGH CALL FOR WITNESSES 
Amid new revelations, trial set to start next week
The House delivered two articles of impeachment to the Senate on Wednesday, laying the groundwork for President Trump's trial as Republicans rallied behind the idea of parity between the two parties in possibly calling witnesses. 
The impeachment managers' brief ceremonial journey across the Capitol "" a month after the House voted to impeach Trump "" relinquished Democratic control over a process that is expected to end in the president's election-year acquittal by the Republican-led Senate. The procession, which solemnly set in motion the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history, capped a rancorous day of partisan conflict and heightened the pressure on Senate moderates, whose views on seeking additional evidence after unmitigated stonewalling by the White House will define the scope of Trump's trial.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) declared that Trump was guilty of 'an assault on the Constitution of the United States' and rejected criticism that his impeachment was politically motivated.
'We take it very seriously,' Pelosi said on the House floor. 'It's not personal. It's not political. It's not partisan. It's patriotic.'
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) attacked the House's inquiry as 'unprecedented and dangerous' and accused Democrats of 'pure factionalism.' 
'This has been naked partisanship all along,' McConnell said on the Senate floor. '. . . We had a 230-year tradition of rejecting purely political impeachments. It died last month.' 
As tensions increased across the Capitol, new evidence of Trump's pressure campaign toward Ukraine for his political benefit added urgency to Democrats' push for more witness testimony and documents during the trial phase. 
Records from Lev Parnas, an associate of Trump personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, showed Ukraine's top prosecutor offering damaging information related to former vice president Joe Biden if the Trump administration recalled the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. They also revealed claims from a Republican congressional candidate that he had the then-ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, under physical and electronic surveillance. 
The impeachment charges "" abuse of power and obstruction of Congress "" center on the allegation that Trump withheld military aid and a White House meeting to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, including Biden. 
Pelosi argued that the revelations proved the wisdom of her decision to withhold the articles for a month "" a gambit that did not fulfill her primary goals of ensuring witness testimony or forcing McConnell to outline terms for the trial. 
'Time has been our friend in all of this, because it has yielded incriminating evidence, more truth into the public domain,' the speaker said at a Capitol Hill news conference. 
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine), one of the moderates whose views on further evidence could shape the trial, held a different view. 
'Doesn't that suggest that the House did an incomplete job, then?' she said. 
The records were released Tuesday night by the four House committees that ran the impeachment inquiry "" just as Senate Republicans began coalescing around the idea of each party having the opportunity to call witnesses, should enough moderates agree with Democrats that more evidence is needed. 
A day after Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) proposed the idea of 'reciprocity' "" which would enable Trump's legal team to call Hunter Biden if Democrats get enough votes to summon former national security adviser John Bolton, for example "" two moderate Republicans signaled they were open to the idea.
'The idea that only the House managers should be able to call witnesses is one I reject,' said Collins, who has insisted on a vote on whether to call witnesses. 'It clearly should be both sides, both sides should have the opportunity. But as far as approving specific witnesses, I haven't heard the case yet.'
Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) said Wednesday that he would be amenable to each side choosing 'which witnesses they want to appear, as opposed to going in and saying, 'Well, I want that one, I want that one.' . . . I think I expect both sides to be able to put together their own list of demands.' 
Should moderates decide witnesses are necessary, it would require four Republicans to join with all members of the Democratic caucus to vote in favor.
Privately, McConnell and other senior Republicans still hope a majority of senators will think they have heard enough "" after days of arguments from the House impeachment managers, the president's defense counsel and several rounds of questioning "" to move to a vote to determine whether Trump should be removed from office. 
Several closely watched Republican senators declined to say whether they believed Hunter Biden was worthy of summoning to the impeachment trial. 
Biden served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma, and Trump and Giuliani have promoted an unfounded theory that Joe Biden, while vice president, tried to stop a corruption investigation of the company to protect his son. Hunter Biden is no longer on Burisma's board.
'I'm not going to opine on that at this stage,' Romney said of whether Hunter Biden's testimony is warranted. 'I think each side should be able to choose the people they want to hear from.' 
'You're asking me to prejudge the evidence,' Collins said. 'I don't know which witnesses we're going to need until I hear the case.' 
'I feel like I'm just going to print a sign "" I don't know whether I'm going to have it on my back or on my chest "" saying there will be a time in the process where we will have an opportunity to make a determination as to what further information we need, whether it is from Hunter Biden or Ambassador Bolton or Lisa Murkowski,' said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska). 'So until that point in time, I'm not thinking about each individual witness.' 
Democrats were unanimous in their view that Hunter Biden's testimony would be irrelevant. 
'Any trial judge in this country would rule such a witness as irrelevant and inadmissible,' said House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), one of the impeachment managers approved by the chamber Wednesday. 
'If someone is accused of robbing a bank, witnesses who say, 'We saw him run into the bank. We saw him someplace else,' are relevant,' Nadler said. 'A witness who says, 'He committed forgery on some other document,' is not relevant to the bank robbery charge. That's the distinction.'
'The Senate is on trial, as well as the president,' with impeachment, Nadler said. 
The transmission of the articles marked the end of the four-week standoff between Pelosi and McConnell "" though an array of proxy battles over timing and protocol highlighted the lingering resentments. 
The House voted Wednesday to send the Senate the two articles and to approve seven Democratic lawmakers to serve as impeachment managers, or prosecutors. 
That group is notably smaller and more diverse than the team of lawmakers tapped by House Republicans to present the case during President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999, when all 13 managers were white men. Pelosi's team includes three women and two African Americans. 
The resolution was approved 228 to 193, breaking largely along party lines.
The procedural formalities of the trial are expected to begin Thursday with the reading of the articles; the swearing-in of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who will preside; and the swearing-in of the senators as jurors. After that, the Senate is expected to recess for the weekend; the trial will begin in earnest Tuesday, according to McConnell. 
The White House signaled Wednesday that it does not expect the Senate impeachment trial to last longer than two weeks, casting acquittal as a foregone conclusion and arguing that Trump's team will present 'a very strong case for the president.'
Asked whether Trump would go ahead with plans to deliver his State of the Union address on Feb. 4 even if the impeachment trial hasn't concluded by then, a senior administration official told reporters, 'I think it's extraordinarily unlikely that we'd be going beyond two weeks.'
'We think that this case is overwhelming for the president, and the Senate's not going to be having any need to be taking that amount of time on this,' said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about internal White House deliberations and discussed the matter on the condition of anonymity. 
In the House, debate was animated over the resolution to send the articles and approve managers. Pelosi emphasized that Trump is 'impeached for life,' regardless of what happens in the Senate. 
'The president is not above the law,' the speaker said. 'He will be held accountable. He has been held accountable. He has been impeached. He has been impeached forever. They can never erase that.'

WADMALAW ISLAND, S.C. "" Benjamin Gadsden was so certain that Joe Biden would be the Democratic Party's strongest nominee against President Trump.
'I think he's the best,' Gadsden, 80, said several weeks ago, citing the former vice president's long career. 'He's a seasoned politician.' 
Over the past three weeks, however, Gadsden's confidence has wilted, much like Biden's poll numbers, after disappointing showings in the first three nominating contests. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has emerged with the most delegates so far and has gained strength in South Carolina, threatening Biden's longtime lead before Saturday's primary.
'I am a bit concerned,' Gadsden, a retired warehouse worker, said in a recent interview. 'Not too long ago, he was up front, and now he's nearly on the bottom. If he doesn't turn it around pretty soon . . .'
His daughter, Tamika Gadsden, 39, is not surprised that Biden's candidacy flagged. She said his campaign had always lacked energy, relying not on passion but on long-standing support among state party leaders and on voters' fond memories of his time in the Obama administration. She tried to talk to her parents, but after some heated discussions, especially with her mother, she let it go. Still, she is not happy to see them so dispirited by Biden's struggling campaign.
Besides, her candidate, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), is also struggling, and Gadsden is frustrated that there's little time left for her to pick off potential Biden defectors. 'I thought she would have done better in New Hampshire,' Gadsden said, irked that Warren is being outspent by billionaire candidates who have raised their profiles with expensive ad buys and, in the case of Tom Steyer, paid top dollar for organizers in South Carolina.
The debate among the Gadsdens and others on Wadmalaw Island, southeast of Charleston, S.C., mirrors a conversation taking place between generations of black voters across the nation. With black voters making up 60-percent of the Democratic electorate in South Carolina and a significant proportion in many Super Tuesday states, the outcome of that conflict in the next few days could prove critical to deciding the party's nomination. 


African American voters, particularly older ones like Benjamin Gadsden, have overwhelmingly supported Biden, fueling the lead he held in national polls until recently. South Carolina's black voters, in particular, were seen as his firewall, blunting anyone else's rise here. The notion that he would be able to win over white swing voters in the general election made him a reasonable choice for many black voters. 
But his support among younger black voters like Tamika Gadsden was always weaker, with many underwhelmed by his nostalgic message of returning to a pre-Trump America. For voters seeking a political leader to confront systemic racism and economic inequity, Biden's long and complicated record and some of his comments during the campaign seemed like a continuation of those institutional biases. 
Younger voters also have found Sanders and Warren as the more attractive alternatives because of their proposals for universal health care, student loan forgiveness and free college tuition, and promises to level the economic playing field.
Tamika Gadsden took advantage of early voting and cast her ballot last week for Warren. 'I see her trying to rally the troops and vowing to turn around her campaign "" and she might,' Gadsden said, adding that she has been heartened by Warren's performances in the past two debates and has not given up hope that the senator will win the nomination.
And despite his concerns, Benjamin Gadsden says he will vote for Biden. 'I'm not going to bail on him,' Gadsden said recently. 'I think Biden will have a better shot in South Carolina than he's [had] so far in Iowa and New Hampshire. But if South Carolina is going to be the only state he's depending on, it could be a problem for him. It's going to take more than South Carolina for him to get the nomination.'



Wadmalaw Island, about 23-miles south of Charleston, has roughly 5,000 residents, more than half of whom are black. After the Union Army seized South Carolina in the Civil War, white plantation owners fled the islands, leaving behind their lucrative rice fields and enslaved African Americans, many of whom were given plots of land. During Reconstruction, some owners reclaimed portions of the land, but the former slaves still established communities in which they retained their culture and sense of independence. Over time, however, economic hardship has forced many to sell their land or lose it to unscrupulous real estate agents.
Benjamin Gadsden was born on Wadmalaw. Following the path of millions of black Southerners during the first half of the past century, Gadsden headed north as a young adult, along with two older sisters who had moved to Woodbridge, N.J., during the Great Migration. Tamika Gadsden calls them 'Jim Crow refugees.'
He returned to Wadmalaw in 1996, to be close to his ailing father, with his wife, Trudy, and Tamika and her twin brother, Terence. Tamika Gadsden remembers being devastated, as most 10th-graders would be, to be uprooted from friends and favorite places and relocated to a rural landscape with one road in and out of town. She headed back to New Jersey for college and stayed after graduation, working for a time in government and in a retailer's corporate offices. Then, on a visit home several years ago, she drove over a bridge and saw sunlight dancing on the water. She decided she wanted to come home.
Gadsden is part of a reverse migration, in which African Americans are moving to the South, searching for a lower cost of living, a better quality of life and, for many, closer proximity to extended family. She lives with her mother and father in a rambler on Maybank Highway, the main thoroughfare that connects Wadmalaw and the other islands to the mainland. 
More than half of the nation's African Americans live in the South, where the Republican Party has had a lock on most political power since the 1950s. But Tamika Gadsden and others see the region on the cusp of change, pushed by its growing population of people of color. Last year, for instance, black voters along with liberal whites and Latinos and Asian Americans nominated African American Democrats for governor's races in Florida and Georgia. Both nearly upset their Republican rivals.
She has jumped into the fight, working as an organizer for Black Voters Matter, an independent group focused on educating and mobilizing African Americans in the rural South. Separately, she is among the 100 activists who endorsed Warren under the banner of Black Womxn For. She has talked up Warren's campaign on a radio show and a podcast that she hosts. 


Presidential candidates rarely venture out to Wadmalaw or neighboring islands. Voters who want to see the candidates in person usually have to go to Charleston. That's where Mildred Mitchell first saw Barack Obama. 'On January 10th. It was my birthday,' she said. 
Mitchell, a longtime friend of the Gadsdens, lives about a quarter-mile off Maybank Highway, in the country version of a cul-de-sac: A rutted dirt road, the drive even more treacherous during a rain spell, empties into a clearing with four houses. The land on which she lives has been in her husband's family for more than 80 years. Long ago, the yards would have been filled with children, but only grandparents live there now. Her grandchildren are in New York, where Mitchell lived for 47 years before moving back to Wadmalaw in 2007, just in time for Obama's historic bid.
She recalled seeing him speak for the first time. She was taken by 'his charisma . . . the way he spoke. He had a young voice. He really was a young man.' 
Mitchell, 78, a retired hospital employee, was a poll worker in 2008 and remembers the excitement "" and the tension "" around that primary, when the senator from Illinois upset Hillary Clinton, who initially had been favored to win South Carolina. She thought Obama's policies, particularly the Affordable Care Act, were good for the country, and she hates that Trump seems intent on undoing his legacy. That was why she was leaning toward Biden, even though she was concerned about his age.
His fifth-place finish in the New Hampshire primary, she said, was 'heartbreaking.'
'I want somebody that can beat Donald Trump,' she said. Right now, she is not sure who that is.
Mitchell's cousins, Mattie and her son Shawn, had never been sold on Biden.
Mattie Mitchell, 67, grew up on Wadmalaw and came back home after earning a degree from Claflin University, about 90 miles north, in Orangeburg. She taught elementary school for 40 years. Fourth grade was her favorite, she said, because that was the year she could see the children really starting to grow up.
She wants a president who cares about children, especially black children, who she said are being shortchanged by inequities in the public school system. 
'We need fair and equity in funding. Our schools are not being treated fairly, and it's wrong,' she said. She rejects conservative arguments for 'school choice' initiatives as a solution. 'If you make all schools the same, you don't need choice,' she said.


In December, Mattie Mitchell said, she was still looking over the candidates. As much as she admired Obama, particularly his fight to push through the Affordable Care Act, she didn't see that as a reason to automatically support Biden.
'I will judge Biden by what he's going to bring to the table, how he's going to help the American people,' she said.
Mitchell, who now lives in Charleston, said in a recent interview she thought the attention to Biden's son Hunter's work in Ukraine had hurt the former vice president, and she's now leaning toward Sanders. She likes his call for canceling student debt and his Medicare-for-all proposal. 
'I could still change my mind,' she cautioned, although she said she's ruled out Warren because she doesn't think a woman can win in the nation's toxic political climate, and she doesn't know enough about Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind. She said she is skeptical of billionaires Steyer and Mike Bloomberg, who is not on the South Carolina primary ballot.
'I don't know if they really realize what it's like for the people, the underdogs, who really need all this help,' she said. 'I don't know if they really understand the needs of our people.'
Her son Shawn Mitchell, 33, said he found Bloomberg's sudden visibility, particularly his ubiquitous ads on TV and social media, disconcerting. He was offended by ads that both the former New York mayor and Trump ran around the Super Bowl that featured the stories of black women who had experienced trauma and had been helped by the politicians.
'I was like, so are we going to try to put up a liberal billionaire against a conservative billionaire?' Mitchell said. 
Early on, he said, he supported Sanders because of his promise to forgive student loans. Mitchell finished dentistry school in 2014 with debt that was so high he couldn't get financing to open a practice in his hometown. He resorted to crowdfunding to help pay down his student debt, which allowed him to get the business loan he needed to start his practice, Sweetgrass Dental Associates, which opened in January in North Charleston.
Bloomberg's rise in the contest reminded him of his residency in New York, where he was stopped a few times by police. Mitchell said he cannot abide Bloomberg's candidacy because of his mayoral policy that prompted police to stop and frisk residents "" mostly young, nonwhite men. Just as worrisome, he said, is the notion that the presidency is for sale. 
'I know people have their gripes with Bernie because of the socialist label. I still agree with him. He evens the playing field for those of us who don't have power and don't have a voice,' Mitchell said. His wife, Myriam, and 30-year-old twin brothers, Trevor and Julian, also are with Sanders.


The Wadmalaw families have one thing in common: None expressed excitement about their choices, even as all vow to vote. They said they were frustrated by the large, chaotic field of candidates, although Tamika Gadsden said she liked the variety. Mostly, they said, they felt a duty to participate in the election and a desire to defeat Trump. But there is no swooning like they all recalled from 2008, when they helped boost Obama's candidacy at a critical moment. 
Benjamin Gadsden shrugged off one of the criticisms of Biden "" his occasional racial insensitivity, particularly in the past. 
He had never even heard of most of the other candidates, except for Sanders, and he hadn't heard of him before 2016. He believes people can change, and he doesn't think Obama would have chosen Biden as his vice president 'if he was so bad in that area.'
'Show me the perfect man,' he said. He added, 'White folks, in general, are not 100 percent in our corner. I don't care how much they try to portray that image, they are not 100 percent for us.'
Gadsden blamed 'bickering' among the Democratic candidates and Republican investigations into Hunter Biden for having 'knocked Biden off course.' Now he is worried that his worst fears will come true. 
'I do not have any desire to see Trump coming back,' he said. 'But as it stands now, I think he's a shoo-in.'
Tamika Gadsden said she thinks black voters should demand better. That's why she's backing Warren, who has talked about issues that affect black women specifically, like the racial disparity in maternal mortality and workplace salaries. 
Looking back, Tamika questioned how much Obama did to challenge and change systemic racial disparities in the criminal justice, economic and educational systems. But she said his election was an important cultural victory "" an affirming image of a black family and black achievement.
Tamika said she is not dispirited by the upheaval of the current field.
'I think black people aren't expecting perfection; there's no perfect candidate, but I think that, honestly, we've got more choices than we've ever had,' she said. 'I think people keep offering these hot takes as opposed to looking at this as a remarkable moment. . . . I think we still have a lot of candidates to choose from.'

LAS VEGAS "" The Democratic presidential candidates staged their toughest and noisiest debate of the campaign Wednesday night, firing at one another with an intensity that underscored a growing sense that their nomination contest has entered what could be a decisive moment.
The race has moved swiftly since Iowa and New Hampshire, with national polls now showing Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the lead and Mike Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York, rising at the expense of others who have been fighting to become a center-left alternative to Sanders.
Everything that was on display Wednesday night "" as well as everyone on the stage "" showed the tension that now exists and the sense of urgency that time is running out on some of them. Sanders's rise has raised fears that, if he were the nominee, his brand of democratic socialism could doom the party to defeat against President Trump, along with many candidates for House and Senate.
One measure of how rapidly things are changing is this: In barely a week, the question has shifted from whether Sanders has a ceiling, based on the fact that he managed just a quarter of the vote in both Iowa and New Hampshire, to whether he can be stopped. The answer to that question could be known as early as Super Tuesday, less than two weeks away.
Some Democrats see Bloomberg as the one candidate could sell better in a general election, and there have been suggestions that the time is coming for the party to coalesce around him. But nobody on the stage Wednesday night showed any willingness to give the former mayor any quarter.
No debate in this campaign began with more at stake "" and with more expectations that it could mark an important shift in the race. Bloomberg's presence on the stage was one big reason. But so, too, was the growing reality that Sanders built up significant momentum in the first two contests and is applying it to future contests in ways that could make him ever more difficult to stop.
Ahead of the debate, a dual sensibility permeated conversation among Democratic Party strategists. One, that only Bloomberg has the resources to compete as broadly on Super Tuesday and beyond as Sanders. Two, that all the other candidates competing to become the alternative to Sanders and who have been running for the past year were not willing to concede anything to a candidate who hasn't been on any of the first four ballots.
Bloomberg supporters have not hidden their belief that only he has the potential to stop Sanders and that, in a general election, he has the resources and the positioning to defeat Trump. As the debate showed, the other candidates see him right now as an intruder of uncertain Democratic Party lineage (much like Trump with the Republicans in 2016) and resent the unprecedented amounts of his own money he has poured into the campaign.
Those ingredients are likely to combine to boost Sanders, as many Democrats predicted on the night he narrowly won New Hampshire. With Sanders increasingly consolidating the left wing of the party and the non-Sanders supporters split among others in the field, the senator from Vermont has positioned himself to gain an advantage in pledged delegates over the next 40 days of competition.
Bloomberg, the newest candidate on the stage, came in for the harshest attacks, an unruly welcome to someone who has faced no serious scrutiny since announcing his candidacy. He often struggled to parry them effectively, particularly when challenged on his record on stop-and-frisk as mayor and when called on to release women who had signed nondisclosure agreements over workplace treatment at his company. 
But the attacks weren't limited to the billionaire former mayor. At one point or another, nearly everyone on the stage drew criticism from someone else. Sanders was criticized as too polarizing and for offering health-care and other proposals without a plan to pay for them.
The debate started with an explosion of attacks and rarely slowed down, with candidates vying to get into the fray and talking over one another so loudly at times that the moderators struggled to keep order. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, their candidacies facing fresh challenges, sparred with one another. Former vice president Joe Biden went after Bloomberg and Sanders. 
No one was more aggressive than Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who was nearly invisible at the New Hampshire debate two weeks ago and came to regret it. With her candidacy in jeopardy, she was relentless in attacks on Bloomberg's record. 
'Democrats are not going to win if we have a nominee who has a history of hiding his tax returns, of harassing women, and of supporting racist policies like redlining and stop-and-frisk,' Warren said in the opening minutes of the debate. 'Look, I'll support whoever the Democratic nominee is. But understand this: Democrats take a huge risk if we just substitute one arrogant billionaire for another.'
Bloomberg's presence on the stage added a new dynamic to a group of candidates who have gotten used to debating one another and often have avoided the kind of direct clashes that peppered the debate Wednesday night.
Bloomberg has focused his efforts on contests starting in March, while skipping the first four events that have reshaped the race. His spending and the results from Iowa and New Hampshire have helped him rise in national polls, a development that has triggered alarms and considerable resentment from the other candidates.
The pummeling of Bloomberg was expected, and the big question was how he would respond. At times, he fired back at his critics. At other times, he seemed to avoid jumping in when he came under fire.
Buttigieg warned Democrats that nominating either Bloomberg or Sanders would put the party at risk. 'We shouldn't have to choose between one candidate who wants to burn this party down and another candidate who wants to buy this party out,' he said.
On the issue of stop-and-frisk, Bloomberg repeated his pre-campaign apology for the policies he pursued as mayor. But when he tried to explain why he had sought to change the policy, Biden slammed him, claiming that it was only because of the intervention of the Obama administration and not because of Bloomberg's initiative.
During the debate, Bloomberg was attacked for operating a workplace hostile to women, for calling the Affordable Care Act a 'disgrace,' for failing so far to release his tax returns "" he said he is working on them "" and for having supported then-President George W. Bush in 2004.
Some of the most pointed exchanges, however, were between Klobuchar and Buttigieg. Their antagonism is not new, but the stakes have been raised by the tests they face in Nevada and South Carolina in proving they can appeal to a far more diverse electorate than in Iowa and New Hampshire.
The primary-season calendar is now a friend to Sanders. In past years, there has sometimes been more than a week between last of the early-state primaries and caucuses and Super Tuesday. This year, Super Tuesday follows South Carolina by three days. 
Other than Sanders or Bloomberg, no candidate has sufficient money to make a real dent in the Super Tuesday states, though some have worked to put organizations into place. 
The question of whether Sanders can be stopped and who might be able to do that might be getting ahead of the story, but the final moments of the debate showed how much this is at the center of the campaign.
The candidates were asked whether the person with the most pledged delegates, even if not a majority, should be rewarded with a first-ballot victory at the national convention or should the convention decide at that moment what to do. Everyone but Sanders said the convention should be allowed to work its will. Sanders stood alone on the other side. 
That is what awaits the Democrats in the coming months.

DES MOINES "" Four candidates were stuck in Washington, embroiled in the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump. Another, Joe Biden, delivered a speech that mentioned Trump an average of once every 17 seconds. Pete Buttigieg traveled to counties Trump won in 2016, trying to showcase his ability to win over the president's supporters.
And then, in the early evening, Trump himself arrived for a rally on the campus of Drake University here.
At a pivotal, potentially energizing moment for Democrats, preparing for the first votes of their long-awaited effort to unseat Trump, the presidential candidates found themselves Thursday reacting to his massive shadow rather than setting their own course. The scrambling reflected a deeper truth just four days before the Iowa caucuses: After four years of turmoil and anger, Democrats have yet to settle on the best path for defeating a president most of them consider the most damaging in memory.
To make matters worse, the contenders faced the prospect that the Senate vote on removing Trump could unfold at roughly the same time Monday night as Iowa caucus-goers begin assembling at their local precincts. And Trump will take center stage again Tuesday as he delivers the State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress, while Democrats absorb the caucus results and head to New Hampshire.
That's making this a highly unusual lead-up to the Iowa caucuses. With four candidates detained by the trial, several are relying heavily on allies or surrogates "" and in the case of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), also her dog "" to fill in on the campaign trail. Downtown Des Moines, normally a hive of activity in the days before the caucuses, was notably quiet Thursday.
With Trump on everyone's mind, Biden's speech, delivered at an elementary school in Waukee, was a blunt attempt to convey the contrast between Trump's tenure and the dignified presidency Biden hopes to embody. It marked a return to an earlier strategy of looking beyond the primary fight to the general election.
During his talk, lasting just under 19 minutes, Biden referred to Trump 64 times while ignoring his Democratic rivals. He criticized the president for withholding his tax returns, dismissing climate change, trying to abolish President Barack Obama's health-care law and failing to address gun violence. 
'I do not believe we're the dark, angry nation that Donald Trump sees in his tweets in the middle of the night,' Biden said. 'I look at Donald Trump and what he stands for, how he behaves, and what he's done. My response is always the same. America is so much better than this. So much better.'
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), after weeks of attacking Biden as insufficiently supportive of Social Security, turned his own fire on the president with a new television ad: 'Donald Trump wants to cut Social Security. We're not going to let that happen.' 
Warren, like Sanders, argues that the best way to take on Trump is to promote a far-reaching liberal agenda, making a case in the final days before Iowa that voters should not be 'afraid' to embrace big change. 
But from Washington, Warren taped an appearance with WHO-TV in Des Moines that focused more on the impeachment trial than that campaign message. 'We need to have a fair trial, and that means witnesses and documents,' Warren said, homing in on a topic that few Iowans have shown interest in discussing. 
She tried to contrast her plans to wrest power from special interests with Trump's governing style and willingness to reward supporters with influential positions.
'The way we're going to beat Donald Trump is to draw that distinction,' Warren said in the interview. 'I have the biggest corruption plan since Watergate and have been talking about this since the first day I got in the campaign.'
Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., stressed his role as a Washington outsider "" his own effort to distance himself from Trump as well as his Democratic rivals. In a significant shift Thursday, Buttigieg attacked Biden and Sanders by name, saying they represent political brands that Democrats must leave behind. 
'I hear Vice President Biden saying that this is no time to take a risk on someone new,' Buttigieg said during a morning stop in Decorah, Iowa. 'But history has shown us that the biggest risk we could take with a very important election coming up is to look to the same Washington playbook and recycle the same arguments and expect that to work against a president like Donald Trump, who is new in kind.'
Then he rebutted Sanders, whose name his campaign has used repeatedly in fundraising emails even as the candidate himself had avoided criticizing him by name until Thursday.
'I hear Senator Sanders calling for a kind of politics that says you got to go all the way here and nothing else counts. . . . We've got to galvanize, not polarize, that American majority so that we can win.'
Throughout the campaign, and more noticeably during his Iowa push in the past month, Buttigieg has avoided criticizing his opponents by name, even as they sometimes slid into high-profile squabbles around him. But Thursday, wearing a full suit instead of a shirt and tie, he made explicit references to his opponents instead of implications, and he acknowledged that time was running out to make his case.
Biden shot back later in the day, poking at the low vote totals required for Buttigieg to win a mayor's race in South Bend. 'Some things are self-evident when it comes to this,' Biden said, when asked at a Dairy Queen about his ability to do well in the caucuses. 'I've got more than 8,600 votes in my life.'
But the day also presented a jarring visual representation of the Democrats' challenge. Trump drew a passionate, raucous crowd of supporters that none of the candidates running against him has been able to match. It also yielded a foretaste of the months to come, when Democrats will have to vie for attention with a president who has proved uniquely adept at making himself the center of public attention and drama.

If Sanders and Warren stress the need for a powerful contrasting agenda, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), like Biden and Buttigieg, touts her ability to win over Trump voters.
'We really leaned into the electability argument because Amy's been so effective in doing well in blue, purple and red counties in Minnesota,' her campaign manager, Justin Buoen, said at a breakfast hosted by Bloomberg News. 
'That's why we've begun to pick up at the end, because that is what is on their mind: Who can actually deliver in November?' Buoen said. 
He stressed that Klobuchar has focused more than her rivals on the 31 Iowa counties that voted for Obama in 2012 and switched to Trump in the last election. 'Amy is willing to go in and face the questions in their community and learn about their community and talk to these voters where they are,' he said. 
Biden and his surrogates have been even more explicit, encouraging Iowans to become poll-readers and pundits and consider how battleground-state voters might act in the fall. In many of those states, Biden leads Trump in head-to-head polling. 
Biden said in his speech Thursday that he successfully campaigned on behalf of other Democrats across the nation in the last midterm elections.
'In 2018, I went to 24 states for 65 candidates,' he said. 'I took on Trump all over the country and beat him. In fact, we beat him like a drum "" and in the process took back the majority in the House. We should remember that this year.'
His own campaign has taken on a new sense of urgency in the closing days before Iowa, where Sanders leads with 23.8-percent support, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls. Biden is in second place with 20.2-percent, but time is running out to reach voters. 
Before Biden spoke at an event Wednesday night, a staffer warned his supporters that there were only about 100 hours before the first presidential votes are cast since 2016.

Sanders's dust-ups with Clinton and rivals raise 2016-style concerns

AMES, Iowa "" On Tuesday, when Democrats had hoped to focus Americans squarely on President Trump's impeachment trial, many in the party were instead watching in alarm and dismay as a fresh spat erupted between Hillary Clinton and the candidate she defeated in 2016, Sen. Bernie Sanders.
In comments published early Tuesday, Clinton left open the possibility that she might not support Sanders if he is the party's nominee. The remarks unleashed fresh angst less than two weeks before the Iowa caucuses amid a flurry of other attacks dividing the presidential candidates and their allies.
Sanders (I-Vt.) has been engaged in battles with rivals on various fronts over the past week "" squabbling with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) over whether he once said a woman could not be president, attacking former vice president Joe Biden with an out-of-context video about Social Security and issuing a rare apology after a top surrogate called Biden corrupt. 
The conflicts have reignited Democratic fears that, whoever becomes the nominee, the party will rupture as it did four years ago, when divisions between the Clinton and Sanders camps marred the primaries and the summer convention, and were blamed by many for contributing to her loss to Trump that November.
'Nobody wants to re-litigate 2016. I don't want Democrats focused on the last campaign; I want to focus on the next campaign,' said Terry McAuliffe, the former Virginia governor and former head of the Democratic National Committee. 'People have to check their attacks. We can't get in the mud pit where Donald Trump wants to be. Let's not be playing on his turf.'
'If Bernie is the nominee,' he added, 'everyone has to rally.'
Rebecca Katz, a liberal New York-based consultant, put the blame squarely on Clinton.
'This is bringing up old wounds,' Katz said. 'It's four years later, and the nominee in 2016 is not saying for certain whether they are going to support the nominee in 2020? That is unacceptable.'
Katz added: 'This is Hillary Clinton. She had to know how explosive these remarks would be. And she did it anyway. And she did it now.'
'There's enough post-traumatic stress out there already,' said former senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif). 'I think it's best if we just move forward. But everybody has a right to say what's in their heart.'
Clinton's comments, published just hours before Democrats began to make their case on impeachment in Washington and as several candidates launched a full day of campaigning here in Iowa, came in an interview promoting a documentary about her that will premiere at Sundance Film Festival on Saturday.
In the film, she offered a blunt assessment of Sanders, casting him as a career politician who has deceived his supporters into believing he could implement change.
'He was in Congress for years,' she said. '. . . Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done. He was a career politician. It's all just baloney, and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it.' 
When asked in the interview with the Hollywood Reporter if that assessment still held, she responded, 'Yes, it does.' Asked if she would support him if he won the nomination, she demurred, saying, 'I'm not going to go there yet. We're still in a very vigorous primary season. '
She also criticized the willingness of his supporters to antagonize his political rivals.
It's 'not only him, it's the culture around him,' she said. 'It's his leadership team. It's his prominent supporters. It's his online Bernie Bros and their relentless attacks on lots of his competitors, particularly the women. And I really hope people are paying attention to that because it should be worrisome that he has permitted this culture "" not only permitted, [he] seems to really be very much supporting it. And I don't think we want to go down that road again where you campaign by insult and attack and maybe you try to get some distance from it, but you either don't know what your campaign and supporters are doing or you're just giving them a wink.'
The comments triggered an outburst of criticism that flew across social media. Tommy Vietor, a former aide to President Barack Obama, tweeted that Clinton's comments were 'inexcusable' and the entire party needed to get behind the nominee, Sanders or not. 
'Don't kick up this . . . right before Iowa, especially after complaining about Bernie's lack of support in 2016,' he wrote, noting that he was 'TERRIFIED' about the party not being united in the general election.
A Clinton spokesman, Nick Merrill, responded to say that Clinton isn't committing to any candidate in the primary and pointed to her record of working for Democrats, including former opponents like Obama. 
'Let's all take a deep breath, give her the benefit of the doubt for once, - look at history,' he wrote on Twitter.
 

Clinton late Tuesday mocked the hubbub she had created and seemed to suggest support for Sanders if he is the nominee.
'I thought everyone wanted my authentic, unvarnished views!' she tweeted. 'But to be serious, the number one priority for our country and world is retiring Trump, and, as I always have, I will do whatever I can to support our nominee.'
Clinton's comments seemed to feed into a growing concern among more-moderate and establishment Democrats that Sanders, an enduring and energetic force if a polarizing one, could damage the party if he captured the nomination. Others, however, worried that the convulsion could further alienate Sanders's supporters, many of whom believe the 2016 race was stacked against him and fear the same happening in 2020. 
'No one loves Hillary Clinton more than I do, but those remarks are not helpful,' said Ed Rendell, the former Pennsylvania governor. 'Whoever wins, we have to get behind them. There's no time this year for Democrats to resolve old grievances.'


Jen Psaki, a veteran Democratic consultant and former top Obama aide, said that it was clear Clinton 'hasn't buried the hatchet, and she needs to bury the hatchet.' 
'There are a number of things that can simultaneously be true,' she said. 'One, she shouldn't have said it; two, it represents the view of many Democrats; and, three, he's always been underestimated.'
The Sanders style of campaigning has increasingly grated on Biden and his campaign, who view his tactics as unfair and out of bounds. Sanders's campaign aides promoted an out-of-context video of Biden that suggested he agreed with the proposals of then-House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) to cut Social Security. Sanders said over the weekend that he wished they had shown the fuller context but stood by his criticisms of other comments by Biden on entitlements.
On Monday, a top Sanders ally wrote an op-ed saying that 'Biden has a big corruption problem and it makes him a weak candidate.' Sanders apologized for the critique.
Some Democrats lamented that Sanders has not faced enough scrutiny, even as he has been repeatedly underestimated by some party leaders. 
'What Hillary is saying is a general concern I have and a lot of other people have, too,' said Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), a former presidential candidate who has endorsed Biden. 'Socialism and taking away people's private health care and, you know, all these things that make it very very difficult to beat Donald Trump in the industrial states we need to win. Hillary knows that better than anybody, how hard that is. To me, she's articulating a concern that a lot of us have.'
Besides his squabbles with Biden, Sanders also has exchanged barbs with Warren over her claim that Sanders told her during a private 2018 meeting that a woman wouldn't defeat Trump "" a claim Sanders has denied. The disagreement spilled onto the presidential debate stage last week. 
Although the disagreements left some Democrats quaking, others found a bright side. 
'I love it,' said Bakari Sellers, a former state legislator from South Carolina. 'Politics is a contact sport. Unfortunately, Democrats think politics is tiddlywinks, which is why we got drummed by Donald Trump, who plays by no rules. We have to get tougher.'
Other Democratic presidential candidates sought to gain advantage through comparison. The super PAC supporting Biden saw an opening to distinguish its candidate, releasing a new ad called 'The Storm' that shows choppy ocean waters amid text that reads, 'Joe Biden. A President to Right the Ship,' and says he's 'The Democrat Who Can Lead Through the Storm.'
Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, who has campaigned as someone who can turn the page on controversies of the past, reiterated that argument.
'I didn't love going through the experience of our party divisions in the past,' Buttigieg said in response to questions about Clinton. 'I'm focused now on making sure that the future is better.'
Until the recent battling, the 2020 race has been tame by comparison to 2016 "" a fact that some held on to. 
'In the immediate short term, all of these soap-operatic outbursts are a distraction,' said Robert Zimmerman, a top donor and DNC member from New York. 'Do I think it's going to prevent us from being united? I don't think so. But we have to be very disciplined about it. Because it wouldn't be the first time we saw a fight get out of control.'
In Iowa, a representative of those mostly too young to take part in the past disputes demanded that her elders cease the current ones.
'Everyone stop fighting about 2016 please thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!! No need for that!!!!!!!!!!! Our President is literally on trial right now!!!!!!!!! Focus on 2020!!!!!!!! Thank you!!!!!!!!!!' tweeted Olivia Habinck, president of the College and Young Democrats of Iowa.

Note of caution from AG: 'There are a lot of agendas in the Ukraine'

Attorney General William P. Barr acknowledged Monday that the Justice Department would evaluate material that Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump's personal attorney, had gathered from Ukrainian sources claiming to have damaging information about former vice president Joe Biden and his family "" though Barr and other officials suggested Giuliani was being treated no differently than any tipster.
At a news conference on an unrelated case, Barr confirmed an assertion made Sunday by Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) that the Justice Department had 'created a process that Rudy could give information and they would see if it's verified.'
Barr said he had established an 'intake process in the field' so that the Justice Department and intelligence agencies could scrutinize information they were given.
'That is true for all information that comes to the department relating to the Ukraine, including anything Mr. Giuliani might provide,' Barr said. He did not provide any other specifics.
A Justice Department official said Giuliani had 'recently' shared information with federal law enforcement officials through the process described by Barr. Two people familiar with the matter said the information is being routed to the U.S. attorney's office in Pittsburgh.

Biden is among the Democrats seeking to challenge Trump for the presidency. That Giuliani would have a direct pipeline to the Justice Department for providing information on a political rival of Trump raised fears among some legal analysts that federal law enforcement was being conscripted into doing campaign work for the president.
The matter is complicated, too, because Giuliani is under investigation by the Justice Department. That case already has produced campaign finance charges against two of his associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who helped in Giuliani's Ukraine-related pursuits.
Giuliani did not return a message seeking comment Monday.

Barr said Monday that the Justice Department had an 'obligation to have an open door to anybody who wishes to provide us information that they think is relevant,' though he said he told Graham: 'We have to be very careful with respect to any information coming from the Ukraine. There are a lot of agendas in the Ukraine. There are a lot of crosscurrents, and we can't take anything we receive from the Ukraine at face value.'
Barr said the intake process was established 'so that any information coming in about Ukraine could be carefully scrutinized by the department and its intelligence community partners so that we could assess its provenance and its credibility.'
FBI Deputy Director David Bowdich said: 'We're taking information as we would in any case. We will evaluate it appropriately.'
Justice Department and FBI officials regularly receive tips about alleged crimes. After receiving such information, it is up to agents and prosecutors to decide whether what they have been told merits opening an investigation.
Barr's announcement angered Democrats, who questioned whether Giuliani was getting special treatment from Trump's Justice Department.
The House Judiciary Committee chairman, Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), wrote to Barr on Monday saying that 'any official relationship between Mr. Giuliani and the Department raises serious questions about conflicts of interest "" both for the Department, generally, and for you, specifically.'
Former Justice Department counterintelligence official David Laufman tweeted: 'There is nothing normal about the Attorney General creating a special 'intake process in the field' for info relating to claims advancing a White House political narrative "" particularly for someone reportedly under criminal investigation.'
The Justice Department in the Trump administration has previously turned to U.S. attorneys outside Washington to look into GOP concerns. Barr tapped U.S. Attorney John Durham to examine the origins of the FBI's 2016 investigation of the Trump campaign.
Trump's first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, assigned John Huber, the U.S. attorney in Utah, to look into concerns that the FBI had not fully pursued cases of possible corruption at the Clinton Foundation, started by former president Bill Clinton, and during Hillary Clinton's time as secretary of state, when the U.S. government decided not to block the sale of a company called Uranium One.
Durham's investigation is ongoing, though Huber's review has effectively ended with no tangible results, according to people familiar with the matter.
It is not clear whether Scott W. Brady, the U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh, will play a similar role, or why his office was chosen. A spokeswoman for Brady's office declined to comment.
Trump and Giuliani have pressed the Ukrainians to investigate Biden and his son Hunter, who worked on the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father oversaw the Obama administration's Ukraine policy. In a phone call in July, Trump personally appealed to his presidential counterpart in Ukraine to work with Barr on the matter.
The call and the related pressure campaign led to Trump's impeachment in the Democratic-controlled House on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. He was acquitted in the Republican-controlled Senate.
Kerri Kupec, a spokeswoman for Barr, said previously in a statement that Trump had not spoken with Barr 'about having Ukraine investigate anything relating to former Vice President Biden or his son.'
The attorney general has complained privately about Giuliani's Ukraine-related efforts and has counseled Trump in general terms that Giuliani has become a liability for the administration, according to people familiar with the conversations.
But Giuliani has maintained access to the department and to Barr. Last year, Giuliani and other lawyers advocating on behalf of a Venezuelan businessman under investigation met privately with the head of the department's criminal division, and Barr dropped by the meeting, according to people familiar with the matter.

For his part, Graham, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, seemed to back off his assertions in recent weeks that he would conduct a Biden-related investigation.
Barr has tried to insulate the Justice Department from investigations that could affect the 2020 presidential election. Last week, he issued an internal memorandum instructing Justice Department and FBI employees that they must get approval from the department's leadership before opening an investigation of a presidential candidate, campaign, campaign staffer or adviser during the 2020 election year.
Durham, though, is continuing his investigation involving the 2016 campaign, and Kupec said previously that he was 'exploring the extent to which a number of countries, including Ukraine, played a role in the counterintelligence investigation directed at the Trump campaign during the 2016 election.' She added that 'certain Ukrainians who are not members of the government have volunteered information to Mr. Durham, which he is evaluating.'

COLUMBIA, S.C. "" In a tiny office space with fold-up furniture and 'Humanity First' posters on the wall, surrounded by local television cameras and about three dozen giddy volunteers in a markedly diverse range of ages and skin tones, Dave Chappelle picked out a phone number off a list and dialed.
The comedian was doing the unglamorous grunt work of phone banking last week on behalf of businessman Andrew Yang, the underdog Democratic presidential candidate whom Chappelle has endorsed.
A woman named Melissa improbably answered the unknown number and was also improbably cheerful about the whole thing. How would she rank Yang on a scale of one to five, 'one being crazy about him and five is kind of like, let's call it 'Trump,' ' Chappelle asked.
She responded 'one' "" a big fan. 'Okay!' he said. 'My name is Dave Chappelle. I'm a world-famous comedian.' Then he became perhaps the first phone banker in history to sign off a cold call not with goodbye but 'Wu Tang.'
The phalanx of journalists filming the whole thing burst out laughing.
But Chappelle wasn't there just for laughs. He'd been making the case for Yang in South Carolina, where he hosted two stand-up comedy fundraisers in hopes of urging voters to head to the polls for Yang in the state's crucial Feb.-29 primary.
Yang's signature campaign proposal is a universal basic income, or giving an $1,000 a month 'Freedom Dividend' to every American, forever. Chappelle sees him as the one person in the race whose policies could make an immediate difference in the lives of his neighbors in Dayton, Ohio, a third of whom live in poverty.
'You give a family like that $12,000 a year, or if there's two adults in the house, $24,000, that is going to put them in striking distance of the middle class,' Chappelle told the reporters in Columbia. 'I want health care and all of those things, but what good is health care without groceries?'
Chappelle, an iconoclastic black comedian being linked with an outsider candidate, who is also one of the first Asian Americans to make a viable bid for the presidency, is the kind of perfect, and perfectly odd, brand synergy that grabs headlines. And in a crowded field with Yang polling at 4 percent nationally, he could use the help.
Chappelle's not alone in finding a candidate to love. Numerous celebrities "" Ellen DeGeneres and Jennifer Aniston (former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg), Cardi B and Ariana Grande (Sen. Bernie Sanders ), and John Legend and Chrissy Teigen (Sen. Elizabeth Warren ) "" have jumped in with the idealistic, probably futile, hope that their support could move the needle.
The race for the Democratic nomination is still unsettled and crowded, plus the Iowa caucuses were a mess, and the New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina primaries are coming up any minute. Sunday's Academy Awards will probably feature stars using their acceptance speeches as political pulpits. Presidential endorsements are an extension of that activism, which is itself an extension of the way celebrities use their social media platforms to erase the boundaries between themselves and their followers.
'What's really important about celebrities is that they help to attract an audience,' said Jamal Simmons, a Democratic strategist who worked for the campaigns of Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. But, 'very few people will support a candidate because of a celebrity's endorsement.'
Perhaps the only instance in which there's empirical data that a big name made a big difference is Oprah Winfrey's endorsement of Obama in the 2008 election. A study suggests she gave him 1 million additional votes in the primaries and caucuses. The authors, economists from the University of Maryland, called it 'the Oprah effect.'
Even Oprah has her limits, though. She campaigned for Stacey Abrams in a tough Georgia gubernatorial race in 2018, which Abrams lost.
Then there are the times when celebrity endorsements go bad, such as when Clint Eastwood talked to an empty chair that was supposed to represent Obama while Eastwood was backing Mitt Romney at the 2012 Republican National Convention.
For now, Chappelle is making the most of his platform. He brought Yang onstage at his comedy show at Iowa State University in Ames two weeks before the caucuses and filmed a new campaign ad with Yang backstage. (Yang got 1 percent of the vote in Iowa as of Thursday.) 
Tickets for his two South Carolina shows "" in performing art centers holding more than 2,300 people "" were sold at $128 apiece as direct donations to Yang 2020. (The campaign wouldn't share fundraising numbers). In South Carolina, where black voters make up nearly two-thirds of the primary electorate, Chappelle appealed to African Americans by often mentioning that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. had made the case for a similar form of guaranteed income in 1967, shortly before he died.
The campaign says that just by showing up, he's boosting morale and helping recruit volunteers. 
'For a guy like me to be vocal about this type of thing, it's not really my jam,' Chappelle told reporters in Columbia. Yang is the first candidate Chappelle has endorsed. 'But I've got to do my civic duty. I don't like to say I'm telling people what to do. I'm just letting them know an option that I think is incredible so that it gets more attention, shine more light on it.'
Supporters as cliques

Maybe the point isn't that a celebrity's support matters at all in the polls, but they can help you match a candidate to your personality, like an electoral Myers-Briggs or love languages quiz.
Squint, and the camps of celebrities who've formed around the Democratic candidates in this 2020 race look a lot like lunch tables in a high school cafeteria. 
Sanders, the senator from Vermont, has the band, the chorus and the orchestra, plus all the kids who smoked under the bleachers and played in garage bands. His supporters joke that his roster is so big he could throw his own music festival, 'Berncella' or 'Bernaroo.' He had Bon Iver and Vampire Weekend play rallies in Iowa and soon the Strokes will headline a New Hampshire rally. Miley Cyrus, Jack White, Kim Gordon, Danny DeVito, Jack Nicholson and Killer Mike have endorsed, along with Phish. Even Tony! Toni! Toné! is on board.
Former vice president Joe Biden has cornered the debate team and straight-A athletes. John F. Kerry practically lives on his campaign bus. Michelle Kwan is on staff as surrogate director, with support from Vivica A. Fox, Tom Hanks and George R.R. Martin. (Okay, so this analogy isn't perfect.)
The artsy radical feminists who all got into Brown seem to flock to Warren, the senator from Massachusetts: Ashley Judd, who's been stumping in New Hampshire, Scarlett Johansson, Megan Rapinoe, Amy Schumer, Shonda Rhimes and Jonathan Van Ness of 'Queer Eye.' 
Buttigieg's celebrity endorsement vibe is straight out of 'Glee,' and the earnest, high-achieving activist kids who remind you to recycle, like Mandy Moore, Ben Harper, Gwyneth Paltrow, Michael J. Fox, Ryan Murphy (who actually created 'Glee'), Kevin Costner, and, an anomaly, Sharon Stone. 
The closest thing to a celebrity endorsement Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) gets is Phill Drobnick, who coached the men's U.S. Olympic curling team to a gold medal.
Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg has the whole disgruntled teacher's lounge: Judith Sheindlin (better known as Judge Judy), Michael Douglas, Sam Waterston, Tim Gunn, Isaac Mizrahi, John Mellencamp (who voiced an ad for him) and 'Sopranos' actress Lorraine Bracco.
Yang has the kids who stopped caring about cliques and are just waiting to get out of there and take over the world, like Chappelle, Donald Glover, 'The Walking Dead's' Steven Yeun, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and Elon Musk.
There's a danger that too much celebrity support will backfire and lead to the nominee being painted as in the pocket of the 'Hollywood liberal elite,' said GOP strategist Doug Heye, who noted that Hillary Clinton's star-studded final rallies "" Beyoncé, Bruce Springsteen, Lady Gaga "" looked like an overconfident victory lap to some voters. 
But the bigger question for Democrats in this general election is whether celebrity endorsements will make any traction at all when President Trump, who was a reality TV star, now has an infinite platform as the sitting president and all the inherent advantages of an incumbent. 'Remember, Donald Trump himself is the ultimate celebrity and sort of remains at the center of this race,' said Mark Harvey, author of 'Celebrity Influence: Politics, Persuasion, and Issue-Based Advocacy.' 'Like it or not, they're all dwarfed by him.'
The Democrats could announce a hundred more celebrity endorsements each, and, Simmons said, '[Trump] just gobbles up so much media coverage that your celebrity endorsement is maybe, like, a paragraph on A4.'
'Is this a sign?'

So if endorsing is somewhat futile, why and how do celebrities get involved?
For Mandy Moore, she saw Buttigieg speak early last year in Los Angeles and was so struck by his message of hope and unity that, she said, 'after that I wanted to do anything I could to support him and his campaign.'
What began as an introduction at an event here and there turned into campaigning in Louisiana, Iowa and Florida with Chasten, Pete's husband, which led to road trips and singalongs and a lasting friendship. Now she gets to do the second job of a surrogate, which is to show the human side of the candidate she supports.
'What always strikes me about the two of them is how dramatically their lives have changed over the course of the last year and yet how gracefully they adapted to those changes,' she says. 'They're so normal, which I know is a silly comment, but I love it.' 
Two-time Olympic figure skating medalist Kwan was always leaning toward Biden because she knew him from working in the State Department under Obama and as a surrogate on Clinton's 2016 campaign. Then she took a trip to the District just before he announced and not only met Biden's future campaign manager, Greg Schultz, by chance through a friend, but also sat next to Jill, his wife, on her plane back to Los Angeles. It was a total accident.
'So,' Kwan said. 'I kind of went, 'Is this a sign?' ' Now she is Biden's director of surrogates, a unique position that means she's both in charge of recruiting other surrogates and being one herself. And yes, there are ice-skating events. 
Sally Field has actually never met Warren, but after watching the first seven debates decided to go with her gut and pick the woman, she says, who 'has the clearest plan to address the symptoms that led to the election of Donald Trump.'
As soon as she made up her mind, her son, Sam, contacted the campaign, which put Field's tweet language into a Warren-approved endorsement graphic.
Field worried that her celebrity might make it hard to help the campaign in the way she wants "" given that Warren's message is about the working class.
'I'm a citizen and I don't want to be excluded from the process of helping just because I happen to be an actor,' Field said. 'I [said to Warren's campaign], 'Look, I can hide the fact that I'm an actor. Trust me! I look like a schlub when I go to the market.'
Why Chappelle is Yang Gang

As for Chappelle, he says he found out about Yang when he asked a friend who he liked in the first debate, and, the friend responded, ''I liked the Chinese guy.'' Chappelle thought he was joking. (Yang is Taiwanese American.)
Then months later, as Chappelle's Netflix comedy special came out, friends started sending him Yang's tweet saying that Chappelle was his favorite comedian. It so happened that that very week, a neighbor gave him a copy of Yang's book, 'The War on Normal People.' He read it and immediately asked his wife to reach out to Yang's campaign. They met up after the December debate in Los Angeles and ended up connecting over their children and their concern for the country's future. It was Chappelle's idea to do a few shows for fundraising and the campaign's idea to have him phone bank.
When Chappelle left the Yang 2020 field office in Columbia recently, he made sure to wear his brand-new blue MATH hat, one of Yang's slogans, and his answer to Trump's MAGA hats: Make America Think Harder.
Chappelle knows Yang's chances are slim, but he pointed out that 'there was a senator from Illinois one time, and people didn't think he could do it.' Given the overwhelming amount of prejudice in the country, Chappelle said, he found Yang inspiring. 'It's inspiring to see someone have the courage to do something that seems unlikely and just be like, 'why not?' And I'm a big fan of 'Why not?''
Besides, it's time for new blood, the comedian added: 'My daughter is 10. Trump is her first white president. She thinks the whites are doing a terrible job!'

Of all the lessons the mainstream media should-have learned over the past four years, one of them is inexcusably obvious: We're bad at predictions.
Who can forget poll analyses, the infographic needles, the endless columns-and pundit panels that confidently projected that Hillary Clinton would be the next president?
 In fact, it was that very certainty that drove much of the damaging and excessive coverage of her email practices. (Because she was all but certainly the next president, went the flawed thinking, we should get started now on showing we'll be tough on her.)
Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank was so sure, in late 2015, that Donald Trump would fail to get the Republican nomination that he promised to eat his printed column if he was wrong. (An honorable man, he followed through.)
But my colleague was far from alone. And the following year, most media people were stunned by Trump's winning the presidency.
And yet, we roll on today, with very little having changed.
The Iowa caucuses, according to many a commentator, surely would come down to a fight between Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. As we know now, it didn't work out that way: Biden finished a lackluster fourth and the photo finish with Sanders involved Pete Buttigieg.
Oh, and surely, we heard many times, voter turnout at the caucuses would be high, signaling the voters' intense desire to replace President Trump with a Democrat. Well, that didn't happen either. Turnout was flat.
Journalists "" reporters and opinionators alike "" just aren't very good at this. Yet they go on doing it, in part because there's so little accountability in political journalism.
'There's no penalty for being wrong. You can just blithely go on making another evidence-free prediction with no consequences,' Columbia University journalism professor William Grueskin said.
He added that it wouldn't work that way in, say, business reporting: If you predicted that 'XYZ Corp will lose $100 million' and then XYZ reported a $250-million profit, 'much of your audience would have a hard time taking you seriously again.'
Part of the problem is our endless desire to frame politics as a horse race. Rather than focus on what's most important to the public interest, political coverage focuses far too heavily on who's up and who's down "" an elusive metric that requires data such as polls and fundraising numbers.
But these things are far from a reliable basis for prediction. What's worse, many journalists don't understand basic notions underlying polling, as data-oriented journalist Nate Silver has emphasized over the years: 'Media understanding about probability, margin of error and uncertainty is very poor.'
If a candidate has an 80-percent chance of winning a race, no one should be surprised if he or she loses. The use of predictive phrases such as 'all but inevitable' should be confined to instances where the chances of a candidate's election are more like 98-percent, he says. (Silver has become more careful since he infamously stated during the 2016 presidential primary season that Trump's candidacy shouldn't be taken seriously. When proved wrong, he followed up by publishing a mea culpa about what went wrong in his thinking, and he was more accurate than most about Trump's chances in the general election.)
Silver's organization, FiveThirtyEight, remains solidly in the horse-race business but with a greater effort now to explain probability and to resist the urge to walk out onto flimsy limbs.
As for me, I'm officially done with making predictions, after flubbing one in mid-2017. New York magazine asked me, along with 12 others "" journalists, academics and political types "" to predict whether Trump would make it through his first term.
Some respondents posited that he'd be gone by now, for various reasons; others were convinced that he would survive and thrive. I managed to get one thing right: that Trump would make it through his first term, but I predicted that he would choose not to run again "" and that Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) would become the first female president. (I'll note in my own defense that this was before she led the charge that brought about Al Franken's resignation as the junior senator from Minnesota.)
Since then, I refuse to predict "" not in print, not in interviews, and not even in informal conversations with friends and family members. 
In a recent MSNBC appearance, the author Anand Giridharadas suggested that, given their generally lousy records, media people should quit the prognosticating game. He put it simply and correctly: 'I don't think it is our job as journalists to predict.'
As we head deeper into the presidential primary season, with all of its temptations, it's high time to heed that advice.

DES MOINES ""
Linda Nelson, a 68-year-old retired elementary school teacher in Council Bluffs, received a notice over the weekend that a new version of the mobile app she would use three days later for Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses was ready for her to test. 
But when Nelson downloaded the software on her smartphone, she couldn't figure out how to log in. She tried one PIN number. She tried the ID for the precinct she would be chairing in the western Pottawattamie County. She tried another PIN number. 'Nothing works!' Nelson wrote in an email to the state party.
Her problems were replicated across the state on Monday, as precinct leaders failed to access the app or reported being locked out as they sought to punch in numbers to report them to state party officials. In one especially stark example, just one precinct leader in all of Scott County, which is part of the Quad Cities region, was able to successfully use the software, according to the county's Democratic Party chair.
The technical setbacks generated mass confusion that played out on live television Monday night, turning the Democrats' much-anticipated, first-in-the-country presidential nominating contest into a global embarrassment "" leaving an international audience in the dark and putting another blemish on the United States' democratic system.
By Tuesday, as state party officials began to release some of the results while apologizing for the failure, the debacle fueled calls for Iowa to relinquish its coveted status at the top of the presidential nomination calendar. 
Attention focused on the state's arcane voting system, illustrated by viral images of intricate caucus math worksheets used to allocate delegates at about 1,700 caucus sites. And it provided fodder for prominent allies of President Trump, including his campaign manager and his adult sons, to question the legitimacy of the Democratic contest. Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) took to Twitter to suggest without evidence that last-minute uncertainty was engineered to damage Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
Some explanations for the meltdown began to emerge "" including the fact that many precinct organizers had not been able to adequately test the app designed for reporting results to party headquarters. But questions also remained about why the state party chose Shadow, a Democratic-aligned start-up, for such a high-stakes moment.
The app had been rolled out for testing in mid-January, just weeks before the caucuses. The delay was intentional, according to a state party official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. 
Iowa Democrats waited to introduce the software to avoid giving potential hackers time to penetrate it, the official said, adding that the party chose to keep the name of the vendor secret on the advice of national cybersecurity consultants.
In the end, the problem on caucus night was not a hack. Nor could it be explained alone by difficulty in downloading the software. 
It was a more basic coding error that caused the problems. When caucus leaders started successfully reporting data through the app, a separate system also developed by Shadow collated the information but spit out only partial results, according to a person familiar with the events.
State party officials soon discovered the coding error, which would delay the final count by more than a day and raise new questions about the judgment of party heads.
State party leaders insisted that the vote count itself was not affected.
'This was a coding error in one of the pieces on the back end,' said Troy Price, the chairman of the Iowa Democratic Party. 'But the raw data, the data that has come in, is secure.'
Still, the technical failures became another damaging flash point for Democrats, who were subject to hacks and disinformation in 2016, when Russian nationals penetrated party servers as part of a scheme to interfere in the presidential race. 
The Nevada Democratic Party, which had planned to use the same software for its Feb.-22 caucuses, said Tuesday that it would forgo the app.
Iowa was caught in suspended confusion, with former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg declaring victory Monday night before formal results were released and Sanders predicting a strong finish for himself. Meanwhile, an attorney for the campaign of former vice president Joe Biden, who was in fourth place based on initial results released Tuesday, wrote a letter to state party officials citing 'considerable flaws' in the caucus reporting system. 
Unfounded conspiracy theories coursed through social media, pushed by Trump allies as well as backers of Democratic hopefuls, as Iowa party leaders struggled to salvage confidence in the vote. 
'Even though the reporting was a hitch, there is no hint of and there hasn't been any skulduggery, intrigue or scalawagging,' said David Nagle, a former state party chair who helped lead caucus planning after the 2016 election. 'The party was faced with a quandary: Do we throw numbers out there, or do we get it right?'
Tuesday brought new scrutiny to Shadow, the technology company registered in Colorado that developed the software and is led by veterans of Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The company was founded as Groundbase in 2017 and rebranded in 2019 with a major investment from Acronym, a nonprofit digital outfit with an affiliated political action committee. 
Shadow received about $154,000 from federal campaign committees, state parties and politically active groups in 2019, Federal Election Commission records show. Among its biggest clients was For Our Future, an independent operation supporting Democrats, which paid the company more than $10,600 for 'digital communications.' 
Democratic campaigns hired the firm, as well, to help with fundraising and digital communications, including the campaigns of Buttigieg, Biden and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, who dropped out of the race last year.
Biden's campaign dropped Shadow after the former vice president's IT team raised concerns about the software it was providing for sending text messages, according to a spokesman for the campaign.
Shadow released a statement Tuesday on Twitter expressing regret for the delay in Iowa and saying the underlying technical issue had been corrected.
In 2016, the state party used an app developed by Microsoft.

Iowa Democrats paid Shadow about $63,000 in two installments in November and December, records show. Nevada also made payments through the end of last year. 
'Back in late 2019, they said there would be an app coming out,' said Steven Drahozal, the Democratic chairman in Dubuque County. Beyond the instructions that accompanied the app's rollout, he added, there was little training from the state party on how to use it. 
A spokeswoman for the state party, Mandy McClure, said there were office hours during which precinct leaders could call in for help. 
'This was way too hurried,' said David Jefferson, a computer scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who has counseled the national party on technology issues and said experts had warned about risks posed by a mobile app for recording results. 'They couldn't possibly have enough testing time, and they couldn't possibly test it at scale.'
A spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, Heather Swift, said that the department's Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency had offered to test the app for the state party but that leaders in Iowa declined. Price, in response, said the party's 'systems were tested by independent cybersecurity consultants.' He added Tuesday that he was not aware of the DHS offer.
In some areas, difficulty installing the app or completing verification with a PIN led county officials to tell their volunteers to rely on calling in their results. As Monday night wore on, the phone lines at the state party were overwhelmed. 
'When our chairs are calling, it's a wait time of an hour and a half or two hours,' said Sean Bagniewski, the chairman of the Polk County Democratic Party. 'In some cases, they have dropped the call.' 
In Johnson County, one caucus site leader who finally got through passed around a phone with an open line so other chairs could report their results, according to Brian Deese, a party volunteer who witnessed the cooperation. 'Pretty much everybody defaulted to phone lines, and it got jammed,' he said. 
At one point, Judy Downs, the executive director of the Polk County party, took photos on her phone of the final results at multiple caucus sites and drove over to the state party headquarters, where she was turned away, Bagniewski said. 
Before the caucuses, the Democratic National Committee had boasted about its efforts to help state parties such as Iowa secure their election processes against hacking and other manipulation. Iowa Democrats scrapped plans for 'virtual caucuses' "" which would have allowed Iowans to participate by phone "" after national leaders moved to block them in August, warning of cybersecurity threats.

write two lines right here 
STOP write More than 8 in 10 view president as racist
Pessimism runs deep, poll shows 
President perceived to have emboldened racists


President Trump made a stark appeal to black Americans during the 2016 election when he asked, 'What have you got to lose?' Three years later, black Americans have rendered their verdict on his presidency with a deeply pessimistic assessment of their place in the United States under a leader seen by an overwhelming majority as racist.
The findings come from a Washington Post-Ipsos poll of African Americans nationwide, which reveals fears about whether their children will have a fair shot to succeed and a belief that white Americans don't fully appreciate the discrimination that black people experience.
While personally optimistic about their own lives, black Americans today offer a bleaker view about their community as a whole. They also express determination to try to limit Trump to a single term in office.

More than 8 in 10 black Americans say they believe Trump is a racist and that he has made racism a bigger problem in the country. Nine in 10 disapprove of his job performance overall. 
The pessimism goes well beyond assessments of the president. A 65 percent majority of African Americans say it is a 'bad time' to be a black person in America. That view is widely shared by clear majorities of black adults across income, generational and political lines. By contrast, 77 percent of black Americans say it is a 'good time' to be a white person, with a wide majority saying white people don't understand the discrimination faced by black Americans.

Courtney Tate, a 40-year-old elementary school teacher in Irving, Tex., outside Dallas, said that since Trump was elected, he's been having more conversations with his co-workers "" discussions that are simultaneously enlightening and exhausting "" about racial issues he and his students face every day. 

 'As a black person, you've always seen all the racism, the microaggressions. But as white people, they don't understand this is how things are going for me,' said Tate, who said he is the only black male teacher in his school. 'They don't live those experiences. They don't live in those neighborhoods. They moved out. It's so easy to be white and oblivious in this country.'
Francine Cartwright, a 44-year-old mother of three from Moorestown, N.J., said the ascent of Trump has altered the way she thinks about the white people in her life. 
'If I'm in a room with white women, I know that 50 percent of them voted for Trump and they believe in his ideas,' said Cartwright, a university researcher. 'I look at them and think, 'How do you see me? What is my humanity to you?' '


The president routinely talks about how a steadily growing economy and historically low unemployment have resulted in more African Americans with jobs and the lowest jobless rate for black Americans recorded. Months ago, he said, 'What I've done for African Americans in two and a half years, no president has been able to do anything like it.' 
Those factors have not translated positively for the president. A 77-percent majority of black Americans say Trump deserves 'only some' or 'hardly any' credit for the 5.5-percent unemployment rate among black adults, compared with 20-percent who say Trump deserves significant credit. 
In follow-up interviews, many said former president Barack Obama deserves more credit for the improvement in the unemployment rate, which declined from a high of 16.8-percent in 2010 to 7.5-percent when he left office. 
Others said their personal financial situation is more a product of their own efforts than anything the president has done. 
'I don't think [Trump] has anything to do with unemployment among African Americans,' said Ethel Smith, a 72-year-old nanny who lives in Lithonia, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta. 'I've always been a working poor person. That's just who I am.'
 

Black Americans report little change in their personal financial situations in the past few years, with 19-percent saying it has been getting better and 26-percent saying it has been getting worse. Most, 54-percent, say their financial situation has stayed the same. 
A similar 56-percent majority of African Americans rate the national economy as 'not so good' or 'poor,' contrasting with other surveys that find most Americans overall rate the economy positively, although there are sharp political divides on this question. 
Beyond questions about the economy, African Americans see a range of concerns impacting the country overall as well as their own communities. 
Just 16-percent of black Americans believe that most black children born in the United States today have 'a good opportunity to achieve a comfortable standard of living.' A 75-percent majority think most white children have such an opportunity. 
More than 8 in 10 say they do not trust police in the United States to treat people of all races equally, and 7 in 10 distrust police in their own communities. 
Black Americans also widely sense that their experiences with discrimination are underappreciated by white Americans. Just about 2 in 10 say that most white Americans understand the level of discrimination black Americans face in their lives. 

The starkly negative outlook appears to be a turnabout from previous points during both the Obama and George W. Bush presidencies, according to surveys that asked related questions. A 2011 Washington Post-Kaiser Family Foundation survey found 73-percent of black women said it was a 'good time' to be a black woman in America, while a similar survey in 2006 found 60-percent of black men saying it was a good time to be a black man. 
Yet the Post-Ipsos poll also finds that 65-percent of black Americans say they feel optimistic about their own lives most or all of the time. This positive personal outlook crosses age and political groups. While it peaks among those who are older and with higher incomes, roughly half of black Americans with incomes under $35,000 annually say they feel optimistic about their lives. 
Dana Clark, a father of 11 in Ontario, Calif., said he tells all of his children that it's possible to succeed in America, but that they'll have to work harder than the white children they encounter. 
'I tell them we're going to set this plan up. Whatever you want to do, you're going to be able to do it,' he said. 'But it ain't going to be easy, especially if [you] want to make some money because you're going to be in a world where they're not going to expect you to be there. You can get what you want, but you've got to work harder, faster and stronger.' 
The survey, by The Post and Ipsos, a nonpartisan research firm, is one of the most extensive recent surveys focused on views of the country and Trump among black Americans, who are often represented by only small samples in customary national polls. It was conducted among 1,088 non-Hispanic black adults, including 900 registered voters, drawn from a large online survey panel recruited through random sampling of U.S. households. 
Few black voters responded positively to Trump's campaign appeal for their votes. Exit polls taken during the 2016 election showed just 8-percent of African Americans supported Trump and 89-percent backed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, although black turnout was significantly lower than in 2008 and 2012 for the election and reelection of Obama, the country's first black president. 

In the Post-Ipsos poll, roughly three-quarters of black adults say the things that Trump is doing as president are 'bad for African Americans,' while a similar majority 

says Obama's actions as president were good. 
Kenneth Davis, a truck driver who lives outside Detroit, said that when Trump was elected, co-workers who secretly harbored racist thoughts felt emboldened to publicly express them. 
'One gentleman is waving the Confederate flag on the back of his pickup truck,' said Davis, 48, who is a Marine Corps veteran. 'He was very brave to say, 'Trump's president, I'm going to get my window [painted].' '
Retired federal prison Warden Keith Battle said the political climate has exposed 'unresolved racial issues' and that Trump has emboldened white supremacists. Battle, who lives in Wake Forest, N.C., said white supremacists 'are not the majority of whites in America, but there is a significant amount still, I'd say 30-percent, and I think they're just leading the country down a path of, eventually, chaos. They're feeling jeopardized of losing their white privilege.'
Survey respondents were asked to say how Trump's presidency has affected them personally or African Americans in general. The responses illuminated the data in the poll. 
'Donald Trump has not done anything for the African American people,' said one person.
'He has created an atmosphere of division and overt racism and fear of immigrants unseen in many years,' said another.
A third said, 'He has taken hatred against people of color, in general, from the closet to the front porch.'
Others echoed that sentiment, saying that the president has emboldened those with racially prejudiced views and therefore set back race relations for years. 'I sense a separation between myself and some of my white associates,' one person wrote.
Trump's overall approval rating among black Americans stands at 7-percent, with 90-percent disapproving, including 75-percent who disapprove 'strongly.' 
Similarly large majorities of black men and women disapprove of Trump, as do black Americans across different age, education and income levels. Trump receives somewhat higher marks among self-identified black conservatives, with 25-percent approving of his performance, compared with 5-percent of moderates and 3-percent among liberals. 
Few black Americans appear open to supporting Trump's bid for reelection at this point. He receives between 4 and 5-percent support among black registered voters in head-to-head matchups against eight potential Democratic nominees. But the level of Democratic support depends on who is the party's nominee, peaking at 82-percent for former vice president Joe Biden and falling to 57-percent for former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg.
The Post-Ipsos survey was conducted Jan. 2-8 through Ipsos's KnowledgePanel, a large online survey panel recruited through random sampling of U.S. households. Overall results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points among the sample of 1,088 black adults overall and four points among the sample of 900 registered voters.

Democrats on Thursday seized on a new report citing unredacted emails that bolster the case that President Trump was directly involved in withholding military aid to Ukraine as he was seeking investigations that could benefit his reelection bid.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) joined Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) in pressing for key witnesses and documents to be included in a Senate impeachment trial of Trump following the report.
Senate leaders remained at an impasse Thursday over the scope of a trial, and aides to Schumer and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said the two men had not spoken over the holidays about the standoff. Pelosi has held off sending the articles of impeachment "" alleging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress "" to the Senate as Democrats seek guarantees about witnesses and documents that will be subpoenaed regarding Trump's conduct toward Ukraine.
The report by Kate Brannen, published by Just Security, referenced an email from Michael Duffey, associate director of national security programs at the Office of Management and Budget, to Elaine McCusker, the acting Pentagon comptroller, on Aug. 30, a little more than a month after Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for investigations during a phone call.
In the email, which followed a meeting with Trump that included senior administration officials, Duffey told McCusker, 'Clear direction from POTUS to hold.'
A redacted version of that email "" and several others cited in the report by Brannen, a veteran Pentagon reporter "" had previously been made public as the result of Freedom of Information Act litigation. 
'The newly-revealed unredacted emails are a devastating blow to Senator McConnell's push to have a trial without the documents and witnesses we've requested,' Schumer said in a statement Thursday. 'These emails further expose the serious concerns raised by Trump administration officials about the propriety and legality of the president's decision to cut off aid to Ukraine to benefit himself.'
Schumer has sought guarantees from McConnell that several administration officials who declined to participate in House impeachment proceedings will be subpoenaed to testify in a Senate trial, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, former national security adviser John Bolton and Duffey. McConnell has said the Senate should decide on what if any witnesses to call after hearing opening statements from House impeachment managers and Trump's lawyers.
Schumer said the unredacted emails raise 'questions that can only be answered by having the key Trump administration officials . . . testify under oath in a Senate trial.'
'The American people deserve a fair trial that gets to the truth, not a rigged process that enables a cover-up,' Schumer said.
At the heart of the Democrats' case is the allegation that Trump tried to leverage a White House meeting and $391-million in congressionally appropriated military aid, sought by Ukraine to combat Russian military aggression, to pressure Zelensky to launch an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden, a 2020 presidential candidate, and his son Hunter Biden, as well as a probe of an unfounded theory that Kyiv conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 presidential election.
In a tweet, Pelosi said, 'Trump engaged in unprecedented, total obstruction of Congress, hiding these emails, all other documents, and his top aides from the American people. His excuse was a phony complaint about the House process. What's the excuse now? Why won't Trump - McConnell allow a fair trial?'

House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) said in a statement that the messages show that the White House 'cannot argue that the aid was held for any reason other than to pressure Ukraine into helping the President's re-election efforts.'

As the Democratic primaries take off, stock market prognosticators are handicapping the race for the White House. Will Mike Bloomberg be good for stocks? Will Sen. Amy Klobuchar or Joe Biden?
Superficially, it sounds compelling. Bloomberg certainly made a ton of money in Bloomberg LP, the software and media firm that catapulted his political career.
More broadly, Bloomberg cares about business. Like Klobuchar, Biden and others in the dwindling breed of Democratic moderates, they've refused to sign on to the progressive drumbeat demonizing corporations. 
Here's some advice: If anyone says a particular candidate (including President Trump) will be good for your portfolio, head for the hills. 
Election gurus don't know who is going to win any more than you do. And even if they did, it would tell you nothing about the stock market.
The most pro-free-enterprise president in recent memory "" a businessman himself "" was George W. Bush. Oops. By the time he left office in 2009, the market (as measured by the Dow Jones industrial average, as throughout) had tumbled 26-percent. Barack Obama, Bush's successor, had never met a payroll and was not above saying unkind things about CEOs. He was loathed by investment managers, and some of them still gripe to me that he was a socialist. Kind of ungrateful, I would say, because under 'Comrade Obama' the market vaulted 148-percent.
Bush and Obama each had to deal with the fallout from the mortgage bubble, and their policies weren't much different. Each supported federal bailouts of banks and automakers, and each supported ultralow interest rates and higher capital ratios for banks. Although Bush's rhetoric and inclinations were far more conservative than Obama's "" no one dreamed that Bush would be investing federal money in private banks "" the policies of each were determined by an unforeseen event (the crash), which mattered more than where they stood on an ideological spectrum. 
Candidates' political leanings rarely translate neatly into policy. Some presidents do stuff that seems 'anti-business' (such as George H.W. Bush's 1990 tax hike) but helps the economy in the long term. Sometimes free-enterprise types, like the younger Bush, are forced by a crisis to intervene. And sometimes, once in office, they discover an unknown affection for big government, a la Richard M. Nixon, who started his career on the far right and as president in 1971 imposed wage and price controls. 
Historically, there is no correlation between a successful candidate's pro-business sentiments and subsequent market performance. You could even argue there is a negative correlation, because over the past century (not counting 2020), the market has risen 14.4-percent per year in the 48 years when Democrats were in office, and 10.1-percent during 51 Republican years.
There are two reasons for the disconnect. First, the four-year presidential term is unrelated to the business cycle. Gerald Ford, who succeeded Nixon in 1974, didn't accomplish much, but he had the good fortune to enter office at the trough of a recession. Result: The Ford market rose 40-percent. Calvin Coolidge was way luckier. He exited the stage in March 1929, just months before the Great Depression. Coolidge investors earned 230-percent but "" honestly "" how many of them got out before the following October? 
Second, and more importantly, stock prices respond to variables that are only marginally under presidential control. This was extremely fortunate for investors during the golden era of Warren G. Harding, whose administration was rocked by a recession and the Teapot Dome scandal, and who nonetheless gifted investors, in his brief two years, with a positive 23-percent return. Perhaps in the 1920s, Democrats were confused that the market rose under Harding "" a genial mouther of platitudes and not much else. 
The dirty secret is that the market is not a referendum on presidential policies, nor on presidential character. Many in my bluest-of-blue neighborhood in Cambridge, Mass., have wondered, 'If Trump is so awful, why is the market up 46-percent?'
The market is not a retributionist god who punishes narcissistic tweeters. It does not punish the profligate or (except very rarely) the reckless. It is not a barometer of morality. 
It does not reward you for being right about the anti-Iranian airstrike s; by the time the aircraft have returned to base, traders are on to something else. And the market does not conform to a political narrative "" nor to any other narrative. It is not a stage on which, finally in Act 3, some hidden truth emerges and the guilty are punished. Trying to discern such a narrative is not a fruitful way to invest. 
Stocks, simply, are discounting machines; they put a present value on future earnings. Overwhelmingly, stock prices respond over longish periods to two variables, earnings and interest rates. No one who invested in Microsoft when it went public in 1986 says, 'Thank God, I invested under Ronald Reagan.' No offense to the Gipper, but he had nothing to do with it. 
Microsoft's earnings have consistently risen over three-plus decades. That's why the stock had been a home run. Like every other investment, it has also benefited from steadily falling interest rates. (The lower the rate, the greater the present value of future earnings.)
What happens to earnings and interest rates will be more important, if you're viewing the election through a mercenary lens, than who wins Iowa in the Democratic caucuses on Feb. 3.
Investing truths are always easier to see on a smaller scale. If you were thinking of putting money into a new business "" maybe a friend has an app "" you wouldn't say, 'Let's wait for Iowa.' 
Whether that app succeeds will not depend on the election. It's not much different for big corporations. If they do a good job selling products and staying ahead of the competition, and if you don't pay a crazy price for their stock, you'll do okay. 
Of course, presidents have some effect. The Trump tax cuts provided a one-year boost, but they were offset by the disguised tax of the Trump tariffs. And be careful about crediting a particular president for policies that might have happened anyway. Before Trump, quite a few Democrats (Obama included) supported a corporate tax cut. Going forward, there is less support for unbridled capitalism and global trade than in a long time. Both parties have turned populist, which will be true no matter who wins. 
Sen. Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist, scares a lot of people. He scares me, too. But the party is tacking left. Biden, the front-running moderate, and Sanders both support an increase in public health-care benefits, an increase in the minimum wage to $15, some years of free college and an increase in the capital gains tax. There are important differences, but four years from now, they are likely to be overwhelmed by events we can't predict. 
Something will happen to jolt the market in the next term (it always does). And the president, whoever she or he is, will have to respond. In the next term, as wages continue to rise, the Federal Reserve will worry more about inflation than many people now realize. That will put pressure on interest rates. And stocks will start the term (assuming there is no break first) in nosebleed territory (24.6 times earnings). 
So I would pay attention to prices and earnings, and, when it comes to your portfolio, ignore the polls. If we elect a good person for the country, the market will do fine, or as well as it can. If you are still hooked on a pro-business candidate, remember: The most pro-business, and indisputably the most prepared, candidate ever elected was a millionaire former mining executive and secretary of commerce. His name was Herbert Hoover.

Technology - specifically the Internet - has upended primaries, robbing parties of power, just as it has upended almost everything else. There's no going back to the days when ""the party"" could stop an insurgent candidate. Good or bad, that's reality. 
Donald Trump's takeover of the Republican Party in 2016 proved that the GOP is spent as a candidate-selecting force. An insurgent from outside the party, armed with a bellicose Twitter account, demolished the establishment - which then lined up behind him.
The Democratic Party's power to choose its nominee is over, too. There are many reasons for this, but the biggest change has been the rise of small-donor money.
Once, if the party's big-dinner donors all moved behind the establishment front-runner, the front-runner was guaranteed to become the nominee. That all changed with Howard Dean's campaign, which I managed in 2004. With very primitive online fundraising tools, we broke the record for the most money raised by a Democrat to that point. The establishment rallied to stop Dean, and won. But four years later, Barack Obama rolled over the pro-Clinton establishment, raising close to half a billion dollars from small online donations. In 2020, Joe Biden's reliance on the establishment donor base puts him at a disadvantage relative to candidates who can outraise him online (not to mention the billionaires).
Voters hold the power now. But the one area where a party can exert some control is its primary calendar. If the first primary had been in South Carolina, not Iowa, we might be talking about a Joe Biden-Kamala Harris race. Here's the challenge: How do we offer an early contest that allows someone like Pete Buttigieg to come out of nowhere but is also diverse enough to be representative of the nation? 
I propose that the first ""primary"" should not be held in a state or a regional group of states. Rather, clusters of three congressional districts in three different regions of the country would be the sites of the first contest. Ideally, the clusters would be in areas Democrats need to win in a general election. So in the Southwest, three congressional districts from Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico would make up one cluster; in the Midwest, it would be districts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio; and in the Southeast, the districts might be drawn from North Carolina, Georgia and Florida. These places would all hold primaries on the same day in February. Nine congressional districts would be small enough to give a dark-horse contender a chance to break out, yet the results might also help voters measure the strength of the candidates across three regions.
It may not be perfect, but it's better than what we've got.

Talk-show hosts ask whether voters would elect an openly gay man 


Allies of President Trump have sharply focused attention on the sexual identity of presidential contender Pete Buttigieg in recent days, questioning in stark terms whether Americans are ready for a gay candidate who kisses his husband onstage. 
The attacks are prompting blunt responses from Buttigieg's allies and even his Democratic rivals, who call the remarks inappropriate and offensive. The exchanges were ignited by radio host Rush Limbaugh, who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Trump last week and who framed his comments as an ostensible analysis of how Democrats feel.
 'They're sitting there and they're looking at Mayor Pete "" a 37-year-old gay guy, mayor of South Bend, loves to kiss his husband on the debate stage. And they're saying, okay, how's this going to look, a 37-year-old gay guy kissing his husband onstage next to Mr. Man Donald Trump? What's going to happen there?' Limbaugh said. (Buttigieg is 38.)

The episode abruptly injected the topic into the political discussion after months when it had a lower profile. And it underlines a notable feature of Buttigieg's rise: An openly gay, married candidate has never gotten so far in the presidential arena, and it's not clear how some voters will react. 
The episode is a window into what Buttigieg could face if he becomes the Democratic nominee. Buttigieg did not publicly address Limbaugh's remarks, but his surrogates and supporters pushed back.
Elliot Imse, spokesman for the Victory Fund, which supports LGBTQ candidates, said it's clear the Trump camp would 'use homophobia to try and define who Mayor Pete is as a person and as a candidate.' He added, 'That will likely backfire with most of America if we are able to expose the homophobia for what it is and refocus quickly on who Pete is as a candidate.'
Victory Fund staffers deliberated internally on whether to respond to the comments because they did not want amplify them. But given Limbaugh's high profile, the group decided it needed to respond.
'The real question is who wants to kiss Rush Limbaugh,' the group tweeted Thursday. 'But seriously folks: we must watch for and rally against this type of hate. It will not go unanswered in November.'

Meanwhile, Limbaugh's comments quickly reverberated around right-wing circles; the Federalist, a conservative magazine, defended them as 'not homophobic,' saying he was simply asking, albeit in an 'uncouth' way, how voters would respond to a gay candidate.
On his own radio show Wednesday, Sebastian Gorka, a former deputy assistant to the president and a Trump campaign surrogate, questioned 'what right' Buttigieg had to talk about abortion rights.
'Why is a homosexual man lecturing us about the sanctity of life in the womb? Just a little curious there. Strange, strange,' Gorka said. 'I thought you're supposed to stay in your lane as a leftist. You can't comment on the lived experience of the other.'
Conservative radio host Ben Ferguson said Wednesday that he had no problem with Buttigieg being gay, though he seemed to be implying that Buttigieg is less masculine because he is gay when he posted on Twitter, 'For people who don't think 'masculinity' matters in elections call this former Presidential candidate!' He appended a photo of 1988 Democratic nominee Mike Dukakis in a tank, the subject of ridicule at the time.
Now that early primary results have solidified Buttigieg's role as a top contender, some of his allies are bracing for more attacks.
Previous candidates have sometimes decided to confront identity issues directly: Barack Obama delivered a highly personal talk on race in 2008, and John F. Kennedy gave a major speech about his Catholicism in 1960 to a group of Protestant ministers. 
The Buttigieg campaign has evidently concluded that ignoring the remarks is the best course, but that could change if the attacks become louder and more frequent, or show signs of resonating more widely.
It was in part because Limbaugh's remarks spawned other comments in conservative circles that some of his allies felt the need to respond Thursday. 
'Rush is a nasty and hateful person who lives in a bigot bubble and doesn't realize he's out of touch with America,' Imse said. 'We want to avoid giving Rush any more attention than he deserves, but when he says something as outrageous as he did and it's already making the rounds, I think it's important that our community and mainstream media expose his homophobia for what it is.'
Limbaugh's remarks also prompted a defense from former vice president Joe Biden, who is running against Buttigieg for the Democratic nomination.
'I mean, my God,' Biden said, after hosts on ABC's 'The View,' where he appeared Thursday, played clips of Limbaugh's comments. 'It is part of the depravity of this administration . . . Pete and I are competitors, but this guy has honor, he has courage, he's smart as hell.'
Buttigieg's campaign did not respond to a request for comment. His campaign rarely discusses the prospect that he will be vilified for his sexual orientation, and Buttigieg himself almost never utters the word 'homophobia.'
When voters ask how he will handle attacks from Trump, he almost always gives the same line: 'We can't allow him to change the subject,' Buttigieg often says, adding: 'I grew up gay in Indiana. I'm not afraid of bullies.' 
Still, Buttigieg did not come out when he was growing up. He often talks about thinking he could be either a politician or openly gay but not both.
When he did reveal he was gay, during his reelection campaign in South Bend, he faced pushback, although he also won decisively. Early in his presidential campaign, when he was still largely unknown, he said his office was already receiving vitriolic messages. 
'It doesn't matter much,' he told The Washington Post at the time. 'The criticisms that really get to you are ones you take seriously, ones that might be right. When someone's attacking me over a decision I made that might be wrong, that's going to make me stop and think . . . If someone calls me a faggot "" okay.' 
Since Buttigieg's strong performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, journalists have begun raising the issue of his sexuality more frequently, prompting responses like his recent comment to People magazine that he was excited about starting a family 'soon' with his husband, Chasten.
'No matter what happens, I think the next chapter in our personal lives is going to be about kids,' Buttigieg said.
 Some reactions are less celebratory. In a video that recently went viral, an Iowa woman who supported Buttigieg, then learned he was gay, asked whether she could change her vote. 'He'd better read the Bible,' the woman said in the video.


Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said the fact that he and other openly gay politicians have won statewide elections shows the limits of such attacks. He said he did not think his sexuality swayed voters either way, since anti-gay conservatives would be unlikely to support a Democrat in any case. 
'I'm obviously pro-choice; there's obviously voters who didn't vote for me because they're pro-life,' he said in an interview. 'They might not like my orientation, it might not be consistent with what they would want for themselves, but I'm completely convinced that if there were a pro-life candidate who was gay they would vote for that person over a straight person who was pro-choice.'
