President Trump ended 2019 with a strong economy, a string of domestic policy achievements—and the notoriety of becoming the third president to be impeached by the House.
The mix of political highs and lows that has characterized Mr. Trump's presidency was especially pronounced in his third year. He welcomed a
special counsel report
that found insufficient evidence the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election, though it drew no conclusion about whether the president obstructed justice. But his efforts to push Ukraine to investigate a political rival led to his
historic rebuke by the House
.
Kicking off during a
government shutdown
, Mr. Trump's year had no shortage of other unexpected and polarizing moments. He clashed with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), but also signed some deals with Democrats. He
shook hands
with North Korea's Kim Jong Un in the demilitarized zone at the inter-Korean border and attended a state banquet at Buckingham Palace. He feuded with four freshman Democratic lawmakers known as the ""squad"" and expressed interest in
potentially buying Greenland
. He celebrated a U.S.-led raid that resulted in the death of an Islamic State leader and hosted the military dog involved in the operation at the White House.
Playing out before a deeply divided nation, 2019 provided the president with some policy wins to tout on the campaign trail, as well as plenty of material for his potential opponents to pounce on. For his part, Mr. Trump is defending himself against impeachment and emphasizing trade deals and a strong economy, often with a dose of hyperbole.
""With new trade deals, and more, THE BEST IS YET TO COME!"" he declared recently on Twitter.
Presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said that by year three the public has grown more accustomed to Mr. Trump's style.
""Since Trump's become president we've developed a rhythm of what to expect. Somebody's going to criticize the president, he's going to fight back on Twitter. I don't think it's a grab bag full of surprises any more; it's Trump being Trump,"" said Mr. Brinkley, a professor at Rice University.
Though his year ended with impeachment, Mr. Trump also closed out 2019 with a
phase one trade deal
with China and won legislative support for his replacement of the North American Free Trade Agreement as well as funding for a U.S. Space Force.
""I think he's in a better position than most people expected three years ago,"" said Republican strategist Alex Conant, who worked for Sen. Marco Rubio's 2016 presidential campaign. ""Between the economy and some legislative victories, he has some tailwinds.""
Democrats played down Mr. Trump's 2019 policy wins and said they were prepared to take him on in 2020. They pointed to his
slumping support in suburbs
and their own strong turnout in the 2018 midterms and in some 2019 races as evidence of momentum.
""We are taking nothing for granted,"" said Democratic National Committee spokesman David Bergstein. ""We know that each of these battleground races are going to be tight, and we are preparing to win them no matter who our eventual nominee is.""

How would you grade President Trump's performance last year? Join the conversation below.
While Mr. Trump's backers point to his policy wins and the impeachment process as energizing their voters, Democrats also stress that his presidency has galvanized their supporters as well, both through frustration with his policies on issues like immigration and the environment, as well as his confrontational personal style.
""I believe his actions and his rhetoric are so divisive that he's going to turn out Democrats in record numbers,"" said Democratic strategist Jim Manley.
Polling underscored the divided feelings about Mr. Trump throughout the nation. A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that 48% of registered voters said they would vote against Mr. Trump, no matter who the Democrats choose as their nominee. By contrast, 34% of registered voters surveyed said they were certain to vote to re-elect the president. That poll also showed the president's approval rating at 44%, with 54% disapproving.
While he saw some successes in 2019, impeachment also leaves a lasting stain on Mr. Trump's legacy. He is accused of pressuring Ukraine's president this summer to announce investigations that would benefit Mr. Trump politically, and making $391 million in U.S. security aid contingent on Kyiv going public with investigations. The House resolution says he released the aid after his efforts were known, but then blocked officials from testifying in the probe.
Mr. Trump denies any wrongdoing, and the White House has said it is protecting executive branch authority by not allowing officials to testify. But Democrats argue that he abused his executive power and that impeachment was a responsibility.

(Dec. 23, 2019)
Despite their differences, the White House and Democratic House members came together to reach many of the recent bipartisan deals. While the deals benefit the president, they will also prove helpful to vulnerable Democrats heading into the campaign year.
Despite gloomy predictions at the start of the year about prospects for an economic downturn—and ripples of anxiety amid the extended trade clash with China—Mr. Trump ended the year on solid economic footing, bolstered by
strong jobs numbers
and rising wages. Heading into 2020, his phase one trade deal with China has soothed investors, who grew jittery during the president's aggressive negotiating.
During 2019, the president also continued a foreign policy with a focus on preserving military might while often showing caution on engagement. He sought to withdraw U.S. troops from northern Syria,
drawing criticism
from many in his party. He also
called off a planned military strike
against Iran over the downing of an unmanned U.S. surveillance drone, concerned it was an overreaction.
A key achievement for Mr. Trump was the
U.S.-led raid
that resulted in the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, considered a significant setback for the militant group. The president has emphasized that mission on the campaign trail.
Mr. Trump's other first-term policy wins include exiting the Iran nuclear deal, confirming conservative judges and cutting taxes. But his efforts to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border have lagged behind, he hasn't repealed former President Obama's health-care law, and he has achieved only a phase one trade deal with China.
Looking ahead, Mr. Trump faces unknowns as he aims to become the first president to seek re-election after being impeached. The process has yet to run its course in the Senate, though the Republican-led chamber is expected to acquit him. The tax returns he has long sought to keep private could come to light next year, depending on a Supreme Court ruling. And just who his Democratic opponent will be might not be clear for some time.
The president's re-election campaign team said they were ready for any surprises, with spokesman Tim Murtaugh stressing their fundraising and organizing efforts and saying Mr. Trump is used to weathering crises.
""People act as if this president hasn't been under fire since even before he became the nominee,"" Mr. Murtaugh said.
Mr. Trump seemed to acknowledge that the kind of churn that has defined his first three years would continue between now and Election Day.
""In the life of Trump,"" he said at a recent rally in Michigan, ""10 months is an eternity.""

WASHINGTON—Taking a victory lap a day after
he was acquitted
in the Senate impeachment trial, President Trump said he ""went through hell"" during what he deemed a politically driven investigation and called top Democrats ""very evil and sick people"" for seeking his removal from office.
Before an audience of aides and Republican allies, Mr. Trump offered freewheeling remarks from the East Room of the White House Thursday. Speaking for just over an hour, he characterized the event as a celebration, while taking swings at political rivals who he alleged have been targeting him since he took office.
""We've been going through this now for over three years. It was evil, it was corrupt, it was dirty cops, it was leakers and liars, and this should never, ever happen to another president, ever,"" Mr. Trump said.
Holding up a copy of a newspaper with the headline ""Trump Acquitted,"" he quipped: ""It's the only good headline I've had in the Washington Post.""
He reiterated his stance that he did nothing improper regarding Ukraine, and called former special counsel
Robert Mueller's earlier probe
into possible ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia ""all bullshit.""
The remarks came one day after the Republican-led Senate acquitted Mr. Trump on
two articles of impeachment
stemming from his efforts to
press Ukraine
to announce investigations that would benefit him politically in this year's election, including a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate.
Mr. Trump's comments about Democratic leaders also came on the heels of his
State of the Union speech
on Tuesday night, when he didn't shake the hand offered by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), and she ripped up her copy of his address at its conclusion.
""He is impeached forever, no matter what he says or the headlines he wanted to carry around,"" Mrs. Pelosi said in remarks to reporters on Thursday. She added that Mr. Trump was ""never getting rid of that scar.""
Mrs. Pelosi also defended tearing up the speech, calling the address ""a manifesto of mistruths"" and her action necessary to ""get the attention of the American people.""

President's Second-Term Agenda Still on the Drawing Board

The combative comments from Mr. Trump on Thursday and the vigorous response from Mrs. Pelosi made clear that the
rancorous political climate
between Democrats and Republicans will continue even with impeachment over.
Republicans cheered Mr. Trump's acquittal in the Senate and have called his impeachment part of a three-year effort to delegitimize the 2016 election and remove the president from office nine months before Democrats face him again at the ballot box.
Democrats said Mr. Trump's acquittal amounted to a defeat for the institution of Congress, and they warned that leaving Mr. Trump in office would free him to try to cheat in this year's election again.
In his White House event, the mood was triumphant, with guests hugging and slapping each other on the back. The crowd gave Mr. Trump more than a half-dozen standing ovations. He thanked various supporters in the room by name, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). Mr. Trump also thanked his Senate impeachment legal team.
He didn't mention personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, whose efforts in Ukraine have been at the center of the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Giuliani wasn't in attendance.
Mr. Trump also continued his criticism of Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah), who was the
lone Republican to vote to convict
the president on the first article of impeachment. Without naming him, Mr. Trump said there were ""some that used religion as a crutch"" and called him a failed presidential candidate.
Mr. Romney, the 2012 GOP candidate against President Obama, said Wednesday that he was a very religious person and reached an ""inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded"" that he convict Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump took two tacks toward Democrats in his White House speech. He called for bipartisanship, citing infrastructure and drug prices as areas of common interest. If Republicans and Democrats work together, ""what we can do is incredible,"" he said.
But he also continued to question the goodwill of Democrats. Earlier, in remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast, Mr. Trump appeared to reference Mrs. Pelosi, saying he doesn't like ""people who say, 'I pray for you,' when they know that's not so.""
Mrs. Pelosi, who was seated at a long table near the lectern at the breakfast, clapped as he entered the room. Later, she told reporters that she did pray for Mr. Trump, while criticizing his actions in office as ""so off the track of our Constitution, our values, our country.""
Mr. Trump's appearance at the breakfast marked the fourth year he has addressed the annual gathering, which is hosted by members of Congress and has been running since 1953. Presidents of both parties traditionally attend the event. Mr. Trump enjoys
strong support from evangelical Christians
, who were a key piece of his winning 2016 coalition.
Before Mr. Trump spoke at the breakfast, there was a keynote address from Arthur Brooks, former president of the American Enterprise Institute, who urged the audience to rise above the country's divided political climate.
Mr. Trump, known for his combative style, acknowledged the message when he took the podium, but said: ""Arthur, I don't know if I agree with you.""

OXON HILL, Md.—The impeachment of President Trump motivated her to fly up from Texas, but after a half day at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Cathie Broten was convinced a more sinister force is in play.
""It's like Custer's Last Stand: the Republicans vs. the socialists,"" said Ms. Broten, 70 years old, wearing a pin reading, ""Kiss me, I'm a capitalist.""
Mr. Trump, greeted by wild applause as he took the CPAC stage on Saturday afternoon, sought to portray Democrats as seeking policies that would turn the U.S. into a ""large-scale Venezuela.""
""But we will never let them do that,"" he said. Mr. Trump trash-talked the Democratic presidential candidates, at one point ducking down to mock Michael Bloomberg's height.
He acknowledged the rise of Sen. Bernie Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist, as the front-runner for the party's nomination. He asked the crowd to cheer to indicate which candidate he should compete against in November, either Mr. Sanders or former Vice President Joe Biden.
By the cheers, the crowd seemed itching for the ideological showdown that is the official theme of the four-day CPAC conference: America vs. Socialism. ""We'll probably end up with Crazy Bernie,"" Mr. Trump said.
The event's theme shows how Republicans plan to frame the November election, with or without Mr. Sanders as the nominee. Repeatedly, speakers portrayed the Democrats' agenda on health care, the environment, college tuition and other issues as an attempt to radically transform America.
""Donald Trump and his allies are getting a little bit nervous about facing Sen. Sanders in a general election, and they're all quickly realizing that the only way to attack someone who spent his entire life standing with the working class is to lie,"" said Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca.
Amid the ""crazy Bernie"" and communist Cuba references at CPAC were warnings about being overconfident.
""Get your laughs out of the way and get the mockery out of the way and then get deathly serious,"" said the young conservative activist Charlie Kirk. ""Because we should not do what the left did in 2016 and dismiss an outsider populist candidate from thinking that person can't win the White House.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How can President Trump's relationship with CPAC benefit him during the 2020 election season? Join the conversation below.
When Mr. Trump spoke at CPAC in 2011, saying he might run for president the following year, many in the Republican establishment laughed it off as a publicity grab. He skipped it in 2016 while some conservatives still fought to prevent his march to the nomination.
This year showed how Mr. Trump commands the GOP, injecting his own sense of grievance and fight. The mere mention of Mitt Romney, the party's 2012 nominee who
voted earlier this month in the Senate to convict Mr. Trump
on one article of impeachment, brought boos. Conference-goers stuffed ballot boxes to judge the ""phoniest"" conservative, picking from a list of other Republicans who have criticized Mr. Trump.
Before noon on Thursday, attendees had sat through four panels focused on ""the coup,"" with speakers dismissing the impeachment and other investigations into Mr. Trump as the work of Democrats and a bureaucratic deep state.
""They're never going to stop,"" said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio. ""They tried to overturn the will of 63 million Americans—all of us who voted for President Trump.""
Democrats hit back at claims like Mr. Jordan's, calling it ""the oldest trick in the GOP playbook.""
""Republicans are trying to distract because they know they can't win on the issues. In 2017, 2018 and 2019 Democrats won on a message of expanding access to health care,"" said Daniel Wessel, a Democratic National Committee spokesman.
In addition to panels, actors Dean Cain and Kristy Swanson performed a dramatic reading of anti-Trump text messages between former FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, favorite targets of Mr. Trump in his complaints about the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The CPAC gathering in past years was animated by Ron Paul-style libertarians; now it is dominated by Trump loyalists in red MAGA hats as the president continues to redefine the GOP on foreign policy and trade. There was little mention of the ballooning national debt.
For some, it was a venue to apologize for being wrong about Mr. Trump in 2016.
""Look, I was late to the Trump train,"" said Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. ""I was about as late as one can be. I had my doubts about whether he was a conservative. I had my doubts about whether he was electable."" But Mr. Lee said the president has followed through on his promises, including moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, slashing regulations and nominating conservative judges.
Vice President Mike Pence ticked off those accomplishments and the strong economy and
declared victory over the impeachment
. ""President Donald Trump was acquitted forever,"" he said to wild cheers. Like others, Mr. Pence acknowledged the appeal of Mr. Sanders's policy proposals to young people in particular and said Republicans must engage them and explain the differences between ""freedom and socialism.""
""We definitely need to a better job of reaching young people and address their concerns,"" said Alexander Bowles, 18, of St. Louis, who said Mr. Trump also should moderate the way he speaks to avoid losing more suburban voters.
Outside the ballroom, people who have become celebrities in the Trump era were flocked by fans. Biceps poking from a black T-shirt, the Fox News regular Dan Bongino posed for selfies. Nigel Farage, one of Brexit's most-visible architects, was greeted with applause as he rode down an escalator holding a wooden doll depicting Mr. Trump.
Vendors sold Trump hats, towels, T-shirts and pins. A red-white-and-blue hammock with the word ""Deplorable"" was being offered at 10% off the $499 price tag with an extra 10% discount for anyone from a battleground state.

DES MOINES, Iowa—An election debacle unfolded Monday night as the Iowa Democratic Party failed to release the results of the
state's presidential caucuses
, saying it had found ""inconsistencies in the reporting"" as the nation awaited the outcome of the first-in-the-nation nominating contest.
""In addition to the tech systems being used to tabulate results, we are also using photos of results and a paper trail to validate that all results match and ensure that we have confidence and accuracy in the numbers we report,"" Mandy McClure, the state party's communications director, said in a statement.
She said
a mobile app
used to record and report results from each caucus site ""did not go down and this is not a hack or an intrusion. The underlying data and paper trail is sound and will simply take time to further report the results.""
The delay has temporarily deprived the winner of the burst of media attention and momentum that typically comes from success in Iowa. It also may have given any candidates who performed poorly a free pass.
During an early Tuesday conference call with the campaigns, state party officials said they weren't willing to provide details on any results they had collected, according to a person familiar with the call. The officials said they expected to release results later Tuesday but didn't specify a time, the person said.
The campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden said in a letter to the state party that ""acute failures are occurring statewide"" in the party's reporting system. ""We believe that the campaigns deserve full explanations and relevant information regarding the methods of quality control you are employing, and an opportunity to respond, before any official results are released,"" wrote Dana Remus, general counsel for Mr. Biden's campaign.

Richard Harpootlian, a former South Carolina Democratic chairman who volunteered for Mr. Biden's campaign in a suburban Des Moines precinct, called the caucuses ""the most convoluted, distorting process I've ever been involved with.""
""We all entered stuff on an app. So where's the results? They're just dragging it out,"" Mr. Harpootlian said.
President Trump pounced on the uncertainty, calling the Democratic caucuses an ""unmitigated disaster"" in a
Tuesday morning tweet
. ""Nothing works, just like they ran the Country,"" he wrote, adding that only he can claim victory in the state. The president is
scheduled to deliver
his annual State of the Union address Tuesday night.
With the results still unknown, several campaigns released internal, unverifiable data from the caucuses to claim a favorable result. The candidates also took to stages scattered around Iowa's capital to declare their own versions of success.
""I imagine, have a strong feeling, that at some point, the results will be announced,"" said Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. ""And when those results are announced, I have a good feeling we're going to be doing very, very well here in Iowa.""
Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar told her supporters gathered at a caucus night party that they are ""punching above their weight.""
""Even in a crowded field of candidates, even during the well-earned impeachment hearing of Donald J. Trump, which had me bolted to my Senate desk for the last two weeks, we kept fighting,"" Ms. Klobuchar told her supporters. ""And you kept fighting for me.""

The caucuses kicked off the party's
quest to find a challenger to President Trump
in November's election, formally opening a primary campaign that showed no signs of wrapping up quickly.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called the race ""too close to call"" during her speech, but said she was confident the final Iowa results would show her in a strong position.
Ms. Warren once again signaled that her campaign is gearing up for a long nomination fight. ""This fight will stretch across all 57 states and territories that make up this great nation until we unite together as a party in Milwaukee,"" she said, referring to the host city of the party's convention this summer.
Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., took the stage and claimed victory, even as he acknowledged the official results were unknown.
""By all indications, we are going on to New Hampshire victorious,"" he told his supporters. ""We don't know all the results, but we do know when it's all said and done, Iowa, you have shocked the nation.""

The reporting was complicated in this year's caucuses by additional data. For the first time—in response to calls for greater transparency—the state party was to release the raw total for votes from both rounds of voting, along with the traditional share of delegates won.
The data had to be transmitted from nearly 1,700 neighborhood caucuses, typically held in school gymnasiums and public libraries. Dozens of additional ""satellite caucuses"" were held for those unable to attend a meeting in their own neighborhood.

)
Some precinct chairs struggled to transmit caucus results, according to people familiar with the situation, both via a mobile app and by a backup telephone system.
Two caucus organizers said before the gatherings started that they had heard about issues with downloading or logging into the app, meaning they would likely need to call in their results over a secure phone line that had been set up as a backup plan.
The state party said before the caucuses that the reported issues had come mainly from areas with poor cellphone service or have involved minor user errors.
After the caucuses began, Adin Mann, a caucus official in Story County, said in an interview that the app ""wasn't working at all.""
An Iowa campaign operative said the state party said on a conference call with the presidential campaigns that 35% of precincts were able to successfully report their results. But when campaign officials asked for additional details, including if the state party might provide a statement offering clarity, the call ended abruptly.
Democrats have been debating whether to back someone promising major change and a bigger governmental role in the economy, such as Mr. Sanders or Ms. Warren, or a more moderate candidate who might win over independents and some Republicans. Messrs. Biden and Buttigieg fall into that camp.
There are indications the party is unlikely to resolve this debate soon. All four of the top candidates heading into the caucuses had campaign war chests large enough to sustain them through February, including New Hampshire's primary on Feb. 11.
Mr. Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, has recently shown strength in national polls. That has triggered concerns among centrist Democrats who worry Mr. Trump would use Mr. Sanders's political identity to damage the party's prospects in Midwestern battleground states that helped decide the 2016 election.
If Mr. Sanders shows strength in the first few state contests over more moderate candidates like Messrs. Biden and Buttigieg, it would almost certainly add fuel to the candidacy of former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire, is skipping any serious competition for the first four states holding nominating contests, a strategy no successful candidate has pursued in the modern era. He is instead focusing his fortune on states with primaries and caucuses in March, a month when about 60% of the delegates to the national convention are in play. And he has already spent lavishly, devoting more than $300 million to the campaign.
His prospects in the Democratic nominating race likely rest on whether Mr. Biden is doing well or struggling to compete after the first several contests, as well as whether another moderate like Mr. Buttigieg or Ms. Klobuchar—who focused on competing in Iowa this year—has moved into contention by the end of February.
The massive size of the Democratic field—still at close to a dozen—has complicated the party's hopes of coalescing around a nominee more quickly than in 2016. Some supporters of Mrs. Clinton, the eventual nominee, have said she was harmed by an extended fight for the nomination with Mr. Sanders.
A victory in Iowa would offer a significant achievement to Mr. Sanders, who overcame a heart attack during the fall and has separated himself from Ms. Warren, the party's other leading liberal in the race, in recent months.

What Happens at the Iowa Caucuses

Mr. Biden, meanwhile, has campaigned on his experience, his ties to former President Obama and his contention that he would give the party its best chance of defeating Mr. Trump in a series of hard-fought battleground states such as Wisconsin, Michigan and Mr. Biden's birth state of Pennsylvania.
Ms. Warren struggled during the fall to explain how she would implement—and pay for—a Medicare-for-all health plan and has watched her poll numbers dip as Mr. Sanders has improved his standing with liberals and Mr. Buttigieg has picked up support among suburban voters.
Mr. Buttigieg, a military veteran who is openly gay, entered the race as a relatively unknown mayor of a midsize city but has raised his profile through an extensive media campaign and focus on early voting states. To gain traction, however, he would need to gain interest among African-American voters in states such as South Carolina, where he has limited support.
The future of Ms. Klobuchar's candidacy could be more dependent on the Iowa outcome than the others because of her deep investment in the state and status as a neighbor.
When Democrats settle on their nominee, they will enter a general-election contest against a man who has been preparing for the fight since he took office more than three years ago. Mr. Trump is likely to be the best-funded president seeking re-election in history and will have a sophisticated digital messaging and get-out-the-vote operation at his disposal.

With the leadoff Iowa caucuses days away, President Trump's re-election campaign wants to remind voters that Democrats aren't the only game in town.
For the Feb. 3 caucuses, the Trump campaign is planning an ambitious show of force around the state, with over 80 surrogates expected to campaign at caucus locations. The push will be led by campaign manager Brad Parscale, the president's sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, as well as Eric Trump's wife Lara Trump, who works for the campaign and Donald Trump Jr.'s girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle, also a campaign adviser.
The group heading to Iowa includes White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and a number of cabinet members, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. Also attending are members of Congress, among them House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) , Rep. Elise Stefanik, (R., N.Y.) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), as well as Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and governors from surrounding states.
Four years ago, President Trump placed second in the Iowa caucuses. But this time around he has no strong challenger and Republican turnout is expected to be light. Still, the campaign sees the night as an opportunity to test its organizational muscle across the state's 99 counties and put on a show of strength in a key general election state.

""Our Caucus Day operation is just a preview of what is to come,"" said Mr. Parscale, in a statement provided to The Wall Street Journal. ""This will be the strongest, best funded, and most organized presidential campaign in history.""
The president is also heading to Des Moines on Thursday for a rally in advance of the caucuses, and Vice President Mike Pence is planning a bus tour through the state that day. The campaign has held caucus training sessions and Lara Trump recently issued a video detailing how to participate.
""By attending your caucus you can show your support for the president and send a clear message to the rest of the country,"" she said.
Mr. Trump has made clear he plans to leave nothing to chance in Iowa, a state he captured by nearly 10 percentage points in 2016 over Hillary Clinton but that Barack Obama won in 2008 and 2012. He has stayed close to Iowa Republicans, repeatedly visiting the state throughout his presidency.
Some states have opted not to hold Republican primaries this year, but Iowa—ever mindful of its first-in-the-nation status—has kept the GOP contest going.

""When you're a first in the nation state, you can't take off an election cycle,"" said Iowa Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kaufmann. ""We need to make sure both parties are out front and showing the country that we're going to do things in a transparent way and an efficient way.""
On the evening of Feb. 3, Republicans and Democrats will gather in nearly 1,700 precinct locations to pick their choice to be the party nominee. The GOP process is more straightforward than the Democratic approach, with Republicans simply casting a vote. The caucus results ultimately determine the delegates that represent the state at the Republican convention in August.
Mr. Kaufmann stressed that the turnout among Republicans would likely be low, perhaps in the thousands, but said the night provided an on-the-ground organizing test.
Mr. Trump has followed the closely fought
Democratic nomination fight
, which kicks off in Iowa.
Speaking to Fox Business recently, he said of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders: ""I don't know, maybe he's really surging. He really is,"" while adding that Massachusetts Sen. ""Elizabeth Warren seems to be going in the other way.""
Of former Vice President Joe Biden, Mr. Trump said he ""doesn't seem to be doing too well.""
Although the
president's impeachment trial
will continue unfolding in Washington this week, the push in Iowa also comes as he has been or will be central to several other notable events.
He is holding a rally in New Jersey this week, as well as a high profile meeting with Israeli leaders. He recently attended the
World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos
and on Friday became the
first president to personally address the March for Life
in Washington.

WASHINGTON -- The House delivered two articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate on Wednesday, after voting to approve seven Democratic managers to prosecute the case before the Republican-controlled chamber.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that she stressed litigation experience in choosing managers to handle the trial over alleged presidential abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Senators are expected to be sworn in on Thursday, and the proceedings are scheduled to get under way in earnest on Tuesday.
""The emphasis is making the strongest possible case to protect and defend our Constitution, to seek the truth for the American people,"" Mrs. Pelosi (D., Calif.) said.
""President Trump has done nothing wrong,"" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said, adding that he ""expects to be fully exonerated.""
The managers aim to advance Democrats' arguments that Mr. Trump should be removed from office. The group comprises House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California, Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Reps. Zoe Lofgren of California, Val Demings of Florida, Sylvia Garcia of Texas and Jason Crow of Colorado.
After a brief debate, the House approved the managers, 228 to 193, almost entirely along party lines. One Democrat, Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota, broke with the party and voted against the resolution. He had also opposed both articles of impeachment. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, an independent who left the GOP last year, supported the resolution.
The Democratic-led House voted to impeach Mr. Trump last month. The first article of impeachment stems from Mr. Trump pressing Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, including by withholding almost $400 million in aid to help Kyiv combat Russian aggression. The second article accuses Mr. Trump of impeding Congress's investigation by preventing witnesses from testifying and defying subpoenas for documentary evidence.
After the House impeached Mr. Trump, Mrs. Pelosi held off on naming the managers for nearly a month, as Democrats unsuccessfully sought guarantees from Senate Republicans that new witnesses would be heard and new evidence presented. She relented this week, after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) ratcheted up the pressure on her by signing on to a resolution to dismiss the case.
House Democratic leaders argue the delay paid off, as new emails and documents related to the case emerged in recent weeks, as well as documents showing the effort to undermine the then-U.S. ambassador to the country.
""It made sense to wait a while, as even more evidence piled up, but we have to proceed, because. . .the integrity of the election is at stake,"" said Mr. Nadler, referring to the November election.
The White House doesn't believe there is a need to hear witness testimony in the Senate trial, a senior administration official said. The official said the White House considers it ""extraordinarily unlikely"" that the trial would last longer than two weeks.
But several Republican senators, including Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, have said they would be open to hearing from new witnesses, and Mr. McConnell has ruled out a quick dismissal of the case. Witnesses sought by Democrats include former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who were directed by the White House not to testify before the House inquiry.
Votes on witnesses and documents could extend the trial beyond the two-week time frame, potentially extending it through the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3 -- the first nominating contest in the 2020 Democratic presidential race -- and Mr. Trump's State of the Union address, scheduled for Feb. 4.
Sen. John Thune of South Dakota, the chamber's No. 2 Republican, said that wrapping up the trial by Mr. Trump's State of the Union address ""seems like a fairly tight deadline given what we are facing.""
Republican senators briefed on a GOP draft of rules for the trial said it likely will include a guaranteed vote on witnesses and documents after opening arguments and a period for written questions. Moderate Republicans had been pushing for such a vote, putting them at odds with Mr. Trump, who recently renewed his call to dismiss the articles without a trial.
Some GOP senators are pushing reciprocity of witnesses, so that if Democrats hear from Mr. Bolton, Republicans would push to hear from Mr. Biden's son, Hunter Biden, according to a person familiar with the matter. The younger Mr. Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company that Mr. Trump asked Ukraine's leader to investigate.
""If [Democrats] end up getting witnesses, I'm going to insist there be a motion that the president gets to call anybody deemed to be necessary to his defense,"" said Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) in an interview.
Both Bidens have denied any wrongdoing, and in the Democratic debate Tuesday night, Joe Biden called allegations from Mr. Trump ""flat-out lies.""
Mrs. Pelosi signed the articles of impeachment in a ceremony at the Capitol on Wednesday, cycling through about a dozen pens emblazoned with her name and finally handing one pen to each of the lawmakers gathered. She kept one for herself.
The House's clerk and the sergeant at arms, accompanied by all seven Democratic impeachment managers, then walked the articles to the Senate, along with a message that the House has appointed managers to exhibit the articles of impeachment.
In the Senate chamber, the camera flashes first came into view through the filigreed windows of the Senate door. At 5:34 p.m., the procession of seven House Democrats appeared at the door, met by Laura Dove, secretary for the Republicans, who signaled the group to head to the back wall.
The managers entered, single file, and walked to their places. At their desks inside the chamber, 27 Senate Democrats sat in their seats. Mr. McConnell and Sen. Kevin Cramer (R., N.D.) were in the room to bear witness.
""Mr. President, a message from the House of Representatives,"" Ms. Dove told Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), the Senate's president pro tempore, who presided over the chamber.
Mr. McConnell acknowledged the message and said the Senate will receive the managers to present the articles of impeachment at noon Thursday.
""This is a difficult time for our country, but this is precisely the kind of time for which the framers created the Senate,"" he said.
On Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts, who will preside over the trial, is to be sworn in by Mr. Grassley. Mr. Roberts is then expected to administer the same oath, to do ""impartial justice,"" to all 100 senators, who will act as the jury. At least two-thirds of the senators would have to vote to convict Mr. Trump to remove him from office.
Mr. Trump will be summoned and given time to respond. Then the Senate is expected to break for the holiday weekend before reconvening to start the trial.

Pelosi Names Seven House Lawmakers to Manage Senate Trial
Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.)
Mr. Jeffries is chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, the No. 4 leadership spot, and is widely viewed as a potential House speaker. He sits on the House Judiciary Committee, from which he had a role in the impeachment proceedings. He was initially cautious about endorsing impeaching President Trump, in contrast to the progressives on the panel who pushed earlier for the president's removal.
Sylvia Garcia (D., Texas)
Early in her career, she worked as a social worker and legal-aid lawyer. Before her election to Congress in 2018, she served as Houston City controller, Harris County commissioner and Texas state senator. Ms. Garcia also was the director and presiding judge of the Houston Municipal System. She serves on the Judiciary Committee, which drafted the impeachment articles against Mr. Trump.
Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.)
In 2019, as calls to impeach Mr. Trump grew, Mr. Nadler, the Judiciary Committee chairman, said he wanted clear evidence that would push some supporters of the president to support impeachment. Still, when the findings of the Mueller report showed Mr. Trump attempted to interfere with the investigation, he began to pursue impeachment in his committee, before the House launched a formal impeachment investigation over the Ukraine matter.
Adam Schiff (D., Calif.)
Mr. Schiff has led the impeachment investigation since it launched in September, deposing witnesses and presiding over hearings. His position on impeachment was a bellwether for many in the caucus, because he was reluctant to pursue impeachment until he became aware of a whistleblower's complaint that Mr. Trump pushed Ukraine to launch probes that could be politically beneficial to him.
Val Demings (D., Fla.)
As a member of the House Judiciary and Intelligence panels, Ms. Demings was one of the few lawmakers who questioned witnesses at every impeachment hearing. She was the first woman to lead the Orlando Police Department. When Republicans criticized holding the initial phase of the inquiry in secret, Ms. Demings drew on her law-enforcement background to argue investigations are conducted in private before the evidence is presented in public.
Zoe Lofgren (D., Calif.)
Ms. Lofgren is the No. 2 Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. She served as a staffer on the Judiciary Committee in 1974 when it voted to send articles of impeachment against President Nixon to the full House. An ally of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, she was careful about supporting impeachment, waiting until late last year to endorse the president's removal.
Jason Crow (D., Colo.)
The freshman lawmaker is a former Army Ranger who served three combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. A lawyer, he is member of the House Armed Services and Small Business committees. He joined with six other Democrats with national-security backgrounds who wrote in September that if Mr. Trump had indeed pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, it would be an impeachable offense.

WASHINGTON—House Democrats and President Trump's defense team concluded their closing arguments to the Senate, the last major step in the
impeachment trial
before an expected acquittal this week on
charges
of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
The two sides gave their final pitches Monday to the jury of 100 senators who had largely made up their minds on impeachment, broadly unmoved by three weeks of presentations and arguments. They used their final two hours apiece to issue warnings: Democrats focused on what they saw as the danger to democracy presented by Mr. Trump remaining in office, while the Trump legal team decried what it called the use of impeachment as a political weapon.
The vote on the two articles of impeachment will be on Wednesday. The first article stems from
Mr. Trump pressing Ukraine
to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a top Democratic presidential candidate, which Democrats allege amounted to attempted interference in the 2020 election. The second article accuses Mr. Trump of obstructing Congress's investigation by preventing witnesses from testifying and defying subpoenas for documentary evidence.

How Republicans Scotched the Idea of Witnesses in Impeachment Trial

In the trial proceedings Monday, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the lead impeachment manager, again urged senators to convict Mr. Trump. Mr. Schiff warned of a ""runaway presidency"" and argued that Mr. Trump's removal was needed now, rather than waiting for the 2020 election to decide his fate.
""He has betrayed our national security and he will do so again,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""He has compromised our elections and he will do so again. You will not change him.…Now do impartial justice and convict him.""
Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing and again called impeachment a hoax on Twitter on Monday. His legal team, in their presentation, painted the Democrats' pursuit of impeachment as purely political, driven by a longstanding dislike of the president.
""At the end of the day, this is an effort to overturn the results of one election and to try to interfere in the coming election that begins today in Iowa,"" said White House counsel Pat Cipollone.
Iowa's caucuses
Monday evening kick off the Democratic and Republican nominating contests.
""What the House Democrats have done to this nation, to the Constitution, to the office of the president, to the president himself and to this body is outrageous,"" said another Trump team lawyer, Jay Sekulow.
Mr. Trump and his allies have argued that Mr. Trump's interest in Mr. Biden was legitimate, alleging it was corrupt for Mr. Biden during the Obama administration to seek the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had once investigated a Ukrainian gas company where Mr. Biden's son Hunter sat on the board. Mr. Biden sought the prosecutor's removal as part of a broad international effort to combat corruption in Ukraine. The Bidens have denied wrongdoing. Hunter Biden has said it was poor judgment on his part to serve on the Burisma board while his father was involved with Ukraine policy as vice president.
An acquittal for Mr. Trump is all but certain, following the
Senate's vote
last week to not seek new witnesses or documents and as Republicans defended the president's actions. Twenty Republicans would have to join the entire Democratic caucus to vote to remove the president. No Republicans have said they favor impeachment, and just two supported the Democrats' effort last week to seek more evidence in the trial, which failed 51-49.
What isn't clear is whether the acquittal vote will be bipartisan. Some Democratic senators, such as Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Doug Jones of Alabama and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, are undecided. Mr. Jones, representing a state that backed President Trump by 28 points in the 2016 election, is
the most vulnerable Democratic senator
this cycle.
The president is scheduled to give his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, in the chamber where the House approved two articles of impeachment against him in December. Some Republicans hoped that the president would move forward past impeachment in the annual speech.
""There are a lot of really great things he should talk about, and stay away from maybe what the proceedings are,"" said Sen. Joni Ernst (R., Iowa). ""Let's focus on the things that can bring us together. What does he want to see coming up next? We've got infrastructure we need to be working on. I think we really need something that will pull Democrats and Republicans back together again.""
But Sen. Angus King (I., Maine), who caucuses with the Democrats, said he expects Mr. Trump to be emboldened as he heads into the State of the Union address, and beyond.
""He's expressed no remorse or understanding that he did anything wrong, so why should he hold back? That's what worries me,"" Mr. King said.
A new
Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll
published on Sunday found a majority of voters said they believed Mr. Trump abused his power by asking Ukraine to investigate a potential political opponent in order to influence the coming election, and that Mr. Trump obstructed Congress by not cooperating with the impeachment inquiry.
But there wasn't majority support for removing him from office. The poll found 49% said he should be allowed to finish his term, compared with 46% who said he should be removed. Mr. Trump's job approval in the January poll stood at 46%, with 51% disapproving, in line with results throughout the Trump presidency.

After Donald Trump's election, Lev Parnas saw a chance to cash in on his connections.
The Florida businessman and Trump donor was courting investors for a real-estate project. He took one of them, Roman Nasirov, at the time the head of Ukraine's tax service, to Mr. Trump's Florida Mar-a-Lago resort, where they chatted with the president-elect in a crowd of supporters, a video released by Mr. Parnas's attorney shows. Mr. Nasirov ultimately helped fund a $10 million loan Mr. Parnas arranged for the project, people familiar with the matter said.
A sizable donation to a political campaign typically brings a handshake and some chitchat with the candidate. In the three years that followed, Mr. Parnas went further.
As he launched himself into Mr. Trump's orbit, Mr. Parnas found sponsors for his own ventures among wealthy Republican donors, mingling with them at fundraisers and dinners that he documented in copious selfies. He also sought out and eventually became a key associate of Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney, who embraced Mr. Parnas in his pursuit of investigations in Ukraine.
The role he has carved out for himself has thrust the Ukrainian-born Mr. Parnas into the impeachment saga, injecting a wild card into the tightly choreographed
proceedings on Capitol Hill
. Last week, he offered new allegations in several interviews that have inflamed the debate about whether senators should call witnesses in the president's trial, which opens Tuesday.

Many of Mr. Parnas's ventures went awry
despite his connected patrons' support. The real-estate project Mr. Nasirov invested in ended in a lawsuit, in which Mr. Parnas said the developer cut him out of a subsequent deal and that he is owed $250,000 for expenses in January 2017 alone, as well as the costs of hiring a personal assistant and leasing Cadillac Escalades. Mr. Nasirov didn't respond to a request for comment.
In Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Parnas found not a patron but an inroad with the White House—perceived access that he in turn sought to use to broker new business deals.
Mr. Parnas says he arranged meetings and carried messages for Mr. Giuliani as the president's attorney tried to
pressure Ukraine's government to undertake investigations
into a leading Trump rival in this year's elections, Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden. That campaign is at the center of the president's impeachment, in which Democrats say Mr. Trump abused his power for personal benefit. Mr. Trump has denied that and called the impeachment a hoax.
Democrats in the House and Senate say Mr. Parnas should be heard from. Republicans, meanwhile, question his credibility, citing his federal indictment in Manhattan in October. The prosecutors, who accused Mr. Parnas and an associate of attempting to funnel foreign money into U.S. elections and influence American politics on behalf of at least one Ukrainian politician, say they are continuing to investigate the two men. The fall indictment doesn't address the efforts to push for investigations in Ukraine.
Parnas's Impeachment Role
Now facing campaign-finance charges, Lev Parnas had worked with President Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as he sought to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens—an effort that is now a focus of impeachment proceedings.

Mr. Parnas has pleaded not guilty, and he and his attorney say his cooperation in the impeachment proceedings should earn him leniency. He has turned over
hundreds of pages of text messages and other documents
to House committees that outline his relationship with Mr. Giuliani and others in the Trump camp. In television interviews last week, he said Mr. Trump knew what he and Mr. Giuliani were doing in Ukraine. Mr. Trump says he doesn't know Mr. Parnas, though he has acknowledged taking pictures together.
At a meeting with prosecutors from the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office late last year, people familiar with the matter say, Mr. Parnas's attorney disputed that he pushed for the removal of the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine at the behest of a Ukrainian official—one of the charges in the campaign finance indictment.
As Mr. Parnas sat without speaking, the attorney told prosecutors that his client didn't act at the official's direction, though the two had been in contact about removing the ambassador, the people said. Manhattan prosecutors rejected that explanation, the people said. Prosecutors haven't detailed publicly any evidence that would support their allegation.
In Florida, Mr. Parnas, who frequently puffs on a vape pen, gained a reputation for having quick access to large amounts of financing, former business associates and others said. An investor who met Mr. Parnas in the early 2010s remembers him having a Rolls-Royce, an Aston Martin and a chauffeur. Mr. Parnas has acknowledged he likes nice cars and has had a bodyguard who served as a driver at times.
Others recall him as a charming if questionable operator who reminded them of a Joe Pesci character. ""Anything that you talked to them about, they had some kind of angle on it,"" said Joe Cartolano, an attorney who worked briefly with a firm involved with Mr. Parnas, referring to Mr. Parnas and another business associate.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How, if at all, do you think Lev Parnas's statements and documents might influence President Trump's impeachment trial? Join the conversation below.
A $50,000 donation to the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee shortly before the November 2016 election first brought Mr. Parnas into the Trump orbit. At a fundraiser in Florida, Mr. Parnas introduced himself to Messrs. Trump and Giuliani.
After the fundraiser, Mr. Parnas pressed the host, construction magnate Robert Pereira, to invest in a new venture, Fraud Guarantee, which offered insurance for investments. Mr. Pereira told The Wall Street Journal last year that he ""didn't trust this guy"" and cut off contact with Mr. Parnas.
Fraud Guarantee was born from a failed venture to develop real estate in which Mr. Parnas says he was scammed. His former business partner, Dale Wood, who is now serving a 12-year sentence for a related $7 million investment fraud, said in an interview that around $500,000 of the money stolen in the fraud in 2012 paid for Mr. Parnas's house, cars, bodyguard and private jets.
Records from several companies linked to their efforts show $50,000 went to a charter plane firm and $55,000 to a car-leasing company, both used by Mr. Parnas.
Mr. Parnas's attorney, Joseph Bondy, said Mr. Parnas was a victim and that Mr. Wood didn't provide agreed-upon payments. Because Mr. Parnas provided information on Mr. Wood to law enforcement, he ""now seeks to cast Mr. Parnas in a falsely negative light,"" Mr. Bondy said.
Mr. Parnas, who wasn't charged in the case, sought to use his experience with Mr. Wood to his benefit. ""The one good thing that came out of the situation was our desire to turn lemons into lemonade! That was the birth of Fraud Guarantee,"" one pitch letter to investors said.
His 2016 donation had taught him he needed to spend money to earn money. Bigger donations vaulted Mr. Parnas further into Trump circles and brought success in recruiting investors.
In May 2018, Mr. Parnas and a fellow Soviet-born businessman, Igor Fruman—both U.S. citizens—made a $325,000 donation to America First Action, a pro-Trump super PAC. Prosecutors said the donation came through a limited liability company to conceal their identities. Mr. Fruman has pleaded not guilty to campaign finance violations. Unlike Mr. Parnas, he has declined to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry and hasn't spoken publicly.
After the donation, the pair attended a small dinner at the Trump Hotel in Washington with the president, his son Donald Trump Jr. and other top donors to America First Action.
Those connections bred new ones. At the Trump hotel in June, Dallas investor and Trump donor Roy Bailey introduced them to Harry Sargeant III, a Florida-based businessman and Trump donor who would later help foot the bill for the pair's travel to Ukraine. Mr. Bailey told Mr. Sargeant the pair had written a big check to the super PAC, according to a person familiar with the matter.
When Mr. Giuliani in 2018 demanded a $500,000 fee for his consulting services for Fraud Guarantee, Messrs. Parnas and Fruman didn't have the money. So they turned to another Trump donor, personal-injury lawyer Charles Gucciardo, who paid Mr. Giuliani that fall in exchange for a stake in the company, according to Mr. Gucciardo's lawyer.
With Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Parnas flew higher still. He and Mr. Fruman ramped up their efforts to arrange meetings for Mr. Giuliani with key Ukrainian officials in their quest to get Kyiv to announce investigations into alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election by Ukrainian officials—a largely unsubstantiated theory embraced by the president and some congressional Republicans—and into the role Mr. Biden's son, Hunter, played on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma Holdings.
The pair were also on a mission of their own in Ukraine:
to broker a deal to sell U.S. liquefied natural gas to the country
. In a meeting with a top official at Ukraine's state oil-and-gas company, Messrs. Parnas and Fruman cited their alleged access to Mr. Trump. The deal didn't materialize, another unsuccessful attempt by the pair to use their connections to bolster their business prospects.
Their push for investigations in Ukraine gave Mr. Parnas fodder to bond with high-level Trump associates, according to documents released by the House committees. He traded texts with Tommy Hicks Jr., who in early 2019 was named co-chairman of the Republican National Committee. Mr. Hicks, a close friend of Mr. Trump Jr., didn't respond to a request for comment.
In March, an official at America First Policies, AFA's nonprofit arm, solicited Mr. Parnas's suggestions on what Mr. Trump Jr. should tweet about issues in Ukraine, according to texts released by the House. Mr. Parnas sent the official an article about calls to remove the ambassador to Ukraine, which Mr. Trump Jr. tweeted. His spokesman declined to comment.
Mr. Giuliani has denied knowing about the two highest-level Ukrainian meetings Messrs. Parnas and Fruman attended: one in February with then-President Petro Poroshenko, and one the following May with a top aide to the incoming president, Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr. Parnas said he relayed to both men that favorable U.S. treatment was at risk if they didn't announce the sought-after investigations.
Messrs. Giuliani and Parnas were in close contact in the days surrounding both meetings: The two men called or tried to call each other nearly 40 times the week of the February meeting, a person familiar with the matter said. On the day of the May meeting, Mr. Giuliani called Mr. Parnas twice, and Mr. Parnas called him three times the next day, the person said, and they exchanged hundreds of calls over the course of that week.
Meanwhile, funding the travel for the Ukraine project began to wear on Mr. Sargeant, the Trump donor. In April, he texted Mr. Parnas: ""Just become expensive flying u guys everywhere LEV."" Mr. Parnas promised to pay him back.
An attorney for Mr. Sargeant said he lent Mr. Parnas money because he ""claimed, perhaps falsely, he was broke and promised to pay the funds back.""
When Messrs. Parnas and Fruman were arrested in October, the owner of a charter company that Mr. Parnas had hired at Mr. Sargeant's recommendation took notice. Mr. Parnas owed the company more than $30,000 for a flight for Mr. Giuliani and his girlfriend, according to a person familiar with the matter.
After their arrest, the person said, the owner ran a credit card belonging to Mr. Parnas's wife to pay himself back.

Party and politics aren't all that distinguish the billionaire New Yorker in the White House from the one seeking to displace him.

President Trump's
Fifth Avenue apartment in Manhattan's Trump Tower feels ""like you're walking into a casino. Very lavish. A lot of gold,"" said John Catsimatidis, another billionaire New Yorker. He also has visited
Michael Bloomberg'
s New York City townhouse. ""You walk into Bloomberg's home on 79th Street, it's like Louis XIV's home,"" he said. ""Very conservative.""
Mr. Trump, 73 years old, and Mr. Bloomberg, 78, lived about 20 blocks apart on Manhattan's East Side and miles apart in sensibility, say dozens of people who know them. Mr. Trump was seen as a celebrity whose marriages and divorces splashed across newsstand tabloids. Mr. Bloomberg was the data-driven businessman who served three terms as New York's mayor.
""Mike's more intellectual, more of a refined billionaire,"" said Don Peebles, a real-estate developer. ""Donald's more of a blue-collar billionaire.""
Mr. Bloomberg was raised in a working-class family outside of Boston and made his fortune selling data to Wall Street traders. Once established, he circulated easily in Manhattan's philanthropic circles, boardrooms and elite clubs.
The president grew up in a wealthy New York real-estate family. He never fit among the city's old-money crowd, which viewed him more as a showman than a successful developer.
Share Your Thoughts
How do you expect Michael Bloomberg's campaign to fare on Super Tuesday? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Bloomberg appears on the ballot for the first time in the Democratic primary contest on Tuesday, when more than a dozen states hold contests. He has spent more than $600 million on his presidential campaign.
For years, the two billionaires coexisted peacefully in the city, trading pleasantries in public when it suited them. Some of their children became friends. Whatever ill feelings the two men harbored stayed private. Not anymore.
Mr. Catsimatidis said he spoke with Mr. Bloomberg last fall, before the former mayor launched his bid, and he recalled Mr. Bloomberg clearly felt he was more qualified to be president. ""He considers himself so much smarter than Trump and so much richer than Trump,"" he said. ""And Trump is sitting in his chair. Bloomberg hates him.""
The prospect of a November election showdown between Mr. Trump and Mr. Bloomberg might be hard to predict, but the two men are trading punches like crosstown rivals.
Mr. Bloomberg is ""a loser who has money but can't debate and has zero presence,"" Mr. Trump tweeted. He mocks the ex-mayor's height, calling him Mini Mike. Mr. Bloomberg tweeted that some of their mutual acquaintances in New York ""laugh at you & call you a carnival barking clown.""
The billionaires' bout ignited nearly four years ago, when Mr. Bloomberg took the stage at the Democratic National Convention. Mr. Trump, then the GOP presidential nominee, ""wants to run the nation like he's running his business. God help us,"" Mr. Bloomberg said. ""I'm a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one.""
Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said in a statement: ""Mike Bloomberg is not equipped to run this country, and President Trump has made his thoughts on that clear.""
Mr. Bloomberg declined a request to be interviewed for this article. His spokesman, Stu Loeser said, ""Running a golf course is about the only thing"" Mr. Bloomberg would hire Mr. Trump to do.
'The greatest'
Mr. Bloomberg, as mayor, and Mr. Trump, as a developer, occasionally crossed paths. They were never close, people familiar with their relationship said, yet they largely presented—at least publicly—a warm front.
Mr. Trump said in 2007 that Mr. Bloomberg would ""go down as one of the great mayors, if not the greatest"" in New York history. Mr. Bloomberg referred to Mr. Trump in 2011 as a ""New York icon."" Both called each other a friend.
Messrs. Trump and Bloomberg were photographed together on the golf course. Mr. Bloomberg twice appeared on ""The Apprentice,"" Mr. Trump's reality TV show. Mr. Trump was picked by the city to run a public golf course.
Given their personal differences, the cordiality rested on shaky ground. Mr. Bloomberg had little to gain from tangling with a high-profile TV personality. Likewise, Mr. Trump had little reason to antagonize the mayor, given the city's broad land-use authority.
When Mr. Bloomberg took office in 2002, Mr. Trump's status as a New York real-estate developer was on the wane. After running into financial trouble in the 1990s, he would eventually shift to mostly licensing his name to developers around the globe. Yet he still had ambitions to develop in New York.
His dealings with the Bloomberg administration hit an early setback. City Hall officials rejected Mr. Trump's attempt to acquire 2 Columbus Circle, a property near Central Park in one of Manhattan's landmark intersections.
The city instead sold it to what is now called the Museum of Arts and Design. Dan Doctoroff, Mr. Bloomberg's deputy mayor for economic development, said he didn't hear from Mr. Trump again until the ""The Apprentice"" made its 2004 TV debut 18 months later.
""The next morning, I got a call from him out of the blue simply to tell me the ratings of 'The Apprentice,' which he then proceeded to do for the next three weeks in a row,"" Mr. Doctoroff said. ""In the development world that we were living in, that sort of post-9/11 period, we didn't have that much engagement with him.""
During Mr. Bloomberg's third term, Mr. Trump explored taking over Tavern on the Green, a restaurant in Central Park. He got a chilly response from City Hall. Then came Mr. Trump's shot at a golf course development in the Bronx.
Adrian Benepe, commissioner of the parks and recreation department for most of Mr. Bloomberg's tenure, said the city had promised decades earlier to turn the Ferry Point landfill into a public golf course.
City officials tried without success to find a developer willing to handle the conversion, which required extensive and costly environmental remediation.
The city ended up building the course with taxpayer money, Mr. Benepe said. He praised Mr. Trump's operation of the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point. But he was surprised to hear the Trump campaign in 2016 portray Mr. Trump's role as a single-handed rescue after years of municipal fumbling.
""It's a pants-on-fire lie,"" Mr. Benepe said. ""It was kind of a big telling moment that Trump would make up a completely fabricated story that was instantly and easily disprovable.""
A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization said, ""For over 30 years, before President Trump and the Trump Organization stepped in, Ferry Point was a stalled city project, in desperate need of rescue.""
On the town
R. Couri Hay, a publicist and New York society maven, said Mr. Bloomberg is a frequent guest at charity events and gala dinners in Manhattan and the Hamptons. ""Mayor Bloomberg likes to go out and about,"" Mr. Hay said. ""He's no stranger to putting on black tie, although often his is red.""
Mr. Trump ""famously doesn't go to a lot of parties,"" Mr. Hay said. ""He's more of a homebody.""
That wasn't always the case, said Jean Shafiroff, a Manhattan philanthropist. In the late 1980s, Mr. Trump and Ivana Trump, his wife at the time, ""were very big on the social scene and in philanthropy. They were at the New York City Ballet gala, pretty much everywhere.""
Mr. Bloomberg topped the Chronicle of Philanthropy's annual ranking of the top 50 biggest donors in the U.S. His charitable contributions totaled $3.3 billion in the past year. Mr. Trump hasn't made the list in its 20 years.
Mr. Bloomberg gets credit from many in New York's real-estate industry for helping rebuild lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Mr. Trump was more of an outsider, with few close friendships among real-estate developers. As mayor, Mr. Bloomberg would attend the Real Estate Board of New York's annual banquet. Mr. Trump was never a member of the powerful trade group, a spokesman said.
With no access to either man's unredacted tax records, evaluating wealth is an educated guess. Forbes estimated Mr. Trump's net worth at about $3 billion and Mr. Bloomberg's at around $60 billion.
Mr. Bloomberg, a lifelong Democrat, switched to the Republican Party before his first race for mayor in 2001. He left the GOP in 2007 as he flirted with a 2008 presidential bid. When asked on CNN about Mr. Bloomberg's prospects at the time, Mr. Trump said Mr. Bloomberg would be a formidable candidate because he could ""spend the money that it takes to get elected.""
Mr. Bloomberg decided not to run. He instead sought permission from the City Council to bust a law prohibiting him from serving more than two terms. Mr. Trump joined a chorus supporting Mr. Bloomberg's bid for a third term.
""I think in New York City real estate, developers are forced into a position where they try to be accommodative to the politicians,"" said Stephen Meister, an attorney who has represented Mr. Trump and known him since the 1980s.
Messrs. Trump and Bloomberg took opposite sides of a national debate in 2010, but the dispute contained none of the vitriol now being volleyed between them. That summer, Mr. Bloomberg stood on Governors Island, the Statue of Liberty behind him, to deliver a speech supporting a proposal to build a mosque and Islamic community center two blocks from where terrorists had toppled the World Trade Center.
Opposition grew, drawing in Mr. Trump. He offered to buy out one of the investors in the property on the condition no mosque be built within five blocks of ground zero. Mr. Trump said the proposed location wasn't appropriate.
Real-estate developer Sharif El-Gamal, one of the investors in the property, said he was surprised by Mr. Trump's offer.
""Even though he was polarizing against the project, what stood out for me is that he is a rational genius in a way,"" Mr. El-Gamal said. ""He is somebody that understands how to push buttons and is the greatest showman that I think we've ever seen.""
After Mr. Trump's offer was rebuffed, he appeared on CNN to criticize the proposal but not Mr. Bloomberg. ""He's a great mayor and he's a great friend of mine,"" Mr. Trump said in the TV interview. ""He feels very strongly about freedom of religion, and I understand that.""
In 2016, Mr. Bloomberg, who at that point had been unaffiliated with any political party for nearly a decade, briefly considered running for president as an independent. Mr. Bloomberg's younger daughter, Georgina Bloomberg, told W Magazine after her father decided against the idea that she was happy to have avoided campaign mudslinging with the Trumps.
""Donald Trump and his family have always been very close,"" she told the magazine. ""I'm good friends with his kids. I was not looking forward to having to watch our fathers go against each other.""
Ms. Bloomberg and Ivanka Trump, Mr. Trump's eldest daughter, both appeared in the 2003 documentary ""Born Rich.""
Mr. Bloomberg rejoined the Democratic Party in 2018, and he launched his bid for the Democratic nomination last fall.
In October, Georgina Bloomberg and Eric Trump's wife, Lara Trump, were co-chairwomen of the Rescue Dogs Rock NYC charity gala. They planned to headline a charity event for rescue dogs at Mar-a-Lago, the president's Florida resort, in March. The Palm Beach Post reported neither would attend because of scheduling conflicts.
After Mr. Bloomberg's first televised debate this month, largely panned, Mr. Trump lashed out at the former mayor.
""Mini Mike Bloomberg's debate performance tonight was perhaps the worst in the history of debates, and there have been some really bad ones. He was stumbling, bumbling and grossly incompetent,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. ""If this doesn't knock him out of the race, nothing will.""
Should Mr. Bloomberg face Mr. Trump in the general election, it will only get more heated, said New York public-relations executive Howard Rubenstein: ""There's some kind of war that will take place.""

WASHINGTON—With his anticipated acquittal in his impeachment trial a day away, President Trump was scheduled to deliver his annual State of the Union address Tuesday, striking an optimistic tone and touting the strong U.S. economy nine months before Election Day.
Mr. Trump told television anchors at a lunch Tuesday afternoon previewing the speech that his address would be ""extraordinarily low key,"" according to people familiar with the matter, and would last about 1½ hours.
The upbeat tone he was expected to strike stands in contrast to the outrage the Republican president often expresses on the campaign trail and on social media over the investigations that have dogged him for much of his presidency. In the speech, he is expected to focus on election themes, such as his plans for health care, the impact of economic growth on the middle class, and the wall along the southern border, according to aides.
With acquittal in the Senate on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress charges expected Wednesday afternoon, the speech comes at a moment when the president is feeling triumphant, according to people close to him. He spent part of the day Tuesday reveling in the
chaos in Iowa
over counting the results of the Democratic caucuses.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How would you grade the state of our union? Why? Join the conversation below.
The impeachment trial doesn't appear to have moved the president's approval ratings. Mr. Trump's job approval in the
most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll
late last month stood at 46%, with 51% disapproving, in line with results throughout his presidency.
Mr. Trump's advisers said he would largely avoid commenting on impeachment, even as he is scheduled to speak in front of the Democrats who sought to remove him from office.
House and Senate lawmakers, as well as Supreme Court justices and the president's cabinet typically attend the annual address, which is held in the House chamber. The top Democratic candidates—including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts—weren't expected to be in the audience. Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren were in New Hampshire for campaign events Tuesday. It is unclear if Mr. Trump will mention any of his opponents by name.
The president previewed his speech in a lunch meeting with television anchors at the White House on Tuesday afternoon. CNN said it was excluded from the event, but anchors from ABC, NBC, PBS, Fox News and other stations attended, people familiar with the meeting said.
Two of the people familiar with the nearly two-hour meeting said the president told the anchors that he isn't bitter about impeachment. He also praised conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh, who said on Monday he is being treated for advanced lung cancer. Mr. Trump said he had invited Mr. Limbaugh to the speech, but was unsure if he could make it. He said he intended to present him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the people said.
Mr. Trump also said war with Iran was ""closer than you thought."" The president's comment on Iran came after one attendee asked him how close the U.S. came to going to war with Iran earlier this year,
after the U.S. killed a top Iranian military commander, Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani
. Iran responded with a missile barrage on Iraqi bases housing U.S. and allied military forces that resulted in no deaths.
White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal didn't attend the event.
The theme of the speech, ""The Great American Comeback,"" echoed the core message of Mr. Trump's
recent remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland
, where the president cast himself as the architect of the booming U.S. economy. Voters consistently list the economy as a top issue, and the president's advisers view it as central to Mr. Trump's re-election chances.
As he did in his remarks in Davos, Mr. Trump plans to tout what he calls a ""blue-collar boom,"" part of an effort to highlight how his policies are helping the middle class, aides said. The president plans to trumpet the economic effects of a pair of recent trade agreements: the
newly approved U.S.-Mexico-Canada deal
and a
""phase one"" deal with China
.
He is expected to emphasize his administration's efforts to help working families, including his support of paid family leave and affordable child care. Lowering the cost of health care, as well as the cost of prescription drugs, are scheduled to be a major theme of the speech, aides said.

The issue of health care will present Mr. Trump with an opening to criticize his Democratic opponents. ""He will contrast his vision with radical proposals being floated on the left,"" a senior administration official said. Mr. Trump is expected to echo comments he made in his 2019 address
criticizing efforts ""to adopt socialism in our country.""

Drew Hammill, the deputy chief of staff to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), said, ""President Trump ran in 2016 on the Democratic policies of making health care affordable for everybody and negotiating lower drug prices. He has broken both of those promises with his ongoing crusade to repeal protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions, putting a pharmaceutical executive in charge of drug prices, and siding with Big Pharma against the House's game-changing Lower Drug Prices Now Act.""
The president plans to call on Congress to approve legislation implementing his vision on health care, school choice and other issues, according to aides. Bitterly divided and with the election later this year, Congress is unlikely to pass major legislation before November.
Mr. Trump is expected to highlight immigration, an issue that animates his supporters. In addition to giving an update on his efforts to build a wall along the southern border, the president is expected to take aim at sanctuary cities. Lastly, Mr. Trump is planning to talk about national security, aides said.

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration said it is making an additional 35,000 seasonal guest-worker visas available this year ahead of the busy summer season, the largest increase since President Trump took office.
The additional visas announced Thursday by the Department of Homeland Security will bring the total available this year to 101,000, though the additional visas will primarily be made available to returning workers.
The seasonal-worker visa program, known as H-2B, enables U.S. employers to hire as many as 66,000 foreign workers a year, with the allotments split evenly between the winter and summer seasons. Congress permits the Department of Homeland Security each year to raise that cap by as many as 64,000 additional visas. This year's cap is slightly higher than the 30,000 workers the administration allowed last year.
DHS is adding new restrictions on the additional visas, which some administration officials and outside critics of the move said could limit how many of the visas will actually be used.
The visas will become available to employers in two tranches: 20,000 immediately and an additional 15,000 for employees beginning work on or after May 15.
Of the 35,000 total, 10,000 will be set aside for workers from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, the only countries that will be allowed to send new applicants. Those three Central American countries, collectively known as the Northern Triangle, accounted for the majority of asylum seekers crossing the border illegally last year. DHS officials said that providing these people a pathway to work lawfully in the U.S. will reduce the incentive to migrate illegally.
""The department is taking significant steps to promote integrity in the program, combat fraud and abuse, and ensure the supplemental allocation aligns with the national interest,"" a DHS spokeswoman said.
The additional visas are being made available ahead of the summer, when demand for short-term work is typically highest. Still, demand has routinely outstripped the available cap. Landscapers, fisheries, county fairs and holiday resorts -- including President Trump's own golf and beach clubs -- all use the H-2B program to fill lower-skilled jobs.
The departments of Homeland Security and Labor had for weeks pushed for the cap to be raised by 45,000 additional visas this year, more in line with industry demands.
That higher number of visas had been approved by the White House. But the administration began facing backlash from groups advocating more immigration restrictions after The Wall Street Journal reported on the administration's plan. Stephen Miller, President Trump's top immigration adviser, argued internally that proceeding with the higher number risked displeasing the president's base, which views immigration skeptically, as the election season ramps up, people familiar with the discussions said.
The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.
Thursday's decision comes amid a broader debate inside the Trump administration over legal immigration, with some officials arguing American workers will see wages rise only if foreign workers are prevented from competing with them for jobs and undercutting them, while others believe more immigrants are needed to sustain the economic growth that Mr. Trump will put at the center of his re-election campaign.

WASHINGTON—Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said the House would move forward next week on sending the articles of impeachment to the Senate, ending a tense standoff and setting the stage for the trial of President Trump, the third of its kind in the nation's history.
Mrs. Pelosi
had withheld the articles
for several weeks as Democrats sought assurances that the Senate trial would include new documents and testimony from witnesses blocked previously by the White House.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) made no such guarantees and said he would set his own rules. On Thursday he signed onto a resolution to dismiss the articles against Mr. Trump unless they were sent over soon, a move that Mrs. Pelosi said prompted her to act.
""A dismissal is a cover-up and deprives the American people of the truth,"" Mrs. Pelosi wrote in a letter to colleagues Friday. ""Leader McConnell's tactics are a clear indication of the fear that he and President Trump have regarding the facts of the President's violations for which he was impeached.""
Asked about Mrs. Pelosi's announcement, Mr. McConnell said, ""About time.""
The Senate leader has ramped up his criticism of the delay in recent days, saying Thursday that Democrats ""have initiated one of the most grave and most unsettling processes in our Constitution and then refused to allow a resolution.""
To send the articles to the Senate, the House must vote on a resolution that names impeachment managers and delivers documents to the chamber. The vote would transmit the articles and automatically trigger a Senate trial. The exact timing of the vote is unclear. Mrs. Pelosi said she had asked House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) to prepare that resolution for a vote next week and said she would consult with House Democrats on Tuesday.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you think President Trump's Senate impeachment trial should include witnesses and the introduction of new documents? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
The Democratic-led House
approved two impeachment articles
in late December. The first alleges that Mr. Trump's efforts to press Ukraine to launch investigations that could benefit him politically in the 2020 election constituted abuse of power. The second article alleges that White House efforts to block key witness testimony amounts to obstruction of Congress. Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing, and he has urged the House to send over the articles so the Senate could begin its trial.
Mr. McConnell, who has been coordinating with the White House on the impeachment strategy, has
said he has enough Republican support
to move forward on the proceedings without bipartisan agreement on the trial's structure. Under his plan, senators would wait to determine whether to include witnesses until after the trial begins.
He told Republicans at lunch on Thursday to expect to start a trial next week. Senators will be required to be present for the trial, the rules for which Mr. McConnell has said would be similar to those used to conduct the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton. Those rules allowed each side to have 24 hours of opening arguments, followed by a period of written questions from senators, submitted to either the prosecution or the defense through the Supreme Court's chief justice, who would preside in the Senate chamber. Lawmakers could also call for votes to summon witnesses, which would require 51 senators to agree to do so. The Senate has 53 Republicans and 47 members of the Democratic caucus. Even in 1999, however, Democrats and Republicans couldn't agree on the subject of witnesses, however. A resolution dealing with witnesses passed largely along party lines later in the trial.
""The 1999 precedent does not guarantee witnesses or foreclose witnesses,"" Mr. McConnell said earlier this week. ""It leaves those determinations until later in the trial, where they belong.""
Democrats accused Republicans of setting their own rules without bipartisan support to serve Mr. Trump. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has indicated that once the trial begins, Democrats will offer motions about whether to subpoena witnesses and documents. Because four Republicans would have to join Democrats to reach the majority needed to pass such motions, those votes will put pressure on GOP senators in tough re-election contests.
""Senate Democrats are ready for the trial to begin and will do everything we can to see that the truth comes out,"" Mr. Schumer said Friday.
Mrs. Pelosi said her delay in transmitting the articles had borne fruit. In her letter to Democrats, the speaker pointed to former national-security adviser John Bolton's statement on Monday
saying he would be willing to testify
, and new emails published last week
showing the Pentagon was concerned
about the White House decision to freeze security aid to Ukraine at the same time that Mr. Trump was seeking the investigations.
Still, Mrs. Pelosi didn't get what she wanted from the Senate. She had called for Mr. McConnell to publish the resolution outlining his rules for a trial before she selected impeachment managers and sent the articles. The leader has released nothing in writing showing how he plans to structure the full trial, leaving him room to change the format as long as he has the majority of senators' agreement.
Democrats in recent days had expressed doubts that any additional leverage could be gained by further delay. A number of Senate Democrats said in the past week that Mrs. Pelosi should send over articles, and some House Democrats in competitive districts wanted the articles to be moved quickly, as they saw a continued focus on impeachment hurting their ability to focus on issues such as health care and infrastructure.
Besides Mr. Bolton, Senate Democrats have called for testimony from acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney; his aide, Robert Blair; and Office of Management and Budget official Michael Duffey.
Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) said Friday she was talking to a few Republican colleagues to allow for witnesses to be included, including those sought by Democrats and her own caucus.
""I am hopeful that we can reach an agreement on how to proceed with the trial that will allow the opportunity for witnesses for both the House managers and the President's counsel if they choose to do so,"" she said.
Mr. Trump indicated Friday that he would invoke executive privilege in an attempt to block Mr. Bolton from testifying. ""You have to for the sake of the office,"" the president told Fox News.
Mr. Bolton's lawyer didn't respond to a request for comment. A Senate Democratic aide said it was too early to say how Democrats would respond, such as by going to court, if Mr. Trump moved to block Mr. Bolton's testimony.

WASHINGTON—House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday
named a diverse group
of seven lawmakers to present the House's case for the removal of President Trump in the
coming Senate impeachment trial
.
The impeachment managers will act akin to prosecutors in a criminal proceeding.
Mrs. Pelosi told reporters Wednesday she chose the lawmakers with an emphasis on litigation and courtroom experience. One of the managers, Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, was a staff aide to a member of the House Judiciary Committee in 1974 during the impeachment proceedings against President Richard Nixon.
Most of the managers come from safe Democratic seats. One exception is Jason Crow, a first-term congressman who flipped a Republican seat in suburban Denver.
""It's racial, it's gender, it's regional, it's ideological and it's religious diversity,"" said New York Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of the group. ""But most importantly, every single one of those members are serious individuals with either a law or law-enforcement background.""
Adam Schiff (D., Calif.)
The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Schiff is a close ally of Mrs. Pelosi and a top target of Mr. Trump's ire on Twitter and at campaign rallies.
Mr. Schiff has led the impeachment investigation since it launched in September, deposing witnesses and presiding over hearings. His position on impeachment was a bellwether for many in the caucus, because he was reluctant to pursue impeachment until he became aware of a whistleblower's complaint that Mr. Trump pushed
Ukraine to launch probes
that could be politically beneficial to him.
The 59-year-old Democrat has represented his affluent Southern California district since 2001, after he defeated a Republican who had voted to impeach President Bill Clinton and served as one of the House managers during the 1999 Senate trial.
Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.)
As chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Mr. Nadler controls the committees that prepared the articles of impeachment against the president and set the scope of the charges.
In 2007, Mr. Nadler resisted the calls to impeach President George Bush, saying that doing so would be pointless and would distract from the presidential election. In 2019, as calls to impeach the president grew, Mr. Nadler said he wanted clear evidence that would push some supporters of the president to support impeachment. Still, when the findings of the Mueller report showed President Trump attempted to interfere with the investigation, he began to pursue impeachment in his committee, before the House launched a formal impeachment investigation over the Ukraine matter.
Mr. Nadler, 72, served in the New York State assembly from 1977 to 1992, when he was elected to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives. His congressional district includes Manhattan's Upper West Side, Greenwich Village and Wall Street areas, and some Brooklyn neighborhoods.
Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.)
Mr. Jeffries is chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, the No. 4 leadership spot, and is widely viewed as a potential House speaker.
He also sits on the House Judiciary Committee, the perch from which he had a firsthand role in impeachment proceedings. He was initially cautious about endorsing impeaching Mr. Trump, in contrast to progressives on the panel who pushed earlier for the president's removal, so he brings the balanced tone that Democrats hope will be persuasive during a Senate trial.
The 49-year-old black lawmaker represents large parts of Brooklyn and a section of Queens.
Val Demings (D., Fla.)
As a member of both the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees, Ms. Demings was one of the few House lawmakers who questioned witnesses at every impeachment hearing.
Ms. Demings, 62, was the first woman to lead the Orlando Police Department. When Republicans criticized Democrats for holding the initial phase of the impeachment inquiry in secret, Ms. Demings drew on her law-enforcement background to argue investigations are conducted in private before the evidence is presented in public.
First elected in 2016, Ms. Demings is a member of the centrist New Democrat Coalition and the Congressional Black Caucus, and will bring ideological and racial diversity to the panel.
Jason Crow (D., Colo.)
The freshman lawmaker from Colorado is a former Army Ranger who served three combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. A lawyer, he is member of the House Armed Services and Small Business Committees.
Mr. Crow, 40, is the first Democrat to represent his district. He joined with six other Democrats with national-security backgrounds to co-write an editorial in September arguing that if President Trump had indeed pressured Ukraine to investigate his political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, it would be an impeachable offense.
The editorial helped drive a shift among Democratic holdouts on impeachment. Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Pelosi announced she would back an impeachment inquiry for the first time.
Sylvia Garcia (D., Texas)
Ms. Garcia, 69, is one of the first two Latinas to represent Texas in Congress.
Early in her career, she worked as a social worker and legal aid lawyer. Before her election to Congress in 2018, she served as Houston City controller, Harris County commissioner and Texas state senator. Ms. Garcia also was the director and presiding judge of the Houston Municipal System. She serves on the Judiciary Committee, which drafted the impeachment articles against President Trump.
Zoe Lofgren (D., Calif.)
Ms. Lofgren is the No. 2 Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. She brings a unique background to the impeachment trial, having served as an aide to a member of the House Judiciary Committee in 1974 when it voted to send articles of impeachment against President Nixon to the full House.
A close ally of Mrs. Pelosi, she was careful about supporting impeachment, waiting until late last year to endorse the president's removal.

WASHINGTON—In six days of arguments on the Senate floor, Democrats and the White House defense team sparred over whether the president abused the power of his office and obstructed Congress—and whether those actions would merit his removal from office.
President Trump's defense team on Tuesday concluded its three days of arguments in the impeachment trial, in which the lawyers sought to rebut Democrats' allegations of wrongdoing by the president and dismiss the investigation as a politically motivated stunt.
Their arguments followed three days of sessions in which Democrats, who sought to persuade senators of the urgent need to remove Mr. Trump—whom they described as a threat to democracy—from office. In one major development after the Democrats finished their arguments, the New York Times revealed that former national-security adviser John Bolton, in a draft of his forthcoming book, wrote that Mr. Trump told him aid to Ukraine was conditioned on investigations.
Here is a breakdown of the arguments the House Democratic impeachment managers made on key points, and how the Trump team responded:
Ukraine Aid
Impeachment Managers: The Democrats alleged Mr. Trump leveraged nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine to pressure Kyiv to undertake investigations that could benefit him politically. Democrats said that amounted to an effort to interfere in the 2020 election. The aid was released after pressure from Congress.
Trump's Defense: Mr. Trump's team noted the aid to Ukraine was released in September without any announcement of investigations by Ukraine. President Trump denied the conversation Mr. Bolton described in his book. Alan Dershowitz, a member of the Trump legal team, argued that even if the conversation did take place as Mr. Bolton described, it wouldn't amount to an impeachable offense.
July 25 Call
Impeachment Managers: Democrats said the White House sought to cover up a July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president—in which Mr. Trump asked him to investigate Democrat Joe Biden and his son and alleged election interference—by moving the transcript to a classified server typically reserved for the nation's top secrets.
Trump's Defense: Lawyers said the White House wasn't seeking to hide the transcript of the July 25 phone call because it was both preserved on a White House server and, in September, made public. The lawyers also pointed to the fact that Mr. Trump didn't link aid to investigations on the call.
Articles of Impeachment
Impeachment Managers: Aside from blocking aid, Democrats said, the president obstructed the impeachment investigation by blocking evidence and testimony sought by House investigators—including that of Mr. Bolton.
Trump's Defense: The president's team argued the articles of impeachment are constitutionally deficient and overly broad. The lawyers also argued that Democrats don't allege that the president committed a crime, which they said is necessary to warrant removal from office. In past impeachments, lawyers—some of whom are now serving on Mr. Trump's team—have argued a crime wasn't necessary to impeach a president.
Trump's Removal From Office
Impeachment Managers: The president poses a national-security threat to the country and, said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), an ""imminent threat to the integrity of our democracy"" and therefore must be removed prior to the 2020 election.
Trump's Defense: Mr. Trump's lawyers said the president is up for re-election in less than 10 months and the choice should be left to the voters. The lawyers also countered Democrats' calls for urgency in removing the president from office by noting that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) waited a month to turn over the articles of impeachment to the Senate.
Senate Witnesses
Impeachment Managers: Democrats argued the Senate should call new witnesses—among them Mr. Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney— who could offer first-hand accounts of the president's motivation for holding up aid to Ukraine.
Trump's Defense: The president's team said the House was responsible for collecting testimony and documents, and in voting for the articles of impeachment determined it had enough evidence to warrant the president's removal from office. Therefore there is no need to prolong the trial, they argued.

RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif.—Republican senators facing tight re-election battles remained loyal to President Trump during
the Senate impeachment trial
. Now, they are reaping the rewards.
Mr. Trump is set to hold campaign rallies this week with
two of the most vulnerable GOP senators
: Martha McSally of Arizona and Cory Gardner of Colorado. Both hail from states that will be competitive in the presidential election in November and hope Mr. Trump's visit will help them rally voters and raise money.
Since the impeachment trial, Ms. McSally—who has deployed Trump-style tactics such as criticizing a CNN reporter as a ""liberal hack"" last month when he sought an interview from her in the Capitol—has doubled down on her support for the president. In recent days, her campaign began airing a new ad against her opponent,
former astronaut Mark Kelly
, criticizing his support for impeachment and calling him ""too liberal for Arizona.""
Jacob Peters, Mr. Kelly's communications director, criticized the ad as ""more of the same negative and false attack ads that Arizonans are tired of and rejected in 2018.""
""This one is tough as hell,"" Mr. Trump said of Ms. McSally as he introduced her at Wednesday's rally. ""She's a warrior."" He said she had his ""complete and total support and endorsement.""
Ms. McSally in turn heaped praise on the president. ""I am flying on your wing, President Trump,"" she said. Her Twitter account posted a video of her on stage shortly afterward.
Ms. McSally and Mr. Gardner both voted against calling witnesses in the Senate impeachment trial and subsequently to acquit the president. When Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) told Republican senators that
he didn't have the votes
yet to block new witnesses desired by Democrats from being called in the trial, Ms. McSally and Mr. Gardner addressed their colleagues, people familiar with the matter said. Days later, the Senate voted against new testimony.
Appearing with the president carries risk for the two senators, who during the impeachment trial faced the choice of breaking with Mr. Trump and inciting his wrath, or rallying behind him and intensifying Democratic attacks. Embracing the president on stage will help the senators rally the Republican base, but also serve as a reminder to Democrats and independents of how they cast their votes on impeachment.
""The senators risk alienating voters who don't like the president by declining to distance themselves from Trump. But virtually all Republican elected officials have made the calculation that it's more risky to oppose the president and alienate his Republican supporters,"" said Nathan Gonzales, editor and publisher of Insider Politics. But Mr. Gardner and Ms. McSally are in a ""tough spot,"" he said. ""They have to compile a coalition that includes voters who like and dislike President Trump. Simply rallying Republicans is not enough for either of them to win.""
In a fundraising email Tuesday, the Democratic National Committee singled out Ms. McSally and Mr. Gardner's votes to acquit the president. They ""want voters to believe they won't just fall in line behind Trump,"" the email said. ""But when it came down to it, they voted with nearly every other Republican senator to give a green light to Trump's corruption.""
The president, who plans to spend four days out West this week attending rallies and fundraisers, is scheduled to arrive Wednesday evening in Phoenix. In 2018, Ms. McSally lost to now-Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) in a race for Arizona's other seat, but was subsequently appointed to the Senate by the state's governor to fill a vacancy.
On Thursday, Mr. Trump is set to travel to Colorado Springs, Colo., for a rally with Mr. Gardner, who defeated his Democratic opponent six years ago by less than 2 percentage points. Mr. Gardner faces a likely matchup with former state Gov. John Hickenlooper, who is running for the Democratic nomination.
The president will continue to campaign for vulnerable Republican senators in the coming months as the GOP looks to keep control of the Senate in an election cycle
more favorable to Democrats
. Some 23 Republican-held seats are up for election in November, including four open seats, compared with 11 Democratic seats on the ballot. Democrats need three Senate seats to win control of the chamber if they also win the White House this fall; if Mr. Trump is re-elected, Democrats must net four seats to overcome the vice president's tiebreaking vote.
For Mr. Trump, this week's Western swing also offers him an opportunity to engage in one of his favored campaigning strategies: counterprogramming.
Wednesday's rally in Phoenix is set to begin at the same time as the Democratic debate 300 miles away in Las Vegas. Wednesday will be the first time on the debate stage for Mike Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who in recent weeks has become a focus of the president's ire.
Mr. Trump has
made his presence known
in the states where Democrats have begun voting, holding rallies and sending surrogates to Iowa and New Hampshire earlier this month. With Democrats set to caucus in Nevada on Saturday, he is spending three nights at his hotel in Las Vegas this week and is scheduled to hold a campaign rally at the Las Vegas Convention Center on Friday afternoon. He also plans to travel to South Carolina before the primary there next week
""It seems to be effective,"" he told reporters on Tuesday. He didn't offer specifics.
Mr. Trump is also attending high-dollar fundraisers out West. A fundraiser Tuesday in Los Angeles and another Wednesday in Rancho Mirage, Calif.,—hosted by Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison—collectively raised $14 million for a joint account between the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee, a Republican official said.
In his remarks to about 250 supporters, he criticized the Democratic presidential candidates' policies—in particular the health-care overhaul proposed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who he said was looking to ""give away free stuff to everybody,"" an attendee said. He also praised his own efforts, the attendee said, telling supporters his job was harder than it looked.

Facebook Inc. removed Trump campaign ads that referred to a census, saying they violated
a company policy
aimed at preventing disinformation and other interference with the nationwide 2020 census, which goes online next week.
The ads, which began running on the social network this week, asked people to take the ""Official 2020 Congressional District Census"" and then directed users to a website for fundraising to support Mr. Trump's re-election. ""The information we gather from this survey will help us craft our strategies for YOUR CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT,"" the ads said.

What steps should social-media companies take to help reduce online disinformation surrounding the U.S. census? Join the conversation below.
Facebook said Thursday that it was the first time the company removed a Trump campaign ad for violating its census interference policy. ""There are policies to prevent confusion around the U.S. Census, and this is an example of those being enforced,"" a Facebook spokesman said.
The ads were paid for by Trump Make America Great Again Committee, a joint fundraising committee of Donald J. Trump for President Inc. and the Republican National Committee. Representatives for Mr. Trump's re-election effort didn't respond to requests for comment.
Facebook and other social media platforms are under scrutiny for the way they handle political ads to prevent disinformation during this year's election season, and many of those same concerns have also come up with the 2020 census.
The census, which is required to take an accurate count of the population and apportion congressional seats, takes place once a decade. The 2020 census will be the first one where most Americans are asked to respond online, raising new challenges about security and preventing bad information from discouraging participation.
The Trump campaign ads were posted on Facebook pages for President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and began running earlier this week. The Republican National Committee began circulating a similar ad via mail last year.
Tech and politics newsletter Popular Information initially reported on the Trump campaign Facebook ads related to a census.
Some of the campaign ads remained active, while others were inactive, as of Thursday afternoon, according to Facebook's ad library.
The ads drew heat from Democrats on Capitol Hill on Thursday who said the campaign solicitations might confuse people, whose participation in the census is crucial to obtaining an accurate nationwide count.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, before the ads were removed, ""This is, on the part of Facebook, a robust unacceptable interference in the census.""
She added at her weekly news conference, ""I know the profit motive is their business model, but it should not come at the cost of counting who is in our country so that we can provide the services.""
Asked about the ads at a Senate hearing, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told lawmakers that he has ""asked the career staff at census to look into this and see what appropriate action, if any, we should be taking to deal with it.""
New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said the Republican National Committee mailing seemed to be deliberately trying to cause confusion.
""They don't know the difference between this document and what comes out officially from the census,"" she said.
""That could be,"" Mr. Ross said in response.
Facebook said the Trump campaign ads were in violation of the policy because they are misleading about how to participate in the official U.S. Census.
Census officials have raised concerns that social media platforms may be used to spread misinformation about the count. Facebook said it anticipates census interference may increase as it gets closer to Census Day.
The census is fully available next week, going online Thursday. Mailings from the Census Bureau urging people to participate will also begin arriving at homes next week.
Facebook announced in December a policy designed to prevent census interference by banning misleading information about ""when and how to participate in the census and the consequences of participating."" It also banned ads portraying census participation ""as useless or meaningless"" or advising people not to participate, according to the announcement.
The company, in its announcement of the new census-related policy, also referenced work it has done with the civil rights community as well as monthslong efforts among Facebook, the U.S. Census Bureau and experts with diverse backgrounds to develop appropriate rules to prohibit census interference on its platforms.
But some of those groups, including the Leadership Conference Education Fund, which works to promote and protect civil and human rights, pushed back on the time it took to take down the Trump campaign ads.
""While we're gratified that Facebook shut down Trump's attempt to sow confusion about how and when to participate in the 2020 Census, it's disturbing that the ads weren't immediately removed,"" a statement from Vanita Gupta, president and chief executive of the Education Fund said.

DESERT HILLS, Ariz.—Four years ago, the relatively humdrum scene never would have happened: A week before Christmas, more than three dozen Democrats filed into a public school cafeteria to go over their finances and organizing goals, and to hear from a local candidate.
The Maricopa County Democratic Party didn't have much of a presence in this traditionally Republican, suburban area until President Trump's election in 2016, when Ann Olsen, a 59-year-old physical therapist, decided to organize a local committee, suspecting there were others who were motivated by his surprise win.
""Even though I knew it was red…I knew those people were there, and I wasn't crazy for feeling the way I felt,"" Ms. Olsen said.
Now, these Democrats are part of a growing network trying to win in some of the most hotly contested states in next year's presidential and Senate elections. Arizona went President Trump's way in 2016, and Republicans say they are confident he'll bring out his voters again. But recent demographic and voting trends indicate the GOP faces a tougher path in 2020.

Democrats saw gains in all but two of Arizona's counties in 2018, when Sen. Kyrsten Sinema became the state's
first Democrat elected to the Senate
since 1988. The state is also experiencing a population boom in suburban and exurban areas where voters are supporting Democrats in greater numbers.
Those factors are drawing heightened amounts of money and attention to a state that has voted for a Democrat in the presidential election only once since 1948.
Priorities U.S.A., a Democratic super PAC, is spending $2 million on digital advertising in the state. The Democratic National Committee is adding staff and training field organizers months before it did in 2016, aiming to have infrastructure in place for whichever candidate emerges as the nominee.
David Bergstein, a DNC spokesman focused on battleground states, said the party sees an opportunity to contrast Democratic
positions on health care
and the economy with Mr. Trump's record in traditionally Republican suburban areas that played a big role in Ms. Sinema's victory.
""The result of the 2018 race, and the way voters rejected his record of broken promises on issues like health care and taxes, makes it clear that this is a big liability for him,"" he said of Mr. Trump.
Rick Gorka, a spokesman for the Trump Victory committee, the joint fundraising operation of Mr. Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee, said that while the state will be competitive, the campaign doesn't believe Democrats can repeat the gains they made here in 2018.
""What we are finding with President Trump is that he brings out an electorate, unlike any other traditional Republican. And if Donald Trump is not on the ballot, there are folks that are simply just not going to go out to the polls,"" Mr. Gorka said of the 2018 results.
Mr. Gorka said the campaign has identified 200,000 Arizona voters who supported the president in 2016 but didn't vote in 2018. The Trump reelection effort is working to bring those people back to the polls in 2020 by deploying thousands of volunteers, armed with scripts tailored by the Republican Party's cache of data on individual voters' personal characteristics.

The stakes are high because if Mr. Trump were to lose Arizona's 11 electoral votes in 2020, he would have to hang onto more of the Midwestern states that he won by close margins four years ago and that Democrats are also contesting fiercely.
Republicans will also be defending the seat currently held by Sen. Martha McSally, who lost to Ms. Sinema but was
appointed to fill the seat vacated
when Sen. John McCain died. Ms. McSally, who
faces a primary challenger
but has the support of national Republican groups, is likely to face Democrat Mark Kelly, the former astronaut and husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.
Recent polling
suggests a dead heat in that race as well as in the presidential race.
Any path to winning Arizona runs through Maricopa County, home to Phoenix, 2.4 million registered voters and 62% of the state's population. In 2016, Mr. Trump carried it by 3 percentage points, and the state overall by 3.5 percentage points. But in 2018, Ms. Sinema took it 51% to 47% and won the state by 2.5 percentage points.
A critical part of Ms. Sinema's win was driving up turnout in the heavily Democratic areas of central Phoenix and winning in the northern and western parts of the city's suburban ring that went for Mr. Trump in 2016, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from OpenElections, a nonprofit effort that collects and publishes official precinct results.
Ms. Sinema also outperformed 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton in heavily Latino areas within Maricopa County, where Brendan Walsh, the organizing director with Unite Here Local 11, which represents thousands of hospitality workers in Southern California and Arizona, has been working for over a decade.
Mr. Walsh said the union helped drive up turnout in minority communities in 2018 by arguing that the president was hurting communities of color. In suburban areas, he said the union also contrasted Ms. Sinema and Ms. McSally on health care and education. They knocked on more than 400,000 doors in 2018, he said, and plan to knock on 600,000 doors this cycle.

Rae Chornenky, chairman of the Maricopa County Republican Committee, said she's confident having Mr. Trump at the top of the ticket in 2020 will outweigh Democratic organizing efforts.
""I feel much more secure and solid about the Republican victory results in November of 2020,"" Ms. Chornenky said. But she added the party needs to do more to reach out to suburban women, a group she said can be a weak spot for the president.

Will Arizona turn blue in 2020? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
Ms. Olsen, the physical therapist who became an activist after Mr. Trump won, isn't counting on flipping her state legislative district, which covers largely Republican Yavapai County and a small section of Maricopa County.
But she's optimistic that increased turnout here will help other Democrats, and she's seeing small signs her area is turning bluer. At this year's Veterans Day parade, Ms. Olsen said, when the Democratic Party float came by, more people gave her a thumbs-up than the year before. Some even clapped.

President Trump is campaigning for re-election in 2020 by saying he has made great progress in reducing drug prices. But the issue has been a source of frustration for him recently, according to people familiar with the matter, as polling shows a majority of Americans disapprove of his handling of the issue and Democratic challengers for the White House focus on how his initiatives have stalled.
Key parts of the president's plan to combat prescription costs have been blocked by courts, dropped by the administration or delayed. Meanwhile, drug companies this year have raised prices for hundreds of medications.
Fifty-four percent of Americans disapprove of Mr. Trump's handling of the costs of prescription drugs,
according to a January poll
by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
The lack of a major success is needling Mr. Trump, who has become frustrated without a signature accomplishment on drug pricing, according to people familiar with the matter. He has taken to task Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, a former pharmaceutical executive tasked with driving down drug prices, one of these people said.
Democratic rivals vying for their party's nomination have also targeted Mr. Trump on the issue. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently ran an ad saying ""Trump did nothing"" on prescription costs. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, at a rally this month in Denver, said beating Mr. Trump would amount to taking on the pharmaceutical industry, suggesting the president hadn't done so. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar has repeatedly said Mr. Trump broke his promise to bring down drug prices.
Mr. Trump has publicly characterized his work on lowering drug costs as an achievement while blaming Democrats for blocking more progress. In his State of the Union speech this month, he said that the cost of prescription drugs went down.
""Because of President Trump's leadership, last year drug prices fell for the first time in almost 50 years, and he will continue to consider any and all tools to ensure that the decline continues,"" said deputy White House press secretary Judd Deere.
Health analysts have questioned the assertion. Deciphering price trends in drugs is difficult because many of the measurements are imperfect or incomplete.
More than 60 drugmakers raised prices in the U.S. at the start of 2020, but the
acceleration in prices had slowed year-to-year
, according to an analysis from Rx Savings Solutions, which sells software to help employers and health plans choose the least-expensive medicines.
Consumer prices for prescription drugs
rose 3% from December 2018 to December 2019
, according to the Labor Department.
Some health analysts say Mr. Trump, who has built much of his health-policy platform on reducing drug prices, could feel pressure to release bolder drug-pricing regulations before the election.
""His campaign is going to be focused on health care,"" said Robert Blendon, a health policy professor at Harvard University. ""The economy, for the average person, is getting better except for these pocketbook health-care issues. They're going to hold him responsible.""
Some voters, such as Jacqueline Means, 73 years old, said they still don't know if Democratic presidential candidates or Mr. Trump offer the best approach to tackle drug costs. Ms. Means's partner, Ed, got a bone-marrow transplant to treat his leukemia. The cost of one of his drugs was $89,000 for the month.
""The drug companies are way out of whack,"" said Ms. Means, of Portland, Ore.
The president sounded optimistic when he
unveiled his plan
to curb prescription prices in May 2018 in the White House Rose Garden. Standing behind a blue banner that read 'Lower Drug Prices for Americans,"" Mr. Trump said his blueprint would mean ""much lower prices at the pharmacy counter.""
One element of the plan called for drugmakers to put list prices in television ads. That requirement
was blocked in July by a federal court
, however, after Amgen Inc., Merck & Co., Eli Lilly & Co. sued.
Another part of the plan aimed to end drug rebates to middlemen in Medicare. The administration
dropped that idea in July
because it would cost about $200 billion over a decade.
And the plan's aim to
tie some drug prices to the lower costs in other countries
has stalled since it was formally proposed in October 2018. White House health officials have sparred over the policy, according to the people familiar with the matter.
Now, White House health advisers are working with congressional lawmakers to support a bill to bring down prices. Mr. Trump, who is eager for a win on drug pricing, is accusing Democrats of blocking the measure to score political points.
""We're also ready to lower drug prices very substantially,"" Mr. Trump told governors on a Feb. 10 White House session. ""But to get them really down, we have to do exactly what we're doing. We need the votes of the Democrats, and they just didn't have time to do anything.""
House Democrats in December passed legislation that would let Medicare negotiate the price for some costly drugs. Republicans remain opposed. Mr. Trump has called for bipartisan legislation and the White House has laid out what it would like in a bill.
The Trump administration has had some successes, including a faster-paced approval of new generic drugs that can drive down prices. Mr. Trump also signed legislation in 2018 that empowers pharmacists and insurers to inform consumers they could pay less out of pocket for certain drugs.
The administration has also supported states that want to re-import lower-priced drugs from Canada, even though Canadian officials have balked at the idea over concerns it could undermine their drug supply.
But many voters remain frustrated.
""Whatever they're doing, they're just talking,"" said Ruth Rinehart, 69, of Tampa, Fla., who has turned to getting drugs in Canada because of their cost in the U.S. ""I want somebody to do something.""

WASHINGTON—A draft of a forthcoming book from former national security adviser John Bolton alleges that President Trump told him in August that he wanted to keep aid to Ukraine frozen until the country aided investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. The development threatened to throw into turmoil the careful choreography of the Senate impeachment trial of Mr. Trump.
Mr. Bolton's claim, which was reported by the New York Times and confirmed by a lawyer for Mr. Bolton, goes to the heart of Democrats'
impeachment inquiry
and contradicts the White House's argument that the decision to hold up nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine wasn't related to the president's push for investigations there. Democrats have said the president abused his power by leveraging aid approved by Congress to get a foreign leader to undertake actions that would benefit him politically.
Mr. Trump late Sunday evening denied Mr. Bolton's allegations. ""I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens,"" the president tweeted. ""In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book.""
Mr. Bolton's lawyer, Charles Cooper, said he sent a copy of his manuscript to the National Security Council in December so it could be reviewed for classified information, adding that he did so on the assurance that the contents of the book wouldn't be disclosed to anyone not involved in that process.
""It is clear, regrettably, from The New York Times article published today that the prepublication review process has been corrupted and that information has been disclosed by persons other than those properly involved in reviewing the manuscript,"" Mr. Cooper said.
News of the manuscript's claims comes on the eve of the defense team's second session on the Senate floor, in which it was expected to present the bulk of its argument. The White House didn't respond to requests for comment on Mr. Bolton's description of his conversation with the president.
Democrats immediately intensified their calls for the Senate to vote in favor of calling more witnesses later this week, chief among them Mr. Bolton, who has said he would testify if he were subpoenaed by the Senate. Details of what Mr. Bolton might say could sway the four Republican senators who have said they are on the fence about the vote in favor of more testimony. If all Democrats vote in favor, they would need four Republicans to join them for the vote to pass.
""It is now up to four Senate Republicans to support bringing in Mr. Bolton... as well as the key documents we have requested to ensure all the evidence is presented at the onset of a Senate trial,"" said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. Democrats have also wanted to bring in acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and two other witnesses.
The White House has sought to block testimony by Mr. Bolton and the other witnesses on the Democrats' list.
Mr. Trump said in a news conference last week that testimony by Mr. Bolton would be a ""national security problem"" and added: ""I don't know if we left on the best of terms. I would say probably not.""
Mr. Bolton's book also includes details of cabinet officials' discussions about Ukraine and about Rudy Giuliani, the president's personal attorney who led the campaign for investigations in Ukraine, according to the New York Times. Mr. Bolton wrote that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said privately that Mr. Giuliani's claims that the ambassador to Ukraine was corrupt weren't true, and that he shared his concerns about Mr. Giuliani with Attorney General William Barr after the president's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Mr. Trump urged his Ukrainian counterpart to work with both Messrs. Giuliani and Barr on investigations, the Times said. Mr. Bolton wrote that he told the attorney general Mr. Trump had invoked him on the call.
A Justice Department official familiar with the matter said Mr. Bolton did call Mr. Barr to express concerns about Mr. Giuliani and his shadow foreign policy in Ukraine. It wasn't clear what, if anything, the attorney general did with that information.
Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec denied that Mr. Barr learned of the Ukraine call from Mr. Bolton. The department has repeatedly said he learned about it in mid-August.
The alleged conversation between the president and Mr. Bolton also sheds more light on an exchange that took place later in August between Mr. Bolton and Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.). According to Mr. Johnson, Mr. Bolton urged him to call Mr. Trump directly about the Ukraine aid matter. Mr. Johnson spoke to Mr. Trump on Aug. 31 and asked the president if the aid to Ukraine was contingent on new investigations by Ukraine. Mr. Trump responded by vehemently denying that that was the case, Mr. Johnson said.
News of Mr. Bolton's claims shook the White House, where several top advisers hadn't read the manuscript. As of late Sunday evening, the press office hadn't yet decided whether to issue a statement on the matter.
In their
first day of arguments on Saturday
, the president's lawyers argued for two hours that Democrats had failed to make a compelling case and were relying on circumstantial evidence to conclude that the Republican president had conditioned aid to Ukraine on investigations that could benefit him politically. Mr. Bolton's manuscript would provide a first-person account of the president doing precisely that.
Among other matters, the president's team was expected to argue on Monday that Mr. Trump was right to press Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden, a Democratic candidate for president, and his son, Hunter, the person familiar with the discussions said. They will argue that it was corrupt for the younger Mr. Biden to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father as vice president was overseeing U.S. efforts to combat corruption in Ukraine. No evidence has emerged of wrongdoing by either Mr. Biden or his son, though Hunter Biden has said serving on the company's board while his father worked on anticorruption efforts showed poor judgment.
Republican lawmakers have echoed the president's calls for an investigation into the Bidens, which Democrats say amount to an effort by the White House to enlist a foreign country's help in interfering in this year's election.
The president's team plans to present arguments Monday beginning at 1 p.m. EST and likely wrapping up by about 8 p.m., according to a person familiar with the discussions.
Constitutional law professor Alan Dershowitz and former independent counsel Kenneth Starr will likely speak Monday, the person said. Depending on how the session goes, the team may not use its session on Tuesday, the last day it has to make arguments before senators begin their questioning.
If the Senate votes against calling more witnesses, it would proceed soon afterward to a vote on whether to convict or acquit the president. Mr. Trump faces little prospect of conviction, which requires a two-thirds majority of senators to remove him from office.

The president told aides he was pleased with his team's presentation Saturday, but over the weekend he lobbed insulting nicknames at top Democrats. He was in particular rebuked by Democrats on Sunday for a tweet he issued about Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the lead House impeachment manager. The president said of Mr. Schiff, ""he has not paid the price, yet, for what he has done to our Country.""
Mr. Schiff on NBC called the president ""wrathful and vindictive"" and added: ""I don't think there's any doubt about it. And if you think there is, look at the president's tweets about me today.""
Separate from the trial, new information has continued to emerge about the president's dealings with Ukraine. On Saturday, a lawyer for Lev Parnas, an associate of Mr. Giuliani, released a 90-minute recording that appeared to show Mr. Trump ordering the removal of the ambassador to Ukraine at a small 2018 dinner with donors.
Mr. Trump has denied knowing Mr. Parnas, who is under indictment for alleged campaign-finance violations, to which he has pleaded not guilty.
The former ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, testified during the impeachment inquiry about her removal, which Democrats argued was designed to clear the way for the Ukraine pressure campaign. Republicans portrayed her testimony as largely irrelevant to the impeachment inquiry.

WASHINGTON -- Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, once crowned by Republicans as their presidential nominee, became the lone member of his party on Wednesday to vote to convict and remove President Trump from office.
In so doing, Mr. Romney denied Mr. Trump the ability to present the acquittal as a unanimous decision among GOP senators. With the exception of Mr. Romney, the Senate voted along party lines to acquit the president, who has a 91% approval rating among GOP voters, according to recent polling by The Wall Street Journal/NBC News.
""The allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious,"" said Mr. Romney, a devout member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in an emotional speech on the Senate floor.
""As a senator-juror, I swore an oath, before God, to exercise 'impartial justice,' "" he said.
Mr. Romney's vote to convict is a defining moment in a lengthy political career that many thought had ended when he lost to President Obama in 2012. Mr. Romney easily won an open Senate seat in 2018 in Utah, and won't face a re-election campaign until 2024, should he decide to run again.
As a Republican who built his career in deep-blue Massachusetts, the 72-year-old Mr. Romney has experience pulling against the political current.
The party that nominated Mr. Romney for president eight years ago is now Mr. Trump's party, and the two have a history of public clashes dating to Mr. Romney's 2012 defeat, when Mr. Trump said the former Massachusetts governor ""blew it.""
During the 2016 presidential election cycle, Mr. Romney emerged as a prominent Trump critic and called for him to release his tax returns. Mr. Romney gave a speech attacking him, calling hima ""phony"" and a ""fraud,"" and urged Republicans to force a contested convention to choose a different candidate.
The president endorsed Mr. Romney for his 2018 election, and Mr. Romney said in his Senate speech on Wednesday that he supports a great deal of the president's agenda, noting that he has voted with the president 80% of the time.
But ""were I to ignore the evidence that has been presented, and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience,"" Mr. Romney said.
He said the question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor.
""Yes,"" Mr. Romney said. ""He did.""
After his Senate speech, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel -- Mr. Romney's niece -- tweeted that President Trump did nothing wrong, and the Republican Party is more united than ever behind him.
""I, along with the @GOP, stand with President Trump,"" the tweet said.

OXON HILL, Md.—The impeachment of President Trump motivated her to fly up from Texas, but after a half day at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Cathie Broten was convinced a more sinister force is in play.
""It's like Custer's Last Stand: the Republicans vs. the socialists,"" said Ms. Broten, 70 years old, wearing a pin reading, ""Kiss me, I'm a capitalist.""
""We need to stand up and fight,"" she said Thursday. ""Somebody's got to pay for the free TV, the free college. It's time to draw the line.""
While Mr. Trump is certain to be greeted by rapturous applause when he addresses CPAC on Saturday afternoon, another name has featured as prominently as the president's during the four-day conference in suburban Washington: Sen. Bernie Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist and front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination.
""I have two words for you: Socialism sucks,"" Trump campaign adviser Mercedes Schlapp told an audience of hundreds. ""We have to stop it in its tracks.""
The CPAC theme—America vs. Socialism—reveals how Republicans plan to frame the November election, with or without Mr. Sanders as the nominee. Repeatedly, speakers portrayed the Democrats' agenda on health care, the environment, college tuition and other issues as an attempt to radically transform America.
""Donald Trump and his allies are getting a little bit nervous about facing Sen. Sanders in a general election, and they're all quickly realizing that the only way to attack someone who spent his entire life standing with the working class is to lie,"" said Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca.
Amid the ""crazy Bernie"" and communist Cuba references at CPAC were warnings about being overconfident.
""Get your laughs out of the way and get the mockery out of the way and then get deathly serious,"" said the young conservative activist Charlie Kirk. ""Because we should not do what the left did in 2016 and dismiss an outsider populist candidate from thinking that person can't win the White House.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How can President Trump's relationship with CPAC benefit him during the 2020 election season? Join the conversation below.
When Mr. Trump spoke at CPAC in 2011, saying he might run for president the following year, many in the Republican establishment laughed it off as a publicity grab. He skipped it in 2016 while some conservatives still fought to prevent his march to the nomination.
This year showed how Mr. Trump commands the GOP, injecting his own sense of grievance and fight. The mere mention of Mitt Romney, the party's 2012 nominee who
voted earlier this month in the Senate to convict Mr. Trump
on one article of impeachment, brought boos. Conference-goers stuffed ballot boxes to judge the ""phoniest"" conservative, picking from a list of other Republicans who have criticized Mr. Trump.
Before noon on Thursday, attendees had sat through four panels focused on ""the coup,"" with speakers dismissing the impeachment and other investigations into Mr. Trump as the work of Democrats and a bureaucratic deep state.
""They're never going to stop,"" said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio. ""They tried to overturn the will of 63 million Americans—all of us who voted for President Trump.""
Democrats hit back at claims like Mr. Jordan's, calling it ""the oldest trick in the GOP playbook.""
""Republicans are trying to distract because they know they can't win on the issues. In 2017, 2018 and 2019 Democrats won on a message of expanding access to health care,"" said Daniel Wessel, a Democratic National Committee spokesman.
In addition to panels, actors Dean Cain and Kristy Swanson performed a dramatic reading of anti-Trump text messages between former FBI agents Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, favorite targets of Mr. Trump in his complaints about the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The CPAC gathering in past years was animated by Ron Paul-style libertarians; now it is dominated by Trump loyalists in red MAGA hats as the president continues to redefine the GOP on foreign policy and trade. There was little mention of the ballooning national debt.
For some, it was a venue to apologize for being wrong about Mr. Trump in 2016.
""Look, I was late to the Trump train,"" said Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. ""I was about as late as one can be. I had my doubts about whether he was a conservative. I had my doubts about whether he was electable."" But Mr. Lee said the president has followed through on his promises, including moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, slashing regulations and nominating conservative judges.
Vice President Mike Pence ticked off those accomplishments and the strong economy and
declared victory over the impeachment
. ""President Donald Trump was acquitted forever,"" he said to wild cheers. Like others, Mr. Pence acknowledged the appeal of Mr. Sanders's policy proposals to young people in particular and said Republicans must engage them and explain the differences between ""freedom and socialism.""
""We definitely need to a better job of reaching young people and address their concerns,"" said Alexander Bowles, 18, of St. Louis, who said Mr. Trump also should moderate the way he speaks to avoid losing more suburban voters.
Outside the ballroom, people who have become celebrities in the Trump era were flocked by fans. Biceps poking from a black T-shirt, the Fox News regular Dan Bongino posed for selfies. Nigel Farage, one of Brexit's most-visible architects, was greeted with applause as he rode down an escalator holding a wooden doll depicting Mr. Trump.
Vendors sold Trump hats, towels, T-shirts and pins. A red-white-and-blue hammock with the word ""Deplorable"" was being offered at 10% off the $499 price tag with an extra 10% discount for anyone from a battleground state.
At a booth sponsored by the NRA, young activists posed with cutouts of a diminutive Michael Bloomberg, a nod to Mr. Trump's nickname for the Democratic presidential contender—""mini Mike.""
Mr. Trump is scheduled to address CPAC at 3 p.m. Saturday. Last year he took the stage, hugged an American flag and delivered a speech that lasted more than two hours.

WASHINGTON—In his three years in office, President Trump has overseen an escalation in the U.S. military's deployment of cyber weapons as a way to engage forcefully with adversaries around the globe without provoking all-out war.
But the White House hasn't made the same effort to inform Congress and the public about its rules for using these new cyber capabilities, lawmakers and experts say, prompting a bipartisan push to demand more transparency from the administration.
President Trump issued a
classified directive
nearly a year-and-a-half ago that outlines new, less restrictive rules for the military's use of cyber weapons. Approved efforts can range from a temporary network disruption to long-term degradation or sabotage of an adversary's computer systems, officials have said.
That more-aggressive posture has largely paid off, current and former officials say, as it has allowed the administration to rely on cyber operations to confront a broader array of threats and to react more nimbly to changing circumstances, including during a peak in
hostilities with Iran
this summer and
Russian election interference
attempts during last year's midterm elections.
But the White House hasn't let members of Congress see the directive, known as National Security Presidential Memorandum 13, the lawmakers said, leaving them with little understanding of a key element of American warfighting capability.
The rejection of
repeated bipartisan requests
to review the document prompted Congress to include a provision in its latest defense bill, which Mr. Trump signed Dec. 20, that will require the president to allow selected congressional committees to read in a secure facility copies of the document and any other presidential memorandum relating to the Pentagon's ""operations in cyberspace"" within 30 days.
A senior administration official said that the classified cyber rules have been made available to Congress, but declined to specify what kind of access was offered or what it entailed. ""No one took us up on it,"" the official said. A spokeswoman for the House Armed Services Committee, which pushed for the defense bill to include the requirement, said the Trump administration ""offered to provide limited access to the requested information with significant caveats and pre-conditions.""
The reluctance to share information with lawmakers, the spokeswoman said, ""severely impairs Congress's ability to evaluate the national security threat posed in the cyber realm on behalf of the American people.""
Past presidential administrations have been accused of being overly secretive about their use of offensive cyber capabilities, and even some former intelligence officials have criticized what they have described as overly zealous efforts to keep information classified.
""In no other domain of warfare has an administration prevented congressional review of the guiding policy documents regarding the employment of military capabilities,"" said Rep. Jim Langevin (D., R.I.), who serves on the House Armed Services Committee and led bipartisan efforts to pressure the administration to furnish the cybersecurity memo.
The National Defense Authorization Act requires that relevant documents be shared with lawmakers. The law, which passed by lopsided margins in both the House and the Senate, also updates requirements that Congress be informed of significant military cyber operations in a timely manner after they are carried out. Some Republicans in the Senate have said they believe the current level of information sharing to be adequate.
The Wall Street Journal
reported last year
that Mr. Trump had rescinded Obama-era rules and replaced them with new guidance intended to empower the Defense Department with more autonomy and flexibility to launch offensive cyber strikes.
Army Gen. Paul Nakasone, as head of U.S. Cyber Command, has been more forthcoming than predecessors have been about his cyberwar doctrine and the capabilities at his disposal, said Bobby Chesney, a national-security expert and law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, making the standoff between the White House and lawmakers especially confounding.
""I don't have the impression there is anything to hide there,"" Mr. Chesney said, adding that the policy changes have been applauded by Democrats and Republicans alike. ""But it's of this larger trend from the Trump administration, where it takes a harder line on resisting congressional oversight than any administration we've ever seen.""
Complaints about White House transparency on cyber issues aren't limited to the rules for offensive engagement.
In 2017, the White House released a first-of-its-kind public road map outlining the administration's policies regarding major cybersecurity flaws discovered—often in popular consumer software—by U.S. intelligence agencies. The document lays out guidelines for when the government would disclose the discovery of flaws to vendors so that they can be patched, and when to keep flaws secret in order to preserve them for use in possible future offensive actions.
The move was hailed at the time by transparency advocates and cybersecurity policy experts as a way to draw the curtain on a secretive process that had fueled accusations the U.S. government too often stockpiles information about cyber vulnerabilities at the expense of broader internet security.
Cyber Defense Developments Under Trump
* May 2018: White House eliminates position of senior cybersecurity coordinator, established under Obama administration
* August 2018: President Trump rescinds Obama-era policies requiring elaborate interagency consultation before Pentagon can carry out major offensive cyber operations
* November 2018: As part of a continuing operation code-named Synthetic Theology, U.S. Cyber Command jams servers used by Russian troll farm in effort to head off potential interference in midterm elections
* June 2019: During a peak in hostilities with Iran, President Trump pulls back on traditional use of military force but allows cyber operations to go forward that damage some Iranian systems used to monitor shipping traffic in the Persian Gulf
The public document that outlined the so-called Vulnerabilities Equities Process, or VEP, said that an annual report would be written ""at the lowest classification level permissible and include, at a minimum, an executive summary written at an unclassified level"" that may be provided to Congress.
Two years later, however, no information has been made public, and the lack of unclassified details has prompted frustration on Capitol Hill, people familiar with the matter said.
""Like everyone else, I assumed when they announced there would be an unclassified summary, that meant a separate report that was made public,"" a congressional aide said. But the unclassified summary is buried within the body of the fuller classified report, the aide said, limiting Congress's ability to share it publicly or with anyone who lacks proper clearance.
The annual report for 2018 was disseminated to appropriate congressional committees and was drafted at a classified level due to a ""need to provide relevant context,"" the senior administration official said. ""We remain committed to a transparent, inclusive process.""
Former officials and cybersecurity policy experts have said they have been surprised by the White House's apparent disinterest in sharing more about the process after earlier signaling a commitment to openness.
""When the VEP charter was made public, it seemed we were making progress that would put pressure on other countries to be more transparent,"" said Ari Schwartz, a senior White House cybersecurity official during the Obama administration who worked on standards for sharing information about cybersecurity vulnerabilities. ""The lack of any actual public data on what vulnerabilities are shared—even in the aggregate—is a major disappointment.""

Facebook Inc. removed Trump campaign ads that referred to a census, saying they violated a company policy aimed at preventing disinformation and other interference with the nationwide 2020 census, which goes online next week.
The ads, which began running on the social network this week, asked people to take the ""Official 2020 Congressional District Census"" and then directed users to a website for fundraising to support Mr. Trump's re-election. ""The information we gather from this survey will help us craft our strategies for YOUR CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT,"" the ads said.
Facebook said Thursday that it was the first time the company removed a Trump campaign ad for violating its census interference policy. ""There are policies to prevent confusion around the U.S. Census, and this is an example of those being enforced,"" a Facebook spokesman said.
The ads were paid for by Trump Make America Great Again Committee, a joint fundraising committee of Donald J. Trump for President Inc. and the Republican National Committee. Representatives for Mr. Trump's re-election effort didn't respond to requests to comment.
Facebook and other social-media platforms are under scrutiny for the way they handle political ads to prevent disinformation during this year's election season, and many of those same concerns have also come up with the 2020 census.
The census, which is required to take an accurate count of the population and apportion congressional seats, takes place once a decade. The 2020 census will be the first one where most Americans are asked to respond online, raising new challenges about security and preventing bad information from discouraging participation.
The Trump campaign ads were posted on Facebook pages for President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and began running earlier this week. The Republican National Committee began circulating a similar ad via mail last year.
Tech and politics newsletter Popular Information initially reported on the Trump campaign Facebook ads related to a census.
Some of the campaign ads remained active, while others were inactive, as of Thursday afternoon, according to Facebook's ad library.
The ads drew heat from Democrats on Capitol Hill on Thursday who said the campaign solicitations might confuse people, whose participation in the census is crucial to obtaining an accurate nationwide count.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said, before the ads were removed, ""This is, on the part of Facebook, a robust unacceptable interference in the census.""
She added at her weekly news conference, ""I know the profit motive is their business model, but it should not come at the cost of counting who is in our country so that we can provide the services.""
Asked about the ads at a Senate hearing, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told lawmakers that he has ""asked the career staff at census to look into this and see what appropriate action, if any, we should be taking to deal with it.""
New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said the Republican National Committee mailing seemed to be deliberately trying to cause confusion.
""They don't know the difference between this document and what comes out officially from the census,"" she said.
""That could be,"" Mr. Ross said in response.
Facebook said the Trump campaign ads were in violation of the policy because they are misleading about how to participate in the official U.S. Census.
Census officials have raised concerns that social-media platforms may be used to spread misinformation about the count.

RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. -- Republican senators facing tight re-election battles remained loyal to President Trump during the Senate impeachment trial. Now, they are reaping the rewards.
Mr. Trump is set to hold campaign rallies this week with two of the most vulnerable GOP senators: Martha McSally of Arizona and Cory Gardner of Colorado. Both hail from states that will be competitive in the presidential election in November, and they hope Mr. Trump's visits will help them rally voters and raise money.
Since the Senate trial, Ms. McSally -- who has deployed Trump-style tactics such as criticizing a CNN reporter as a ""liberal hack"" last month when he sought an interview from her in the Capitol -- has doubled down on her support for the president. In recent days, her campaign began airing a new ad against her opponent, former astronaut Mark Kelly, criticizing his support for impeachment and calling him ""too liberal for Arizona.""
Jacob Peters, Mr. Kelly's communications director, criticized the ad as ""more of the same negative and false attack ads that Arizonans are tired of and rejected in 2018.""
""This one is tough as hell,"" Mr. Trump said of Ms. McSally as he introduced her at Wednesday's rally. ""She's a warrior."" He said she had his ""complete and total support and endorsement.""
Ms. McSally in turn heaped praise on the president. ""I am flying on your wing, President Trump,"" she said. Her Twitter account posted a video of her on stage shortly afterward.
Ms. McSally and Mr. Gardner both voted against calling witnesses in the Senate impeachment trial and subsequently to acquit the president. When Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) told Republican senators that he didn't have the votes yet to block new witnesses desired by Democrats from being called, Ms. McSally and Mr. Gardner addressed their colleagues, people familiar with the matter said. Days later, the Senate voted against new testimony.
Appearing with the president carries risk for the two senators. Embracing the president on stage will help the senators rally the Republican base, but also serve as a reminder to Democrats and independents of how they cast their votes on impeachment.
""The senators risk alienating voters who don't like the president by declining to distance themselves from Trump. But virtually all Republican elected officials have made the calculation that it's more risky to oppose the president and alienate his Republican supporters,"" said Nathan Gonzales, editor and publisher of Insider Politics.
But Mr. Gardner and Ms. McSally are in a ""tough spot,"" he said. ""They have to compile a coalition that includes voters who like and dislike President Trump. Simply rallying Republicans is not enough for either of them to win.""
In a fundraising email Tuesday, the Democratic National Committee singled out Ms. McSally and Mr. Gardner's votes to acquit the president. They ""want voters to believe they won't just fall in line behind Trump,"" the email said. ""But when it came down to it, they voted with nearly every other Republican senator to give a green light to Trump's corruption.""
The president, who plans to spend four days out West this week attending rallies and fundraisers, arrived Wednesday evening in Phoenix.
On Thursday, Mr. Trump is set to travel to Colorado Springs, Colo., for a rally with Mr. Gardner, who defeated his Democratic opponent six years ago by less than 2 percentage points.
For Mr. Trump, this week's Western swing also offers him an opportunity to engage in one of his favored campaigning strategies: counterprogramming. Wednesday's rally in Phoenix began at the same time as the Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas.

WASHINGTON—President Trump has had two major national audiences in the past five days, and both times he aimed a message at African-Americans, a group that overwhelmingly disapproves of the job he is doing but could help decide whether he gets to keep it.
During the Super Bowl, Mr. Trump's campaign spent millions of dollars on a commercial featuring an African-American woman who had a drug sentence commuted by the president. ""Politicians talk about criminal-justice reform,"" the ad said. ""President Trump got it done.""
At the State of the Union, Mr. Trump celebrated the low unemployment rate among African-Americans, talked of urban development zones, honored one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen and awarded a fourth-grader from Philadelphia, Janiyah Davis, with a school-choice scholarship.
The black unemployment rate is 5.9%, according to the latest government statistics, up slightly from the historic low of 5.4% reached in August 2019. Overall, the U.S. unemployment rate is 3.5%.
While Mr. Trump's re-election strategy mainly relies on motivating his conservative base, the focus on African-Americans, and a similar push for Hispanics, shows an effort to attract new voters. Only 8% of black voters went for Mr. Trump in 2016, but his campaign is confident it can improve on that. Even a small boost could help in battleground states such as Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.

Many Black Voters Like Joe Biden, but Some Are Open to Other Democrats

""There's significant support out there that you're not going to hear about but it will show up at the ballot box. People see results,"" said Calvin Tucker, who directs minority outreach for the Republican Party of Pennsylvania. He noted that Mr. Trump in 2016 did better among black voters than the past two Republican nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain.
The push Mr. Trump has displayed in the last week—chiefly the emotional Super Bowl ad, which generated favorable reviews—also appears intended for another group of voters he has struggled with.
""Ads showing the compassionate part of Trump's agenda could help raise his favorable ratings with some suburban voters,"" said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist in Washington. ""They like his economic policies, but are turned off by the tweets and harsh rhetoric.""
The Trump campaign has been holding outreach events, seeking to shake the decadeslong dominance Democrats have held with black voters. It is a far different effort than 2016, when Mr. Trump lacked a record and simply asked, ""What the hell do you have to lose?""
The campaign plans to continue an advertising campaign geared toward black voters, including African-American community newspapers and radio. Ads encourage people to text ""woke"" to receive updates. The campaign is also training activists to engage and register voters, according to a person familiar with the strategy.
With a strong economy at the president's back, some Democrats say Mr. Trump's outreach is a wake-up call.
""What we saw from Donald Trump was a 2020 surgical strategy,"" said Quentin James, founder of the Collective PAC, which helps elect black candidates to office. Mr. James said Democrats need a large-scale program to engage with African-Americans and fears the party will play catch-up.
""We assume black voters will just vote for the Democratic Party like they always do,"" he said. ""Sure the numbers are there, but if Trump can get two or three more points with black men in swing states, this thing is over. I am very nervous.""
Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee who is also African-American, said Mr. Trump was smart to make a play for black voters. But he said that effort is hampered by the president's history of controversial statements, from saying there were fine people on ""both sides"" of the deadly 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., to saying four Democratic lawmakers, all of them minority women, should return to the ""totally broken and crime infested places from which they came"" and ""fix"" them.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you think President Trump can improve on his 2016 performance among African-American voters? Join the conversation below.
""This is a man who wanted to execute the Central Park Five,"" said Mr. Steele, referring to the black and Hispanic teenagers who were wrongfully convicted of raping a jogger in 1989. Asked about the case last year, Mr. Trump refused to apologize for his stance, which he had emphasized at the time in newspaper ads that called for bringing back the death penalty in New York.
A January poll released by the Washington Post showed more than 8 in 10 black Americans think Mr. Trump is a racist and that he has made racism a bigger problem. Despite Mr. Trump's boasts about the economy, 77% of black Americans said he deserves only ""some"" or ""hardly any"" credit, according to the poll.
""You go in the barber shop and talk to people—they hate Donald Trump,"" said Keith Williams, chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party's black caucus. He said Mr. Trump's frequent criticisms of former President Obama were a sore spot and noted the economic recovery began under Mr. Trump's predecessor.
""He can bring people to the State of the Union but he's never been for us,"" Mr. Williams said.
A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll from January showed only 15% of African-Americans approve of the job Mr. Trump is doing, and 83% disapprove—by far the worst of any demographic group.
Still, another Journal poll in December showed Mr. Trump could improve on his 2016 margin. While only 9% of blacks were almost certain to vote for the president and 72% were almost certain to vote against him, 21% said it depends on whom Democrats nominate.

With the leadoff Iowa caucuses days away, President Trump's re-election campaign wants to remind voters that Democrats aren't the only game in town.
For the Feb. 3 caucuses, the Trump campaign is planning an ambitious show of force around the state, with over 80 surrogates expected to campaign at caucus locations. The push will be led by campaign manager Brad Parscale, the president's sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, as well as Eric Trump's wife Lara Trump, who works for the campaign, and Donald Trump Jr.'s girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle, also a campaign adviser.
The group heading to Iowa includes White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and a number of cabinet members, including Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson. Also attending are members of Congress, among them House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.), Rep. Elise Stefanik, (R., N.Y.) and Rep. Mark Meadows (R., N.C.), as well as Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and governors from surrounding states.
Four years ago, President Trump placed second in the Iowa caucuses. This time around he has no strong challenger and Republican turnout is expected to be light. Still, the campaign sees the night as an opportunity to test its organizational muscle across the state's 99 counties and put on a show of strength in a key general election state.
""Our Caucus Day operation is just a preview of what is to come,"" said Mr. Parscale, in a statement provided to The Wall Street Journal. ""This will be the strongest, best funded, and most organized presidential campaign in history.""
The president is also heading to Des Moines on Thursday for a rally in advance of the caucuses, and Vice President Mike Pence is planning a bus tour through the state that day. The campaign has held caucus training sessions and Lara Trump recently issued a video detailing how to participate.
""By attending your caucus you can show your support for the president and send a clear message to the rest of the country,"" she said.
Mr. Trump has made clear he plans to leave nothing to chance in Iowa, a state he captured by nearly 10 percentage points in 2016 over Hillary Clinton but that Barack Obama won in 2008 and 2012. He has stayed close to Iowa Republicans, visiting the state throughout his presidency.
Some states have opted not to hold Republican primaries this year, but Iowa -- ever mindful of its first-in-the-nation status -- has kept the GOP contest going.
""When you're a first-in-the- nation state, you can't take off an election cycle,"" said Iowa Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kaufmann. ""We need to make sure both parties are out front and showing the country that we're going to do things in a transparent way and an efficient way.""
On the evening of Feb. 3, Republicans and Democrats will gather in nearly 1,700 precinct locations to pick their choice to be the party nominee. The GOP process is more straightforward than the Democratic approach, with Republicans simply casting a vote. The caucus results ultimately determine the delegates that represent the state at the Republican convention in August.
Mr. Trump has followed the Democratic nomination fight.
Speaking to Fox Business recently, he said of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders: ""I don't know, maybe he's really surging. He really is,"" while adding that Massachusetts Sen. ""Elizabeth Warren seems to be going in the other way."" Of former Vice President Joe Biden, Mr. Trump said he ""doesn't seem to be doing too well.""
Although the president's impeachment trial will continue this week, the push in Iowa comes as he has been or will be central to several other events.
He is holding a rally in New Jersey this week, as well as a meeting with Israeli leaders. On Friday, he became the first president to address the March for Life in Washington in person.

DAVOS, Switzerland—President Trump touted what he described as a ""blue-collar boom"" transforming the American economy and hailed
the U.S. trade agreement with China
in a speech to global business and government leaders, hours before
his impeachment trial
was set to begin.
Over 30 minutes on Tuesday, Mr. Trump ticked off a list of accomplishments from
low unemployment
to increases in foreign investment. The campaign-style address appeared aimed as much at a U.S. re-election audience and the 100 senators who will act as jurors in his impeachment trial as at the other heads of state and business executives attending the
World Economic Forum
in this Swiss mountain resort.
""The American dream is back, bigger, better and stronger than ever before,"" Mr. Trump said. ""No one is benefiting more than America's middle class.""
Before the Davos crowd of several hundred global business and political leaders, he took a shot at his domestic political opponents, saying, ""We will never let radical socialists destroy our economy, wreck our country, or eradicate our liberty.""
The president also reiterated his administration's promise for a middle-class tax cut. He told The Wall Street Journal it would be subject to his re-election and GOP gains in the House, where Democrats now hold a several-dozen seat majority. Administration officials have been talking for months about another round of tax cuts they would layer on top of those Mr. Trump signed in 2017, but the White House hasn't released a detailed proposal.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you think President Trump portrayed himself and the U.S. during his speech? Join the conversation below.
In a remark in his speech widely understood as referring to climate-change activists, he urged the world to ""reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse,"" whom he described as ""the heirs of yesterday's foolish fortunetellers.""
After Mr. Trump's speech, Axel Weber, chairman of Swiss bank UBS Group AG, said it ""was a typical sales pitch of the CEO in Davos overselling the company's achievements and underreporting on some of the risks that are there.""
David McKay, chief executive of Royal Bank of Canada, said that, based on his meetings in Davos so far, business leaders shared Mr. Trump's optimism. ""There's a general positivity about economic opportunity in the U.S.,"" Mr. McKay said.
Year-over-year growth
cooled to 2.1%
in the third quarter of last year from 3.2% in the second quarter of 2018. The U.S. has been in a period of uninterrupted growth since 2009.
As Mr. Trump crisscrossed a conference hall for the event, he was surrounded by crowds, with attendees jostling to get a look at him.
Mr. Trump had bilateral meetings with world leaders throughout the day, but he was particularly interested in what business executives he spoke with thought about his speech, according to people familiar with the matter.
Some in Davos disagreed with Mr. Trump, but attendees at a dinner Tuesday night took turns praising him one at a time.
FIFA president Gianni Infantino, compared Mr. Trump with the world-class athletes he often interacts with. ""President Trump is made of the same sort of fiber. He is competitive,"" he said, adding, ""He wants to win.""
White House aides said the president remained focused throughout the day on his meetings at Davos. In the interview with the Journal, Mr. Trump paused several times to comment on Fox News segments playing on a television nearby. At one point, he pointed out a pro-Trump banner in the crowd at a pro-rights rally in Virginia that flashed across the screen.
The six-hour time difference in Davos gave Mr. Trump plenty of time to watch the Senate trial from his hotel. During his motorcade back to the hotel Tuesday night, he tweeted ""READ THE TRANSCRIPTS,"" indicating that the impeachment proceedings were very much on his mind.
Tuesday was Mr. Trump's second appearance at the summit as president. In 2018, he sought to reassure world leaders and business executives that there was a place for global cooperation in his nationalist worldview. ""'America First' does not mean America alone,"" he said at the time.
His speech at the summit coincides with the first day of a trial in the U.S. Senate to determine whether he should be removed from office. In a legal filing Monday, Mr. Trump's legal team urged the Senate to swiftly reject the articles of impeachment,
calling the case frivolous and dangerous
.

Mr. Trump's remarks focused on the vibrancy of the American economy and the benefits he said he had delivered for people left behind in earlier booms, emphasizing employment gains by people without college degrees, African-Americans and military veterans.
In
his interview with the Journal
, the president said the administration was preparing a proposal for a middle-class tax cut to be unveiled in the next 90 days.
""Very much of a workers' tax cut,"" he said. He said its passage would come after the 2020 election and would depend on his winning a second term and Republicans holding the Senate and retaking the House.
While the president and his allies will tout the promised middle-class tax cut during the 2020 campaign, it has little chance of passing a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives. Democrats favor some tax cuts for middle-income and lower-income households, but they also want to roll back pieces of the 2017 law that benefited high-income taxpayers and corporations.
In his speech, the president addressed the issue of inequality, saying that wages for low-income Americans have been growing faster than those of the richest. ""For the first time in decades, we're not only concentrating wealth in the hands of a few,"" he said.
The U.S. labor market is in a strong spot, with the unemployment rate having held at a 50-year low of 3.5% in December.
Wages for rank-and-file workers have been rising at the quickest pace in more than a decade, even faster than for bosses, a sign that the labor market has tightened sufficiently to convey bigger increases to lower-paid employees. Pay for the bottom 25% of wage earners rose 4.6% in December from a year earlier, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Wages for the top 25% of earners rose 3%.

President Trump's team has been weighing the prospects of a race against a
populist outsider or a party stalwart
. Michigan's Democratic primary may determine just what they get.
The Midwestern battleground, voting on Tuesday, is the first major general election battleground state to hold a primary. Tuesday is the first day Democrats cast a ballot since voters
whittled the race down to two candidates
a week before.
In 2016, President Trump became the first Republican to win Michigan since George H.W. Bush in 1988, eking out a victory over Hillary Clinton that was powered by strong support in white rural areas and benefited from the fact that Mrs. Clinton couldn't match former President Obama's turnout in majority-black districts.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What will you be watching for in the Michigan Democratic primary Tuesday? Join the conversation below.
In that year's Democratic nomination race, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won the state, and he retains loyal support among young people and liberals. But former Vice President Joe Biden appears to have momentum after
a strong Super Tuesday
that showed him consolidating moderate support, and he has gathered key endorsements in the state.
While Mr. Trump remains confident he can take on either Democrat, his aides and allies have been privately pondering whom they would prefer to compete against in the general election. Some favor the contrast with Mr. Sanders's democratic socialist message—his promise to upend American politics with fundamental overhauls of the health-care and higher education systems and more. Others lean toward Mr. Biden, saying that his decades in government and record of verbal miscues offer rich opportunities for the president.
Each Democrat argues he is best equipped to defeat Mr. Trump. Mr. Sanders says he can bring to the party new voters who support his message of radical political change, while Mr. Biden's allies stress his backing among centrist suburban voters will be critical in November. Recent general election polling of head-to-head matchups with Mr. Trump in Michigan show both Democrats ahead of the president.
For weeks, Mr. Trump and his associates had openly been agitating for Mr. Sanders, with the president seeking to stir up the Vermont senator's supporters by claiming without evidence the Democratic establishment had fixed the race for Mr. Biden. But Trump team's focus turned to Mr. Biden again after Super Tuesday. A key question is whether Mr. Biden can bring back to the Democratic fold voters in the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which Mr. Trump swept in 2016 to take the White House, as well as compete in historic swing states like Florida.
""I'll tell you, I was all set for Bernie, because I thought it was going to happen,"" Mr. Trump said during a Fox News town hall Thursday. ""In a certain way Bernie would be tougher because he's got a base,"" he said, but added, ""I think it's going to be very hard for him to come back.""
Some Democratic voters in Detroit and its suburbs said they preferred a contest between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden, fearing Mr. Sanders's suite of policy proposals are too far to the left.
""I'm happy with Biden getting stronger. Bernie has a lot of good criticisms to make, but I still feel like in my heart Biden is our best choice,"" said Sara Frank, 69 years old, a retiree from West Bloomfield. ""He would have a broader reach.""
Aaron Parks, 24, who works in the health insurance industry, backed Mr. Sanders in 2016 but this year said he is supporting Mr. Biden. He said when he knocked on doors for Mr. Sanders in Commerce Charter Township four years ago, he found resistance to his liberal policies.
""What I like most about [Mr. Biden] is he's going to resonate with people around here,"" he said.
But Megan Hakala, 31, who works at Wayne State University and lives in Garden City, said if Democrats chose Mr. Biden, Mr. Trump could beat him in Michigan.
""He just doesn't have the passion. I have not met anyone, personally, who is fired up about Biden the way people are fired up about Bernie,"" she said. ""I think that the passion has to be there for the Democratic candidate in order to beat Trump.""
Michigan, which offers 125 delegates to the Democratic convention awarded proportionately, could prove a critical moment in the primary race, either as the state in which Mr. Biden solidifies his march to the nomination or where a strong victory enables Mr. Sanders to remain competitive.
Mr. Sanders has said a loss in Michigan's primary won't force him out of the race, and he has made an aggressive push in Michigan in the final days before the primary, canceling events in other states to add extra stops there. Mr. Biden didn't get to the state until Monday. Later, he is expected to appear with California Sen. Kamala Harris, who
endorsed him Sunday
, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who announced his backing Monday. Meanwhile, Mr. Biden has sent surrogates including Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and has key backers in the state, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Heading into Tuesday, Mr. Sanders has begun to criticize Mr. Biden's trade record more forcefully, hitting his support for trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement. His aides feel the criticism resonates with Michigan's large union population and would be a powerful general election argument. They argue Mr. Trump won Michigan and other Midwest states in part because he focused on the trade deals.
""If we are going to defeat Trump in Michigan, in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin it will be very hard for a candidate who voted for these disastrous trade agreements,"" Mr. Sanders said at a rally in Detroit on Friday night. The campaign also released ads targeting Mr. Biden on trade.
Mr. Biden is expected to focus on his record as vice president while trying to avoid a back-and-forth with Mr. Sanders. He likely also will emphasize his role in the 2009 bailout of General Motors Co. and Chrysler, as well as the Affordable Care Act, issues that he would likely continue to stress in a general election. His aides said his strong showing in suburban swing districts on Super Tuesday show he will be competitive in Michigan.
One Biden adviser said, ""Vice President Biden has actually been on two presidential tickets that won Michigan.""
Whichever Democrat wins on Tuesday, the president's campaign said trade will be an issue in the fall. Campaign manager Tim Murtaugh said that Mr. Trump will have an advantage against either, arguing that ""Joe Biden voted for the job-killing Nafta, and Bernie Sanders voted against its much-improved replacement,"" the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA.
The president's campaign—which has pumped resources into Michigan since 2016 to remain competitive—has sought to depict all the Democratic contenders as too far left for many Americans. From the White House on Friday, Mr. Trump made that case against Mr. Biden.
""He's left wing and he's got all people that are left wing. And in many ways, he's worse than Bernie,"" Mr. Trump said.
Mr. Trump also made clear this week that he will continue to raise questions about Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden and their dealings with Ukraine. No evidence has surfaced of any wrongdoing on the part of either Biden, and Mr. Trump was impeached in the Democratic-majority House for pressing the country to announce investigations that would benefit him politically in this year's election, including a probe of the former vice president. He was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate.
""That will be a major issue in the campaign,"" Mr. Trump told Fox News host Sean Hannity on Wednesday, speaking about the Bidens and Ukraine.
Michigan Democrat Michael Frank, 70, a dermatologist from West Bloomfield who is supporting Mr. Biden, said he was worried about Mr. Trump reviving these attacks, but said ""I think there's enough animosity for Trump out there now.""

WASHINGTON—House Democrats cited witnesses and documents the White House kept from impeachment investigators to press their case that President Trump has obstructed Congress, seeking to win over enough Republican senators to subpoena additional materials.
Friday marked the last chance for the seven Democratic managers—House lawmakers acting as prosecutors—to make their opening pitch to GOP senators who may be wavering on whether to subpoena witnesses and documents. Democrats say the material could bolster the allegation that Mr. Trump improperly
withheld nearly $400 million in aid
to Ukraine as leverage for the country to open investigations into Vice President Joe Biden, a potential election opponent this year, then tried to cover it up.
Mr. Trump ""invited foreign interference in our elections and sold out our country's security for his personal benefit, and betrayed the nation's trust to a foreign power,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) said.
Later, in his closing remarks in a tense Senate chamber, Mr. Schiff read out each allegation against Mr. Trump, then added, ""The facts have been proved. Those facts are not contested. We have met our burden."" He concluded shortly before 9 p.m. with an appeal to senators: ""I ask you, I implore you, give America a fair trial.""
Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing. He derided the Democrats' presentation Friday, saying in an interview with Fox News: ""They've been telling so many lies, so many fabrications, so much exaggeration. And this is not impeachable.""
The president's legal team will kick off its three days of arguments on Saturday morning, when it plans to speak for two to three hours, a person on the team said. The White House wanted to begin rebutting Democrats on Saturday but plans to save the bulk of its arguments for Monday and Tuesday, when there will be more television viewers, a person familiar with the discussions said.
Rep. Jason Crow (D., Colo.) led off the Democratic arguments Friday, wrapping up managers' presentation of the
first article of impeachment
, alleging abuse of power. Mr. Crow ran through the chronology surrounding the frozen Ukraine aid, which was later released amid media reports and a bipartisan outcry in Congress. The hold on the aid ""was only lifted because President Trump had gotten caught,"" he said.
Managers spent the bulk of Friday, however, on the second article of impeachment, which accuses Mr. Trump of trying to thwart the House inquiry by directing witnesses not to testify, refusing to allow the release of documents and ordering executive-branch agencies to do the same.
""We are here today in response to a blanket order issued by President Trump directing the entire executive branch to withhold all documents and testimony from that inquiry,"" said Rep. Val Demings (D., Fla.). ""President Trump's obstruction of the impeachment inquiry was categorical, indiscriminate, and historically unprecedented.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you think Democrats will be able to sway enough Republican senators to break ranks and agree to subpoena witnesses and documents? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Schiff said the second impeachment article, alleging obstruction, was just as important as the first article, alleging abuse of power.
If lawmakers ""lack the power to investigate a president, there will never be an article one, whether that article one is abuse of power, or that article one is treason, or that article one is bribery,"" he said. ""If you can't have the ability to enforce an impeachment power, you might as well not put it in the Constitution.""
Democrats said House committees issued 71 categories of document requests or subpoenas last year to the White House, the Office of the Vice President, the Office of Management and Budget and the State, Defense and Energy departments. The White House blocked all of the requests.
Senate Democrats have said they want to subpoena a slice of those documents, including emails from National Security Council officials who expressed concern about Mr. Trump's decision to delay aid to Ukraine, and about a July 10 meeting in which the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Gordon Sondland, urged Ukrainian officials to announce investigations as a way to get an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart.
Senate Democrats also want to hear from at least four witnesses, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton. In total, 12 current or former Trump administration officials declined to testify as part of the House impeachment inquiry.
It would take a simple majority of 51 senators to vote for the additional evidence, meaning that at least four Republicans would have to vote with all 47 senators in the Democratic caucus. If Democrats can't muster those four GOP votes, the trial could end as soon as next week.
Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee are among those who have said they would be open to witnesses. They have been tight-lipped in recent days about how the Democrats' opening arguments might have affected their thinking.
Mr. Alexander told reporters he would make his decision after the questioning portion of the trial, expected next week. Mr. Romney said he would like to hear testimony from Mr. Bolton and that he would make a decision about other officials later. Mr. Bolton, who was described by witnesses as alarmed at the pressure put on Ukraine,
said earlier this month that he would testify
in a Senate trial if subpoenaed.
White House officials have said they don't expect any Republicans to vote in favor of hearing from more witnesses, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) is privately far less certain, people familiar with the talks said.
The White House has largely delegated the task of rallying senators to vote against witness testimony to Mr. McConnell and a handful of other senators, though some White House officials including the president have been in contact with lawmakers as the trial has unfolded.
During the trial, Mr. McConnell is using daily closed-door lunches as a venue for GOP senators to have frank exchanges and relay feedback to party leadership.
Among the arguments some Republicans are making at lunch and in private conversations is that voting in favor of witness testimony would further prolong the trial with an extended court battle over executive privilege, people familiar with the talks said. Republicans also say that witness testimony won't change the case and that the trial should end by the Feb. 4 State of the Union address.
Mr. McConnell has made that case publicly, saying on the Senate floor Tuesday that pursuing new witnesses could indefinitely delay the Senate trial and draw the body into a protracted and complex legal fight. ""Such litigation could potentially have permanent repercussions for the separation of powers and the institution of the presidency that senators would need to consider very carefully,"" he said.

Analysis: Trump Impeachment Trial

Mr. Schiff told reporters on Friday that it is ""nonsense"" that subpoenaing new witnesses or documents could make the trial last too long. ""This is not a trial over a speeding ticket or shopping ticket, this is an impeachment trial involving the president of the United States,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""These witnesses have important firsthand testimony to offer.""
Trump attorney Jay Sekulow has rejected Democrats' push for more documents and witnesses, citing executive privilege, the principle presidents use to protect communications with close aides and advisers from public scrutiny. The argument is that confidentiality is needed to protect national security and to enable the president to receive frank and honest advice.
Executive privilege isn't explicitly mentioned in the Constitution but is understood to be implied by its separation of powers. Democrats say executive privilege shouldn't be used to shield a president engaged in alleged misconduct.
Sixty-six percent of Americans say the Senate should call witnesses to testify in Mr. Trump's impeachment trial, including 45% of Republicans, 65% of independents and 87% of Democrats, according to an
ABC News/Washington Post poll
released on Friday.
Previewing the White House's opening arguments, Mr. Sekulow said Friday that his team would include discussion of Mr. Biden, as well as his son Hunter, who worked at Ukrainian firm Burisma. Mr. Trump and his allies have accused Joe Biden of working to replace the Ukraine prosecutor to protect his son, but Joe Biden pressed for his removal with the backing of U.S. allies at a time when the prosecutor's probe into Burisma was dormant. Both Bidens have denied wrongdoing.

The U.S. drone strike that killed the Iranian Quds Force commander marks a pivot toward direct confrontation with Iran, further entangling the U.S. in the Middle East after years of trying to avoid a major conflict.
Since taking office, President Trump has made a priority of winding up the fight against Islamic State militants and reducing the American military footprint in the Middle East. The Trump administration was determined to roll back Iranian power and stop its nuclear program by tightening economic sanctions -- not through military power.
With Islamic State seemingly routed in Iraq and Syria, and Tehran lashing out in the face of a deteriorating economy, the U.S. and Iran have entered a new phase as they vie to shape the ragged peace in an unsteady part of the world.
See-sawing tensions in recent months rose in the past few weeks, with Iranian-backed militias trying to harass U.S. forces by stepping up rocket attacks against multiple bases in Iraq. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned in mid-December that should harm come to any American the U.S. would respond decisively.
On Dec. 27 the administration's red line was finally crossed when a rocket attack carried out by the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia killed an American contractor at a base near Kirkuk, north of Baghdad.
That set in motion a spiral of violence that ultimately led to the targeting of Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's overseas wing, and Iraqi paramilitary military leader Abu Mahdi al-Mohandes on a road leading from the Baghdad airport.
""Ever since the U.S. official was killed in indirect fire in Iraq, [President Trump] said enough is enough,"" according to a senior White House official.
""We took action last night to stop a war,"" President Trump said Friday. ""We did not take action to start a war.""
In killing the Iranian commander, the Trump administration is gambling that it can weaken Iran's regional influence, possibly forcing Tehran to negotiate. Such an outcome could further boost Mr. Trump as he faces an impeachment trial and gears up for re-election.
Critics said the killing of Gen. Soleimani is more likely to inflame tensions, generating reprisals from Iran and potentially miring the U.S. further in the region.
""The level of unpredictability going forward is very concerning to me,"" said Rep. Andy Kim (D., N.J.), who was the Iraq director at the National Security Council under President Obama. He said the Obama administration considered killing Gen. Soleimani but never went through with it because of concerns about a backlash.
Defense officials said Gen. Soleimani was behind the dozen or so rocket attacks that showered Iraqi bases since October, including the strike that killed the American contractor, who was working as a linguist. The Iranian commander was involved in plotting future attacks on Americans in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq, having recently visited those places as part of the planning, the officials said.
There was ""clear, unambiguous intelligence indicating a significant campaign of violence against the United States in the days, weeks and months"" ahead, Army Gen. Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters Friday.
""These were attacks targeting American diplomats, American military personnel and facilities that house Americans,"" a State Department official said.
After the death of the contractor, on Dec. 27, the U.S. responded with airstrikes against compounds of the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah paramilitary group in Iraq and Syria that the group says killed 27 people. That weekend, President Trump also authorized the use of military force on Gen. Soleimani, U.S. officials said.
Gen. Milley, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Mr. Pompeo discussed the strike with Mr. Trump, who was winding up a two-week holiday at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago. Senior officials concluded that ""there was a reasonable chance"" the strike wouldn't spark a war and would instead empower moderates in Iran, a White House official said.
The official said discussions on targeting Gen. Soleimani also ""went through a legal review"" to determine whether it qualified as self-defense.
Five days later, Gen. Soleimani flew to Baghdad, becoming what one defense official described as a ""target of opportunity."" The airport road that Gen. Soleimani and Mr. Mohandes took has few exit ramps and is lined with high walls, making it an optimum location for a targeted killing.
As Gen. Solemiani started out on that road an unmanned aerial drone dropped ordnance on the convoy, the defense officials said.
Mr. Pompeo said the attack aimed to show resolve to deter Iran against further aggression and that ""the U.S. remains committed to de-escalation."" President Trump, in a tweet, said Iran has never won a war, nor lost a negotiation.
Getting Iran to refrain from reprisals is unlikely, experts say. ""Nobody in the administration thinks that is going to happen,"" said Kirsten Fontenrose of the Atlantic Council foreign-policy think tank, who left Mr. Trump's NSC in November 2018.
After Gen. Soleimani's death, Iran's leaders named a replacement and vowed retaliation.
""Soleimani was iconic,"" tweeted Norman Roule, a former Central Intelligence Agency official on the Middle East. ""He managed militias & terrorists. Neither will go away w his death. He will be replaced by others albeit w less experience & stature.""
Iran has a variety of options to strike back. The 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq are part of an array of forces numbering 80,000 throughout the region at bases and at sea. U.S. officials said Friday that some 3,500 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division would be sent to Kuwait as early as this weekend.
The region's oil shipping and infrastructure remain a vulnerability and have been the targets of earlier skirmishes. Iranian forces could seed the Persian Gulf with mines and fire missiles at U.S. bases, oil fields and desalinization plants in the Arabian peninsula.
If it is looking to respond quickly, Iran could use the militia forces it backs in Iraq and elsewhere to mount rocket strikes and other attacks against American troops. Mounting cyberattacks against American businesses and institutions, experts say, is also an option.
The U.S. and Iran have battled for influence across the region for decades. During the Iraq war, Iran undermined the U.S. by arming Shiite militias that attacked U.S. troops. Iran still holds much sway over Iraq's politics, enjoying the allegiance of many political groups, including some now calling for a vote in parliament to expel U.S. forces.
During the Obama administration, Iran agreed with the U.S. and five world powers to curb its nuclear program. The Trump administration scrapped that accord in mid-2018, saying the pact wouldn't ultimately prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons and didn't cover its missile programs or its assertive regional posture. Washington turned to sanctions and other measures to cripple Iran's economy and cut off revenues from oil sales.
The rise of Islamic State gave Washington and Tehran a common enemy, especially after militants expanded control of territory and took the Iraqi city of Mosul in June 2014.
U.S. troops and Iraqi Shiite militias backed by Iran tolerated each other's presence on the battlefield in Iraq. Though the U.S. didn't coordinate with Iranian-backed militias, the two sides avoided clashes.
Once, Gen. Soleimani's aircraft was parked on the same Iraqi airfield as the one used by Tony Thomas, the general, now retired, who headed the Joint Special Operations Command and later the U.S. Special Operations Command.
That uneasy and unofficial truce enabled the U.S. to shrink its military footprint in the Middle East as outlined in the Pentagon's national defense strategy, published in 2018, which sought to redirect the U.S. military's focus mainly to deterring a resurgent Russia and a potentially more powerful China.
Under then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, the Pentagon reduced the number of military personnel in the Middle East, stopped the practice of constantly maintaining an aircraft carrier in the region and redeployed four Patriot antimissile batteries from Jordan, Kuwait and Bahrain.
During the first two years of the Trump administration, U.S. officials discussed the possibility of targeting Gen. Soleimani, a former senior U.S. official said. He was difficult to locate since he left Iran only for brief periods, said the former official, so a decision to target him was never close.
With tensions rising with Tehran, U.S. Central Command commander Marine Gen. Kenneth McKenzie Jr. has argued for the need to augment forces.
As the U.S. ratcheted up economic pressure against Iran, Tehran lashed out, attaching mines to ships and shooting down a U.S. drone in June. The U.S. blamed Iran for missile and drone strikes against an oil facility in Saudi Arabia owned by state-controlled Saudi Arabian Oil Co. in September.
Starting in May, Gen. McKenzie began assembling more forces, deploying the Patriots, a Thaad anti-ballistic missile defense system and ultimately restored the carrier's presence there.
Last month, the Pentagon began considering whether to send yet more forces -- potentially as many as 14,000 additional troops, which could include sailors aboard ships.
The promise of additional forces doesn't guarantee that Iran won't retaliate, Pentagon officials conceded. ""They are going to respond. They have to,"" said a defense official.

WASHINGTON—U.S. officials have informed Sen. Bernie Sanders that Russia is actively trying to support his campaign for the Democratic nomination as part of Moscow's broader efforts to interfere in the 2020 election, according to two people familiar with the matter.
President Trump and a small number of lawmakers have been briefed on the same intelligence, the people said.
The classified FBI briefing wasn't of the type routinely given to presidential campaigns about election security, those people said. It was given in reaction to intelligence considered compelling enough that Mr. Sanders needed to be alerted, one of the people said. But the intelligence suggested that the Russian effort to bolster Mr. Sanders hasn't approached the scale or scope of operations to support
Mr. Trump's campaign in 2016
, the person said.
The Washington Post earlier reported Mr. Sanders received a briefing that Russia was seeking to support him in the primary.
Speaking to reporters Friday, Mr. Sanders acknowledged a briefing had taken place but said it wasn't clear what role Russia was attempting to play in the election.
""We were told that Russia and maybe other countries were getting involved in the campaign,"" Mr. Sanders told reporters in Bakersfield, Calif. ""And look, here is the message to Russia, 'Stay out of the American election.' ""
Mr. Sanders, who has been criticized for online vitriol some of his supporters have directed against his opponents, also said in a statement that it was possible ""ugly stuff"" that has been attributed to his campaign was actually coming from fake internet accounts.
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security declined to comment.
The reports emerged a month after the briefing on the day before
the Nevada caucuses
. Mr. Sanders is currently leading his Democratic rivals
in national polls
following a first-place finish in the New Hampshire primary this month, and polls suggested he was positioned for a strong finish in Nevada.
""I'll let you guess, about one day before the Nevada caucuses, why do you think it came out?"" Mr. Sanders asked.
Last week, intelligence officials told President Trump and lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee about Russia's apparent preference to have Mr. Trump re-elected, according to people familiar with the matter. During an Oval Office meeting Mr. Trump
lashed out
at Joseph Maguire, his acting director of national intelligence until he was replaced this week, because he was irate that lawmakers received the information first, the people said. The president was also agitated by the content of the intelligence that indicated Russia would again seek to support his electoral prospects in the fall, they said.
It couldn't be determined what Moscow's precise motive was in its effort to support Mr. Sanders, including through social media, the people familiar with the matter said.
Russia has repeatedly denied interfering in U.S. elections.
Mr. Trump, at a campaign rally in Las Vegas on Friday, dismissed reports that U.S. intelligence agencies believe Russia may interfere this year on his behalf, calling them ""disinformation."" He said Russian President Vladimir Putin would want to wait until Democrats pick their nominee.
""Wouldn't he rather have Bernie, who honeymooned in Moscow?"" Mr. Trump asked.
The president's remarks about Mr. Sanders emerged before any reports that the Democratic candidate had been warned about Moscow's interest in aiding his campaign, a sequence pointed to by the Sanders campaign.
Mr. Sanders and his wife traveled to Russia in 1988 on a delegation from Burlington, Vt., where he was mayor, to establish a sister-city program with the city of Yaroslavl. They also celebrated their honeymoon there.
U.S. intelligence officials have been warning for years that Russia and others will likely seek to interfere in the 2020 contest. Former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation found that Russia interfered in
""sweeping and systematic"" fashion
in the 2016 presidential election to help Mr. Trump and denigrate his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton.
But Mr. Mueller's probe also found that Russian intelligence operatives spreading propaganda on social media also showed some favoritism for Mr. Sanders.
""Use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest except for Sanders and Trump—we support them,"" a Russian operative is quoting as saying in an indictment.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren, one of Mr. Sanders's rivals for the Democratic nomination, told reporters Friday she hadn't received a similar briefing.
""I believe that we need as much transparency as possible on any Russian interference,"" she said. ""Understand, this is about disinformation and the way to fight disinformation is to call it out, show what it is, and give everyone full information as quickly as possible. Otherwise, the Russians continue to have too much influence over our campaign, and this is how we fight against that.""
U.S. national security officials have struggled with how to respond to indications that foreign adversaries may be meddling in elections after the Obama administration was criticized by Republicans and Democrats alike for not disclosing more to the public and Russia's interference in 2016.
In November the Trump administration
outlined its plan
for when to notify the public or campaigns of foreign election interference, but the framework received criticism from some election officials who said it was vague and Democrats who argued it could allow for political influence.
Those notification decisions are made to further national-security interests and are ""intended to protect the integrity of political and social discourse,"" according to a one-page public summary of the framework.

WASHINGTON—The Republican-led Senate acquitted President Trump of charges stemming from his efforts to
pressure Ukraine to announce investigations that would benefit him
in this year's election, concluding a four-month drama that has consumed Washington and intensified the nation's sharp divide over his presidency.
On the first article of impeachment, abuse of power, all 47 Democrats and one Republican voted to convict the president, falling short of the 67 needed to remove the president from office. On the second article of impeachment, obstruction of Congress, the vote also failed, with all Democrats and no Republicans finding the president guilty.
The
presidential impeachment trial,
the nation's third in its history, grew out of a July 25 phone call in which Mr. Trump asked Ukraine's president to announce certain investigations just as he was holding up U.S. aid to the country. Mr. Trump has defended the call as ""perfect"" and has said he did nothing wrong regarding Ukraine. The aid was later released after bipartisan outcry from lawmakers.
""The American people, and frankly, people all over the world, know it's a hoax,"" he told supporters at a recent rally in Des Moines, Iowa.
Mr. Trump had hoped for vindication in the Senate trial after a House investigation that he had decried as politically motivated. What he got was something less: Amid strong support for his acquittal from his own party, several Republicans also said Democrats had proved that he acted improperly regarding Ukraine.
Mr. Trump was also denied a unanimous verdict from Republican senators, with Mitt Romney of Utah voting to convict Mr. Trump on abuse of power.
""The president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust,"" Mr. Romney said on the Senate floor before the vote.
The action by Mr. Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, made him the first senator in U.S. history to vote to convict a president of his own party. In the impeachment trials of Democratic presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, no Democratic senators voted to convict.
The White House, which as late as Wednesday morning had been predicting that all Republican senators would vote to acquit the president, was caught off-guard by Mr. Romney's announcement, aides said. The White House abruptly closed to the media a planned event at which Mr. Trump had been expected to make remarks.
Nonetheless, the Senate vote to acquit among Republicans marked a clear victory for the president, underscoring his primacy in the GOP and among the party's voters and the end to a process that had hung over his presidency as he seeks re-election in November. Mr. Trump has sent nearly 700 tweets or retweets about impeachment, an average of more than five per day.
Democrats said the acquittal amounted to a defeat for both their party and the institution of Congress, and they warned that leaving Mr. Trump in office would make him free to abuse power again.
""He has compromised our elections and he will do so again,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff, the California Democrat who led the team of impeachment managers. ""You will not change him. You cannot constrain him.""

How do you think President Trump's acquittal will affect his bid for 2020, if at all? Join the conversation below.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) opened the inquiry in September over the president's push for Ukraine to announce investigations into Joe Biden, a potential election opponent this year, and his son, Hunter. Mr. Trump and his allies have argued that it was corrupt for Hunter Biden to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father as vice president was spearheading an anticorruption effort in the country. The Bidens have denied any wrongdoing. Hunter Biden has said it was poor judgment to take the board position while his father was involved with Ukraine policy.
The Democratic-led House called 17 witnesses and hundreds of documents to build its case, formally
impeaching the president in December
. A month later, it handed the articles over to the Senate, which heard arguments from House impeachment managers and Mr. Trump's defense team over about three weeks but rejected calling additional witnesses or documents, speeding Mr. Trump's acquittal.
Mr. Trump's impeachment trial, the first not to include witnesses, was shorter than its predecessors. Former President Bill Clinton's trial lasted two weeks longer than Mr. Trump's after senators voted to allow new depositions.
The tightly choreographed Senate trial was upended late last month by new revelations from former national security adviser John Bolton about the president's pressure campaign on Ukraine. The former official's
revelations in a yet-unpublished memoir
briefly raised the possibility a sufficient number of Republicans would join with Democrats to vote in favor of new witness testimony. But Republicans ultimately voted nearly in unison to oppose hearing from Mr. Bolton and other witnesses, moving the trial along to Wednesday's expected acquittal.
A top House Democrat said Wednesday the House would ""likely"" subpoena Mr. Bolton and continue the investigation. Mr. Bolton's spokeswoman declined to comment on whether he would comply with any subpoena.
The trial's political impact isn't clear. Mrs. Pelosi spent much of last year avoiding impeachment, telling her caucus it needed to be a bipartisan process and last spring describing the effort as ""not worth it."" Her mind changed
after The Wall Street Journal reported
in September that Mr. Trump had pressed Ukraine's president in the July call to investigate the Bidens. When centrists in her caucus backed an impeachment inquiry, she announced it would move forward.
A majority of voters said they believed Mr. Trump abused his power and obstructed Congress, according to a
Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll
published Sunday. Some 49% of respondents said he should be allowed to finish his term, compared with 46% who said he should be removed.
Impeachment also made little impact on Mr. Trump's job-approval rating, which stood at 46% in the January poll—in line with his rating throughout his presidency.
Despite his public attacks on the impeachment process, Mr. Trump stayed—at Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's urging—largely on the sidelines of Republican efforts to rally lawmakers against voting for new witnesses and approached his own legal team with a fairly light touch.
The president's sole recommendation to his team came after the defense's first day of arguments, an administration official said. After his lawyers argued for two hours, he called with a request: put Pam Bondi on TV more. He told the team he wanted Ms. Bondi, the former Florida attorney general who joined the White House last fall as an adviser on impeachment, to continue arguing his case on TV in the evenings.
Instead, Mr. Trump focused his attention elsewhere. As the trial unfolded last week, White House officials huddled with GOP House members and their aides in a small room in the vice president's office in the Capitol that one GOP aide described as ""mission control."" The president, the aide said, insisted advisers not call it a ""war room,"" which he said wrongly suggested Republicans were embattled and that impeachment was an actual crisis.
Republicans' arguments in favor of acquittal split broadly into two camps. Some argued that House impeachment managers' case was half-baked and that Democrats should have gone to court to pursue the testimony of further witnesses before voting to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate. Democrats countered that such a move would have significantly delayed the effort to oust Mr. Trump, who they saw as a danger to the next election.
Others in the party said House Democrats had proved their case but that the president's conduct wasn't impeachable.
Mr. Trump continues to be supportive of investigations into the Bidens, which are being pushed by his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and his allies on Capitol Hill. Hours before the Senate vote to acquit his client, Mr. Giuliani posted his fourth episode of his podcast, titled ""The Trial: The Biden Family Crimes Conclusively Proved."" In the video, he offered no new evidence but included a three-minute interlude asking viewers to subscribe to the magazine Cigar Aficionado.

WASHINGTON—Four federal prosecutors withdrew from the case against Roger Stone on Tuesday, with one resigning as an assistant U.S. attorney, as the Justice Department reversed itself and recommended less prison time for President Trump's longtime confidant.
The Justice Department's move to withdraw the recommendation it made on Monday to a U.S. judge and propose a more lenient one came hours after President Trump criticized in a tweet the original request that Mr. Stone spend more than seven years behind bars.
After the reversal became public, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Kravis, one of the government attorneys who prosecuted Mr. Stone, withdrew from the case and resigned from his post, according to a court filing. Three other prosecutors, Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys Aaron Zelinksy and Adam Jed and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Marando, also said in court filings that they were withdrawing from the case.
The fast-moving developments came one day after prosecutors asked for
a seven-to-nine-year sentence
following Mr. Stone's conviction last November for lying to Congress and witness tampering in connection with Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and any contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign.
It was an unusual reversal by the Justice Department, which typically hews to a set of legal guidelines when recommending punishments.
Mr. Trump had harshly criticized the initial request
in a tweet
and later did so at the White House. ""I thought the whole prosecution was ridiculous,"" he said in the Oval Office. ""I think it's a disgrace.""
Mr. Trump denied that he had intervened in the case and declined to discuss whether he would pardon Mr. Stone or commute his sentence.
Several leading Democrats said the developments suggested Mr. Trump was improperly influencing prosecutors' decisions. ""This is what we feared,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.). ""The message is now clear: If you commit a felony in support of the president's re-election, there will be protection there for you. It's really, really, really dangerous for the republic.""
Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said officials reached the decision to revise the recommendation on Monday night, before Mr. Trump's tweet. A senior Justice Department official played down the differences in the two main filings and said the agency wanted to clarify that it believed a sentence below the guidelines would still serve the interests of justice.
In a new sentencing memo filed in court Tuesday evening, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Crabb asked for ""a sentence of incarceration"" but said prosecutors would defer to the judge over the term. He wrote that the previous recommendation ""does not accurately reflect the Department of Justice's position on what would be a reasonable sentence in this matter.""
After the withdrawals, Mr. Crabb was the only prosecutor affiliated with the case.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said he would request that the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General investigate the matter.
Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the lead manager of the House's impeachment of Mr. Trump, said, ""It would be a blatant abuse of power if President Trump has in fact intervened to reverse the recommendations of career prosecutors at the Department of Justice.""
The ultimate decision on Mr. Stone's punishment rests in the hands of U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is scheduled to sentence Mr. Stone on Feb. 20. She has the discretion to ignore the government's sentencing recommendations and could ask the government to explain the change.

Mr. Stone was found guilty last year
of misleading Congress about his efforts to make contact with the website WikiLeaks during the 2016 presidential campaign, and of threatening a witness who would contradict his testimony. While first-time offenders like Mr. Stone generally receive sentences of a few months for crimes that include lying to Congress, the witness-tampering count ratchets up Mr. Stone's potential punishment. It carries a 20-year maximum prison term.
Traditionally, presidents go to great lengths to avoid the appearance of interfering in law-enforcement matters. Charging and sentencing decisions are generally left to the line prosecutors and their supervisors.
The appropriate sentence for Mr. Stone has been a topic of some dispute within the Justice Department in recent days, according to people familiar with the matter. Supervisors and senior Justice Department officials had pushed for more lenient treatment for the 67-year-old Mr. Stone, the people said.
The reversal came just days after Attorney General William Barr named Timothy Shea, a close aide, to become the new U.S. attorney in Washington. Mr. Shea's name appeared on both main filings.
The White House on Tuesday withdrew the nomination of Jessie Liu—Mr. Shea's predecessor as U.S. attorney who had overseen Mr. Stone's prosecution—to a senior Treasury Department position, according to a former administration official familiar with the matter.
Ms. Liu had been nominated to serve as Treasury undersecretary for terrorism and financial crimes. Ms. Liu's Senate confirmation hearing was scheduled for Thursday, and she would almost certainly have faced questions about the latest developments in the Stone case.
Ms. Liu had expected to stay in her position as U.S. attorney until her confirmation to the Treasury Department, but Mr. Barr told her he wanted her to step down, the former administration official said.
Reached for comment on the Justice Department's reversal, Bruce Rogow, Mr. Stone's defense attorney, told The Wall Street Journal that he was ""just watching and reading"" the news.
Mr. Stone's legal team called for a sentence of no incarceration, citing Mr. Stone's age and his lack of a criminal record.
The witness with whom Mr. Stone was convicted of tampering, New York comedian Randy Credico, asked Judge Jackson in a January letter not to send Mr. Stone to prison, saying such a sentence would be unnecessarily cruel.
Multiple defendants in Mr. Mueller's investigation received sentences of a few weeks in prison for lying to investigators or other crimes. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has received the longest prison term to date: about 7½ years for tax and bank fraud.

WASHINGTON—President Trump's advisers are pondering the prospect of facing off against another antiestablishment candidate armed with giant rallies, loyal supporters and bold promises.
As Bernie Sanders gains strength in the Democratic presidential primary, Mr. Trump's aides and allies largely welcome a general election matchup with the self-avowed socialist. Still, some also acknowledge that the Vermont senator, who narrowly
won the New Hampshire Democratic primary
this week and leads in national polls of the Democratic nomination contest, would enter the race with momentum and some key similarities to the president.
Mr. Trump said as much Tuesday in the Oval Office, by way of criticizing former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What issues do you think would dominate a race between President Trump and Sen. Bernie Sanders? Join the conversation below.
""Frankly, I'd rather run against Bloomberg than Bernie Sanders, because Sanders has real followers—whether you like him or not, whether you agree with him or not,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I happen to think it's terrible what he says. But he has followers.""
Both Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders have attracted passionate supporters, who flock to their rock-concert like rallies. That similarity was on display on the eve of the New Hampshire primary, when Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders
held dueling rallies in the state
. The president drew more than 11,000 supporters in Manchester and the senator more than 7,500 in Durham.
To the president, a political outsider who sees his massive rallies and loyal base as key to his electoral strength, Mr. Sanders's crowds are noteworthy. Like Mr. Trump, the senator is also a nontraditional figure who argues
he can expand the electorate
by energizing new voters with his message.
Rep. Ro Khanna (D., Calif.), who is Mr. Sanders's national campaign co-chair, stressed the senator's support on Fox News Wednesday.
""So he is building the type of coalition that can really defeat Donald Trump. And Trump actually understands it,"" Mr. Khanna said. ""I mean, Trump understands the power of crowds, he understands the power of having an online following. And he is right to recognize that Bernie Sanders is the person on the other side who's building that.""
After the New Hampshire results came in, Mr. Sanders told supporters that ""this victory here is the beginning of the end for Donald Trump.""
He later added: ""Our campaign is not just about beating Trump, it is about transforming this country.""
Polling shows Mr. Sanders, whose campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, performing similarly to others in the Democratic race in hypothetical matchups with Mr. Trump. A recent WSJ/NBC poll showed Mr. Sanders leading Mr. Trump 49% to 46%.
For months, the Trump campaign has openly relished the prospect of running against Mr. Sanders, actively seeking to elevate him with commentary and social media posts suggesting he was being disenfranchised by the Democratic Party.
People with knowledge of campaign and White House thinking said Mr. Sanders was viewed as the Democratic candidate who generated significant voter enthusiasm, with his highly motivated base of support. While they consider him beatable and many said they welcome the contrast, some also characterized him as a candidate who could appeal as Mr. Trump did in 2016.
But Trump's allies also argue that Mr. Sanders's policies, including Medicare for All, may lean too far left for much of the electorate,
particularly the suburban voters
who helped power Democratic wins in 2018.
""He's always been my first choice"" to run against, said former 2016 Trump campaign aide Barry Bennett. ""I just think he is the starkest contrast. … I just don't think that a candidate that far left has much appeal outside of California and New York.""
Democratic strategist Jim Manley said Mr. Sanders provided a lot of opportunities for Republicans to attack.
""I get the idea that Team Trump is going to go low no matter who we put up, but I for one think Sen. Sanders is going to be a really target-rich environment for a lot of Trump folks, starting with the president,"" he said. But he added: ""They need to take him seriously because just like Trump he's got a movement around him, and he's very good at painting his opponents as the enemy.""
Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh characterized Mr. Sanders as the ""Democratic front-runner and has been the intellectual leader of his party in this campaign."" He argued that whoever the eventual candidate is, ""Bernie's mark on the race has been to dictate the issues that are required for Democrats to embrace.""
Just how this face-off could affect the electoral map remains uncertain. Mr. Sanders is viewed as a strong contender in some key battleground states, including Michigan and Wisconsin, which Mr. Trump captured in 2016 with a similar message on trade and manufacturing.
But his liberal views on issues like taxes and health care
may prove a tougher sell in other states
Democrats are hoping to put in play, like Georgia. Mr. Sanders and his allies say his policies are more popular with the general public than Republicans contend.
White House counselor Kellyanne Conway also stressed that Mr. Trump will be running on a record in 2020.
""Bernie is still in the promising stage, and the president has delivery and results on trade deals with China, with Mexico, with Japan,"" she said. ""Now it's the difference between the progressive and the progress report.""

WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration unveiled its long-delayed Middle East peace plan, giving Israelis much of what they have long sought, including allowing for immediate expansion of territory, while providing Palestinians a path to nationhood but under conditions they instantly rejected.
""Today Israel is taking a giant step toward peace,"" President Trump said Tuesday at the White House with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel at his side.
Some Israeli goals, such as annexing the Jordan River Valley and permanently setting its eastern border, may advance as soon as this weekend, when Mr. Netanyahu plans to ask his cabinet for approval to move ahead.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas rejected the plan. ""We say a thousand times, no, no, no to the deal of the century,"" Mr. Abbas said. ""We rejected this deal from the start and our stance was correct.""
The Trump proposal requires many more concessions from the Palestinians than from the Israelis. Israel has agreed to a four-year freeze on expanding settlements in areas that might make up the core of a Palestinian state, while the Palestinians consider whether to accept terms set by the plan, including demilitarization and Israeli control of all security arrangements from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean.
Trump administration officials cast the design as the best the Palestinians could expect given Israel security requirements. U.S. officials are calculating that Arab pressure could eventually prompt the Palestinians to go along.
Ambassadors from the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Bahrain attended the rollout, and Egypt and the U.A.E. issued statements in support. ""Egypt calls on the two relevant parties to undertake a careful and thorough consideration of the U.S. vision to achieve peace and open channels of dialogue, under U.S. auspices,"" the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.
In a cautious statement on Twitter, the Saudi Foreign Ministry said the kingdom ""encourages the start of direct peace negotiation between the Palestinian and Israeli sides, under the auspices of the United States . . .""
Jordan, however, took aim at one of the principal elements of the Trump plan by warning against ""unilateral Israeli measures such as the annexation of Palestinian lands.""
Important elements of the plan have now been set in motion in a way that ensures substantial Israeli territorial gains regardless of what the Palestinians say or whether the plan is approved by other world powers or the United Nations.
The Palestinian Authority cut ties with the Trump administration after the U.S. in 2017 recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, but Mr. Trump called on it to engage now that the blueprint has been unveiled.
Mr. Trump has said he wants to help Palestinians economically, and the plan vows to help marshal $50 billion in economic investment over 10 years if the Palestinians agree to its terms.
The incentives, part of an economic portion of the Mideast plan released last year, aim to double the Palestinian gross domestic product, slash Palestinian unemployment rates and cut the Palestinian poverty rate in half, U.S. officials assert.
The plan was criticized by some Middle East experts as a ploy to boost Messrs. Netanyahu and Trump domestically while failing to narrow the deep-seated differences between Palestinians and the Israelis. Mr. Trump faces an impeachment trial while Mr. Netanyahu has been charged with bribery.
The blueprint outlines an Israeli-U.S. consensus on the most sensitive issues of the conflict -- Jerusalem, borders, security, and refugees -- that had until now been left for so-called final-status negotiations.
The plan grants Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem -- a move the Palestinians have long rejected -- with Palestinians gaining a capital in areas east and north of a barrier that Israel constructed along the outskirts of the city during the second intifada.
Arab residents of Jerusalem could choose to become citizens of Israel or of the new Palestinian state. Alternatively, they could remain permanent residents of Israel without becoming citizens of either state.
Regarding borders, the Palestinian footprint would more than double, to include about 80% of the West Bank, U.S. officials said. Land swaps between Israel and Palestinians would be used to enlarge Gaza, which also would be connected to the West Bank by high-speed rail. The ""Triangle Communities"" -- Arab towns inside of Israel southeast of Haifa -- could become part of the future Palestinian state under the plan.
Israel would get about 30% of the West Bank, U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said, including the Jordan Valley and the Jewish settlements there.
On refugees, the plan rejects the right of return to land for Palestinians who left their homes after Israel's creation in 1948. It says refugees can be absorbed into the Palestinian state, integrate into host countries or be resettled in regional countries who agree to take them. The plan also supports the creation of a fund to compensate some refugees.
The Palestinians must meet strict political and security conditions set by the plan to satisfy requirements for forming a state.
Most of those requirements have been rejected by Palestinians in the past. For instance, during the four-year negotiation period, the plan requires that they refrain from taking action against Israel in the International Criminal Court and dismiss their current claims.
They also must halt payments to families of Palestinians imprisoned in Israeli jails and to families of Palestinians killed while attacking Israelis or resisting Israel's control of the Palestinian territories. Palestinian officials have argued that such funding is a social benefit that compensates for Israeli oppression and helps prevent families from radicalizing further.
The demands made of the Palestinians are all the more difficult given the divisions in their ranks. Hamas, considered by Israel and the U.S. to be a terrorist organization, controls the Gaza Strip after multiple failed reconciliation efforts with the Palestinian Authority, which controls the Palestinian parts of the West Bank.
To satisfy the terms of Mr. Trump's blueprint, Hamas would need to yield control of Gaza, which then would be demilitarized.
In recent years, Hamas's leadership has said it would accept the state of Israel within its pre-1967 borders -- even though individual Hamas members continue to call for Israel's destruction.
Tamara Cofman Wittes, a Middle East expert at the Brookings Institution, said the proposals fail to provide a foundation for lasting peace. ""They are structured as a diktat,"" she said. ""The administration has made it clear that it plans to recognize Israeli sovereignty over all the land indicated for the Israelis in Trump's map, whether the Palestinians accept it or not.""

How the President's
Plan Has Evolved
Key dates in President Trump's Middle East plan:
November 2016: After his election, Mr. Trump says he will put his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in charge of a peace effort.
December 2017: President Trump recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's capital and begins to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv, prompting Palestinian officials to cut off all official contact with the U.S. government. Administration officials initially said they would present their peace plan in 2018.
May 2018: U.S. hosts embassy opening in Jerusalem, while more than 50 people are killed in Gaza border protests, beginning a cycle of periodic violent clashes between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
September 2018: President Trump promises to issue his plan by early 2019, after Gaza violence and the embassy-move fallout delay it.
Late 2018: Israel's parliament dissolves, setting up April election.
May 2019: Parliament again dissolves after an inconclusive April vote, prompting new elections and delaying again the Trump administration plans to release the peace blueprint.
June 2019: U.S. releases economic portion of its plan at a conference in Bahrain. Officials say they will host follow-up discussions to get international powers to back the document, but none are announced.
December 2019: Israel goes to a third set of elections; U.S. officials say this will again delay release of the Trump peace plan.
January 2020: President Trump invites Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Blue and White Party leader Benny Gantz to discuss the plan and release it.

DES MOINES, Iowa—As Iowa's leadoff caucuses approach, Democratic presidential hopefuls are vying for the nomination and President Trump is showing off his campaign muscle.
But for the Republicans seeking to wrest the GOP nomination from the incumbent, Iowa largely presents an opportunity to remind voters that they exist.
The Republican outcome in Iowa and beyond is considered a foregone conclusion, with the party firmly behind the president. Still, former Illinois Congressman Joe Walsh and former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld are pitching themselves as alternatives to Mr. Trump, arguing that some voters may be receptive to another GOP approach.
""I believe in my bones that Donald Trump is unfit,"" said Mr. Walsh, 58, who served in Congress for one term. ""And I thought it was really important that there was a Republican out there—a Republican—every day making that case. I knew it would be difficult.""
It's been an uphill battle. A number of states have canceled their Republican primaries and caucuses this year, a move both parties have made when there is an incumbent president. State party operations are strongly behind Mr. Trump, and 91% of Republicans approve of his job performance, according to a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.
The challenge for GOP challengers was evident Friday night in Des Moines, as Mr. Walsh appeared at a community forum put on by urban groups. As he was questioned about issues like climate change, minimum wage and sentencing laws, there appeared to be few Republicans in the crowd.
At one point, Mr. Walsh jokingly said: ""You probably won't caucus for me. It's great to be here.""
Mr. Walsh acknowledged during his remarks that he had supported President Trump before turning on the president, saying, ""If I could take that vote back, I would,"" and adding that any of the Democratic options would be ""better in the White House."" A former radio show host, Mr. Walsh has a history of controversial comments, including the false suggestion that President Obama is a Muslim. Mr. Walsh has expressed regret for those remarks in a New York Times opinion piece.
While Mr. Walsh has made a number of trips to Iowa, Mr. Weld, 74, has put more attention on New Hampshire. Still, he was coming to Iowa on Saturday for his own campaign events, touting an endorsement from former Iowa Congressman Jim Leach, a Republican.
Calling his Iowa expectations ""modest,"" Mr. Weld said he wants people ""to understand that there is an alternative to the president to anybody who may not be totally bought in to everything.""
Mr. Weld emphasized that he was pitching himself as an economic conservative with concerns about environmental protections. He said he disagreed with Mr. Trump's trade policies and stressed that he had concerns about the president's fitness for office.
Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh showed little concern about the president's intraparty foes.
""We spend zero time thinking about anything else other than beating whoever the Democratic opponent is,"" he said.
While the caucus results aren't in doubt, Mr. Trump is using the moment to unleash a show of campaign strength. He held a massive rally in Des Moines Thursday night and is sending roughly 80 surrogates to the state on caucus night, seeking to boost enthusiasm for Monday night, as well as build his organization for the general election.
Asked about the prospects for Mr. Walsh and Mr. Weld, Iowa Republican Party Chairman Jeff Kaufmann was blunt.
""They are not taking Iowa seriously and my expectation is that Iowans are not going to take them seriously,"" he said, adding that ""even if they were spending time here, I don't know what case would be made.""
Mr. Walsh and Mr. Weld, who are friendly with each other, both argued the party was controlled by the president. ""The state party in every state is the Trump organization,"" Mr. Weld said.

WASHINGTON— President Trump granted a pardon to financier Michael Milken, the onetime ""junk bond king"" who spent nearly two years in prison for securities-law violations, and commuted the sentence of Rod Blagojevich, a former Illinois governor who was midway through a 14-year sentence for multiple counts of corruption.
Mr. Milken served 22 months of a 10-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to several securities-law violations in 1990. He was barred from the securities industry for life and paid hundreds of millions of dollars in fines, penalties, restitution to investors and civil settlements. The White House said Mr. Milken's pardon doesn't affect his ban from the securities industry.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What do you think are the strongest arguments for or against clemency? Join the conversation below.
After his 1993 release from federal prison, Mr. Milken established and endowed a philanthropic organization devoted to cancer research. His supporters have emphasized that his philanthropy also predated his conviction and fall from pre-eminence in the world of high-yield bond financing.
Attorneys for Mr. Milken have long sought a presidential pardon. They lobbied President Bill Clinton before he exited office, but the move faced strong law-enforcement opposition.
In commuting the sentence of Mr. Blagojevich, who was a former contestant on Mr. Trump's reality TV show ""The Celebrity Apprentice"" in 2010, Mr. Trump said he has served a long time in prison.
""I don't know him very well, I've met him a couple of times he was on for a short time on 'The Apprentice' years ago,"" Mr. Trump told reporters, referring to his reality TV show. He said that ""many people disagree with the sentence,"" and stressed that the Illinois politician was a Democrat.
""He'll be able to go back home with his family,"" Mr. Trump said.
Pardons can help rehabilitate the reputation of people convicted of crimes. They can also serve to restore rights such as the right to vote or serve in public office.
In his remarks, Mr. Trump declined to say if he was considering a potential pardon for longtime confidant Roger Stone. Earlier in the day, a federal judge
declined to delay Mr. Stone's sentencing
, set for Thursday, amid tumultuous developments in the case of the informal adviser to President Trump.
Mr. Stone was convicted last year
of lying to Congress and witness tampering.
""I haven't given it any thought,"" Mr. Trump said, when asked about a potential pardon for Mr. Stone. ""In the meantime he's going through a process, but I think he's been treated very unfairly.""
Mr. Blagojevich, 62 years old, was arrested in December 2008 after he was heard on wiretaps allegedly seeking to sell an appointment to the Senate seat Barack Obama vacated upon his election as president.

""I've got this thing, and it's f— golden. I'm just not giving it up for f— nothing,"" the Democratic governor was overheard saying. Within weeks, he was impeached and removed from office by the Illinois Legislature.
The U.S. attorney who oversaw the prosecution, Patrick Fitzgerald, said at the time that Mr. Blagojevich's arrest had ""interrupted a political-corruption crime spree.""
The action culminates a yearslong campaign by Mr. Blagojevich and his family
to win Mr. Trump's sympathy
by likening the former governor's prosecution to the probes the president has faced from special counsel Robert Mueller and House Democrats. Mr. Blagojevich began serving his sentence in March 2012.
The Blagojevich case, however, has scrambled partisan divisions, with advocates and critics of leniency falling on both sides of the aisle. While
all five Republicans
in Illinois' congressional delegation have joined with the state's Democratic governor to oppose clemency, other Democrats and Republicans have supported it, as have several Fox News personalities along with such figures as Alan Dershowitz, who helped defend Mr. Trump in his impeachment trial, and the
Rev. Jesse Jackson.

The moves involving Messrs. Milken and Blagojevich were the most high profile of a series of executive clemency grants on Tuesday, including other pardons and commutations.
Mr. Trump also pardoned former New York Police Department Commissioner Bernard Kerik, who won national acclaim for managing the NYPD in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. He was tapped by President George W. Bush to head the Department of Homeland Security in 2004, but withdrew under pressure during the background check process
He later pleaded guilty to eight felony counts, including tax fraud and multiple counts of lying to federal officials. He was sentenced to four years in prison and
was released in 2013
.
Mr. Trump also pardoned David Safavian, a former chief of staff for the General Services Administration who was convicted of lying to investigators about his relationship with disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. He was sentenced to one year in prison.
The president also pardoned Edward DeBartolo Jr., a former owner of the San Francisco 49ers,
who pleaded guilty
to a felony in 1998 as part of a Louisiana gambling-industry investigation. He paid $1 million in fines and restitution but served no jail time.
President Trump issued seven pardons and four commutations on Tuesday. Here is a rundown.
PARDONS
* Edward DeBartolo, Jr.: Pleaded guilty to a felony regarding a payment demanded for a riverboat casino license in Louisiana. He paid $1 million in fines and restitution, served no jail time. ""His exceptional compassion and warmth define his character to this day,"" the White House said.
* Michael Milken: Credited with helping to popularize the use of junk bonds to finance bold and sometimes hostile takeovers. Pleaded guilty to several securities-law violations in 1990. He served 22 months of a 10-year prison sentence. ""We have Mike Milken, who's gone around and done an incredible job for the world, with all of his research on cancer, and he's done this and he suffered greatly,"" Mr. Trump said.
* Ariel Friedler: Pleaded guilty to conspiracy to access a protected computer without authorization and served two months in prison.
* Bernard Kerik: The former New York Police Department commissioner was tapped by President George W. Bush to head the Department of Homeland Security in 2004, but withdrew under pressure during the background check process. He was sentenced to four years in prison for tax fraud and for making false statements. Mr. Trump said he was ""a man who had many recommendations from a lot of good people.""
* Paul Pogue: The construction company owner pleaded guilty to filing false returns and was sentenced to three years of probation.
* David Safavian: The former government official was convicted of lying to investigators about his relationship with disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. He was sentenced to one year in prison.
* Angela Stanton: She was involved in a stolen vehicle ring and served a six-month home confinement sentence.
COMMUTATIONS
* Rod Blagojevich: The former Illinois governor was midway through a 14-year sentence for multiple counts of corruption. He was heard on wiretaps allegedly seeking to sell an appointment to the Senate seat Barack Obama vacated upon his election as president. ""That was a tremendously powerful, ridiculous sentence, in my opinion,"" Mr. Trump said.
* Tynice Nichole Hall: Served nearly 14 years of an 18-year sentence for allowing her apartment to be used to distribute drugs.
* Crystal Munoz: Spent 12 years in prison for her role in a marijuana smuggling ring.
* Judith Negron: Sentenced to 35 years in prison for her role in a scheme by her health-care company to defraud the federal government.

WASHINGTON—The Supreme Court on Tuesday denied requests to quickly decide the fate of the Affordable Care Act, a move that is likely to make the health-care law play less of a role in the 2020 election.
A group of 20 Democratic-led states and the U.S. House of Representatives had asked the court to fast-track their appeals so that the latest legal battle over the Obama-era law could be resolved by the end of June.
The justices denied those requests in a one-sentence order with no dissents noted. The move likely means that any court consideration of the ACA won't happen until the fall at the earliest, with any decision likely coming after Election Day.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you think the Supreme Court's failure to take action on the ACA before the election will play out with candidates and with voters? Join the conversation below.
The Supreme Court has twice upheld the ACA. Had the court issued another ruling this summer, it could have placed the issue at the center of the election and put pressure on President Trump and other Republicans, no matter the outcome.
The latest case stems from a lawsuit brought by Republican-led states and backed by the Trump administration that
challenged the law's insurance mandate
. Mr. Trump has pledged to repeal the ACA and has long promised to release his own health plan.
Last week, Mr. Trump claimed he had saved coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, but his Justice Department has argued for the invalidation of that provision in the current litigation.
The Supreme Court's move on Tuesday comes after a New Orleans-based federal appeals court
ruled last month
that a central feature of the ACA was unconstitutional. That part of the law required most individuals to carry health insurance or pay a penalty. The appeals court declined to say whether any, some or all other parts of the law remain enforceable without the mandate, leaving the federal health-policy regime in legal limbo.
The law continues to remain in effect during the litigation, which began after a GOP-controlled Congress reduced the penalty under the insurance mandate to $0. The GOP-led states argued the elimination of the tax rendered the mandate unconstitutional.
The appeals court has ordered a federal judge in Texas to reconsider what parts of the sprawling health law can remain in place, but the Democratic-led states and House were seeking to have the Supreme Court go ahead and rule that the entire law remains valid.
The timing of the appeals court ruling, after more than five months of deliberations, put the law's defenders in a bind, because it made it difficult to squeeze the case onto the Supreme Court's current calendar, which likely filled up last week.
The House and the Democratic states floated the possibility of a special argument session in May, but the court rarely agrees to place additional days for arguments on its schedule. The justices seemed even less likely to do so this time because they already have an unusually long list of blockbuster cases to decide before the end of June, including ones on abortion, gay rights, gun rights and immigration.
The Trump administration argued against expedited Supreme Court consideration of the case, saying in a court brief that there were no exigencies that required it.
Democratic presidential candidates including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg have all criticized President Trump as a threat to health coverage and the ACA, and a number have cited the administration's support for the lawsuit as evidence.
Judd Deere, a spokesman for the White House, said on Tuesday: ""While radical Democrats propose plans that would destroy the health insurance of millions of Americans, President Trump continues to work to improve health care more broadly, including creating a system that protects the vulnerable and those with pre-existing conditions, and delivers the affordability Americans need, the choice and control they want, and the quality they deserve.""
About half of Americans now approve of the ACA, according to Gallup, up slightly from 48% in fall of 2018.
The court's decision leaves uncertainty hanging over health care. Hospital groups have said the lack of clarity on the long-term status of the ACA is complicating decisions on investments, and patient groups have said consumers are concerned they could lose health-care coverage if the law is struck down.
""The court's decision today leaves the fate of tens of millions of people who could lose health coverage protections for pre-existing health conditions, and access to treatment for substance use disorders and mental health, maternal care, and more, up in the air,"" said Emily Stewart, executive director of Community Catalyst, a consumer advocacy group.

WASHINGTON—More Americans are taking a favorable view of President Trump's leadership as he navigates
the novel coronavirus pandemic
, with some measures of support hitting or tying all-time highs.
Approval of Mr. Trump's handling of the outbreak has risen by 8 percentage points in weekly Economist/YouGov surveys over the course of March, standing at 49% in a poll that ended Tuesday, with 44% disapproving.
Gallup surveys found Trump's overall job approval rating at 49% in a survey that ended Sunday, tying a record high he had hit earlier this year as the Senate took up impeachment. The president's job approval rose to 45%, its highest mark since early 2017, in a Pew Research Center survey released Thursday. An average of polls by Real Clear Politics finds Mr. Trump's approval rating at 47%, at or near a high, with just under 50% disapproving.
Americans typically rally behind their president during a national crisis.

In this case, some surveys find Americans optimistic but not fully confident the administration can navigate the crisis. Some 20% of respondents who said they approved of Mr. Trump's handling of the outbreak in the latest Economist/YouGov poll were also ""uneasy'' or ""not sure'' when asked if he could ""deal wisely'' with the problem.
""When you're in the middle of a crisis, there's a willingness to take a step back from prior personal views and give the president an opportunity—any president, not just Trump,'' said David Winston, a Republican pollster and strategist.
Other than the core supporters of each party, he said, ""Americans are not thinking politically. They feel personally threatened, and this is not a political dynamic.'' For now, he said, Americans may support Mr. Trump while making no change in their broader political outlook or voting decisions.
Stanley Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, described the boost in Mr. Trump's ratings as modest. ""It's an uptick, when it should be the country embracing him. ... He has not rallied the country,'' Mr. Greenberg said.
Some polls support the idea that Mr. Trump's higher approval ratings are not changing underlying views of him or his re-election, at least so far.
The president's expected Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, has led Mr. Trump by about 4 percentage points in test match-ups through March in Economist/YouGov polling, at the same time views of Mr. Trump's work on the coronavirus issue brightened. Some polls have shown a wider margin. Mr. Biden led by 9 points in a Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey earlier this month.
In an earlier era—from the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941 through the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001—presidents received a boost of 10 points or more in their approval ratings amidst crises, Gallup polling has found. President Kennedy's rating jumped by 13 points during the Cuban missile crisis, as did President Carter's rating just after American hostages were seized in Iran. In both cases, the boost lasted for months.
Increased partisanship has made such spikes less common, as presidents now win little support from members of the opposing party. Gallup reports that the biggest increases for President Obama and Mr. Trump were 7 percentage points—for Mr. Obama after U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden in 2011 and for Mr. Trump after a government shutdown ended in 2019.

WASHINGTON—Alarmed about the unprecedented cash Michael Bloomberg is
pouring into the presidential race
, Republicans are moving to press top donors to contribute more than planned to ensure President Trump isn't outspent in the fall.
The president's allies have reached out to supporters such as casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, who discussed Mr. Bloomberg's spending during a dinner last week with Vice President Mike Pence, according to people familiar with the matter. Other billionaires Trump allies plan to target include Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison and Blackstone Group Inc. CEO Stephen Schwarzman.
Mr. Bloomberg has spent roughly half a billion dollars on advertising alone, according to ad tracker CMAG/Kantar. The former New York City mayor has said he would devote some of his $55 billion fortune to helping whichever Democrat wins the nomination.
""Trump world has always thought he would be better funded than the eventual Democratic nominee,"" said GOP donor Dan Eberhart. ""Now, maybe not.""
The president's campaign, together with the Republican National Committee,
has raised enormous sums
in recent years—at least compared with past campaigns, though not with Mr. Bloomberg's planned spending. The campaign said last week that the re-election effort's war chest tops $200 million, after it raised $60.5 million in January. That is about double the $29.1 million President Obama and Democrats raised in the same period of 2012.
Allies of Mr. Trump are always asking donors to give more. They are focusing their recent push on getting top donors to give large sums to pro-Trump super PACs—which can accept unlimited amounts of money—rather than only hosting fundraisers. People familiar with the efforts said Mr. Bloomberg's spending was motivation for donors to get off the sidelines sooner rather than later.
""The Bloomberg threat is something you have to be ready for,"" said a fundraiser familiar with the effort. ""Better now than in August, when you have to say, 'Oh, shoot, we have to find another $1 billion.' You want enough time to actually spend it right.""
Amid Mr. Bloomberg's spending, concerns have also grown among some Republican donors that America First Action, the primary pro-Trump super PAC to date, hasn't been forceful enough in its fundraising. Through December, according to FEC filings, several of the party's top donors hadn't donated to the super PAC. Its largest donor in that period was Linda McMahon, the former U.S. Small Business Administration head and co-founder of World Wrestling Entertainment Inc. who now serves as the super PAC's chairwoman.
""We literally fundraise every day,"" the group's spokeswoman, Kelly Sadler, said in response to a question about to those concerns.

In early February, the super PAC sent an email to supporters warning of the impact Mr. Bloomberg was having on the race. A memo titled ""The Bloomberg Effect,"" sent on the night of the New Hampshire primary, detailed his media spending and the increase in advertising rates in key states. ""We need to be prepared to make certain that President Trump has the financial support he needs to compete,"" the email read.
Ms. Sadler said officials weren't anxious about Mr. Bloomberg's impact and that the group regularly sent out such emails to motivate donors. The group aims to raise $300 million and had spent about $4 million on ads so far, she said.
The Bloomberg campaign didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the 'Bloomberg Effect' memo.""
In addition to spending hundreds of millions on TV and social media advertising,
Mr. Bloomberg's campaign
now has more than 2,400 staffers, many in battleground states that will decide the outcome in November. While some donors' concerns about Mr. Bloomberg's candidacy subsided after the former mayor's widely panned debate performance last week, the threat of his cash will remain: Mr. Bloomberg hasn't ruled out spending as much as $1 billion through November even if he isn't the party's nominee.
Share Your Thoughts
How do you think Republican fundraising will stack up against Michael Bloomberg's fortune? Join the conversation below.
Some of the donors approached about countering Mr. Bloomberg's spending have already agreed to hold fundraisers for the president. Last week, Mr. Ellison of Oracle helped raise $7 million at his home in California. Mr. Adelson is scheduled to hold an event March 12 in Las Vegas.
Mr. Ellison didn't donate to the Trump campaign in 2016 and has never donated to America First Action. Mr. Adelson gave the super PAC $5 million for the midterm elections in 2018—part of more than $123 million he and his wife donated to candidates and conservative causes during that election cycle—but hasn't donated this cycle, according to Federal Election Commission records covering the period through December.
Mr. Pence, who was campaigning with the president out west last week, dined Thursday evening with the Adelsons, people familiar with the matter said. Among other topics, they discussed Mr. Bloomberg's spending, and Mr. Pence raised with Mr. Adelson the resources the president would need ahead of the November election, one of the people said.
Donald Trump Jr. and Kimberly Guilfoyle, the national chairwoman of Trump Victory Finance Committee and Mr. Trump Jr.'s girlfriend, held meetings last week with more than a half-dozen donors in Las Vegas, including Frank and Lorenzo Fertitta, the billionaire brothers who once owned the Ultimate Fighting Championship circuit, a person familiar with the matter said. Mr. Bloomberg's spending came up, the person said, but wasn't the focus of the discussions.
At a Trump campaign rally Friday in Las Vegas, Mr. Adelson sat in the audience wearing a ""Keep America Great"" hat. Mr. Trump, spotting the casino billionaire, singled him out as a ""great, great person"" and added: ""He's got so much money, he doesn't know what the hell to do with it.""

President Trump has long enjoyed the outsize attention of the national media. As he seeks his second term, his re-election campaign is amping up efforts to garner local press coverage.
Mr. Trump gives some local interviews when he appears in states for rallies, but his surrogates are the ones carrying much of the load. Campaign manager Brad Parscale wooed voters at widely attended events in Texas and Oregon. Former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders personally filed the paperwork to ensure Mr. Trump was on the ballot in Arkansas. The president's daughter-in-law Lara Trump hopped on a bus tour through Iowa.
The aggressive push for attention from regional newspapers, radio and TV stations reflects the vast resources associated with Mr. Trump's massive re-election bid as well as the platform afforded to an incumbent president. But it also reveals a strategic goal for the campaign as it heads into a tough re-election cycle: to shift focus of coverage in as many places as possible away from events dominating the national media, like the
impeachment trial gripping the Capitol.

While all campaigns do some amount of this outreach, the Trump campaign has made a specialty of bracketing his in-person campaign rallies with events before and after, designed to maximize local media coverage. They also have been holding stand-alone events in some states, like the ballot-filing efforts and surrogate appearances.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How should news-media outlets balance coverage of an event against free exposure for political candidates? Join the conversation below.
""It matters to tell the president's story through a local lens. It allows us to talk about the president and what he's been able to accomplish through the eyes of somebody in Wisconsin or Florida or Minnesota,"" said Rick Gorka, a spokesman for the Trump Victory committee, the joint fundraising operation of Mr. Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee.
As the impeachment trial unfolds in Washington, the president is planning two rallies this week—in New Jersey Tuesday and Iowa Thursday, along with other events in the states.
Democrats, for their part, are seeking to aggressively counter Mr. Trump's efforts. The Democratic National Committee has a team in Washington focused on local issues, as well as staff in six battleground states. They work with local Democratic surrogates to beat back the president's messages and put on rival events whenever Mr. Trump has a rally. A Democratic aide said there was no comparable program this early in 2016.
""We are not waiting for the primary to be over to start the work of the general election—we are doing the work right now to communicate a general-election message to voters in the outlets they are reading every day,"" said David Bergstein, DNC director of battleground state communications.
Mr. Gorka said the Trump campaign and the RNC were building the ""largest regional communications team the RNC has ever had."" He said that by Election Day there would be 60 people on the team, mostly distributed around the country. Already they have nine regional political directors and staff in 18 states.
The GOP staffing is a significant increase compared with four years ago, when Mr. Gorka said the RNC had about 11 people working in this type of regional role and the campaign about the same number.
So far there have been thousands of local radio interviews and hundreds of TV appearances by Trump aides and surrogates. Top supporters have attended more than a dozen ballot-paperwork events at statehouses, and preview events have been held in the days before the president's rallies at least five times.
Key figures out on the road include Vice President Mike Pence and the president's son Donald Trump Jr., as well as his girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle, who works for the campaign. Ahead of the president's recent rally in Toledo, Ohio, Lara Trump, also a top campaign aide, appeared at a Columbus hotel, declaring that ""all roads to the White House run through Ohio.""
""I think it's smart,"" said Matt Paul, a Democratic strategist based in Iowa, who worked for Hillary Clinton's 2016 bid. ""There's such division and discord in the country that finding those opportunities to punch through at the neighborhood level matters and may matter more in this cycle than we've seen in the past. ""
During his first run for president, Mr. Trump enjoyed huge attention from the national press, as he held massive rallies, called in to television shows and generally disrupted campaigning as usual. This time, investing in local outreach is seen as good insurance against sometimes unflattering national coverage, particularly in states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which the president narrowly captured last time.
Also on the ground in key states is Democratic super PAC Priorities USA, which has communications teams in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Florida, said spokesman Josh Schwerin, who said they try to provide context about the president's policies. But he acknowledged they can only move the needle in certain ways.
""When he goes and does a rally, that's going to be the headline and there's really not much anyone can do about that,"" said Mr. Schwerin. ""What we can do is make sure that when Trump says this is the greatest economy in history, that [the story] says there has been a record number of farm bankruptcies in Wisconsin.""

The U.S. drone strike that
killed the Iranian Quds Force commander
marks a pivot toward direct confrontation with Iran, further entangling the U.S. in the Middle East after years of trying to avoid a major conflict.
Since taking office, President Trump has made a priority of winding up the fight against Islamic State militants and
reducing the American military footprint in the Middle East.
The Trump administration was determined to roll back Iranian power and stop its nuclear program by
tightening economic sanctions
—not through military power.
With Islamic State seemingly routed in Iraq and Syria, and
Tehran lashing out in the face of a deteriorating economy
, the U.S. and Iran have entered a new phase as they vie to shape the ragged peace in an unsteady part of the world.

See-sawing tensions in recent months
rose in the past few weeks, with Iranian-backed militias trying to harass U.S. forces by stepping up rocket attacks against multiple bases in Iraq. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned in mid-December that should harm come to any American the U.S. would respond decisively.

On Dec. 27 the administration's red line was finally crossed
when a rocket attack carried out by the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia killed an American contractor at a base near Kirkuk, north of Baghdad.
That set in motion a spiral of violence that ultimately led
to the targeting of Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani,
the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's overseas wing, and Iraqi paramilitary military leader Abu Mahdi al-Mohandes on a road leading from the Baghdad airport.
""Ever since the U.S. official was killed in indirect fire in Iraq, [President Trump] said enough is enough,"" according to a senior White House official.
Rising Tensions With Iran
Before the U.S. strike that killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, friction between the two countries was building.
* May 18, 2018: U.S. pulls out of an international nuclear deal and reimposes sanctions on Iran.
* April 8, 2019: The Trump administration lists the Islamic Revolutionary Guard as a terrorist organization.
* April 22, 2019: U.S. cancels waivers for Iran's remaining oil customers, further curbing the country's oil revenues.
* June 13, 2019: U.S. blames Iran for an attack on oil tankers off the Iranian southern coast. Tehran denies responsibility.
* June 20, 2019: Iran shoots down a U.S. drone which it says was on a spy mission over its territory. The U.S. says the drone was in international air space.
* July 28, 2019: The U.S. shoots down an Iranian drone it says was flying too close to a U.S. warship in the Strait of Hormuz.
* Sept. 14, 2019: Missile and drone strikes on Saudi oil facilities briefly knock out about 50% of the country's oil production. The U.S. blames Iran.
* Dec. 9, 2019: A rocket attack in Baghdad wounds members of Iraq's Counterterrorism Service, trained by the U.S. The U.S. blames Iran.
* Dec. 13, 2019: U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warns that any rocket attacks carried out by Iran or its proxies in Iraq that harm Americans ""will be answered by a decisive U.S. response.""
* Dec. 27, 2019: Over 30 rockets are fired at an Iraqi base that hosts U.S. forces, killing an American contractor. The U.S. blames Iranian-backed Iraqi militia Kataib Hezbollah.
* Dec. 29, 2019: The U.S. carries out airstrikes against five Kataib Hezbollah sites in Iraq and Syria, killing 27 people.
* Dec. 31, 2019: Supporters and members of Kataib Hezbollah, as well as others, attempt to storm the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad
""We took action last night to stop a war,"" President Trump said Friday. ""We did not take action to start a war.""
In killing the Iranian commander, the Trump administration is gambling that it can weaken Iran's regional influence, possibly forcing Tehran to negotiate. Such an outcome could further boost Mr. Trump as he faces an impeachment trial and gears up for re-election.
Critics said the killing of Gen. Soleimani is more likely to inflame tensions, generating reprisals from Iran and potentially miring the U.S. further in the region.
""The level of unpredictability going forward is very concerning to me,"" said Rep. Andy Kim (D., N.J.), who was the Iraq director at the National Security Council under President Obama. He said the Obama administration considered killing Gen. Soleimani but never went through with it because of concerns about a backlash.
Defense officials said Gen. Soleimani was behind the dozen or so rocket attacks that showered Iraqi bases since October, including the strike that killed the American contractor, who was working as a linguist. The Iranian commander was involved in plotting future attacks on Americans in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq, having recently visited those places as part of the planning, the officials said.
There was ""clear, unambiguous intelligence indicating a significant campaign of violence against the United States in the days, weeks and months"" ahead, Army Gen. Mark Milley, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters Friday.
""These were attacks targeting American diplomats, American military personnel and facilities that house Americans,"" a State Department official said.
After the death of the contractor, on Dec. 27, the U.S. responded with airstrikes against compounds of the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah paramilitary group in Iraq and Syria that the group says killed 27 people. That weekend, President Trump also authorized the use of military force on Gen. Soleimani, U.S. officials said.
Gen. Milley, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Mr. Pompeo discussed the strike with Mr. Trump, who was winding up a two-week holiday at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago. Senior officials concluded that ""there was a reasonable chance"" the strike wouldn't spark a war and would instead empower moderates in Iran, a White House official said.
The official said discussions on targeting Gen. Soleimani also ""went through a legal review"" to determine whether it qualified as self-defense.
Five days later, Gen. Soleimani flew to Baghdad, becoming what one defense official described as a ""target of opportunity."" The airport road that Gen. Soleimani and Mr. Mohandes took has few exit ramps and is lined with high walls, making it an optimum location for a targeted killing.
As Gen. Solemiani started out on that road an unmanned aerial drone dropped ordnance on the convoy, the defense officials said.
Mr. Pompeo said the attack aimed to show resolve to deter Iran against further aggression and that ""the U.S. remains committed to de-escalation."" President Trump, in a tweet, said Iran has never won a war, nor lost a negotiation.
Getting Iran to refrain from reprisals is unlikely, experts say. ""Nobody in the administration thinks that is going to happen,"" said Kirsten Fontenrose of the Atlantic Council foreign-policy think tank, who left Mr. Trump's NSC in November 2018.
After Gen. Soleimani's death, Iran's leaders named a replacement and vowed retaliation.
""Soleimani was iconic,"" tweeted Norman Roule, a former Central Intelligence Agency official on the Middle East. ""He managed militias & terrorists. Neither will go away w his death. He will be replaced by others albeit w less experience & stature.""
Iran has a variety of options to strike back. The 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq are part of an array of forces numbering 80,000 throughout the region at bases and at sea. U.S. officials said Friday that some 3,500 troops from the 82nd Airborne Division would be sent to Kuwait as early as this weekend.
The region's oil shipping and infrastructure remain a vulnerability and have been the targets of earlier skirmishes. Iranian forces could seed the Persian Gulf with mines and fire missiles at U.S. bases, oil fields and desalinization plants in the Arabian peninsula.
If it is looking to respond quickly, Iran could use the militia forces it backs in Iraq and elsewhere to mount rocket strikes and other attacks against American troops. Mounting cyberattacks against American businesses and institutions, experts say, is also an option.

Capital Journal: More Conflict Is Inevitable; War With Iran Isn't

The U.S. and Iran have battled for influence across the region for decades. During the Iraq war, Iran undermined the U.S. by arming Shiite militias that attacked U.S. troops. Iran still holds much sway over Iraq's politics, enjoying the allegiance of many political groups, including some now calling for a vote in parliament to expel U.S. forces.
During the Obama administration, Iran agreed with the U.S. and five world powers to curb its nuclear program. The Trump administration scrapped that accord in mid-2018, saying the pact wouldn't ultimately prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons and didn't cover its missile programs or its assertive regional posture. Washington turned to sanctions and other measures to cripple Iran's economy and cut off revenues from oil sales.
The rise of Islamic State gave Washington and Tehran a common enemy, especially after militants expanded control of territory and took the Iraqi city of Mosul in June 2014.
U.S. troops and Iraqi Shiite militias backed by Iran tolerated each other's presence on the battlefield in Iraq. Though the U.S. didn't coordinate with Iranian-backed militias, the two sides avoided clashes.
Once, Gen. Soleimani's aircraft was parked on the same Iraqi airfield as the one used by Tony Thomas, the general, now retired, who headed the Joint Special Operations Command and later the U.S. Special Operations Command.
Share Your Thoughts
Was killing the Iranian general a good decision?Join the conversation below.
That uneasy and unofficial truce enabled the U.S. to shrink its military footprint in the Middle East as outlined in the Pentagon's national defense strategy, published in 2018, which sought to redirect the U.S. military's focus mainly to deterring a resurgent Russia and a potentially more powerful China.
Under then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, the Pentagon reduced the number of military personnel in the Middle East, stopped the practice of constantly maintaining an aircraft carrier in the region and redeployed four Patriot antimissile batteries from Jordan, Kuwait and Bahrain.
During the first two years of the Trump administration, U.S. officials discussed the possibility of targeting Gen. Soleimani, a former senior U.S. official said. He was difficult to locate since he left Iran only for brief periods, said the former official, so a decision to target him was never close.
With tensions rising with Tehran, U.S. Central Command commander Marine Gen. Kenneth McKenzie Jr. has argued for the need to augment forces.
As the U.S. ratcheted up economic pressure against Iran, Tehran lashed out, attaching mines to ships and shooting down a U.S. drone in June. The U.S. blamed Iran for missile and drone strikes against an oil facility in Saudi Arabia owned by state-controlled Saudi Arabian Oil Co. in September.
Starting in May, Gen. McKenzie began assembling more forces, deploying the Patriots, a Thaad anti-ballistic missile defense system and ultimately restored the carrier's presence there.
Last month, the Pentagon began considering whether to send yet more forces—potentially as many as 14,000 additional troops, which could include sailors aboard ships.
The promise of additional forces doesn't guarantee that Iran won't retaliate, Pentagon officials conceded. ""They are going to respond. They have to,"" said a defense official.

President Trump's team has been weighing the prospects of a race against a populist outsider or a party stalwart. Michigan's Democratic primary may determine just what they get.
The Midwestern battleground, voting on Tuesday, is the first major general election battleground state to hold a primary. Tuesday is the first day Democrats cast a ballot since voters whittled the race down to two candidates a week before.
In 2016, President Trump became the first Republican to win Michigan since George H.W. Bush in 1988, eking out a victory over Hillary Clinton that was powered by strong support in white rural areas and benefited from the fact that Mrs. Clinton couldn't match former President Obama's turnout in majority-black districts.
In that year's Democratic nomination race, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders won the state, and he retains loyal support among young people and liberals. But former Vice President Joe Biden appears to have momentum after a strong Super Tuesday that showed him consolidating moderate support, and he has gathered key endorsements in the state.
Each Democrat argues he is best equipped to defeat Mr. Trump.Mr. Sanders says he can bring to the party new voters who support his message of radical political change, while Mr. Biden's allies stress his backing among centrist suburban voters will be critical in November. Recent general election polling of head-to-head matchups with Mr. Trump in Michigan show both Democrats ahead of the president.
For weeks, Mr. Trump and his associates had openly been agitating for Mr. Sanders, with the president seeking to stir up the Vermont senator's supporters by claiming without evidence the Democratic establishment had fixed the race for Mr. Biden. But the Trump team's focus turned to Mr. Biden again after his wins on Super Tuesday.
A key question is whether Mr. Biden can bring back to the Democratic fold voters in the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, which Mr. Trump swept in 2016 to take the White House, as well as compete in historic swing states like Florida.
""I'll tell you, I was all set for Bernie, because I thought it was going to happen,"" Mr. Trump said during a Fox News town hall Thursday. ""In a certain way Bernie would be tougher because he's got a base,"" he said, but added, ""I think it's going to be very hard for him to come back.""
Some Democratic voters in Detroit and its suburbs said they preferred a contest between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden, fearing Mr. Sanders's suite of policy proposals are too far to the left.
""I'm happy with Biden getting stronger. Bernie has a lot of good criticisms to make, but I still feel like in my heart Biden is our best choice,"" said Sara Frank, 69 years old, a retiree from West Bloomfield. ""He would have a broader reach.""
Aaron Parks, 24, who works in the health-insurance industry, backed Mr. Sanders in 2016 but this year said he is supporting Mr. Biden. He said when he knocked on doors for Mr. Sanders in Commerce Charter Township four years ago, he found resistance to his liberal policies.
""What I like most about [Mr. Biden] is he's going to resonate with people around here,"" he said.
But Megan Hakala, 31, who works at Wayne State University and lives in Garden City, said if Democrats chose Mr. Biden, Mr. Trump could beat him in Michigan.
""He just doesn't have the passion. I have not met anyone, personally, who is fired up about Biden the way people are fired up about Bernie,"" she said. ""I think that the passion has to be there for the Democratic candidate in order to beat Trump.""
Michigan, which offers 125 delegates to the Democratic convention awarded proportionately, could prove a critical moment in the primary race, either as the state in which Mr. Biden solidifies his march to the nomination or where a strong victory enables Mr. Sanders to remain competitive.
Mr. Sanders has said a loss in Michigan's primary won't force him out of the race, and he has made an aggressive push in Michigan in the final days before the primary, canceling events in other states to add extra stops there.
Mr. Biden was expected to appear later Monday with California Sen. Kamala Harris, who endorsed him Sunday, and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who announced his backing Monday. Meanwhile, Mr. Biden has sent surrogates including Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a former primary rival, and has key backers in the state, including Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Heading into Tuesday, Mr. Sanders has begun to criticize Mr. Biden's trade record more forcefully, hitting his support for trade deals like the North American Free Trade Agreement. His aides feel the criticism resonates with Michigan's large union population and would be a powerful general election argument. They argue Mr. Trump won Michigan and other Midwest states in part because he focused on the trade deals.
Mr. Biden is expected to focus on his record as vice president while trying to avoid a back-and-forth with Mr. Sanders.
He likely also will emphasize his role in the 2009 bailout of General Motors and Chrysler, as well as the Affordable Care Act, issues that he would likely continue to stress in a general election. His aides said his strong showing in suburban swing districts on Super Tuesday show he will be competitive in Michigan.
One Biden adviser said, ""Vice President Biden has actually been on two presidential tickets that won Michigan.""

New documents in the impeachment probe into President Trump show that his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked for a meeting with the Ukrainian president with Mr. Trump's ""knowledge and consent"" and that one of Mr. Giuliani's associates was sent text messages about tracking the U.S. ambassador's movements in the country.
House Democrats on Tuesday released the documents, aiming to incorporate them into the House record in time for the start of the
Senate's impeachment trial.

The documentation, some of which was kept confidential to protect personally sensitive information, includes text messages from Lev Parnas, an indicted associate of Mr. Giuliani. Among the material that Mr. Parnas provided to the House Intelligence Committee was a screenshot of a previously undisclosed May 10 letter from Mr. Giuliani to Ukraine's newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky. In the letter, Mr. Giuliani sought a meeting with Mr. Zelensky that would take ""no more than a half-hour of your time.""
Mr. Giuliani didn't say in the letter why he sought the meeting with Ukraine's president, but he had already said on Fox News that he
wanted information about Joe Biden
, his client's potential 2020 election rival, part of the effort that later in the year sparked the impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump.
Mr. Zelensky didn't end up taking the meeting, fearful of getting sucked into a U.S. political drama.

Mr. Parnas was arrested in October
on campaign-finance charges along with his associate, Igor Fruman, both of whom have pleaded not guilty to the charges. The two men for months assisted Mr. Giuliani in his push for investigations in Ukraine. In recent days, a lawyer for Mr. Parnas said he turned over to the Intelligence Committee a trove of messages from Mr. Parnas's cellphones. The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.
The communications also included messages that mentioned the then-ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, whom
Mr. Trump later fired
. In his July phone call with Ukraine's president, after she had been removed from her post, Mr. Trump
described her as ""bad news""
and said she would ""go through some things."" Ms. Yovanovitch later testified that she
felt threatened by the disparaging comments
from the president and was alarmed by the State Department's failure to defend her.
In the documents released Tuesday, a man named Robert F. Hyde, believed to be a congressional candidate in Connecticut, told Mr. Parnas in a March text message that he couldn't believe that Mr. Trump ""hasn't fired this bitch."" Mr. Hyde also texted messages about Ms. Yovanovitch's movements, sending texts such as ""they will let me know when she's on the move"" and adding that ""They are willing to help if we/you would like to pay a price"" and ""Guess you can do anything in Ukraine with the money."" Later, he said, ""if you want her out they need to make contact with security forces.""
Ms. Yovanovitch's lawyer, Lawrence Robbins, called for an investigation into whether the diplomat was being tracked.
""Needless to say, the notion that American citizens and others were monitoring Ambassador Yovanovitch's movements for unknown purposes is disturbing,"" Ms. Yovanovitch's lawyer said in a statement. ""We trust that the appropriate authorities will conduct an investigation to determine what happened.""
Mr. Hyde couldn't immediately be reached for comment. A spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm for House Republicans, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Democratic-led House last month voted to impeach Mr. Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The articles of impeachment accuse him of pressuring Ukraine to open investigations that would benefit him politically. Mr. Trump has said he did nothing wrong.
""These documents—and those recently released pursuant to Freedom of Information Act—demonstrate that there is more evidence relevant to the President's scheme, but they have been concealed by the President himself,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) and other Democratic chairmen of the committees that ran the impeachment probe wrote in a letter. ""All of this new evidence confirms what we already know: the President and his associates pressured Ukrainian officials to announce investigations that would benefit the President politically. There cannot be a full and fair trial in the Senate without the documents that President Trump is refusing to provide to Congress.""
The House is expected to vote Wednesday to transmit the obstruction-of-Congress and abuse-of-power impeachment articles to the Senate, which is expected to begin a trial next week after taking ceremonial steps such as swearing in senators as jurors.
Mr. Parnas also turned over notes that were handwritten on stationery from a Vienna hotel in which he wrote, ""get Zalensky to Annonce that the Biden case will Be Investigated,"" incorporating misspellings into his notes, the committees said. That refers to the probe Mr. Trump had asked Ukraine's leader to announce into an energy company that Mr. Biden's son Hunter Biden had been associated with. Both Bidens deny any wrongdoing.
Mr. Parnas took those notes following a phone conversation with Mr. Giuliani in June, weeks after Mr. Zelensky's inauguration, according to his lawyer, Joseph Bondy. The previous month, Mr. Parnas had met with Serhiy Shefir, a top adviser to Mr. Zelensky, in Kyiv.
The communications were made via encrypted messaging applications, particularly WhatsApp, the committees said, and included conversations that often took place in Russian with senior Ukrainian officials in 2019. The communications ""demonstrate that Mr. Parnas served as a direct channel between President Trump's agent, Mr. Giuliani, and individuals close to President Volodymyr Zelensky,"" the committees said.
Mr. Giuliani, asked about that conversation, said in a text message: ""I was pursuing evidence in my role as private counsel defending my client."" Asked whether he recalled the conversation in June, he said: ""By that time meeting with Zelensky was off the table but it would have been for same purpose."" He added of Mr. Parnas: ""I dispute anything his lawyer says.""

President Trump is emerging from the four-month impeachment process with little sign of damage to his political standing, even though a majority of voters believes he carried out the acts that House Democrats charge in their articles of impeachment, a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll finds.
Some 46% of voters in the survey said the Senate should remove Mr. Trump from office at the end of
the impeachment trial
, while 49% said he should serve out his term.
By an 11-point margin of 52% to 41%, voters said they believe Mr. Trump asked Ukraine to investigate a political opponent in order to influence the coming presidential election to his advantage. And by a 16-point margin of 53% to 37%, voters said Mr. Trump obstructed Congress by directing officials not to comply with subpoenas for testimony and otherwise not cooperating with the impeachment inquiry. Those two accusations form the basis of the impeachment charges.
Together, the findings suggest that impeachment hasn't changed one durable feature of Mr. Trump's presidency: In a turbulent political environment, Americans' views of him remain fixed.
The poll, in fact, found some signs that the president's political standing has strengthened in recent months, due largely to a more energized Republican Party base.
Mr. Trump's job approval in the January poll stood at 46%, with 51% disapproving, in line with results throughout the Trump presidency. But the share who ""strongly approve'' of his job performance hit its highest mark, at 36%. Approval among independents rose to its highest level since the summer.
A separate measure found that while half of the country holds a negative overall view of Mr. Trump, 43% of voters view him favorably—the largest share since his first month in office.
Moreover, Mr. Trump has gained ground in test match-ups against Democratic candidates, though he still trails his three leading potential rivals.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Have your feelings about either the Democratic or the Republican Party changed through President Trump's impeachment? How? Join the conversation below.
To Jeff Horwitt, a Democratic pollster who conducted the survey with Republican Bill McInturff, the results draw a picture of stability for Mr. Trump, even after an impeachment process that is expected to end this week with a Senate acquittal. ""America's attitudes about Donald Trump have hardly budged,'' he said.
Mr. McInturff said impeachment had energized Republican voters, to the president's benefit. ""This is Trump's strongest poll, I think, in three years,"" he said.
One reason impeachment has had little impact is that Americans view the proceedings with skepticism, pollsters said. When voters were asked to supply a phrase to describe the trial, one word surfaced prominently among members of both parties: sham.
Nearly 60% in the survey, conducted Jan. 26-29, said that Democrats in the House and Senate were acting on impeachment out of political considerations, while 37% said they were focused on upholding the Constitution. The results were similar for Republican lawmakers.
""That's an explanatory tool for how we can be going through 4½ months of this process and have Trump where he is,'' said Mr. McInturff.
Less than half in the survey—39% of all voters—said the Senate has enough information to make a decision on removing Mr. Trump from office. Some 37% said the Senate should collect more information, while the rest said they were unsure. On Friday, the Senate
voted against calling witnesses
and seeking more information in the impeachment trial.
Mr. Trump trails the three leading Democratic candidates in hypothetical election matchups, the survey found, though the gaps have narrowed from prior surveys and are within the poll's margin of error.
Vice President Joe Biden led Mr. Trump by 6 percentage points, 50% to 44%, compared with a 9-point margin in October. Sen. Elizabeth Warren led by 3 points, 48% to 45%, compared with an 8-point margin in October.
Sen. Bernie Sanders topped the president in a test match-up by 4 points, 49% to 45%, compared with a 7-point lead in July.
Matched against Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., Mr. Trump drew 45% to Mr. Buttigieg's 46%.
Mr. Trump inspires strong feelings on
both sides of the partisan divide
, a dynamic that becomes clear when voters are asked for a broad measure of comfort or discomfort with various candidates—whether each candidacy leaves them enthusiastic, comfortable, with reservations or makes them very uncomfortable.
Among all voters, 32% said they were enthusiastic about Mr. Trump's candidacy, a level of intensity unmatched by his potential opponents. No Democrat drew more than 14% of voters rating themselves as enthusiastic.
At the same time, 49% of voters said they were very uncomfortable with Mr. Trump's candidacy, compared with 43% for Mr. Sanders, 36% for Ms. Warren and 35% for Mr. Biden.
In one sign of the stability of the political environment amid impeachment, the poll found that 49% of voters want the next Congress to be controlled by Democrats, while 43% wanted a Republican-led Congress—a 6-point margin. Democrats have led on that question by 6 to 8 points since mid-2018.
In such a partisan environment, one point of focus in the coming year will be the subset of voters who remain persuadable. The survey provided one measure of that group when it asked voters to choose a candidate in the four test match-ups between Mr. Trump and potential Democratic rivals.
Some 41% picked Mr. Trump in all four matchups, and an equal 41% picked the Democrat in all four tests. That left a swing group of 18%, whose vote depended on which Democrat was named or were undecided.
The Journal/NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters from Jan. 26-29. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

Party and politics aren't all that distinguish the billionaire New Yorker in the White House from the one seeking to displace him.

President Trump's
Fifth Avenue apartment in Manhattan's Trump Tower feels ""like you're walking into a casino. Very lavish. A lot of gold,"" said John Catsimatidis, another billionaire New Yorker. He also has visited
Michael Bloomberg'
s New York City townhouse. ""You walk into Bloomberg's home on 79th Street, it's like Louis XIV's home,"" he said. ""Very conservative.""
Mr. Trump, 73 years old, and Mr. Bloomberg, 78, lived about 20 blocks apart on Manhattan's East Side and miles apart in sensibility, say dozens of people who know them. Mr. Trump was seen as a celebrity whose marriages and divorces splashed across newsstand tabloids. Mr. Bloomberg was the data-driven businessman who served three terms as New York's mayor.
""Mike's more intellectual, more of a refined billionaire,"" said Don Peebles, a real-estate developer. ""Donald's more of a blue-collar billionaire.""
Mr. Bloomberg was raised in a working-class family outside of Boston and made his fortune selling data to Wall Street traders. Once established, he circulated easily in Manhattan's philanthropic circles, boardrooms and elite clubs.
The president grew up in a wealthy New York real-estate family. He never fit among the city's old-money crowd, which viewed him more as a showman than a successful developer.
Share Your Thoughts
How do you expect Michael Bloomberg's campaign to fare on Super Tuesday? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Bloomberg appears on the ballot for the first time in the Democratic primary contest on Tuesday, when more than a dozen states hold contests. He has spent more than $600 million on his presidential campaign.
For years, the two billionaires coexisted peacefully in the city, trading pleasantries in public when it suited them. Some of their children became friends. Whatever ill feelings the two men harbored stayed private. Not anymore.
Mr. Catsimatidis said he spoke with Mr. Bloomberg last fall, before the former mayor launched his bid, and he recalled Mr. Bloomberg clearly felt he was more qualified to be president. ""He considers himself so much smarter than Trump and so much richer than Trump,"" he said. ""And Trump is sitting in his chair. Bloomberg hates him.""
The prospect of a November election showdown between Mr. Trump and Mr. Bloomberg might be hard to predict, but the two men are trading punches like crosstown rivals.
Mr. Bloomberg is ""a loser who has money but can't debate and has zero presence,"" Mr. Trump tweeted. He mocks the ex-mayor's height, calling him Mini Mike. Mr. Bloomberg tweeted that some of their mutual acquaintances in New York ""laugh at you & call you a carnival barking clown.""
The billionaires' bout ignited nearly four years ago, when Mr. Bloomberg took the stage at the Democratic National Convention. Mr. Trump, then the GOP presidential nominee, ""wants to run the nation like he's running his business. God help us,"" Mr. Bloomberg said. ""I'm a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one.""
Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said in a statement: ""Mike Bloomberg is not equipped to run this country, and President Trump has made his thoughts on that clear.""
Mr. Bloomberg declined a request to be interviewed for this article. His spokesman, Stu Loeser said, ""Running a golf course is about the only thing"" Mr. Bloomberg would hire Mr. Trump to do.
'The greatest'
Mr. Bloomberg, as mayor, and Mr. Trump, as a developer, occasionally crossed paths. They were never close, people familiar with their relationship said, yet they largely presented—at least publicly—a warm front.
Mr. Trump said in 2007 that Mr. Bloomberg would ""go down as one of the great mayors, if not the greatest"" in New York history. Mr. Bloomberg referred to Mr. Trump in 2011 as a ""New York icon."" Both called each other a friend.
Messrs. Trump and Bloomberg were photographed together on the golf course. Mr. Bloomberg twice appeared on ""The Apprentice,"" Mr. Trump's reality TV show. Mr. Trump was picked by the city to run a public golf course.
Given their personal differences, the cordiality rested on shaky ground. Mr. Bloomberg had little to gain from tangling with a high-profile TV personality. Likewise, Mr. Trump had little reason to antagonize the mayor, given the city's broad land-use authority.
When Mr. Bloomberg was elected in 2002, Mr. Trump's status as a New York real-estate developer was on the wane. After running into financial trouble in the 1990s, he would eventually shift to mostly licensing his name to developers around the globe. Yet he still had ambitions to develop in New York.
His dealings with the Bloomberg administration hit an early setback. City Hall officials rejected Mr. Trump's attempt to acquire 2 Columbus Circle, a property near Central Park in one of Manhattan's landmark intersections.
The city instead sold it to what is now called the Museum of Arts and Design. Dan Doctoroff, Mr. Bloomberg's deputy mayor for economic development, said he didn't hear from Mr. Trump again until the ""The Apprentice"" made its 2004 TV debut 18 months later.
""The next morning, I got a call from him out of the blue simply to tell me the ratings of 'The Apprentice,' which he then proceeded to do for the next three weeks in a row,"" Mr. Doctoroff said. ""In the development world that we were living in, that sort of post-9/11 period, we didn't have that much engagement with him.""
During Mr. Bloomberg's third term, Mr. Trump explored taking over Tavern on the Green, a restaurant in Central Park. He got a chilly response from City Hall. Then came Mr. Trump's shot at a golf course development in the Bronx.
Adrian Benepe, commissioner of the parks and recreation department for most of Mr. Bloomberg's tenure, said the city had promised decades earlier to turn the Ferry Point landfill into a public golf course.
City officials tried without success to find a developer willing to handle the conversion, which required extensive and costly environmental remediation.
The city ended up building the course with taxpayer money, Mr. Benepe said. He praised Mr. Trump's operation of the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point. But he was surprised to hear the Trump campaign in 2016 portray Mr. Trump's role as a single-handed rescue after years of municipal fumbling.
""It's a pants-on-fire lie,"" Mr. Benepe said. ""It was kind of a big telling moment that Trump would make up a completely fabricated story that was instantly and easily disprovable.""
A spokeswoman for the Trump Organization said, ""For over 30 years, before President Trump and the Trump Organization stepped in, Ferry Point was a stalled city project, in desperate need of rescue.""
On the town
R. Couri Hay, a publicist and New York society maven, said Mr. Bloomberg is a frequent guest at charity events and gala dinners in Manhattan and the Hamptons. ""Mayor Bloomberg likes to go out and about,"" Mr. Hay said. ""He's no stranger to putting on black tie, although often his is red.""
Mr. Trump ""famously doesn't go to a lot of parties,"" Mr. Hay said. ""He's more of a homebody.""
That wasn't always the case, said Jean Shafiroff, a Manhattan philanthropist. In the late 1980s, Mr. Trump and Ivana Trump, his wife at the time, ""were very big on the social scene and in philanthropy. They were at the New York City Ballet gala, pretty much everywhere.""
Mr. Bloomberg topped the Chronicle of Philanthropy's annual ranking of the top 50 biggest donors in the U.S. His charitable contributions totaled $3.3 billion in the past year. Mr. Trump hasn't made the list in its 20 years.
Mr. Bloomberg gets credit from many in New York's real-estate industry for helping rebuild lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Mr. Trump was more of an outsider, with few close friendships among real-estate developers. As mayor, Mr. Bloomberg would attend the Real Estate Board of New York's annual banquet. Mr. Trump was never a member of the powerful trade group, a spokesman said.
With no access to either man's unredacted tax records, evaluating wealth is an educated guess. Forbes estimated Mr. Trump's net worth at about $3 billion and Mr. Bloomberg's at around $60 billion.
Mr. Bloomberg, a lifelong Democrat, switched to the Republican Party before his first race for mayor in 2001. He left the GOP in 2007 as he flirted with a 2008 presidential bid. When asked on CNN about Mr. Bloomberg's prospects at the time, Mr. Trump said Mr. Bloomberg would be a formidable candidate because he could ""spend the money that it takes to get elected.""
Mr. Bloomberg decided not to run. He instead sought permission from the City Council to bust a law prohibiting him from serving more than two terms. Mr. Trump joined a chorus supporting Mr. Bloomberg's bid for a third term.
""I think in New York City real estate, developers are forced into a position where they try to be accommodative to the politicians,"" said Stephen Meister, an attorney who has represented Mr. Trump and known him since the 1980s.
Messrs. Trump and Bloomberg took opposite sides of a national debate in 2010, but the dispute contained none of the vitriol now being volleyed between them. That summer, Mr. Bloomberg stood on Governors Island, the Statue of Liberty behind him, to deliver a speech supporting a proposal to build a mosque and Islamic community center two blocks from where terrorists had toppled the World Trade Center.
Opposition grew, drawing in Mr. Trump. He offered to buy out one of the investors in the property on the condition no mosque be built within five blocks of ground zero. Mr. Trump said the proposed location wasn't appropriate.
Real-estate developer Sharif El-Gamal, one of the investors in the property, said he was surprised by Mr. Trump's offer.
""Even though he was polarizing against the project, what stood out for me is that he is a rational genius in a way,"" Mr. El-Gamal said. ""He is somebody that understands how to push buttons and is the greatest showman that I think we've ever seen.""
After Mr. Trump's offer was rebuffed, he appeared on CNN to criticize the proposal but not Mr. Bloomberg. ""He's a great mayor and he's a great friend of mine,"" Mr. Trump said in the TV interview. ""He feels very strongly about freedom of religion, and I understand that.""
In 2016, Mr. Bloomberg, who at that point had been unaffiliated with any political party for nearly a decade, briefly considered running for president as an independent. Mr. Bloomberg's younger daughter, Georgina Bloomberg, told W Magazine after her father decided against the idea that she was happy to have avoided campaign mudslinging with the Trumps.
""Donald Trump and his family have always been very close,"" she told the magazine. ""I'm good friends with his kids. I was not looking forward to having to watch our fathers go against each other.""
Ms. Bloomberg and Ivanka Trump, Mr. Trump's eldest daughter, both appeared in the 2003 documentary ""Born Rich.""
Mr. Bloomberg rejoined the Democratic Party in 2018, and he launched his bid for the Democratic nomination last fall.
In October, Georgina Bloomberg and Eric Trump's wife, Lara Trump, were co-chairwomen of the Rescue Dogs Rock NYC charity gala. They planned to headline a charity event for rescue dogs at Mar-a-Lago, the president's Florida resort, in March. The Palm Beach Post reported neither would attend because of scheduling conflicts.
After Mr. Bloomberg's first televised debate this month, largely panned, Mr. Trump lashed out at the former mayor.
""Mini Mike Bloomberg's debate performance tonight was perhaps the worst in the history of debates, and there have been some really bad ones. He was stumbling, bumbling and grossly incompetent,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. ""If this doesn't knock him out of the race, nothing will.""
Should Mr. Bloomberg face Mr. Trump in the general election, it will only get more heated, said New York public-relations executive Howard Rubenstein: ""There's some kind of war that will take place.""

WASHINGTON—President Trump's first visit to India next week will do more to highlight his personal diplomacy with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi than it will to address tensions over economic issues.
The leaders of the two nations likely will underscore the strength of their security relationship, according to senior U.S. officials. Bolstering those securities ties, at least in part, are shared concerns about terrorism, immigration and the rise of China as a superpower.
""The major area of convergence between the U.S. and India over the last few years has been on the diplomatic and security front,"" said Tanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What do you expect to come out of President Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting? Join the conversation below.
""It's been quite remarkable how much progress they have made, spurred in no small part by shared U.S. and Indian concerns about China's actions in the region,"" Ms. Madan said.
The visit comes amid
simmering disagreements over trade
, e-commerce restrictions and religious and minority protections. But senior U.S. officials say Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi will be more focused on celebrating their personal relationship.
""We are not treated very well by India,"" Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday, referring to issues concerning trade or e-commerce, ""but I happen to like Prime Minister Modi a lot.""
U.S. presidents often receive red-carpet treatment in India, from
President Obama's guest-of-honor status
at the historic Republic Day celebrations in 2015 to the renaming of a northern Indian village, Carterpuri, after the 38th American president visited there in 1978.
The trip by Mr. Trump, the fourth consecutive U.S. president to visit India, will be brief but colorful. With less than 36 hours between his arrival and departure, he will visit the Taj Mahal, meet with Indian businessmen who have invested in U.S. manufacturing operations and will take part in a state dinner in the presidential palace.
But Mr. Trump's most anticipated event is a rally at Sadar Patel Stadium, designed for cricket matches in Mr. Modi's home state of Gujarat, and with capacity of 110,000. The event is being billed as ""Namaste Trump.""
Mr. Trump has held some 100 campaign rallies since his 2016 election victory—just three in the past week alone—but his largest campaign rallies have topped off at about 20,000 people. At a rally at Colorado Springs, Colo., on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he anticipated millions of Indians would line the streets upon his arrival and joked that he may no longer appreciate his smaller crowds in the U.S.
""It's going to look like peanuts from now on,"" Mr. Trump joked. ""I'll never be satisfied again.""
The festivities will gloss over an escalating trade dispute between the world's two largest democracies that largely has been overshadowed by the market-rattling conflict between the U.S. and China. A proposed U.S. deal with India was shelved earlier this year, with Mr. Trump saying Thursday that such a pact wouldn't be made until after the U.S. election in November.
An administration official said Mr. Trump planned to discuss his concerns with Mr. Modi about
an Indian citizenship law that critics say discriminates against Muslims
. He also planned to privately encourage Mr. Modi to reduce tensions with Pakistan over disputes in Kashmir, and to seek support from India in the peace process in Afghanistan, the official said.
The two leaders make an odd couple. Mr. Trump is a real-estate tycoon and former reality-television star, while Mr. Modi is the son of a humble tea-stall owner. Both have risen on the nationalist wave and dethroned establishment powers in their conservative parties.
They have met eight times since Mr. Trump took office, including on the stage of
a rally in Houston
, attracting 50,000 people, that the U.S. president hosted on Mr. Modi's behalf.
President Trump is a popular figure in India. A recent Pew Research poll showed that 56% of people—higher than almost any nation in the world—have confidence that Mr. Trump will do the right thing in global affairs. The survey last month found that Mr. Trump is most popular in countries that hold the most favorable views of America.
Mr. Trump's popularity in India is one reason Mr. Modi can enthusiastically embrace the U.S. president. Mr. Modi was re-elected in a convincing victory last year but has been on the back foot amid complaints about the economy, which has slowed to a 10-year low under his watch.
Mr. Modi is expected to use his meeting with the leader of the world's most powerful country to project strength. Meanwhile, Mr. Modi's policies, which critics say marginalize India's Muslims and other minorities and undermine India's secular and democratic foundation, have in recent months triggered
the biggest protests since he took office
. The Modi administration denies its critics' charges.
Bringing the U.S. president to his home state will also be a symbolic victory lap for Mr. Modi, who was once denied entry into the U.S. amid accusations that he didn't do enough to protect its citizens when riots broke out when he was its chief minister in 2002, and more than 1,000 people were killed, mostly Muslims.
""This visit is a very special one,"" Mr. Modi said on Twitter earlier this month, ""and it will go a long way in further cementing India-USA friendship.""

WASHINGTON—House Democratic impeachment managers filed their first documents in the coming Senate trial, outlining how they plan to make the case for removing President Trump from office.

The Democrats' 111-page document, filed on Saturday
, outlines the case the seven impeachment managers plan to present to senators when the trial begins on Tuesday. In the filing, House Democrats tell senators, who serve as jurors in the trial, to follow the Constitution and ""rise above partisan differences"" as they hear the case.
""President Trump abused the power of his office to solicit foreign interference in our elections for his own personal political gain, thereby jeopardizing our national security, the integrity of our elections, and our democracy,"" the impeachment managers said in a statement.
The Democratic-led House approved
two articles of impeachment
against Mr. Trump last month. The first article of impeachment stems from Mr. Trump
pressing Ukraine to investigate
former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination,
including by withholding almost $400 million in aid
to help Kyiv combat Russian aggression. The second article accuses Mr. Trump of impeding Congress's investigation by preventing witnesses from testifying and defying subpoenas for documentary evidence.
The president denies the accusations and says the transcripts from calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky show he did nothing wrong.
The president's legal team, in a
response posted on Saturday
, called the House impeachment articles ""a brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election and interfere with the 2020 election"" and said the articles fail to allege any crime or violation.
Democrats counter that impeachment doesn't have to include a crime, and say abuse of power is an impeachable offense, according to an aide working on the inquiry.
Mr. Trump
finalized his legal team
for the Senate impeachment trial on Friday, choosing a group of attorneys with wide name recognition and TV experience, including constitutional-law professor Alan Dershowitz and former Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. The White House must formally respond to the House Democrats' brief by midday Monday.
House Democrats plan to allege the president interfered in the 2020 election by seeking investigations against his political rivals, and argue that senators are responsible for removing the resulting threat to national security.
""The Constitution provides a remedy when the President commits such serious abuses of his office: impeachment and removal,"" the Democrats wrote. ""The Senate must use that remedy now to safeguard the 2020 U.S. election, protect our constitutional form of government, and eliminate the threat that the President poses to America's national security.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How would you respond to the impeachment trial brief from the White House's perspective? Join the conversation below.
Most of the material that the Democrats plan to use to make their case is already known. The brief does show that Democrats plan to cite documents released after the House voted to impeach the president. The brief cites documents released by Lev Parnas, an associate of Rudy Giuliani, and the decision announced last Thursday by the Government Accountability Office that the Trump administration didn't have the legal authority to put on hold millions of dollars in security assistance to Ukraine last summer.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) hasn't outlined how the trial will be structured, though he has said it would be similar to the procedures adopted for former President Bill Clinton. Mr. McConnell would need a simple majority of the Senate to pass rules for the trial, and with 53 Republican senators, he doesn't need bipartisan support.
While some GOP senators have said they would be open to hearing new witnesses, Senate Republicans are in agreement to delay a vote on witnesses until after the trial begins, according to people familiar with the plans. The White House doesn't believe there is a need to hear witness testimony in the Senate trial, a senior administration official said.
Democrats are seeking to introduce new witnesses and documents to make their case.
Democrats want to hear
from former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who were directed by the White House not to testify before the House inquiry.

COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa—Hours before President Trump was to address a large crowd in Iowa's capital, Vice President Mike Pence opted for a traditional political pit stop that his boss rarely makes: He met with voters at a fast-food joint.
In between events Thursday, Mr. Pence stopped by a Culver's—a Midwestern staple known for its ""ButterBurgers"" and frozen custard. ""Trust me, I won't leave here without a burger,"" he assured a table of middle-aged men.
He also greeted a pastor, a pleasantly surprised mother with her little girl and a woman wearing a red shirt that said ""Capitalism"" in the style of the Coca-Cola logo who said she wanted to stand on the road with a pro-Trump sign. Mr. Pence got his burger—a Culver's deluxe with bacon, no fries—and was unfazed when the cashier mistakenly referred to him as ""Biden.""
With
Mr. Trump's impeachment trial
under way, both the president and vice president had Iowa plans Thursday as they seek to redirect attention to the 2020 race and energize the state's Republicans days before the Feb. 3 caucuses. While Mr. Trump was free to hit the campaign trail, four senators seeking to unseat him were stuck in Washington, serving as jurors weighing the charges against him.
The joint visits reflect their campaign's effort to boost turnout and test its organizational muscle in an important general-election state. They also illustrated the different roles the duo will play on the campaign trail, with Mr. Trump sticking to his signature mega-rallies and Mr. Pence checking in on smaller interest groups.
Mr. Pence crisscrossed Iowa on Thursday in a blue bus stamped with the campaign logo and a picture of the vice president flashing a wide grin beside Mr. Trump. During a speech before evangelical Christian voters in Sioux City, the vice president sought to keep the focus on his boss, declaring: ""I just spoke to him on the bus, told him I was in Sioux City, Iowa, and I think he sounded just a little bit jealous.""
Connie Schmett, co-chair of the Republican Party of Polk County, Iowa, said Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence were a good pair because of their different styles.
""With President Trump, we have so many people that are so excited about this man because he is not the normal politician,"" she said. ""Vice President Pence is a little more mainstream. He's soft-spoken. He's a kind man. I think they complement each other.""
During his previous campaign, Mr. Trump largely eschewed the intimate campaigning that Iowa caucus voters expect. He placed second in the Republican contest to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who invested in traditional Iowa politicking, but won the state in the 2016 general election, exceeding Democrat Hillary Clinton's margin by nearly 10 percentage points.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What approach to campaigning do you prefer to see from presidential candidates? Why? Join the conversation below.
Throughout his campaign stops, Mr. Pence hammered talking points that Trump aides believe will resonate with Iowa Republicans: He dismissed the Democratic candidates as radical socialists, emphasized the administration's efforts to restrict abortion access and to protect gun rights and highlighted the condition of the U.S. economy.
Mr. Pence also criticized impeachment proceedings seeking to remove Mr. Trump from office, on
charges of abuse of power
and
obstruction of Congress
, as a ""shameful attempt to overthrow the will of the American people.""
The president and vice president are campaigning for re-election in a way that seeks to leverage both traditional stumping and the appeal of Mr. Trump's rallies. Mr. Pence was meeting with evangelical voters and veterans Thursday, both important coalitions for their campaign.
White House officials said Mr. Pence's events are meant to counterbalance the president's rallies with a more targeted approach—a formula the vice president has repeated in other states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida.
""It's a chance for him to gauge the reaction in a community,"" said Marc Short, the vice president's chief of staff, of Mr. Pence's frequent stops at diners and local restaurants. The White House works with the president's re-election campaign to help determine which parts of key states to visit, aides said.
Mr. Pence's appearance in Iowa four days before the caucuses is sure to revive questions about his own political ambitions. The vice president is widely believed to be interested in running for president himself someday. But Mr. Pence's aides bristled at the suggestion that his visit had the secondary benefit of building groundwork for an eventual campaign of his own.
Bob Vander Plaats, chief executive of the Family Leader, an Iowa organization of religious conservatives, said the vice president's meeting with evangelical voters shows that ""they're not going to take Iowa for granted and they're not going to take people of faith for granted.""
Mr. Trump's victory in Iowa in 2016 came after Barack Obama won the state in 2008 and 2012. Recent polls of Iowa show Mr. Trump in a close contest in hypothetical matchups against the leading Democratic candidates.
With no serious Republican challenger, the president is expected to win his party's caucuses easily, though GOP attendance is likely to be very light. Still, more than 80 campaign surrogates are scheduled to flood the state for the Feb. 3 voting, including cabinet officials, members of Congress and top campaign aides.
""We want to absolutely show how powerful of an organization we have, the kind of leaders we have, how serious Iowa is to us,"" said Eric Branstad, a campaign adviser in Iowa.

New documents in the impeachment probe into President Trump show that his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, asked for a meeting with the Ukrainian president with Mr. Trump's ""knowledge and consent"" and that one of Mr. Giuliani's associates was sent text messages about tracking the U.S. ambassador's movements in the country.
House Democrats on Tuesday released the documents, aiming to incorporate them into the House record in time for the start of the
Senate's impeachment trial.

The documentation, some of which was kept confidential to protect personally sensitive information, includes text messages from Lev Parnas, an indicted associate of Mr. Giuliani. Among the material that Mr. Parnas provided to the House Intelligence Committee was a screenshot of a previously undisclosed May 10 letter from Mr. Giuliani to Ukraine's newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky. In the letter, Mr. Giuliani sought a meeting with Mr. Zelensky that would take ""no more than a half-hour of your time.""
Mr. Giuliani didn't say in the letter why he sought the meeting with Ukraine's president, but he had already said on Fox News that he
wanted information about Joe Biden
, his client's potential 2020 election rival, part of the effort that later in the year sparked the impeachment inquiry of Mr. Trump.
Mr. Zelensky didn't end up taking the meeting, fearful of getting sucked into a U.S. political drama.

Mr. Parnas was arrested in October
on campaign-finance charges along with his associate, Igor Fruman, both of whom have pleaded not guilty to the charges. The two men for months assisted Mr. Giuliani in his push for investigations in Ukraine. In recent days, a lawyer for Mr. Parnas said he turned over to the Intelligence Committee a trove of messages from Mr. Parnas's cellphones. The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.

The communications also included messages that mentioned the then-ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, whom
Mr. Trump later fired
. In his July phone call with Ukraine's president, after she had been removed from her post, Mr. Trump
described her as ""bad news""
and said she would ""go through some things."" Ms. Yovanovitch later testified that she
felt threatened by the disparaging comments
from the president and was alarmed by the State Department's failure to defend her.
In the documents released Tuesday, Robert F. Hyde, a congressional candidate in Connecticut, told Mr. Parnas in a March text message that he couldn't believe that Mr. Trump ""hasn't fired this bitch."" Mr. Hyde also texted messages about Ms. Yovanovitch's movements, sending texts such as ""they will let me know when she's on the move"" and adding that ""They are willing to help if we/you would like to pay a price"" and ""Guess you can do anything in Ukraine with the money."" Later, he said, ""if you want her out they need to make contact with security forces.""
Ms. Yovanovitch's lawyer, Lawrence Robbins, called for an investigation into whether the diplomat was being tracked.
""Needless to say, the notion that American citizens and others were monitoring Ambassador Yovanovitch's movements for unknown purposes is disturbing,"" Ms. Yovanovitch's lawyer said in a statement. ""We trust that the appropriate authorities will conduct an investigation to determine what happened.""
Mr. Hyde, in a series of tweets Tuesday, said he welcomed an investigation. He said he was never in Kyiv, and called it ""definitely laughable"" that Democrats were using ""some texts my buddy's and I wrote back to some dweeb we were playing with that we met a few times while we had a few drinks.""
The texts show Mr. Parnas also communicated with numerous Ukrainian officials, including Yuri Lutsenko, months before Ukraine's new regime ousted him as prosecutor general. Mr. Lutsenko, who was widely viewed as corrupt by Western diplomats, complained about Ms. Yovanovitch, the texts show, while also offering Mr. Parnas information about the Bidens.
The Democratic-led House last month voted to impeach Mr. Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The articles of impeachment accuse him of pressuring Ukraine to open investigations that would benefit him politically. Mr. Trump has said he did nothing wrong.
""These documents—and those recently released pursuant to Freedom of Information Act—demonstrate that there is more evidence relevant to the President's scheme, but they have been concealed by the President himself,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) and other Democratic chairmen of the committees that ran the impeachment probe wrote in a letter. ""All of this new evidence confirms what we already know: the President and his associates pressured Ukrainian officials to announce investigations that would benefit the President politically. There cannot be a full and fair trial in the Senate without the documents that President Trump is refusing to provide to Congress.""
The House is
expected to vote Wednesday
to transmit the obstruction-of-Congress and abuse-of-power impeachment articles to the Senate, which is expected to begin a trial next week after taking ceremonial steps such as swearing in senators as jurors.
Mr. Parnas also turned over notes that were handwritten on stationery from a Vienna hotel in which he wrote, ""get Zalensky to Annonce that the Biden case will Be Investigated,"" incorporating misspellings into his notes, the committees said. That refers to the probe Mr. Trump had asked Ukraine's leader to announce into an energy company that Mr. Biden's son Hunter Biden had been associated with. Both Bidens deny any wrongdoing.
Mr. Parnas took those notes following a phone conversation with Mr. Giuliani in June, weeks after Mr. Zelensky's inauguration, according to his lawyer, Joseph Bondy. The previous month, Mr. Parnas had met with Serhiy Shefir, a top adviser to Mr. Zelensky, in Kyiv.
The communications were made via encrypted messaging applications, particularly WhatsApp, the committees said, and included conversations that often took place in Russian with senior Ukrainian officials in 2019. The communications ""demonstrate that Mr. Parnas served as a direct channel between President Trump's agent, Mr. Giuliani, and individuals close to President Volodymyr Zelensky,"" the committees said.
Mr. Giuliani, asked about that conversation, said in a text message: ""I was pursuing evidence in my role as private counsel defending my client."" Asked whether he recalled the conversation in June, he said: ""By that time meeting with Zelensky was off the table but it would have been for same purpose."" He added of Mr. Parnas: ""I dispute anything his lawyer says.""

TEL AVIV—Benny Gantz, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's rival in a coming election, said Saturday he has accepted an invitation from President Trump to go to Washington to discuss the administration's plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
President Trump has said he would release the plan before Tuesday, after it has been delayed several times since 2018.
The White House had originally announced that Messrs. Gantz and Netanyahu would meet Mr. Trump on Tuesday, but Mr. Gantz had second thoughts about accepting the invitation after concerns it could be seen as a boost to Mr. Netanyahu, whom he is running against after two inconclusive elections.
Mr. Gantz said Saturday he would travel to Washington next week to meet separately with Mr. Trump, a decision that reflects a careful effort to cultivate constructive ties with the U.S. president while avoiding a shared stage with Mr. Netanyahu.
Mr. Gantz would then return to Israel in time for the country's parliament to debate forming the committee that would hear Mr. Netanyahu's request for immunity from bribery and fraud charges. The charges stem from allegations that he traded official favors for flattering news coverage, as well as gifts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, including pink champagne, cigars and jewelry. Mr. Netanyahu denies wrongdoing and has vowed to fight the charges.
""These are fateful times, for both Israel's borders and character, as well as its democratic fabric,"" Mr. Gantz told reporters Saturday, adding that he would meet Mr. Trump as head of Israel's largest party.
Mr. Gantz's Blue and White party, whose popularity stems largely from its message that Mr. Netanyahu has been in power too long, has pushed to complete the immunity proceedings before the March elections. In the parliament's current makeup, Blue and White has majority support to reject Mr. Netanyahu's request.
Mr. Netanyahu's Likud party is trying to delay the immunity process, which includes standing up the committee to hear his request, until after the March 3 vote. The Israeli leader hopes a new election will change the makeup of the body to give more favorable consideration to his request.
The meeting on the peace plan with President Trump won't include any Palestinian leaders, who cut ties with the Trump administration in 2017 after the U.S. recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
President Trump said he had spoken to Palestinian officials about the effort, though the White House declined to provide details of those conversations. Palestinian officials denied speaking to Mr. Trump about the plan, and said they would reject any plan that doesn't include East Jerusalem as the capital of an independent Palestinian state and which is based on borders before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
Israel's parliament will vote Tuesday to form the committee that is expected to deny Mr. Netanyahu's request for immunity from bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges. Tuesday is also the final day for President Trump's defense team to make its arguments in the Senate impeachment trial.
Avigdor Liberman, the head of a secular right-wing party who has played a king-maker role in the past two elections, called the timing of the Washington rollout ""very suspicious.""
More than six months after releasing its economic plan for the area, U.S. officials have kept the political portion of the document under wraps. More than 50 pages long, the political part of the plan envisions that no Israelis or Palestinians in the West Bank will leave their homes and it would move Israel's border east of the internationally accepted Green Line with the West Bank, U.S. officials have said.

WASHINGTON—The national debt and sustained federal
budget deficits
will hit the highest levels since World War II over the next decade,
the Congressional Budget Office projected
on Tuesday, following multiple rounds of tax cuts and continued increases in federal spending.
The government will spend $1 trillion more than it collects in 2020 and deficits will reach or exceed that threshold every year for the foreseeable future. As a share of gross domestic product, the deficit will be at least 4.3% every year through 2030. That would be the longest stretch of budget deficits exceeding 4% of GDP over the past century, according to the CBO, an nonpartisan arm of Congress.
Debt held by the public is projected to be 81% of GDP this year and to reach 98% by 2030. That stems from the combination of
tax cuts
and projected increases in spending—particularly on safety-net programs such as Medicare and Social Security as the population ages and health-care costs rise.
Budget deficits were larger after the 2008-09 financial crisis, but what makes the current period unusual is that the gap between taxes and spending has remained high even as the economy extends a record-long expansion.
Persistently low interest rates have provided a fiscal cushion for the U.S. and kept deficits from growing even faster.
""Not since World War II has the country seen deficits during times of low unemployment that are as large as those that we project,"" said CBO Director Phillip Swagel, who warned that the budget is on an unsustainable path.
Tuesday's deficit forecasts may end up being too low. The CBO's projections assume there are no changes to current spending and tax law. Deficits and debt would be larger if Congress extends individual tax cuts beyond their scheduled expiration at the end of 2025.
Congressional Republicans want to extend those tax cuts, and President Trump is preparing to propose further cuts as part of his re-election campaign.
Democratic presidential candidates, by contrast, are calling
for tax increases
to pay for expanded spending, and they generally say they want to avoid expanding projected deficits.
Longer-time-span deficit forecasts are even more daunting as the population ages. The federal debt is projected to hit a record 174% of GDP by 2049, 30 percentage points higher than what the CBO forecast last year.
""There's not a crisis today,"" Mr. Swagel said. ""The longer we wait, the more difficult it gets.""
During his 2016 campaign, President Trump talked about paying off the federal debt within eight years. Reality and the policies he enacted have moved in the opposite direction.
In 2017, Congress enacted tax cuts championed by the president, which are projected to increase budget deficits by more than $1 trillion over a decade. Administration officials, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, have argued that the tax cuts will pay for themselves.
But nonpartisan estimates have contested that claim, and the CBO said in 2018 that the law would pay for less than one-quarter of itself. Mr. Swagel said Tuesday that the CBO stands by that analysis.
""President Trump's economic policies did not create a sustained boost for the economy like he has claimed,"" said Rep. John Yarmuth (D., Ky.), chairman of the House Budget Committee.
The CBO projected economic growth will gradually slow from 2.2% in 2020 to 1.7% after 2021, and unemployment will start to rise in 2022 while remaining below historical averages. The jobless rate was 3.5% in December, sustaining a 50-year low.
In the current expansion, annual economic growth averaged 2.3% through 2018, the latest year for which full-year data is available.
That compares with 2.9% during the previous expansion from late 2001 to 2007, and 3.6% in the 10-year expansion that ended in early 2001, according to the Commerce Department.
The CBO said it had lowered its projected revenue from the 2017 law by $110 billion to account for Treasury regulations that eased some international tax provisions and to reflect how businesses have changed their operations in response to the law.
In 2020, the U.S. will spend $1.28 for every $1 that it collects in revenue.
""I hope that more eyes will be opened to the stark reality we face,"" said Rep. Steve Womack (R., Ark.), the top Republican on the House Budget Committee. ""It is imperative that we put our country on a responsible fiscal path.""
For years, lawmakers and budget experts warned that budget deficits were unsustainable because federal borrowing could crowd out private borrowing, leading to interest-rate increases. But that hasn't happened, and interest rates have remained persistently low.
Those low rates have limited the government's cost of borrowing. Since the CBO's last budget forecast in August 2019, projected interest costs have declined by $441 billion over a decade, reflecting rates that are 0.3 percentage point below the previous estimate. But loss of revenue from tax cuts enacted in December 2019 exceeded those savings, and the CBO now projects budget deficits to be 1.3% larger than it did in August.

WASHINGTON -- The Senate opened the impeachment trial of President Trump on Thursday with Chief Justice John Roberts swearing in the senators, who pledged to deliver impartial justice, and the formal reading of the two charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
Hours before the senators took their oath, the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency, determined that Mr. Trump's administration violated the law when it withheld aid to Ukraine, an issue at the heart of the impeachment case against the president.
Democrats allege that Mr. Trump, a Republican, improperly withheld the aid to pressure Kyiv to launch investigations that would help him politically in the 2020 election.
Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing, calling the case against him a ""big hoax"" on Thursday. He is the third president in U.S. history to be impeached.
The GAO wrote that the White House Office of Management and Budget improperly froze Ukraine funding over the summer for policy reasons. It was later released after pressure from Congress. A spokeswoman for OMB said it disagreed with the GAO finding.
Meanwhile, Ukrainian authorities opened a criminal probe into whether U.S. citizens placed the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine under surveillance, as text messages suggest, before she was removed from her post last year by Mr. Trump. The information came to light after House Democrats released documents Tuesday showing that an associate of Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was sent text messages about tracking Marie Yovanovitch in Ukraine.
Democratic and GOP lawmakers continued to wrangle on Thursday over whether new witnesses and evidence will be allowed in the trial. Those issues aren't expected to be decided until well after the trial begins in earnest on Tuesday.
""If any of my colleagues had doubts about the case for witnesses and documents in a Senate trial, the stunning revelations this week should put those to rest,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the chamber's Democratic leader.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said it wasn't the Senate's job to shore up the case the House built in what he called a ""slapdash inquiry."" The Senate won't ""redo their homework and rerun the investigation,"" he said.
Mr. McConnell is set to release his plans for a trial framework on Tuesday, but Senate Republicans and White House officials said the contents of the resolution have largely been settled. Republicans briefed on the resolution have said they expect it to include a guaranteed vote on whether to subpoena witnesses and documents, as requested by some moderate Republicans.
GOP leaders believe they can keep Republicans united to block any efforts by Democrats to subpoena witnesses at the outset of the trial, according to people familiar with their plans. A vote on witnesses would be held later, after the House managers and Mr. Trump's legal team present their cases, a process expected to stretch over two weeks.
A guaranteed vote to dismiss the charges won't be built into the trial rules, according to these people. The White House and Senate Republicans are discussing holding a vote on a motion to dismiss after Democrats present their case but before Mr. Trump's team addresses the Senate, according to an administration official.
At least two-thirds of the senators would have to vote to convict Mr. Trump to remove him from office.
By noon on Thursday, the fighting over the scope of the Senate trial took a pause. Every senator was seated at his or her desk, a rare sight during ordinary business.
At 12:05 p.m., House managers, who will act as prosecutors during the trial, arrived at the ornate doors of the Senate. They walked in two-by-two, led by Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.).
All managers carried large blue folders containing their own copy of the articles of impeachment passed by the House last month and the resolution passed on Wednesday authorizing them as managers.
Silence fell and phones disappeared as the sergeant at arms warned senators to keep quiet ""on pain of imprisonment."" Then Mr. Schiff, the lead manager, began reading the articles aloud in the well of the Senate.
""Resolved, that Donald John Trump, president of the United States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors,"" he said.
The first article of impeachment stems from Mr. Trump pressing Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, including by withholding the almost $400 million in aid to help Kyiv combat Russian aggression. The second article accuses Mr. Trump of impeding Congress's investigation by preventing witnesses from testifying and defying subpoenas for documentary evidence.
The senators watched, with stony faces, as Mr. Schiff spoke. Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) stifled a cough. Next to her, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) sat motionless with her hands folded in her lap. Sens. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), Tammy Baldwin (D., Wis.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.) scribbled notes.
At 12:22, when Mr. Schiff had finished, the managers departed. They briefly huddled outside the chamber, once again got in order, and marched back toward the House side of the Capitol.
Shortly after 2 p.m., Chief Justice Roberts was escorted into the Senate by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), Roy Blunt (R., Mo.), Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.) and Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.).
Everyone in the chamber rose. Then Chief Justice Roberts spoke: ""Senators, I attend the Senate in conformity with your notice for the purpose of joining with you for the trial of the President of the United States. I am now prepared to take the oath.""
Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), the Senate's president pro tempore, asked him to raise his right hand, place his left hand on the Bible, and swore him in.
Chief Justice Roberts then administered an oath to senators, who will act as the jury. ""Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, president of United States, now pending, you will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws, so help you God?""
""I do,"" the senators said.
Senators were then called in alphabetical order to the Senate clerk's desk to sign their names in an oath book. As the lawmakers waited to sign, there were flashes of bipartisan bonhomie. Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) warmly shook Mr. Grassley's hand. Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) patted the shoulder of Sen. Ben Sasse (R., Neb.), and the two shared a laugh with Sen. Tim Scott (R., S.C.).
After the swearing-in, the Senate formally notified the White House of the pending trial and summoned Mr. Trump, who will be given until Saturday evening to reply.
Mr. McConnell also said the House has until Saturday at 5 p.m. to file a trial brief with the secretary of the Senate, and Mr. Trump has until noon on Monday to do so. The deadline for the House's rebuttal is noon on Tuesday. The Senate trial was then adjourned until Tuesday at 1 p.m.

WASHINGTON—With his anticipated acquittal in his impeachment trial a day away, President Trump used his annual State of the Union address Tuesday to paint an optimistic picture of the country's future and tout the strong economy nine months before Election Day.
""In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline and we have rejected the downsizing of America's destiny. We have totally rejected the downsizing,"" Mr. Trump said in the House chamber. ""We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never going back.""
Mr. Trump entered the chamber just after 9 p.m. to sustained applause, pausing for a moment to speak with Chief Justice John Roberts, who has been presiding over the impeachment trial.
From there, Washington's deep partisanship was on full display. The president handed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) a copy of his remarks, but turned away without shaking her hand as she extended it. Mr. Trump and Mrs. Pelosi haven't spoken in months; tension over impeachment has frayed their relationship. Moments later, Republicans began chanting, ""Four more years!""
During the speech, Republicans repeatedly jumped to their feet and cheered, and Democrats sat stone-faced, standing rarely. A few Democrats walked out of the State of the Union speech early. At the end of the address, Mrs. Pelosi tore her copy of the president's speech in half.
Asked by reporters why she ripped up the speech, Mrs. Pelosi said, ""Because it was a manifesto of mistruths.""
In a one-hour, 18-minute address punctuated by made-for-TV moments, from Mr. Trump presenting a school-age girl with a scholarship to a surprise appearance by a service member returning from his overseas deployment, the president's remarks focused squarely on the economy.
He ticked through a litany of statistics designed to drive home his core message that he is the lead architect of America's economic boom. ""If we hadn't reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would now not be witnessing this great economic success,"" he said.
In the speech, Mr. Trump focused on election themes, such as his plans for health care, the impact of economic growth on the middle class and the wall along the southern border.
With acquittal in the Senate on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress charges expected Wednesday afternoon, the speech comes at a moment when the president is feeling triumphant, according to people close to him. He spent part of the day Tuesday reveling in the
chaos in Iowa
over counting the results of the Democratic caucuses.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How would you grade the state of our union? Why? Join the conversation below.
The impeachment trial doesn't appear to have moved the president's approval ratings. Mr. Trump's job approval in the
most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll
late last month stood at 46%, with 51% disapproving, in line with results throughout his presidency.
Mr. Trump avoided commenting on impeachment, even as he spoke in front of the Democrats who sought to remove him from office.
The president told television anchors during an off-the-record lunch at the White House Tuesday afternoon that he planned to address impeachment in more detail later this week, according to people familiar with the matter. After Bill Clinton in 1999, he was the second president to deliver a State of the Union address during his impeachment trial.
House and Senate lawmakers, as well as Supreme Court justices and the president's cabinet attended the address. The top Democratic candidates—including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts—weren't in the audience. Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren were in New Hampshire for campaign events Tuesday. Several House Democrats boycotted the speech.
The theme of the speech, ""The Great American Comeback,"" echoed the tone of Mr. Trump's
recent remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland
. Voters consistently list the economy as a top issue, and the president's advisers view it as central to Mr. Trump's re-election chances.
As he did in his remarks in Davos, Mr. Trump touted what he calls a ""blue-collar boom,"" part of an effort to highlight how his policies are helping the middle class. The president also trumpeted the economic effects of a pair of recent trade agreements:
newly approved U.S.-Mexico-Canada deal
and a
""phase one"" deal with China
.
""Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace Nafta—only to do absolutely nothing. But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises,"" he said.
He emphasized his administration's efforts to help working families, including his support of paid family leave and affordable child care. Lowering the cost of health care, as well as the cost of prescription drugs, were also major themes of the speech.

The issue of health care presented Mr. Trump with an opening to criticize his Democratic opponents. The president echoed comments he made in his 2019 address
criticizing efforts ""to adopt socialism in our country.""

""To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American health care,"" Mr. Trump said.
When Trump said there are those who want to take away people's doctors and abolish private insurance, Democrats shouted, ""Who? Who?""
Drew Hammill, the deputy chief of staff to Mrs. Pelosi, said Mr. Trump hasn't lived up to his promises to make health care affordable and lower prescription drug prices.
""He has broken both of those promises with his ongoing crusade to repeal protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions, putting a pharmaceutical executive in charge of drug prices, and siding with Big Pharma against the House's game-changing Lower Drug Prices Now Act,"" he said.
The president called on Congress to approve legislation implementing his vision on health care, school choice and other issues. Bitterly divided and with the election later this year, Congress is unlikely to pass major legislation before November.
Mr. Trump also highlighted immigration, an issue that animates his supporters. In addition to giving an update on his efforts to build a wall along the southern border, the president took aim at sanctuary cities.
On foreign policy, Mr. Trump vowed to oust Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. The administration has been
seeking his removal for more than a year
without success.
""Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people. But Maduro's grip of tyranny will be smashed and broken,"" the president said, pointing to Venezuela opposition leader Juan Guaidó, who attended the address.
Mr. Trump praised conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh, who attended the speech and revealed on Monday he is being
treated for advanced lung cancer
. First lady Melania Trump presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the gallery during the speech.
The Democratic governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, gave the Democratic response to the speech and U.S. Rep. Veronica Escobar (D., Texas) delivered a Democratic response in Spanish. Ms. Whitmer said that people were being left behind in Mr. Trump's economy.
""It doesn't matter what the president says about the stock market,"" she said. ""What matters is that millions of people struggle to get by or don't have enough money at the end of the month after paying for transportation, student loans, or prescription drugs.""

WASHINGTON—President Trump's first visit to India next week will do more to highlight his personal diplomacy with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi than it will to address tensions over economic issues.
The leaders of the two nations likely will underscore the strength of their security relationship, according to senior U.S. officials. Bolstering those securities ties, at least in part, are shared concerns about terrorism, immigration and the rise of China as a superpower.
""The major area of convergence between the U.S. and India over the last few years has been on the diplomatic and security front,"" said Tanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What do you expect to come out of President Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's meeting? Join the conversation below.
""It's been quite remarkable how much progress they have made, spurred in no small part by shared U.S. and Indian concerns about China's actions in the region,"" Ms. Madan said.
The visit comes amid
simmering disagreements over trade
, e-commerce restrictions and religious and minority protections. But senior U.S. officials say Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi will be more focused on celebrating their personal relationship.
""We are not treated very well by India,"" Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday, referring to issues concerning trade or e-commerce, ""but I happen to like Prime Minister Modi a lot.""
U.S. presidents often receive red-carpet treatment in India, from
President Obama's guest-of-honor status
at the historic Republic Day celebrations in 2015 to the renaming of a northern Indian village, Carterpuri, after the 38th American president visited there in 1978.
The trip by Mr. Trump, the fourth consecutive U.S. president to visit India, will be brief but colorful. With less than 36 hours between his arrival and departure, he will visit the Taj Mahal, meet with Indian businessmen who have invested in U.S. manufacturing operations and will take part in a state dinner in the presidential palace.
But Mr. Trump's most anticipated event is a rally at Sardar Patel Stadium, designed for cricket matches in Mr. Modi's home state of Gujarat, and with capacity of 110,000. The event is being billed as ""Namaste Trump.""
Mr. Trump has held some 100 campaign rallies since his 2016 election victory—just three in the past week alone—but his largest campaign rallies have topped off at about 20,000 people. At a rally at Colorado Springs, Colo., on Thursday, Mr. Trump said he anticipated millions of Indians would line the streets upon his arrival and joked that he may no longer appreciate his smaller crowds in the U.S.
""It's going to look like peanuts from now on,"" Mr. Trump joked. ""I'll never be satisfied again.""
The festivities will gloss over an escalating trade dispute between the world's two largest democracies that largely has been overshadowed by the market-rattling conflict between the U.S. and China. A proposed U.S. deal with India was shelved earlier this year, with Mr. Trump saying Thursday that such a pact wouldn't be made until after the U.S. election in November.
An administration official said Mr. Trump planned to discuss his concerns with Mr. Modi about
an Indian citizenship law that critics say discriminates against Muslims
. He also planned to privately encourage Mr. Modi to reduce tensions with Pakistan over disputes in Kashmir, and to seek support from India in the peace process in Afghanistan, the official said.
The two leaders make an odd couple. Mr. Trump is a real-estate tycoon and former reality-television star, while Mr. Modi is the son of a humble tea-stall owner. Both have risen on the nationalist wave and dethroned establishment powers in their conservative parties.
They have met eight times since Mr. Trump took office, including on the stage of
a rally in Houston
, attracting 50,000 people, that the U.S. president hosted on Mr. Modi's behalf.
President Trump is a popular figure in India. A recent Pew Research poll showed that 56% of people—higher than almost any nation in the world—have confidence that Mr. Trump will do the right thing in global affairs. The survey last month found that Mr. Trump is most popular in countries that hold the most favorable views of America.
Mr. Trump's popularity in India is one reason Mr. Modi can enthusiastically embrace the U.S. president. Mr. Modi was re-elected in a convincing victory last year but has been on the back foot amid complaints about the economy, which has slowed to a 10-year low under his watch.
Mr. Modi is expected to use his meeting with the leader of the world's most powerful country to project strength. Meanwhile, Mr. Modi's policies, which critics say marginalize India's Muslims and other minorities and undermine India's secular and democratic foundation, have in recent months triggered
the biggest protests since he took office
. The Modi administration denies its critics' charges.
Bringing the U.S. president to his home state will also be a symbolic victory lap for Mr. Modi, who was once denied entry into the U.S. amid accusations that he didn't do enough to protect its citizens when riots broke out when he was its chief minister in 2002, and more than 1,000 people were killed, mostly Muslims.
""This visit is a very special one,"" Mr. Modi said on Twitter earlier this month, ""and it will go a long way in further cementing India-USA friendship.""

President Trump delivered a straightforward message to the millions of football fans watching the Super Bowl on Sunday: ""The best is yet to come,"" he declared in a campaign ad that ran after the game.
But exactly what comes next for Mr. Trump if he wins a second term is still under discussion at the White House, even as the president plans to continue crisscrossing the nation campaigning—now
with a Senate acquittal
, rising approval ratings and increased confidence in his re-election prospects.
Senior aides—led by Chris Liddell, the White House's deputy chief of staff for policy coordination—have been meeting since late last year to chart an agenda for the second term, according to administration officials. The discussions are in their initial stages, the officials said.
The early outlines of the agenda are starting to emerge, but aides said Mr. Trump hasn't yet signed off on the final details of the plan, though he is receiving regular briefings on the discussions. Among the issues under consideration: continuing the administration's efforts to lower prescription drug prices, pushing for a broad infrastructure bill and taking another crack at reforming the country's immigration system, the officials said. White House aides are still holding out hope that some of these things can get accomplished before the end of the first term, but lawmakers and some in the administration are pessimistic about the chances of finding common ground with Democratic lawmakers this year.
Senior aides have also begun discussing ways to lower the deficit—which is projected to reach $1 trillion in 2020—and cut taxes for the middle class, as well as roll back more Obama-era regulations. The president's coming budget blueprint, set to be released Monday, is expected to shed more light on his policy priorities.
Some in the administration have said privately that Mr. Trump should be doing more to sell voters on his second-term agenda. But others countered that developing a detailed term-two agenda is complicated by uncertainty about the balance of power in Congress in 2021; the White House could be much more aggressive in its legislative proposals if Republicans controlled both chambers.
Deputy-level aides from key White House offices gathered at Camp David early last month to discuss the major policy themes they hope to focus on for the rest of 2020 and in the first year of a second term, the officials said. Additional meetings are expected in the coming months.
Mr. Trump hasn't yet publicly articulated a detailed policy vision for a second term during his frequent campaign rallies and speeches, instead pointing to his first-term record and warning that a Democratic president would blow it all up.
At his State of the Union address Tuesday, Mr. Trump made clear that
the economy will be the core theme
of his re-election campaign. Ticking through a list of economic statistics, the president took credit for the U.S.'s economic boom and suggested it could all go away if he is denied four more years in the White House.
Health care and education were among the other policy issues Mr. Trump discussed during the speech. He called on Congress to pass legislation that would establish a tax credit meant to encourage wealthy individuals and corporations to provide scholarships to help low-income students afford private or religious schools. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), hasn't moved forward in the Senate and is unlikely to gain traction in the Democratic-controlled House.
But Mr. Trump has spent more time looking back on the past three years than looking ahead to his possible second term.
During a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, last week, the president vowed to usher in a Republican Congress to enact new immigration policies, negotiate new trade deals, offer an alternative to Obamacare and usher in new breakthroughs in science to cure childhood cancers and end the AIDS epidemic.
The bulk of his remarks focused on what he sees as the threat Democrats pose to the country.
""In short, this election is a choice between American freedom and Democratic socialism, and in some cases, in my opinion, it's worse than socialism,"" he said. ""Socialism is a kind word by comparison.""

What policy issues do you think President Trump should focus on if he wins a second term? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Trump's advisers say drawing a contrast with Democrats is a winning strategy. Some of them believe the president's appeal to his devoted base stems less from his specific policy positions and more from his image as a political outsider who is taking on Washington's elite.
And some longtime political strategists agree.
""He ran as the disrupter in chief; has governed as the disrupter in chief, and will run for re-election as the disrupter in chief,"" said Chris Lehane, a former adviser to Bill Clinton and Al Gore. ""You could even make an argument that the less he sounds like a typical, conventional politician, including having a typical conventional agenda, the more he's on message.""
The president's advisers also believe Mr. Trump has a strong record to run on. As a result, much of Mr. Trump's campaign trail rhetoric looks back on his first-term accomplishments, from criminal justice legislation to the trade deals he struck with China, Mexico and Canada, to the strong economy.
""The election will be a stark study in contrasts, between the Democrats who offer massive government intervention into people's lives and President Trump who promotes liberty, economic freedom, and prosperity,"" Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said in a statement.
Veterans of past administrations and presidential campaigns said Mr. Trump's first-term performance is what many voters care about the most.
""If they're voting for the president, they're likely picking the president for retrospective reasons,"" said Lanhee Chen, who served as the policy director to Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign. ""It's much more important for the challenger to define their agenda, than the incumbent.""
Mr. Chen nonetheless suggested Mr. Trump opens himself up to criticism from his opponents for not laying out a detailed agenda for the second term. During the 2012 election, for example, Mr. Romney repeatedly called on Barack Obama to flesh out his agenda, arguing he wasn't saying enough about what he would do if he won four more years in office.
""They have no agenda for the future, no agenda for America, no agenda for a second term,"" Mr. Romney said during an October 2012 rally.
Some past presidents have outlined detailed visions for a second term as they campaigned for re-election. Bill Clinton, for example, called for a ""bridge to the 21st century"" in 1996, which included a plan to help welfare recipients get jobs. But other presidents have taken a similar approach to Mr. Trump by emphasizing the economic success of their first term, as Ronald Reagan did in his ""Morning in America"" advertising campaign.
Cecilia Muñoz, who led the White House Domestic Policy Council for the last five years of the Obama administration, said senior aides were having in-depth conversations about a second term at this point in Mr. Obama's presidency.
""The conversations were robust. We were an administration of planners,"" she said, adding, ""There was a time when you had a president with a clear vision and a team expected to plan for that vision.""

President Trump on Friday said that he is replacing Mick Mulvaney, his acting chief of staff of 14 months, with Rep. Mark Meadows, a longtime ally and frequent defender of his on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Meadows will be Mr. Trump's fourth chief of staff.
""I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one,"" Mr. Trump tweeted from his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago. He thanked Mr. Mulvaney ""for having served the administration so well,"" and said Mr. Mulvaney would become U.S. special envoy for Northern Ireland.
Mr. Meadows (R., N.C.), a confidant of the president's going back to the 2016 campaign, has long been expected to join the White House in some capacity.
Mr. Mulvaney didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. In a statement, Mr. Meadows said, ""It's an honor to be selected by President Trump to serve alongside him and his team.""
After serving in the House since 2013, Mr. Meadows said in December that he wouldn't seek re-election. Around the same time, he discussed with the president a role that would bring him inside the White House, people familiar with the talks said. At the time, the discussions focused on a senior adviser-type role in which Mr. Meadows would consult on a range of issues.
Mr. Trump had spoken with Mr. Mulvaney for the past several days about leaving the administration, one senior official said. The president discussed the change at a private fundraiser Friday night, speaking positively about both men and setting high expectations for Mr. Meadows, according to a person who attended the event.
Several White House aides described the move as part of Mr. Trump's campaign preparation. Mr. Meadows gives the president a confidant at his side heading into re-election.
One Republican close to the White House said Mr. Meadows had a deal in place for weeks to become staff chief, but was waiting for the president to announce it.
Mr. Meadows, a onetime real-estate developer and sandwich-shop owner, was one of the founders of the House Freedom Caucus, which rose to prominence as a rebellious band of about three dozen Republican lawmakers willing to buck their party establishment.
Mr. Meadows was a thorn in the president's side when he opposed the president's effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017. In subsequent White House meetings, he forged a bond with Mr. Trump and revived the effort to repeal the health-care law in the House. It later failed in the Senate.
In recent months, Mr. Meadows became part of Mr. Trump's de facto defense team during the impeachment investigation on Capitol Hill and the trial, working in the Senate side of the Capitol and appearing on media to ferociously defend the president.
Mr. Mulvaney, who served as the White House budget director, was appointed acting chief of staff in December 2018. He kept the ""acting"" title -- which Mr. Meadows won't have -- throughout his tenure.
Unlike his predecessor, John Kelly, who as chief of staff strove to tighten access to the president and bring order to the White House, Mr. Mulvaney was content to ""let Trump be Trump."" But he clashed with the White House Counsel's Office during the impeachment process, aides said, and often appeared not to be involved in some major decisions.
By the end of his tenure, his relationship with Mr. Trump appeared to be nonexistent.

RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif.—Republican senators facing tight re-election battles remained loyal to President Trump during
the Senate impeachment trial
. Now, they are reaping the rewards.
Mr. Trump is set to hold campaign rallies this week with
two of the most vulnerable GOP senators
: Martha McSally of Arizona and Cory Gardner of Colorado. Both hail from states that will be competitive in the presidential election in November and hope Mr. Trump's visit will help them rally voters and raise money.
Since the impeachment trial, Ms. McSally—who has deployed Trump-style tactics such as criticizing a CNN reporter as a ""liberal hack"" last month when he sought an interview from her in the Capitol—has doubled down on her support for the president. In recent days, her campaign began airing a new ad against her opponent,
former astronaut Mark Kelly
, criticizing his support for impeachment and calling him ""too liberal for Arizona.""
Jacob Peters, Mr. Kelly's communications director, criticized the ad as ""more of the same negative and false attack ads that Arizonans are tired of and rejected in 2018.""
""I'm the firewall to make sure we keep the Senate majority,"" Ms. McSally said ahead of the impeachment vote earlier this month. ""We've got to make sure that we keep President Trump in office and we keep the Senate majority, and that's Arizona, ground zero,"" she told Fox News.
Ms. McSally and Mr. Gardner both voted against calling witnesses in the Senate impeachment trial and subsequently to acquit the president. When Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) told Republican senators that
he didn't have the votes
yet to block new witnesses desired by Democrats from being called in the trial, Ms. McSally and Mr. Gardner addressed their colleagues, people familiar with the matter said. Days later, the Senate voted against new testimony.
Appearing with the president carries risk for the two senators, who during the impeachment trial faced the choice of breaking with Mr. Trump and inciting his wrath, or rallying behind him and intensifying Democratic attacks. Embracing the president on stage will help the senators rally the Republican base, but also serve as a reminder to Democrats and independents of how they cast their votes on impeachment.
""The senators risk alienating voters who don't like the president by declining to distance themselves from Trump. But virtually all Republican elected officials have made the calculation that it's more risky to oppose the president and alienate his Republican supporters,"" said Nathan Gonzales, editor and publisher of Insider Politics. But Mr. Gardner and Ms. McSally are in a ""tough spot,"" he said. ""They have to compile a coalition that includes voters who like and dislike President Trump. Simply rallying Republicans is not enough for either of them to win.""
In a fundraising email Tuesday, the Democratic National Committee singled out Ms. McSally and Mr. Gardner's votes to acquit the president. They ""want voters to believe they won't just fall in line behind Trump,"" the email said. ""But when it came down to it, they voted with nearly every other Republican senator to give a green light to Trump's corruption.""
The president, who plans to spend four days out West this week attending rallies and fundraisers, is scheduled to arrive Wednesday evening in Phoenix. In 2018, Ms. McSally lost to now-Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D., Ariz.) in a race for Arizona's other seat, but was subsequently appointed to the Senate by the state's governor to fill a vacancy.
On Thursday, Mr. Trump is set to travel to Colorado Springs, Colo., for a rally with Mr. Gardner, who defeated his Democratic opponent six years ago by less than 2 percentage points. Mr. Gardner faces a likely matchup with former state Gov. John Hickenlooper, who is running for the Democratic nomination.
The president will continue to campaign for vulnerable Republican senators in the coming months as the GOP looks to keep control of the Senate in an election cycle
more favorable to Democrats
. Some 23 Republican-held seats are up for election in November, including four open seats, compared with 11 Democratic seats on the ballot. Democrats need three Senate seats to win control of the chamber if they also win the White House this fall; if Mr. Trump is re-elected, Democrats must net four seats to overcome the vice president's tiebreaking vote.
For Mr. Trump, this week's Western swing also offers him an opportunity to engage in one of his favored campaigning strategies: counterprogramming.
Wednesday's rally in Phoenix is set to begin at the same time as the Democratic debate 300 miles away in Las Vegas. Wednesday will be the first time on the debate stage for Mike Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor who in recent weeks has become a focus of the president's ire.
Mr. Trump has
made his presence known
in the states where Democrats have begun voting, holding rallies and sending surrogates to Iowa and New Hampshire earlier this month. With Democrats set to caucus in Nevada on Saturday, he is spending three nights at his hotel in Las Vegas this week and is scheduled to hold a campaign rally at the Las Vegas Convention Center on Friday afternoon. He also plans to travel to South Carolina before the primary there next week
""It seems to be effective,"" he told reporters on Tuesday. He didn't offer specifics.
Mr. Trump is also attending high-dollar fundraisers out West. A fundraiser Tuesday in Los Angeles and another Wednesday in Rancho Mirage, Calif.,—hosted by Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison—collectively raised $14 million for a joint account between the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee, a Republican official said.
In his remarks to about 250 supporters, he criticized the Democratic presidential candidates' policies—in particular the health-care overhaul proposed by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who he said was looking to ""give away free stuff to everybody,"" an attendee said. He also praised his own efforts, the attendee said, telling supporters his job was harder than it looked.

WASHINGTON—Sen. Susan Collins said President Trump's efforts
to press Ukraine to open an investigation
into a Democratic presidential candidate were ""improper and demonstrated poor judgment"" but didn't warrant forcing him from office, joining a handful of Republican lawmakers who have criticized his actions while arguing they aren't impeachable.
""I do not believe that the House has met its burden of showing that the president's conduct, however flawed, warrants the extreme step of immediate removal from office,"" said the Maine senator, who faces a tough re-election battle, in a speech Tuesday on the Senate floor.
The GOP-controlled Senate is expected to acquit Mr. Trump in a final vote Wednesday afternoon on two articles of impeachment alleging abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Conviction would require a two-thirds majority, or 67 senators, and Senate Republicans have remained united in rejecting Democrats' impeachment push.
But Ms. Collins and a number of other GOP senators have criticized Mr. Trump's conduct in strong terms on the Senate floor, in op-eds and in remarks to reporters in recent days. Their disapproval is focused on a July 25 phone call in which Mr. Trump asked Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky for an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden, who is currently seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, and his son Hunter. Mr. Trump has defended the call as ""perfect"" and has said he did nothing wrong regarding Ukraine, dismissing the impeachment process as a partisan hoax.
""The president's actions were not 'perfect.' Some were inappropriate,"" said Sen. Pat Toomey (R., Pa.) in
an opinion article published in the Philadelphia Inquirer
on Tuesday. He said the actions didn't rise to an impeachable offense.
Sen. Rob Portman (R., Ohio) condemned Mr. Trump's July call as ""inappropriate and wrong"" in a speech on the Senate floor on Tuesday. ""While I don't condone this behavior, these actions do not rise to removing the president from office and taking him off the ballot in a presidential election year that is already well under way,"" he said.

""The president's behavior was shameful and wrong,"" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) in her own speech on Monday night. ""His personal interests do not take precedence over those of this great nation.""
In her speech on Tuesday, Ms. Collins said: ""It was wrong for President Trump to mention former Vice President Joe Biden on that phone call, and it was wrong for him to ask a foreign country to investigate a political rival.""
Mr. Trump and his GOP allies have alleged that it was corrupt for Mr. Biden during the Obama administration to seek the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had once investigated a Ukrainian gas company where Hunter Biden sat on the board. Mr. Biden sought the prosecutor's removal as part of a broad international effort to combat corruption in Ukraine.
The Bidens have denied any wrongdoing.
Hunter Biden has said it was poor judgment
on his part to serve on the Burisma board while his father was involved with Ukraine policy as vice president.
In her speech on Tuesday, Ms. Collins also reminded listeners that she had voted to acquit former President Clinton, a Democrat, in his impeachment trial in 1999.
""This decision is not about whether you like or dislike this president, or agree with or oppose his policies,"" she said. ""Rather it is about whether the charges meet the very high constitutional standard of treason, bribery or other high crimes or misdemeanors."" She said Mr. Trump's actions didn't meet that threshold.
After her speech, Ms. Collins told reporters she might have been open to censuring Mr. Trump,
a proposal floated by Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin
of West Virginia. Republican Senate leaders have dismissed this idea.
""It's something that I would have looked at. At this point, the fact is the president has been impeached—only the third president to be actually impeached,"" Ms. Collins said. ""That both Republican senators such as myself and Democratic senators have criticized his conduct strikes me as a reprimand.""
Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who also has said Mr. Trump's conduct was inappropriate, told reporters on Tuesday that he hopes the refusal of GOP senators to convict and remove Mr. Trump will discourage future Houses from sending impeachment articles to the Senate that don't have bipartisan support.

WASHINGTON—An emboldened President Trump turned his focus Sunday to his re-election bid, arguing a growing economy would help him in November, as Democrats' lead impeachment manager vowed to press for the president's removal even as the Senate is virtually certain to acquit him.
""It was all nonsense,"" Mr. Trump said of impeachment during a Fox News interview. ""It's a very serious thing. It should never happen to another president.""
In a separate television appearance, Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) said that in closing arguments in the impeachment trial Monday, Democrats would continue pressing to remove Mr. Trump from office over his Ukraine pressure campaign.
""It's enormously important that the country understand exactly what this president did,"" said Mr. Schiff. He said the Senate should remove Mr. Trump from office ""because he is threatening to still cheat in the next election by soliciting foreign interference.""
The televised comments by Messrs. Trump and Schiff came just ahead of the Iowa caucuses Monday, the State of the Union address Tuesday and the expected acquittal of Mr. Trump by Senate Republicans on Wednesday. They also came as
new polling showed Americans' views of him
were little-changed by his impeachment.
In Iowa, site of the nation's first Democratic nominating contest, contenders were crisscrossing the state trying to appeal to the many voters who have said they would make their choice based on who they think has the best chance to unseat Mr. Trump in November.
""I just want Trump out,"" said Sandy Suplee, a 58-year-old laborer from Pella, Iowa. She said she would set aside her personal preferences among the candidates to support former Vice President Joe Biden, whom she believes has the best odds of winning.
For Trump supporter Susan Ohnysty, a 60-year-old in West Des Moines, impeachment was a ""waste of time,"" adding that the articles of impeachment ""were not meeting the standards of a high crime.""
Friday,
the Senate voted 51-49
to reject Democrats demands to call new witnesses in the impeachment trial. That
effectively ended the impeachment effort,
even though the trial will resume for four hours of closing arguments Monday, followed by a vote on the articles of impeachment Wednesday.
A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found a majority of voters said they believed Mr. Trump abused his power by asking Ukraine to investigate a potential political opponent in order to influence the coming election, and also that Mr. Trump obstructed Congress by not cooperating with the impeachment inquiry.
But there wasn't majority support for removing him from office. Among those surveyed, 49% said he should be allowed to finish his term, compared to 46% who said he should be removed.
Mr. Trump's job approval in the January poll stood at 46%, with 51% disapproving, in line with results throughout the Trump presidency.
Mr. Schiff, when pressed on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on what Democrats would do after Mr. Trump's likely acquittal, said he wasn't looking beyond the trial.
""I'm not letting the senators off the hook,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""We're still going to go into the Senate this week and make the case why this president needs to be removed.""
Asked if Democrats would consider subpoenaing former national security adviser John Bolton—
whose coming book alleges
that the president told him he wanted to hold up aid to Ukraine until he got the investigations he wanted—Mr. Schiff declined to answer definitively but said there are several possible options.
In a separate television appearance on Sunday, one of the president's attorneys in the Senate trial, Alan Dershowitz, argued that there is no need to seek out new information.
""The articles of impeachment did not charge an impeachable offense,"" Mr. Dershowitz said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""So the right answer is to dismiss it and cut it off right there. No amount of witnesses could have changed that conclusion.""
Mr. Dershowitz also reframed one of his arguments last week, about whether Mr. Trump could have believed his re-election was in the national interest.
""If the president did something completely lawful, the fact that part of his motivation may have been to help his election cannot be the quid pro quo,"" he said. ""I don't believe that a president can do anything that he thinks is the national interest.""
The Senate impeachment trial commanded 11 days of attention and appeared to be heading for a final vote Saturday. But a decision to break until a resumption this week was bipartisan, said Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.).
That gave Democratic senators campaigning for president a chance to hit the trail in Iowa, while others got a chance to relax. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham headed home to South Carolina, where a pulled pork platter awaited him.
""We all need a break,"" said Mr. Graham. ""This is as close to purgatory as any of us want to get.""
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democratic presidential hopeful, missed a scheduled campaign appearance at a Friday evening town hall in Des Moines, leaving her campaign co-chairs to hold down the fort. However, the Senate trial adjourned in enough time for Ms. Warren to show up at a hastily arranged late-night campaign event at a brewery across the street from the town-hall venue.
Some in the White House saw an upside to the timing, with Mr. Trump giving his State of the Union address before his likely acquittal. Eric Ueland, the White House legislative liaison, told reporters it would bring focus to what he said were Mr. Trump's accomplishments while contrasting with the various investigations into the president.
""It's a strong one-two punch,"" he said.

WASHINGTON—House Democrats said the Senate should convict President Trump on an abuse of power charge even though he isn't accused of violating a criminal statute, seeking i
n the second day of arguments
at his impeachment trial to rebuff a White House argument that the Constitution requires a criminal act.
The Democratic impeachment managers also laid out Thursday Mr. Trump's alleged motive for seeking
investigations by Ukraine
into former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, saying Mr. Trump was determined to undercut a rival, not battle corruption, and that he put U.S. national security at risk as a result.
""A president who uses his office to ask for, or even worse, to compel foreign nations to meddle in our elections is a president who attacks the very foundation of our liberty,"" Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and one of seven impeachment managers, said on the Senate floor. He said it is ""without doubt a crime against the Constitution warranting, demanding, removal from office.""
Mr. Trump and members of the president's defense team as well as some Republicans have dismissed the impeachment as a political assault by Democrats. They also argue that the ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" cited in the Constitution's impeachment clause require the allegation of a crime.
Speaking to reporters during a break in the proceedings, Jay Sekulow, an attorney for Mr. Trump, said the president's defense will advance ""multiple schools of thought"" about what is an impeachable offense as they argue for the president's acquittal. ""Our job here is to defend the president, the office of the presidency and the Constitution,"" he said.
Under the rules governing the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history, the House managers and Mr. Trump's defense team each have 24 hours spread over three days to make their arguments. The House team used roughly eight hours of its time on Wednesday.
Democrats are expected to turn to the second article of impeachment, focused on Mr. Trump's alleged efforts to block documents and testimony sought by House investigators, on Friday.
During his presentation, Mr. Nadler outlined the legal underpinnings of abuse of power, arguing that it has been at the center of previous presidential impeachments.
""The charges set forth in the first article of impeachment are firmly grounded in the Constitution of the United States,"" said Mr. Nadler.
The managers played a series of clips, including decades-old videos of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) and Harvard Law Prof. Alan Dershowitz, now a member of Mr. Trump's defense team in which each argued that certain acts deserve impeachment even if they aren't illegal under criminal statutes.
Mr. Dershowitz, in a CNN interview Sunday, said he would argue on the Senate floor that even if House Democrats' allegations about the president are true, they don't rise to the level of an impeachable offense because they aren't crimes. He said he plans to paraphrase an argument made in the 1868 impeachment trial of President Andrew Johnson that only ""criminal-like conduct or conduct that is prohibited by the criminal law"" is impeachable.
The impeachment managers have argued that Mr. Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine as part of an effort to pressure Kyiv to open investigations into Mr. Biden. The Trump administration released the aid in September after protests from lawmakers in both parties.
Much of Thursday's arguments focused on Mr. Trump's request, during a
July 25 phone call
with Ukranian President Volodymyr Zelensky, that Ukraine probe Mr. Biden. Mr. Trump also mentioned the subject of aid during the call, but didn't tie the two together.
The impeachment managers addressed in detail Mr. Trump's desire to investigate Mr. Biden, who helped lead an international anticorruption push in the country while vice president. Mr. Biden's son, Hunter Biden, served on the board of a Ukranian natural gas company at the time, drawing allegations, without any evidence, from Mr. Trump that Mr. Biden tried to shield Hunter Biden. The Bidens have denied any wrongdoing.
Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D., Texas), presenting on the Senate floor, said that Mr. Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden to harm his presidential campaign and presented slides of polling data that showed Mr. Biden outpacing Mr. Trump. She also moved to debunk the idea that Mr. Biden sought to protect his son.
""The president asked Ukraine for this investigation for one reason and one reason only: because he knew it would be damaging to an opponent who was consistently beating him in the polls and therefore it could help him get re-elected in 2020,"" she added.
Citing testimony before the House from former Ukraine envoy Bill Taylor and former National Security Council official Fiona Hill, Mr. Schiff said: ""There is no question that President Trump's political errand and our national security diverged.""

WASHINGTON -- House managers said President Trump was a threat to American democracy, while his defense team countered that Democrats were trying to undermine two elections, in their final arguments in his Senate impeachment trial on Monday.
With Democrats set to fall well short of the two-thirds threshold needed to remove Mr. Trump from office in the final vote later this week, they used their turns at the lectern to issue a warning to the Senate, focusing on what they saw as the danger presented by Mr. Trump remaining in office.
""He has betrayed our national security and he will do so again,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the lead impeachment manager and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. ""He has compromised our elections and he will do so again. You will not change him. You cannot constrain him. He is who he is. . . . Now, do impartial justice and convict him.""
The two articles of impeachment center on Mr. Trump's pressing Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and other matters that could help Mr. Trump politically in this year's election, and the president's alleged efforts to obstruct Congress's inquiry into those actions.
Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing and again called impeachment a hoax on Twitter on Monday.
His legal team, in their presentation, painted Democrats' pursuit of impeachment as purely political, driven by a longstanding dislike of Mr. Trump, a Republican.
""At the end of the day, this is an effort to overturn the results of one election and to try to interfere in the coming election that begins today in Iowa,"" said White House counsel Pat Cipollone. Iowa's caucuses on Monday evening kicked off the Democratic and GOP nominating contests.
""What the House Democrats have done to this nation, to the Constitution, to the office of the president, to the president himself and to this body is outrageous,"" said another Trump lawyer, Jay Sekulow.
The two sides gave their final pitches Monday to the jury of 100 senators who had largely made up their minds on impeachment, broadly unmoved by three weeks of presentations and arguments.
An acquittal for Mr. Trump is expected on Wednesday. Twenty Republicans would have to join the entire Democratic caucus to vote to remove the president. No Republicans have said they favor impeachment, and just two supported Democrats' effort last week to seek more evidence in the trial, which failed 51-49.
Democratic senators emerged from the trial frustrated that most GOP senators had rejected bringing in new witnesses and information. Republicans countered that the House impeachment probe should have sought more evidence, which was blocked by the White House, before turning the matter over to the Senate.
""I'm trying to find the Senate rule that says for senators to plug their ears with cotton so they don't have to listen to the hard facts,"" Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) said.
Some Republicans, including Sens. Pat Roberts of Kansas and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, said they believe Mr. Trump engaged in improper behavior, but that it didn't rise to an impeachable offense. But others were unconvinced.
Mr. Trump's defense team ""raised a reasonable doubt as to the crime -- the whatever -- that was alleged,"" Sen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.) said.
Democrats allege in the first article of impeachment that Mr. Trump attempted to interfere with this year's presidential election by pressing Kyiv to probe Mr. Biden, a front-runner for the Democratic nomination. The second article accuses Mr. Trump of obstructing Congress's investigation by preventing witnesses from testifying and defying subpoenas for documentary evidence.
Mr. Trump and his allies have argued that Mr. Trump's interest in Mr. Biden was legitimate, alleging it was corrupt for Mr. Biden during the Obama administration to seek the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who once investigated a Ukrainian gas company where Mr. Biden's son Hunter sat on the board. Mr. Biden sought the prosecutor's removal as part of a broad international effort to combat corruption in Ukraine.
The Bidens have denied wrongdoing. Hunter Biden has said it was poor judgment on his part to serve on the Burisma board while his father was vice president.
What isn't clear is whether the acquittal vote will be bipartisan. Some Democratic senators, such as Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Doug Jones of Alabama and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, are undecided. Mr. Jones, representing a state that backed Mr. Trump by 28 points in the 2016 election, is the most vulnerable Democratic senator this cycle.
Mr. Manchin said Monday he remained undecided on how he will vote, but introduced a measure to censure Mr. Trump, saying it would ""allow this body to unite across party lines . . . to formally denounce the president's actions.""
While censure was mentioned at times last year by some House Democrats, it hasn't been seriously discussed by Republican or Democratic leadership. Many Senate Republicans said Mr. Trump did nothing wrong, and those who find his actions problematic haven't called for him to be rebuked by Congress.
""Too late. It's too late,"" said Sen Roy Blunt (R., Mo.), a member of GOP Senate leadership, about censure.
Mr. Trump is scheduled to give his State of the Union speech Tuesday, in the chamber where the House approved the articles of impeachment against him in December. Some Republicans hoped he would move beyond impeachment in the annual speech.
A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found a majority of voters said they believed Mr. Trump abused his power by asking Ukraine to investigate a potential political opponent. But there wasn't majority support for removing him from office.

Joe Biden won all three primaries held Tuesday on a day filled with anxious voting, building a lead in the Democratic presidential nomination race that appears increasingly difficult for Bernie Sanders to overcome.
For up-to-the-minute news on the Democratic presidential primaries, please see
WSJ's Live Coverage

The two-man race lurched forward against major disruptions triggered by
the coronavirus pandemic
as the first balloting was held—in Florida, Illinois and Arizona—since the crisis engulfed the nation. As of Wednesday morning, the former vice president had 52.8% of the delegates allocated so far and 57.6% of the number needed to win the nomination.
In Florida, a critical battleground state in the general election, Mr. Biden won nearly three times as many votes as the Vermont senator and carried all 67 counties. With 99% of Illinois precincts reporting, Mr. Biden had 59.1% of the vote versus 36.1% for Mr. Sanders. In Arizona, with 88% of the vote in, the former vice president had 43.6% against his rival's 31.6%.
The latest large victories for Mr. Biden are likely to place more pressure on Mr. Sanders to exit from the race so the party can focus on President Trump. A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll released Sunday showed
Mr. Biden was favored nationally, 61% to 32%
, among those who have already voted in the Democratic primary or plan to do so.
Mr. Biden, speaking from his home in Wilmington, Del., said his campaign is moving toward winning the nomination as he reached out to his rival's supporters. He delivered his address via a live stream to avoid gathering supporters during the pandemic.
""We've moved closer to securing the Democratic Party's nomination for president, and we're doing it by building a broad coalition,"" he said.
Mr. Biden said he and Mr. Sanders ""may disagree on tactics, but we share a common vision"" on issues such as health care, wealth inequality and climate change. He told young voters inspired by Mr. Sanders, ""I hear you, I know what's at stake.""
Mr. Biden already is trying to unify the party behind him, endorsing policy proposals related to bankruptcy laws and college tuition
in a bid to woo liberals
. Mr. Sanders acknowledged last week that he's losing the ""debate over electability"" among Democrats.
During a live stream address Tuesday evening, Mr. Sanders outlined his proposals to blunt the effects of the coronavirus outbreak. He didn't mention the primary elections or his narrowing prospects.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee noted Tuesday night that Mr. Trump had secured enough delegates through the GOP primaries to become the party's ""presumptive nominee"" for president.
""Nobody motivates our base more than President Trump, as evidenced by the historic turnout we've seen in state after state this primary season,"" Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement. ""Fueled by both our longtime supporters and the thousands of new voters that continue to join our movement, we are united and enthusiasm is on our side.""
Ohio had been expected to hold a primary on Tuesday, but it joined a growing list of states
that have delayed their contests
until May or June in hopes the coronavirus situation will improve.
On the eve of the balloting, a court there rejected a request to postpone the state's primary until June 2 as Republican Gov. Mike DeWine had recommended. The in-person voting was subsequently placed on hold after the state's top health official ordered polls closed.
The Ohio Supreme Court denied a last-minute legal challenge to the postponement, and county election boards were deluged with phone calls from confused, frustrated voters.
In a statement released late Tuesday, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez called for states with upcoming primaries and caucuses to use vote by mail and other alternatives to casting ballots in person.
""What happened in Ohio last night has only bred more chaos and confusion,"" he said, adding that states should focus on figuring out how to make voting easier and safer as opposed to postponing primaries ""when timing around the virus remains unpredictable.""
This round of contests might be the last significant ones for some time, if more states announce primary postponements.

Voters, sobered by the crisis, also cast ballots in local and state contests as they confronted school closures, travel limitations, event cancellations and a stressed global economy. Germs were also on their minds.
At a polling location inside a Miami fire station, workers wore gloves as they inspected voter identification cards and dispensed hand sanitizer to visitors. Some voters arrived with their own pens, gloves and disinfecting wipes.
Officials in Chicago, the biggest city within the three states that voted Tuesday, said election-day turnout was low as nervous voters stayed home. Still, many had cast ballots early. Officials said the previous primary record for such voting was easily surpassed and vote-by-mail applications more than tripled compared with 2016.
James Allen, a Chicago Board of Election Commissioners spokesman, told reporters Tuesday that city election officials failed last week to convince Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker to cancel in-person voting and replace it with vote-by-mail balloting.
Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh said in a statement that the governor's office had offered ""to provide the National Guard to help staff the election"" as well as assistance in recruiting volunteers to fill in for election workers anxious about staffing polling places.

""The governor cannot unilaterally cancel or delay an election,"" she said. ""Elections are the cornerstone of our democracy and we could not risk confusion and disenfranchisement in the courts. No one is saying this is a perfect solution. We have no perfect solutions at the moment. We only have the least bad solutions.""
Some Chicago polls opened late because workers didn't show up or equipment wasn't delivered on time, while some voters were confused about where they were supposed to vote after about 200 of the city's 2,069 precinct voting locations had to be moved.
Voting-rights advocates said they fielded questions from confused voters and poll workers in multiple states because of changes made to polling locations to avoid nursing homes and other vulnerable sites.
""It's unprecedented for us to be addressing this much confusion around basic questions that voters have during a primary election, like where is my polling place,"" Ami Gandhi, senior counsel at the Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, told reporters.

WASHINGTON—President Trump has had two major national audiences in the past five days, and both times he aimed a message at African-Americans, a group that overwhelmingly disapproves of the job he is doing but could help decide whether he gets to keep it.
During the Super Bowl, Mr. Trump's campaign spent millions of dollars on a commercial featuring an African-American woman who had a drug sentence commuted by the president. ""Politicians talk about criminal-justice reform,"" the ad said. ""President Trump got it done.""
At the State of the Union, Mr. Trump celebrated the low unemployment rate among African-Americans, talked of urban development zones, honored one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen and awarded a fourth-grader from Philadelphia, Janiyah Davis, with a school-choice scholarship.
The black unemployment rate is 5.9%, according to the latest government statistics, up slightly from the historic low of 5.4% reached in August 2019. Overall, the U.S. unemployment rate is 3.5%.
While Mr. Trump's re-election strategy mainly relies on motivating his conservative base, the focus on African-Americans, and a similar push for Hispanics, shows an effort to attract new voters. Only 8% of blacks voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, but his campaign is confident it can improve on that. Even a small boost could help in battleground states such as Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.

""There's significant support out there that you're not going to hear about but it will show up at the ballot box. People see results,"" said Calvin Tucker, who directs minority outreach for the Republican Party of Pennsylvania. He noted that Mr. Trump in 2016 did better among black voters than the past two Republican nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain.
The push Mr. Trump has displayed in the last week—chiefly the emotional Super Bowl ad, which generated favorable reviews—also appears intended for another group of voters he has struggled with.
""Ads showing the compassionate part of Trump's agenda could help raise his favorable ratings with some suburban voters,"" said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist in Washington. ""They like his economic policies, but are turned off by the tweets and harsh rhetoric.""
The Trump campaign has been holding outreach events, seeking to shake the decadeslong dominance Democrats have held with black voters. It is a far different effort than 2016, when Mr. Trump lacked a record and simply asked, ""What the hell do you have to lose?""
The campaign plans to continue an advertising campaign geared toward black voters, including African-American community newspapers and radio. Ads encourage people to text ""woke"" to receive updates. The campaign is also training activists to engage and register voters, according to a person familiar with the strategy.
With a strong economy at the president's back, some Democrats say Mr. Trump's outreach is a wake-up call.
""What we saw from Donald Trump was a 2020 surgical strategy,"" said Quentin James, founder of the Collective PAC, which helps elect black candidates to office. Mr. James said Democrats need a large-scale program to engage with African-Americans and fears the party will play catch-up.
""We assume black voters will just vote for the Democratic Party like they always do,"" he said. ""Sure the numbers are there, but if Trump can get two or three more points with black men in swing states, this thing is over. I am very nervous.""
Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee who is also African-American, said Mr. Trump was smart to make a play for black voters. But he said that effort is hampered by the president's history of controversial statements, from saying there were fine people on ""both sides"" of the deadly 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., to saying four Democratic lawmakers, all of them minority women, should return to the ""totally broken and crime infested places from which they came"" and ""fix"" them.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you think President Trump can improve on his 2016 performance among African-American voters? Join the conversation below.
""This is a man who wanted to execute the Central Park Five,"" said Mr. Steele, referring to the black and Hispanic teenagers who were wrongfully convicted of raping a jogger in 1989. Asked about the case last year, Mr. Trump refused to apologize for his stance, which he had emphasized at the time in newspaper ads that called for bringing back the death penalty in New York.
A January poll released by the Washington Post showed more than 8 in 10 black Americans think Mr. Trump is a racist and that he has made racism a bigger problem. Despite Mr. Trump's boasts about the economy, 77% of black Americans said he deserves only ""some"" or ""hardly any"" credit, according to the poll.
""You go in the barber shop and talk to people—they hate Donald Trump,"" said Keith Williams, chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party's black caucus. He said Mr. Trump's frequent criticisms of former President Obama were a sore spot and noted the economic recovery began under Mr. Trump's predecessor.
""He can bring people to the State of the Union but he's never been for us,"" Mr. Williams said.
A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll from January showed only 15% of African-Americans approve of the job Mr. Trump is doing, and 83% disapprove—by far the worst of any demographic group.
Still, another Journal poll in December showed Mr. Trump could improve on his 2016 margin. While only 9% of blacks were almost certain to vote for the president and 72% were almost certain to vote against him, 21% said it depends on whom Democrats nominate.

DAVOS, Switzerland -- President Trump touted what he described as a ""blue-collar boom"" transforming the American economy and hailed the U.S. trade agreement with China in a speech to global business and government leaders, hours before his impeachment trial got under way.
The campaign-style address appeared aimed as much at a U.S. re-election audience and the 100 senators who will act as jurors in his impeachment trial as at the other heads of state and business executives at the World Economic Forum in this Swiss mountain resort.
""The American dream is back, bigger, better and stronger than ever before,"" Mr. Trump said. ""No one is benefiting more than America's middle class.""
The president also reiterated his administration's promise for a middle-class tax cut. He told The Wall Street Journal it would be subject to his re-election and GOP gains in the House, where Democrats now hold a majority.
In a remark in his speech widely understood as referring to climate-change activists, he urged the world to ""reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse,"" whom he described as ""the heirs of yesterday's foolish fortunetellers.""
After Mr. Trump's speech, Axel Weber, chairman of Swiss bank UBS Group AG, said it ""was a typical sales pitch of the CEO in Davos overselling the company's achievements and underreporting on some of the risks that are there.""
David McKay, chief executive of Royal Bank of Canada, said that, based on his meetings in Davos so far, business leaders shared Mr. Trump's optimism. ""There's a general positivity about economic opportunity in the U.S.,"" Mr. McKay said.
Year-over-year growth cooled to 2.1% in the third quarter of last year from 3.2% in the second quarter of 2018. The U.S. has been in a period of uninterrupted growth since 2009. At he same time, the federal deficit totaled $1.02 trillion over the 12 months that ended in December, according to U.S. Treasury data. It marked the first calendar year the deficit had exceeded $1 trillion since 2012.
Mr. Trump had bilateral meetings with world leaders throughout the day, but he was particularly interested in what business executives he spoke with thought about his speech, according to people familiar with the matter.
Some in Davos disagreed with Mr. Trump, but attendees at a dinner Tuesday night took turns praising him one at a time. FIFA President Gianni Infantino, compared Mr. Trump with the world-class athletes he often interacts with. ""President Trump is made of the same sort of fiber. He is competitive,"" he said, adding, ""He wants to win.""
White House aides said the president remained focused throughout the day on his meetings at Davos. In the interview with the Journal, Mr. Trump paused several times to comment on Fox News segments playing on a television nearby.
At one point, he pointed out a pro-Trump banner in the crowd at a pro-gun rally in Virginia that flashed across the screen.
The six-hour time difference in Davos gave Mr. Trump plenty of time to watch the Senate trial from his hotel. During his motorcade back to the hotel Tuesday night, he tweeted ""READ THE TRANSCRIPTS,"" indicating that the impeachment proceedings were very much on his mind.
Tuesday was Mr. Trump's second appearance at the summit as president. In 2018, he sought to reassure world leaders and business executives that there was a place for global cooperation in his nationalist worldview. ""'America First' does not mean America alone,"" he said at the time.
While Mr. Trump and allies will tout the promised middle-class tax cut during the 2020 campaign, it has little chance of passing the House.
Democrats favor some tax cuts for middle-income and lower-income households, but they also want to roll back pieces of the 2017 law that benefited high-income taxpayers and corporations.

To get a clemency case on a president's desk, it often comes down to who you know. That dynamic is even more acute in the current White House.
President Trump granted a series of pardons and sentence commutations this week, a list
that featured high-profile cases
involving political corruption and corporate greed as well as more routine drug and fraud charges. In the 11 cases, Mr. Trump leaned on advice from friends and allies, as well as a woman he freed from prison in a previous clemency round.
""I really rely on the recommendations of people that know them,"" the president told reporters Tuesday in explaining his decisions.
On Thursday, at a Hope for Prisoners event for former inmates re-entering society, Mr. Trump asked the crowd for their own recommendations, and also signaled he was open to clemency for confidant Roger Stone,
who was sentenced
to three years and four months in prison for lying to Congress and other crimes.
""I love doing it. You can be poor, you can be middle income, you can be rich, injustice is injustice,"" Mr. Trump said.
Past presidents also took on recommendations from allies, and like Mr. Trump faced fire for controversial decisions. But the personal nature of Mr. Trump's clemency announcements, and the fluidity of his approach, at times bypassing traditional Justice Department processes, differentiates himfrom recent presidents. That is drawing both praise and criticism.
""Obviously, being able to make your case to the president is an advantage because he's a very hands-on decision maker,"" said Matt Schlapp, a Republican consultant who serves as chairman of the American Conservative Union. He advocated on behalf of David Safavian, a former government official convicted of making false statements, who was pardoned by Mr. Trump.
Under the traditional process, the Justice Department's Office of the Pardon Attorney offers recommendations to the White House, though the final decision rests with the president. The department doesn't discuss any private deliberations with the White House. For some time, Trump advisers have been reviewing ways to revise the clemency process, possibly giving the White House more control, said a person familiar with those talks.
Clemency is the broader term that includes both pardons and commutations.
Critics argue that the president's approach unfairly advantages the well-connected.
""It is the mingling of his self interest and the presidency that has permeated his whole term,"" said Noah Bookbinder of the advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ""It seems to be a case of putting the views and wishes of people with unusual access to the president and often financial ties to the president, ahead of regular people.""
Under the Constitution, presidents have power to pardon and commute sentences related to federal crimes. Other presidents have made controversial choices, based on friendships or other relationships, but often waited until right before leaving office to minimize the political fallout.
Then-President Clinton pardoned fugitive commodities trader Marc Rich, whose ex-wife was a major donor to the Democratic Party and Mr. Clinton's presidential library, on his last day in office, and gave clemency to other controversial and well-connected figures such as Patty Hearst and Susan McDougal. President Obama commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, convicted on charges related to passing classified documents to WikiLeaks, just days before leaving the White House.
White House officials acknowledge that Mr. Trump has his own approach and says the president is focused on correcting what he sees as excessive sentencing for people from a variety of backgrounds. For Mr. Trump, guidance on the cases came in a variety of ways.
Some cases, such as
that of former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich
, were highlighted on Fox News, Mr. Trump's preferred cable channel. In others, allies lobbied Mr. Trump on individuals' behalf, as they did for former financier Michael Milken. Several longtime confidants of the president, including casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, investor Tom Barrack, and Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, were cited by the White House as backers in the clemency cases.
Connections also mattered for lesser-known names on Tuesday's list.
Alice Johnson, a woman whose life sentence Mr. Trump commuted in 2018, helped convince Mr. Trump to, in turn, commute the sentences of three women she had served time with in prison. She said she included the women—Tynice Nichole Hall and Crystal Munoz, both convicted on drug offenses, and Judith Negron, the part-owner of a health-care company accused of defrauding the federal government—on a list of names after Mr. Trump asked at an October event for recommendations on whom to pardon.
""I held him to that commitment. I was not about to let that opportunity pass,"" said Ms. Johnson in an interview.
Ms. Johnson appeared in a recent Super Bowl campaign ad for the president, who is pitching his criminal-justice-reform efforts to minority voters. The decision to commute Ms. Johnson's sentence in June 2018 had come after an appeal from reality television star Kim Kardashian West.
Mr. Trump reached out to Ms. Munoz's husband from the Oval Office to tell him about the commutation. Ms. Munoz said she learned Tuesday morning that she would be going home.
""I think it was a combination of many people working on my behalf,"" she said. Of Mr. Trump, she added: ""It doesn't matter who you are, if you can get his attention for just a moment, I think he's the kind of man that can listen.""
Earlier in the day, the White House invited sports figures, including former San Francisco 49ers wide receiver Jerry Rice, to visit the White House for an announcement of
a pardon for former 49ers owner
Edward J. DeBartolo Jr.
Mr. DeBartolo was backed by a number of key Trump allies, including New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and pastor Darrell Scott.
Another Trump ally pushing for a pardon for an associate was former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who supported the case of Paul Pogue, a Texas construction company owner who pleaded guilty on tax charges. Mr. Pogue contributed to Mr. Santorum's 2016 presidential bid and his family has given to GOP candidates, including over $200,000 to the president's re-election efforts.
""I think I mentioned it to Trump in passing, but it's not like I sat down with Trump and made a big pitch about it,"" said Mr. Santorum. He said Mr. Pogue had backing from Texas Republicans and religious leaders and argued his sentence had been excessive.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you trust President Trump to make the correct decision when it comes to pardons? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
Even before Tuesday's announcements, Mr. Trump's previous actions had provoked controversy. Mr. Trump's earlier pardons included Joe Arpaio, the former Arizona sheriff who had been convicted of disobeying a court order to halt immigration raids. He also issued a pardon for onetime media baron Conrad Black, who had served a prison term for fraud and obstruction of justice, and had subsequently penned a book praising Mr. Trump.
Some advocates said they saw new opportunities for clemency under Mr. Trump.
Amy Ralston Povah, the founder of the CAN-DO Foundation, which seeks clemency for nonviolent drug offenders, said she has found this administration to be open to their entreaties. The organization has met with White House officials and provided a list of recommendations for clemency, including Mses. Hall, Munoz and Negron, after Ms. Johnson was granted a commutation.
""I think that they're very open to seeing the cases that would never see the light of day because they're not high-profile cases,"" she said.
Clemency Under Past Presidents
President Trump has pardoned and issued commutations for high-profile figures throughout his term. Other presidents waited until just before they left office to do so. Here are some of those late decisions:
* Ronald Reagan. Onetime Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, who had pleaded guilty to campaign-finance violations, was pardoned in January 1989.
* George H. W. Bush. Caspar Weinberger, a key figure in the Iran-Contra scandal, was pardoned in December 1992.
* Bill Clinton. Marc Rich, a fugitive financier, was pardoned on Jan. 20, 2001. Also receiving pardons that day: kidnap victim turned bank robber Patty Hearst; Mr. Clinton's brother Roger Clinton, who had been convicted on drug charges; and Whitewater figure and Clinton friend Susan McDougal.
* George W. Bush. Two U.S. Border Patrol agents who had shot an unarmed drug smuggler in the buttocks had their sentences commuted in January 2009. Mr. Bush declined to issue a pardon for former top aide Scooter Libby, whose sentence he had earlier commuted. Mr. Trump then pardoned Mr. Libby in 2018.
* Barack Obama. Chelsea Manning, who provided classified documents to Wikileaks, had her sentence commuted in January 2017. Oscar López Rivera, a Puerto Rican activist and militant, also had his sentence commuted.

WASHINGTON -- Four federal prosecutors withdrew from the case against Roger Stone on Tuesday, with one resigning as an assistant U.S. attorney, as the Justice Department reversed itself and recommended less prison time for President Trump's longtime confidant.
The Justice Department's move to withdraw the recommendation it made on Monday to a U.S. judge and propose a more lenient one came hours after President Trump criticized in a tweet the original request that Mr. Stone spend more than seven years behind bars.
After the reversal became public, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Kravis, one of the government attorneys who prosecuted Mr. Stone, withdrew from the case and resigned from his post, according to a court filing. Three other prosecutors, Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys Aaron Zelinksy and Adam Jed and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Marando, also said in court filings that they were withdrawing from the case.
The fast-moving developments came one day after prosecutors asked for a seven-to-nine-year sentence following Mr. Stone's conviction last November for lying to Congress and witness tampering in connection with Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and any contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign.
It was an unusual reversal by the Justice Department, which typically hews to a set of legal guidelines when recommending punishments.
Mr. Trump had harshly criticized the initial request in a tweet and later did so at the White House. ""I thought the whole prosecution was ridiculous,"" he said in the Oval Office. ""I think it's a disgrace.""
Mr. Trump denied that he had intervened in the case and declined to discuss whether he would pardon Mr. Stone or commute his sentence.
Several leading Democrats said the developments suggested Mr. Trump was improperly influencing prosecutors' decisions. ""This is what we feared,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.). ""The message is now clear: If you commit a felony in support of the president's re-election, there will be protection there for you. It's really, really, really dangerous for the republic.""
Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said officials reached the decision to revise the recommendation on Monday night, before Mr. Trump's tweet. A senior Justice Department official played down the differences in the two main filings and said the agency wanted to clarify that it believed a sentence below the guidelines would still serve the interests of justice.
In a new sentencing memo filed in court Tuesday evening, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Crabb asked for ""a sentence of incarceration"" but said prosecutors would defer to the judge over the term. He wrote that the previous recommendation ""does not accurately reflect the Department of Justice's position on what would be a reasonable sentence in this matter.""
After the withdrawals, Mr. Crabb was the only prosecutor affiliated with the case.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said he would request that the Justice Department's Office of Inspector General investigate the matter.
Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the lead manager of the House's impeachment of Mr. Trump, said, ""It would be a blatant abuse of power if President Trump has in fact intervened to reverse the recommendations of career prosecutors at the Department of Justice.""
The ultimate decision on Mr. Stone's punishment rests in the hands of U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is scheduled to sentence Mr. Stone on Feb. 20. She has the discretion to ignore the government's sentencing recommendations and could ask the government to explain the change.
Mr. Stone was found guilty last year of misleading Congress about his efforts to make contact with the website WikiLeaks during the 2016 presidential campaign, and of threatening a witness who would contradict his testimony. While first-time offenders like Mr. Stone generally receive sentences of a few months for crimes that include lying to Congress, the witness-tampering count ratchets up Mr. Stone's potential punishment. It carries a 20-year maximum prison term.
Traditionally, presidents go to great lengths to avoid the appearance of interfering in law-enforcement matters. Charging and sentencing decisions are generally left to the line prosecutors and their supervisors.
The appropriate sentence for Mr. Stone has been a topic of some dispute within the Justice Department in recent days, according to people familiar with the matter. Supervisors and senior Justice Department officials had pushed for more lenient treatment for the 67-year-old Mr. Stone, the people said.
The reversal came just days after Attorney General William Barr named Timothy Shea, a close aide, to become the new U.S. attorney in Washington. Mr. Shea's name appeared on both main filings.
The White House on Tuesday withdrew the nomination of Jessie Liu -- Mr. Shea's predecessor as U.S. attorney who had overseen Mr. Stone's prosecution -- to a senior Treasury Department position, according to a former administration official familiar with the matter.
Reached for comment on the Justice Department's reversal, Bruce Rogow, Mr. Stone's defense attorney, told The Wall Street Journal that he was ""just watching and reading"" the news.
Mr. Stone's legal team called for a sentence of no incarceration, citing Mr. Stone's age and his lack of a criminal record.
The witness with whom Mr. Stone was convicted of tampering, New York comedian Randy Credico, asked Judge Jackson in a January letter not to send Mr. Stone to prison, writing such a sentence would be unnecessarily cruel.

President Trump said he hoped to clinch a trade agreement with Europe before the 2020 U.S. presidential election, promised overhauls of the World Trade Organization and signaled concern over calling witnesses at the Senate impeachment trial.
In a wide-ranging news conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday shortly before returning to the U.S., Mr. Trump sought to focus on the economy, ticking off a list of statistics that he said showed ""America's unprecedented economic successes.""
""We are the talk of the town, so to speak,"" the president said of his reception at the annual gathering of business executives and world leaders.
Share Your Thoughts
How would you assess President Trump's time at the World Economic Forum? Join the conversation below.
But the subject soon turned to the impeachment trial, which is dominating the attention of Washington and many in Mr. Trump's inner circle.
As House Democrats prepared to make their case in the Senate for the president's removal, Mr. Trump said that calling witnesses in the trial would be ""up to the Senate"" and said he could ""live either way."" He also said that he had national-security concerns about allowing
former national security adviser John Bolton and others to testify
.
""I would rather go the long way, I would rather interview Bolton, I would rather interview a lot of people. The problem with John is that it's a national security problem,"" Mr. Trump said. ""He knows some of my thoughts, he knows what I think about leaders.""
Mr. Bolton, whom Mr. Trump fired in September after nearly a year and a half on the job, has said he would testify if subpoenaed.
Mr. Trump also provided reasons for blocking possible testimony from acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former energy secretary Rick Perry. He said Mr. Mulvaney had ""expressed himself very well"" in a news interview and there wasn't ""much he can add."" And he cited national-security concerns about any testimony from Mr. Pompeo or Mr. Perry.
Following
a lengthy day of deliberation over trial rules
, the president praised his legal team, saying of White House counsel Pat Cipollone: ""I was very impressed with Pat, he had great emotion yesterday. Pat's a brilliant guy, but I've never seen that emotion.""
Mr. Trump criticized Rep. Jerrold Nadler, (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and one of the impeachment managers, calling him a ""sleazebag."" And he insisted he didn't know
Lev Parnas, an associate of Rudy Giuliani
. Mr. Parnas has in recent days sought to tie the president to efforts he made with Mr. Giuliani in Ukraine to launch investigations that could benefit the president politically.
""I don't know him other than he's sort of like a groupie, he shows up at fundraisers,"" said Mr. Trump, who went on to praise Mr. Giuliani.
Looking ahead, Mr. Trump said he didn't see a reason to delay his
Feb. 4 State of the Union address
.
Earlier in the news conference, Mr. Trump said he met with WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo to discuss the president's longstanding frustrations with the organization. ""Roberto and I have a tremendous relationship, and we're going to do something that I think will be very dramatic,"" he said without offering details.
The president said Mr. Azevêdo was planning a trip to Washington in the coming weeks to discuss overhauling the WTO. Joining Mr. Trump at the news conference, Mr. Azevêdo agreed with the president.
""It has to be updated; it has to be changed; it has to be reformed,"" Mr. Azevêdo said.
The president said he hoped that the U.S. would reach a new trade agreement with Europe, saying he had a deadline in his head for making a deal, but declined to publicly reveal it. ""I have a date in my mind and it's a fairly quick date,"" he said.
Mr. Trump had earlier expressed confidence that the U.S. would reach a new trade agreement with Europe, arguing that leaders in the region have ""no choice"" but to make a deal
amid the threat of auto tariffs

Updates From the World Economic Forum

In an interview with CNBC that aired Wednesday, Mr. Trump said he had a ""great talk"" with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum on Tuesday.
""I said, look, if we don't get something, I'm going to have to take action, and the action will be very high tariffs on their cars and other things that come into our country,"" he recalled telling Ms. von der Leyen during the interview.
But he added that investors shouldn't panic at the prospect of tariffs on European cars. ""They're going to make a deal, because they have to. They have to. They have no choice,"" he said.
Mr. Trump renewed his threat to hit Europe with auto tariffs
in an interview Tuesday
with The Wall Street Journal.
The president also said the 11 Americans being screened for traumatic brain injuries after the Iranian missile attack on two bases in Iraq last week weren't seriously hurt.
""I heard that they had headaches and a couple of other things,"" he said. ""But I can say, and I can report, it is not very serious.""
Wednesday's news conference wrapped up Mr. Trump's two-day appearance at the summit, where he gave a speech touting the U.S. economy and had private meetings with world leaders and CEOs.
Mr. Trump shared the limelight at the summit with Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist who has excoriated world leaders for not doing more to address climate change.
""Our house is still on fire,"" she told the audience during her remarks. ""Your inaction is fueling the flames by the hour.""
Mr. Trump, in his speech shortly before Ms. Thunberg, called on attendees to ""reject the perennial prophets of doom and their predictions of the apocalypse.""
He echoed that sentiment during his news conference, encouraging Ms. Thunberg, who he noted
beat him out as Time magazine's person of the year
, to focus on pollution from other countries, not the U.S. ""I think that some people, they've put it at a level that's unrealistic, to the point that you can't live your life,"" he said of climate activists.
The president met with several dozen business executives Wednesday morning for a closed-door breakfast. Mr. Trump arrived late to the event. During his remarks to the executives, he touted the economy, trumpeting low unemployment and wage gains. He pointed to tax cuts, deregulation and the trade deal as things he had delivered to the corporate sector, according to a person familiar with the meeting. The president also told the executives that his polling numbers looked better than ever.
As he heads back to Washington, Mr. Trump mused about the possibility of appearing at his own impeachment trial. ""I'd love to go, wouldn't that be great,"" he said. ""I'd sort of love to sit in the front row and stare at their corrupt faces.""
But he indicated his legal team may have other ideas, acknowledging: ""I think they might have a problem.""

WASHINGTON—Taking a victory lap a day after
he was acquitted
in the Senate impeachment trial, President Trump said he ""went through hell"" during what he deemed a politically driven investigation and called top Democrats ""very evil and sick people"" for seeking his removal from office.
Before an audience of aides and Republican allies, Mr. Trump offered freewheeling remarks from the East Room of the White House on Thursday. Speaking for just over an hour, he characterized the event as a celebration, while taking swings at political rivals who he alleged have been targeting him since he took office.
""We've been going through this now for over three years. It was evil, it was corrupt, it was dirty cops, it was leakers and liars, and this should never, ever happen to another president, ever,"" Mr. Trump said.
Holding up a copy of a newspaper with the headline ""Trump Acquitted,"" he quipped: ""It's the only good headline I've had in the Washington Post.""
He reiterated his stance that he did nothing improper regarding Ukraine, and called former special counsel
Robert Mueller's earlier probe
into possible ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia ""all bullshit.""
The remarks came one day after the Republican-led Senate acquitted Mr. Trump on
two articles of impeachment
stemming from his efforts to
press Ukraine
to announce investigations that would benefit him politically in this year's election, including a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate.
Mr. Trump's comments about Democratic leaders also came on the heels of his
State of the Union speech
on Tuesday night, when he didn't shake the hand offered by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), and she ripped up her copy of his address at its conclusion.
""He is impeached forever, no matter what he says or the headlines he wanted to carry around,"" Mrs. Pelosi said in remarks to reporters on Thursday. She added that Mr. Trump was ""never getting rid of that scar.""
Mrs. Pelosi also defended tearing up the speech, calling the address ""a manifesto of mistruths"" and her action necessary to ""get the attention of the American people.""

President's Second-Term Agenda Still on the Drawing Board

The combative comments from Mr. Trump on Thursday and the vigorous response from Mrs. Pelosi made clear that the
rancorous political climate
between Democrats and Republicans will continue even with impeachment over.
Republicans cheered Mr. Trump's acquittal in the Senate and have called his impeachment part of a three-year effort to delegitimize the 2016 election and remove the president from office nine months before Democrats face him again at the ballot box.
Democrats said Mr. Trump's acquittal amounted to a defeat for the institution of Congress, and they warned that leaving Mr. Trump in office would free him to try to cheat again in this year's election.
In his White House event, the mood was triumphant, with guests hugging and slapping each other on the back. The crowd gave Mr. Trump more than a half-dozen standing ovations. He thanked various supporters in the room by name, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). Mr. Trump also thanked his Senate impeachment legal team.
He didn't mention personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, whose efforts in Ukraine were at the center of the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Giuliani wasn't in attendance.
Mr. Trump also continued his criticism of Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah), who was the
lone Republican to vote to convict
the president on the first article of impeachment. Without naming him, Mr. Trump said there were ""some that used religion as a crutch"" and called him a failed presidential candidate.
Mr. Romney, the 2012 GOP candidate against President Obama, said Wednesday that he was a very religious person and reached an ""inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded"" that he vote to convict Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump took two tacks toward Democrats in his White House speech. He called for bipartisanship, citing infrastructure and drug prices as areas of common interest. If Republicans and Democrats work together, ""what we can do is incredible,"" he said.
But he also continued to question the goodwill of Democrats. Earlier, in remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast, Mr. Trump appeared to reference Mrs. Pelosi, saying he doesn't like ""people who say, 'I pray for you,' when they know that's not so.""
Mrs. Pelosi, who was seated at a long table near the lectern at the breakfast, clapped as he entered the room. Later, she told reporters that she did pray for Mr. Trump, while criticizing his actions in office as ""so off the track of our Constitution, our values, our country.""
Mr. Trump's appearance at the breakfast marked the fourth year he has addressed the annual gathering, which is hosted by members of Congress and has been running since 1953. Presidents of both parties traditionally attend the event. Mr. Trump enjoys
strong support from evangelical Christians
, who were a key piece of his winning 2016 coalition.
Before Mr. Trump spoke at the breakfast, there was a keynote address from Arthur Brooks, former president of the American Enterprise Institute, who urged the audience to rise above the country's divided political climate.
Mr. Trump, known for his combative style, acknowledged the message when he took the lectern, but said: ""Arthur, I don't know if I agree with you.""

WASHINGTON—The Republican-led Senate acquitted President Trump of charges stemming from his efforts to
press Ukraine to announce investigations
that would benefit him politically, bringing to a close a bruising four-month battle fought almost entirely along party lines.
The
third presidential impeachment in U.S. history
intensified the nation's sharp divide over Mr. Trump and previewed many of the arguments likely to be heard ahead of the election this fall. During the trial, Democrats said the Republican president was trying to cheat in the coming election by trying to damage a potential opponent. Republicans said that Democrats were improperly inflating missteps into impeachable offenses and trying to overturn the results of the 2016 election.
The Senate vote to acquit marked a clear victory for the president, underscoring his primacy in the GOP and the end to a process that had hung over the past several months of his presidency. But while Mr. Trump had hoped for a forceful display of unity from Republicans in defense of his actions, he got something less: GOP senators strongly supported his acquittal, but several said the Democrats had proven that he acted improperly—though not in a manner deserving of impeachment—regarding Ukraine.
Mr. Trump was also denied a unanimous not guilty verdict from Republican senators when
Mitt Romney of Utah voted to convict
on the first article of impeachment.
Given the GOP's 53-47 majority in the Senate and the Constitution's requirement that two-thirds of the Senate is required to convict, Mr. Trump's chance of acquittal was always strong. Mr. Trump now becomes the first president to run for re-election after having been impeached.
Mr. Trump and his campaign sought throughout the process to turn impeachment to his political advantage, frequently using his attacks on the investigation in fundraising emails.
On the first article of impeachment, abuse of power, all 47 Democratic-aligned senators and Mr. Romney voted to convict, falling short of the 67 needed to remove the president from office. On the obstruction of Congress article, the vote also failed, with all Democrats and no Republicans finding the president guilty.
The senators read their votes aloud from their desks, and Chief Justice John Roberts announced the outcome. ""Donald John Trump, president of the United States…is hereby acquitted,"" he said.
Mr. Trump, in a tweet after the vote, declared ""our Country's VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax"" and wrote that he would make a public statement about his acquittal on Thursday.
Republicans' arguments in favor of acquittal split broadly into two camps. Some argued that House impeachment managers' case was half-baked and that they should have gone to court to pursue the testimony of further witnesses who had been told by the White House not to cooperate. Others in the party said House Democrats had proved their case but that the president's conduct wasn't impeachable.
The impeachment probe grew out of a phone call last summer in which Mr. Trump asked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to announce an investigation into Joe Biden, a top Democratic presidential contender, while holding up congressionally approved aid to the country. Mr. Trump has defended the call as ""perfect"" and has said he did nothing wrong regarding Ukraine. The aid was later released after bipartisan outcry from lawmakers.
The most dramatic moment of the day came two hours before the acquittal vote, when Mr. Romney said in a floor speech that he had decided to vote to convict the president on the first article. ""The president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust,"" he said.
Mr. Romney was the first senator in U.S. history to vote to convict a president of his own party. In the impeachment trials of Democratic presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, no Democratic senators voted to convict.
The White House, which as late as Wednesday morning had been predicting that all Republican senators would vote to acquit the president, was caught off-guard by Mr. Romney's announcement, aides said.
Immediately after Mr. Romney announced his vote, White House aides began planning to intensify attacks on the Utah senator. Later that evening, Mr. Trump tweeted a video accusing Mr. Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, of ""posing as a Republican"" and trying to ""infiltrate"" the Trump administration.
The White House had also held out hope that a handful of Democrats would side with Republicans and vote to acquit the president, but Democrats remained unified.
Democrats said the acquittal amounted to a defeat for the institution of Congress, and they warned that leaving Mr. Trump in office would make him free to abuse power again.
""The verdict of this kangaroo court will be meaningless,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, on Wednesday. ""You cannot be on the side of this president and be on the side of truth.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you think President Trump's acquittal will affect his bid for 2020, if at all? Join the conversation below.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Democrats used impeachment for political goals. ""We should all agree that this is the precisely the type of recklessness that the Senate was created to stop,"" he said on the floor. ""The response to losing one election cannot be to attack the office of the presidency.""
In a news conference later in the day, Mr. McConnell declined to answer questions about whether he found the president's conduct appropriate.
In the months after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) opened the inquiry in September, the Democratic-led House called 17 witnesses and hundreds of documents to build its case, formally
impeaching the president in December
. A month later, it handed the articles over to the Senate, which heard arguments from House impeachment managers and Mr. Trump's defense team but rejected calling witnesses it said the House should have pursued.
The tightly choreographed Senate trial was upended late last month by new revelations from former national security adviser John Bolton about the president's pressure campaign on Ukraine. The former official's
revelations in a yet-unpublished memoir
briefly raised the possibility a sufficient number of Republicans would join with Democrats to vote in favor of new witness testimony. But Republicans ultimately voted nearly in unison to oppose hearing from Mr. Bolton and other witnesses.
""Unless there's some bipartisan consensus of treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors, as there was in the Nixon case, then there shouldn't be an impeachment,"" Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.) said on Tuesday.
While a majority of voters in a recent
Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll
said they believed Mr. Trump abused his power and obstructed Congress, some 49% of respondents said he should be allowed to finish his term, compared with 46% who said he should be removed.
Impeachment also made little impact on Mr. Trump's job-approval rating, which stood at 46% in the January poll—in line with his rating throughout his presidency.
Democrats made clear the trial settled nothing for them, with members of House leadership saying they would likely continue to investigate. A top House Democrat, Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York, said Wednesday the House would ""likely"" subpoena Mr. Bolton and continue the investigation. Mr. Bolton's spokeswoman declined to comment on whether he would comply with any subpoena.
Despite his public attacks on the impeachment process, Mr. Trump stayed—at Mr. McConnell's urging—largely on the sidelines of Republican efforts to rally lawmakers against voting for new witnesses and approached his own legal team with a fairly light touch.
The president's sole recommendation to his team came after the defense's first day of arguments, an administration official said. After his lawyers argued for two hours, he called with a request: put Pam Bondi on TV more. He told the team he wanted Ms. Bondi, the former Florida attorney general who joined the White House last fall as an adviser on impeachment, to continue arguing his case on TV in the evenings.
Instead, Mr. Trump focused his attention elsewhere. As the trial unfolded last week, White House officials huddled with GOP House members and their aides in a small room in the vice president's office in the Capitol that one GOP aide described as ""mission control."" The president, the aide said, insisted advisers not call it a ""war room,"" which he said wrongly suggested Republicans were embattled and that impeachment was an actual crisis.

President Trump said late Friday that he is replacing Mick Mulvaney, his acting chief of staff of 14 months, with Rep. Mark Meadows, a longtime ally and frequent defender of his on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Meadows will be Mr. Trump's fourth chief of staff.
""I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one,"" Mr. Trump tweeted from his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, on Friday. He thanked Mr. Mulvaney ""for having served the administration so well,"" and said Mr. Mulvaney would become U.S. special envoy for Northern Ireland.
Mr. Meadows (R., N.C.), a confidant of the president's going back to the 2016 campaign, has long been expected to join the White House in some capacity.
Mr. Mulvaney didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a statement, Mr. Meadows said, ""It's an honor to be selected by President Trump to serve alongside him and his team.""
""In particular, I want to recognize my friend Mick Mulvaney,"" he said, praising Mr. Mulvaney's leadership.
After serving in the House since 2013, Mr. Meadows said in December that he
wouldn't seek re-election
. Around the same time, he discussed with the president a role that would bring him inside the White House, people familiar with the talks said. At the time, the discussions focused on a senior adviser-type role in which Mr. Meadows would consult on a range of issues.
Mr. Trump had spoken with Mr. Mulvaney for the past several days about leaving the administration, one senior official said.
White House officials said the move wasn't a surprise, but the timing was unexpected on Friday night, and they struggled to explain the reason for the change. ""Who knows?"" one senior official said. Mr. Trump discussed the move at a private fundraiser Friday night, speaking positively about both men and setting high expectations for Mr. Meadows, according to a person who attended the event.
Several White House aides described the move as part of Mr. Trump's campaign preparation. Mr. Meadows gives the president a confidant at his side heading into re-election.
One Republican close to the White House said Mr. Meadows had a deal in place for weeks to become staff chief, but was waiting for the president to announce it. ""We all sort of knew…but you never know til you know,"" said a GOP aide who said the deal had been seriously discussed during the past week.
During the
Senate impeachment trial
, White House officials huddled with GOP House members and their aides in a small room in the vice president's office in the Capitol. There, some lawmakers jokingly referred to Mr. Meadows as the chief of staff. Mr. Mulvaney wasn't in the room.
Mr. Meadows, a onetime real-estate developer and sandwich-shop owner, was one of the founders of the
House Freedom Caucus
, which rose to prominence as a rebellious band of about three dozen Republican lawmakers willing to buck their party establishment to tank legislation—or even topple House speakers—they deemed insufficiently conservative.
Mr. Meadows was a thorn in the president's side in 2017, when he opposed the president's effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. In subsequent White House meetings, he forged a bond with Mr. Trump and revived the effort to repeal the health-care law in the House. It later
failed in the Senate
. He also served as a sounding board for the president and his conduit to the Freedom Caucus.
In recent months, Mr. Meadows became part of Mr. Trump's de facto defense team during the impeachment investigation on Capitol Hill and the trial, working in the Senate side of the Capitol and appearing on media to ferociously defend the president.
Mr. Mulvaney, who served as the White House budget director, was appointed
acting chief of staff
in December 2018. He kept the ""acting"" title—which Mr. Meadows won't have—throughout his 14-month tenure.
The pairing of Messrs. Trump and Mulvaney was as hasty as it was odd. Mr. Mulvaney was only tapped for the job after it was turned down by Nick Ayers, the vice president's former staff chief, and former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. And the combination of the New York real-estate magnate and a devoted Catholic from South Carolina who described Mr. Trump as ""a terrible human being"" during the 2016 election.
Mr. Mulvaney was also surprised by Mr. Trump's view of the job. Aides said Mr. Mulvaney couldn't be scheduled for any meetings once the president was in the Oval Office, usually around lunch time, because Mr. Trump would constantly call him into the office.
Mr. Mulvaney was Mr. Trump's first budget adviser, and was always viewed that way by the president, aides said. As staff chief, Mr. Mulvaney ceded his budget duties to Russ Vought, the acting Office of Management and Budget director. Over time, Mr. Trump brought questions to Mr. Vought, which reduced the need for Mr. Mulvaney in the Oval Office, one aide said.
But an administration official said Mr. Mulvaney was ""very pleased"" with the change, noting he was close with Mr. Meadows going back to their time on the Freedom Caucus.
A senior White House official also said discussions had been under way with Mr. Mulvaney and the president for some time about the Northern Ireland envoy role. The official said Mr. Mulvaney was fine with the change, saying he felt he had a ""good run.""
Unlike his predecessor, John Kelly, who as chief of staff strove to tighten access to the president and bring order to the White House, Mr. Mulvaney was content to ""let Trump be Trump."" As a result, he garnered fewer enemies inside the White House for much of his tenure. But he clashed with the White House Counsel's Office during the impeachment process, aides said, and often appeared not to be involved in some major decisions.
By the end of his tenure, his relationship with Mr. Trump appeared to be nonexistent. On the president's trip to India last month, Mr. Mulvaney stayed in Washington because, White House officials said, he had a cold. Mr. Trump, asked about Mr. Mulvaney late last month, told reporters: ""Yeah. Sure. He's here now. Sure. No problem.""
But the two remain on relatively good terms, one senior adviser said, pointing out that Mr. Mulvaney, unlike his two predecessors, had received another post.
During the height of the impeachment investigation, Mr. Mulvaney held a widely panned briefing in which he linked Mr. Trump's decision to hold up aid to Ukraine to his desire for Kyiv to probe a Democratic National Committee server—an allegation that Democrats had been making for weeks and that went to the heart of the investigation. Hours later, he issued a statement contradicting his own remarks.

WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court denied requests to quickly decide the fate of the Affordable Care Act, a move that is likely to make the health-care law play less of a role in the 2020 election.
A group of 20 Democratic-led states and the U.S. House had asked the court to fast-track their appeals so that the latest legal battle over the Obama-era law could be resolved by the end of June.
The justices denied those requests on Tuesday in a one-sentence order with no dissents noted. The move likely means that any court consideration of the ACA won't happen until the fall at the earliest, with any decision likely coming after Election Day.
The court has twice upheld the ACA. Had the court issued another ruling this summer, it could have placed the issue at the center of the election and put pressure on President Trump and other Republicans, no matter the outcome.
The latest case stems from a lawsuit brought by Republican-led states and backed by the Trump administration that challenged the law's insurance mandate. Mr. Trump has pledged to repeal the ACA and has long promised to release his own health plan.
Last week, Mr. Trump claimed he had saved coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, but his Justice Department has argued for the invalidation of that provision in the current litigation.
The Supreme Court's move on Tuesday comes after a New Orleans-based federal appeals court ruled last month that a central feature of the ACA was unconstitutional. That part of the law required most individuals to carry health insurance or pay a penalty. The appeals court declined to say whether any, some or all other parts of the law remain enforceable without the mandate, leaving the health-policy regime in legal limbo.
The law continues to remain in effect during the litigation, which began after a GOP-controlled Congress reduced the penalty under the insurance mandate to $0. The GOP-led states argued the elimination of the tax rendered the mandate unconstitutional.
The appeals court has ordered a judge in Texas to reconsider what parts of the sprawling health law can remain in place, but the Democratic-led states and House were seeking to have the Supreme Court go ahead and rule that the entire law remains valid.
The timing of the appeals court ruling, after more than five months of deliberations, put the law's defenders in a bind, because it made it difficult to squeeze the case onto the Supreme Court's calendar, which likely filled up last week.
The justices already have an unusually long list of blockbuster cases to decide before the end of June, including ones on abortion, gay rights, gun rights and immigration.
The Trump administration argued against expedited Supreme Court consideration of the case, saying in a court brief that there were no exigencies that required it.
Democratic presidential candidates including Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, former Vice President Joe Biden and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg have all criticized President Trump as a threat to health coverage and the ACA, and a number have cited the administration's support for the lawsuit as evidence.
Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, said on Tuesday: ""While radical Democrats propose plans that would destroy the health insurance of millions of Americans, President Trump continues to work to improve health care more broadly.""
About half of Americans now approve of the ACA, according to Gallup, up slightly from 48% in fall of 2018.
The court's decision leaves uncertainty hanging over health care. Hospital groups have said the lack of clarity on the long-term status of the ACA is complicating decisions on investments.

WASHINGTON—President Trump's re-election campaign said Thursday that its war chest stood at more than $100 million headed into the 2020 election year, after raising $46 million in the final three months of 2019.
Mr. Trump faces no significant Republican challenger, putting him at a campaign finance advantage over the many Democrats vying for their party's nomination in a highly competitive and costly primary. Although Mr. Trump is expected to have raised more than any single Democrat last quarter, together those candidates will at least double his haul but are expected to have much less cash on hand.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Where do you expect President Trump's campaign to focus its resources? Where would you like to see them allocated? Join the conversation below.
Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale said that this was the president's biggest fundraising quarter during the 2020 campaign cycle, calling him ""an unstoppable juggernaut."" Over the full year, the president's campaign raised a total of $143 million and had $102.7 million in the bank at the end of 2019.
Presidential campaigns must report fourth-quarter fundraising information to the Federal Election Commission by Jan. 31. Mr. Trump's fundraising tops the numbers that have been announced by Democratic presidential hopefuls.
Sen. Bernie Sanders, of Vermont,
brought in $34.5 million
in the final quarter of the year, according to his campaign, and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said he
raised $24.7 million
. Former Vice President Joe Biden said his campaign raised $22.7 million. None of the candidates released updated cash on hand numbers. Some candidates haven't released any numbers yet.
The president also works closely with the Republican National Committee to raise money, and the figures reported by the Trump campaign don't include the RNC's latest finances.
Mr. Trump gave himself an advantage by kicking off his re-election the day he was inaugurated. While recent presidents typically have waited until their third year in office to return to the campaign trail, Mr. Trump
immediately arranged to fundraise
for re-election and never stopped holding the large political rallies that helped him win office in 2016.
Sitting presidents almost always enjoy strong fundraising for re-election. Former President Barack Obama raised about $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, and former President George W. Bush raised $47.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Mr. Bush's campaign had almost $100 million in available cash at the start of his re-election year, the FEC reports show.
An advantage of incumbency is that Mr. Trump has been able to solicit maximum $360,600 donations from individuals, circumventing the far lower $2,800-per-donor cap now in place for the Democratic hopefuls. Those large checks are spread among Mr. Trump's fundraising partners, the RNC and state-level Republican parties. The eventual Democratic nominee also will be able to create a bigger-ticket fundraising program, but Mr. Trump has been benefiting from his arrangement for almost three years already.

WASHINGTON—The
coronavirus crisis
is rapidly changing President Trump's re-election strategy, forcing him into the position of leading the nation through a sprawling, complex emergency while undermining his greatest asset: a strong economy.
Mr. Trump this week has taken steps to demonstrate more command, appearing at daily news conferences and taking a solemn outlook, while his campaign weighs how to contend with battered financial markets and rising unemployment.
""People are going to judge him in this moment—and this moment is going to last for a while,"" said Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist not involved in the campaign. ""In the beginning he downplayed it too much and that hurt his credibility, but there is a lot of time to go now where he can compensate.""
That is forefront in the thinking of Mr. Trump's campaign advisers. The virus may ease amid extraordinary steps affecting all aspects of everyday life, and the campaign could resume its normal rhythms before Election Day. The situation, though, just as well as could worsen.
Mr. Trump's campaign is banking on the economy bouncing back ahead of the crucial several months before November when voters are paying the most attention, advisers say. It has begun to formulate an argument that Mr. Trump's policies since taking office fueled the economy to new heights, and that he is best equipped to build it up a second time if necessary.
""We will point out that it is under the present policies that it was so vibrant and those policies are still in place,"" campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said. ""The stock market will rebound, and the economy will still be in solid shape.""
This week the main super PAC supporting Mr. Trump's re-election held discussions on possible ads highlighting steps the president has taken to combat the virus, including putting travel restrictions on China, according to a person familiar with the talks.
In recent days Mr. Trump has referred to the ""Chinese virus,"" a term that has been criticized for its racist connotations. His campaign on Wednesday moved to portray him as taking tough actions against a world rival and sought to draw a contrast with Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who is closing in on the Democratic presidential nomination.
The former vice president's campaign observed that the president has praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for his handling of the emergency. Of the Trump campaign's email, which accused Mr. Biden of ""incompetence and misinformation,"" Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said, ""This is projection, pure and simple—a classic Trump campaign move.""
For now, campaign mechanics—including the rallies that energize Mr. Trump as much as his supporters—are in the background or on hold and the burden largely rests on the president using the White House stage to make his case. His discipline at news conferences this week has pleased advisers, though they privately acknowledge anything can change.
""I think the base will hold with him no matter, but if he does dumb stuff, he won't be able to build on his reach to voters,"" said one adviser.
""Americans typically rally around their president in times of national crisis, and this should be to Donald Trump's benefit,"" said Jeff Horwitt, a Democratic pollster who partners with Republicans on surveys for The Wall Street Journal. ""But Donald Trump is not a typical president. While he has a chance to seize the moment, unite the country and provide presidential leadership, over the past three years he has yet to prove that he is capable of doing so.""
Only a short time ago Mr. Trump was feeling especially confident. He emerged from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and then withstood impeachment. His campaign was running smoothly.
Now those gains are in jeopardy. A Gallup poll released Tuesday showed Mr. Trump's
approval rating was down to 44%
, slipping 5 percentage points and back to pre-impeachment levels. Among independent voters, his approval was down 7 percentage points.
""There is no question that Covid-19 and Trump's disastrous response will be a part of the political conversation for the rest of this campaign,"" said Josh Schwerin, spokesman for Priorities USA, the leading Democratic super PAC that has put its support behind Mr. Biden. Another outside group, Pacronym, said it was prepared to spend up to $5 million on coronavirus ads, and some already on Facebook criticize the administration's slowness to get testing kits to states.
The Trump campaign's tone has changed in the past week, but not its intensity. It has shifted to online training of volunteers who will be crucial to driving out voters and is considering online events featuring surrogates.
The campaign continues to seek donations from supporters daily, through emails, text messages and on social media. The pitches, however, are being modified to match the unity that White House officials are asking of Americans. Campaign officials expect to pause, at least temporarily, the ""fake news"" attacks and its most biting criticism of Democrats, which also tend to bring in the most money. (Mr. Trump himself, however, hasn't stopped leveling such attacks on Twitter.)
An email Wednesday asked surrogates to focus on what the campaign and the White House describe as unprecedented actions taken by the president. One talking point suggests focusing on the power that states now have to authorize laboratories to develop their own coronavirus tests, but doesn't acknowledge that was a response to the dire shortage of tests for the fast-moving virus.
As the crisis was first unfolding, Mr. Trump played it down, suggesting Democrats and the media were hyping the situation. He compared coronavirus to the seasonal flu, and said in January ""we have it totally under control."" Mr. Trump's tone has shifted in recent days. But when asked last week about the virus, only 33% of Mr. Trump's strongest supporters said they believed the worst was yet to come with the virus, compared with 60% of all Americans who said the same, according to a Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.
On Wednesday, the campaign's talking points urged surrogates to tell supporters to listen to local and state authorities. The only mention of Mr. Biden: Noting that his
sweep of primary contests
on Tuesday would put pressure on Sen. Bernie Sanders to give up his campaign.
Still, campaign officials and advisers cautioned that the tactics are evolving.
While the campaign is unlikely to run any new ads focused on the economy, as officials were considering earlier this month, some believe those spots could be airing again by the fall. Mr. Trump and his team have careened from one political crisis to the next since the 2016 election, and there has been little change in his approval rating since he took office.
""Look, if in 45 days it looks like everything is going back to normal,"" one adviser said, ""then everything is going to go back to where it was.""

MIAMI—President Trump launched an effort to expand the conservative Christian support that helped power him to the White House from a Miami megachurch, making an appeal to Hispanic evangelicals.
At King Jesus International Ministry, Mr. Trump unveiled an ""Evangelicals for Trump"" coalition Friday. The event had the hallmarks of a campaign rally, packed with attendees in Trump garb, but also opened with religious music and prayer. Evangelical leaders in attendance included Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, and Paula White, who works for the White House as an adviser to the Faith and Opportunity Initiative, as well as King Jesus Ministry's pastor, Guillermo Maldonado.
""In 2016, evangelical Christians helped us...they went out and they worked so hard and they produced numbers like they never produced before,"" Mr. Trump said. ""We're going to blow those numbers away in 2020.""
Campaign spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said the coalition aims to sign up thousands of members and would seek to ""maintain the extraordinary support of the evangelical community but also to expand it.""
She added: ""We definitely see we can make inroads with black and Hispanic evangelicals,"" arguing that the president's record on religious issues would be appealing to those voters.
At the event, Mr. Trump acknowledged ""so many extraordinary Hispanic and African-American faith leaders who are lifting our nation to incredible new heights.""
A key piece of the president's winning 2016 coalition, evangelical Christians still overwhelmingly back Mr. Trump, applauding his efforts to restrict abortion access and appoint conservative judges, while largely looking past the combative style that recent polling showed was
working against him with some voters
. Since taking office, the president has stayed close to evangelical leaders, regularly meeting with pastors and setting up an initiative that aims to give religious groups more influence on policy.
""I may not be perfect but I get things done,"" joked Mr. Trump. He stressed his record on judges and abortion as well as recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and rolling back restrictions on political activity by houses of worship. He also pledged to soon take ""action to safeguard students and teachers' First Amendment rights to pray in our schools.""
Mr. Trump's approval rating in the December poll by The Wall Street Journal and NBC News was 34% among Hispanics, with 64% disapproving. That compared with 44% approval and 54% disapproval among adults overall. The poll also found Hispanic registered voters were among the groups most up for grabs in the coming election, with one-quarter saying their decision on whether to vote for or against Mr. Trump would depend on who the Democrats nominate.
At the event, Mr. Trump also stressed low unemployment numbers and a criminal-justice overhaul, as he sought to court minority voters. He also repeatedly targeted Democrats, saying his opponents ""want to shut out God from the public square.""
The Florida location Friday provided Mr. Trump the opportunity to target a segment of Hispanic voters in a battleground state. While the majority of evangelicals are white, Hispanics represent 11% and 6% are black, according to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center.
Thomas Kidd, a professor at Baylor University and the author of ""Who Is an Evangelical?: The History of a Movement in Crisis,"" said that white evangelicals tend to vote Republican and black evangelicals favor Democrats, but Latino evangelicals are more divided politically.
""I think in general that Latino evangelicals are the most interesting group of evangelicals politically because their allegiances are up for grabs,"" he said.
Ms. McEnany said the campaign would focus on both groups, arguing that ""if you are in the faith community, President Trump has made good on his promises.""
The rollout comes just weeks after Christianity Today, an evangelical magazine, published an editorial criticizing Mr. Trump and
calling for his removal from office
. Mr. Trump and many of his evangelical allies reacted with fury, dismissing the article as an isolated voice of dissent, but it served as a reminder that the president's support in the community has at least a few cracks.
The magazine's president, Timothy Dalrymple, said in a statement that the editorial wasn't written in a ""calculated way,"" but ""according to conscience"" and noted that subscriptions have risen overall since its publication on Dec. 19.
""Clearly there's a large pool of evangelicals who are deeply uncomfortable with the evangelical embrace of the president,"" said Mr. Dalrymple, who said the magazine saw 3,000 cancellations and a little over 11,000 new subscriptions.
A new poll from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed that about 8 in 10 white evangelicals approve of the president's job performance. The survey showed that the group didn't back all of his policy moves, with a majority opposed to a policy of
separating migrant families that cross into the U.S. illegally
.

Mr. Trump also drew criticism from some evangelical leaders recently when he sought to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, with pastors expressing concern about Christian minorities in the region.
Mr. Trump's campaign announced the Friday event soon after the Christianity Today editorial was published, but Ms. McEnany said that the timing wasn't related. This is the latest coalition group announced by the campaign, which has already unveiled efforts to
target African-Americans
,
Latinos
and women. The Latino group features several pastors.
Rev. Maldonado, who has visited the White House several times, will serve on the Evangelicals for Trump Coalition in a personal capacity, according to a statement on the church's website. The statement also said the church is nonpartisan and that the event shouldn't be viewed as an endorsement of Mr. Trump.
Rev. Samuel Rodriguez, president of the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference, argued there was room for Mr. Trump to expand his evangelical support.
""He hasn't hit the ceiling, he hasn't hit the lid. There is room. There is room not just because of the policies, but because of the alternatives,"" said Mr. Rodriguez, who advises Mr. Trump, as he did former Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush. Of the kickoff event, he said: ""Florida, Latino and evangelical, check mark, check mark, check mark.""

WASHINGTON -- Senators wavering on calling new witnesses in President Trump's impeachment trial hinted Wednesday at the factors they were considering, as Republican leaders tried to persuade lawmakers to bring the proceedings to a close later this week without fresh testimony.
After several days of opening arguments by each side that offered little give-and-take, Wednesday's session brought an opportunity for senators to direct questions at Mr. Trump's legal team and Democratic House members, who are serving as prosecutors in the trial. Mr. Trump's lawyers portrayed Democrats' case for impeachment as politically motivated and well short of the bar needed to remove a president from office. The Democratic lawmakers said they were trying to block Mr. Trump from cheating to win this year's election and argued that Republican senators were holding Mr. Trump to an unusually low standard.
Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was pushing Republicans to defeat a vote to bring in new witnesses and information, while Democrats argued that a fair trial would include additional evidence, including testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton. While Mr. McConnell (R., Ky.) had said a day earlier that he didn't yet have the votes to block more witnesses, Republican leaders suggested Wednesday they would eventually get there. Democratic leaders in the Senate said procuring additional testimony would be an uphill battle. The Senate is expected to vote Friday on whether to call for witnesses.
In one notable exchange, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- two Republican senators who have said they are debating siding with Democrats on calling new witnesses -- asked a question that is central to the impeachment case: whether the White House had any record of Mr. Trump's trying to end corruption in Ukraine before former Vice President Joe Biden entered the Democratic presidential race last spring. The president has said an overall concern with Ukraine corruption was behind his call to announce an investigation of Mr. Biden while he was freezing nearly $400 million in aid to the country.
In response to the two senators' questions, which were read aloud by Chief Justice John Roberts, deputy White House counsel Pat Philbin said he had no such record of a previous concern with corruption by Mr. Trump. But he said the Republican president had developed concerns about Mr. Biden and his son Hunter after his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, had been pushing for Ukraine to investigate the former vice president in January 2019. Mr. Biden started his campaign in April. ""The president . . . gets information from Rudy Giuliani,"" Mr. Philbin said.
Mr. Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart in July to investigate the elder Mr. Biden's actions in Ukraine as vice president while his son served on the board of a gas company there.
Mr. Bolton in a forthcoming book wrote that the president told him in August that he was holding up the aid until Ukraine agreed to the investigations he was seeking. The aid to Ukraine was released in September amid a bipartisan uproar in Congress.
Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the chamber's Democratic leader, asked the House lawmakers, who are essentially acting as prosecutors in the trial, if there could be a fair trial without calling Mr. Bolton.
""The short answer to that question is no,"" Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, responded. He told lawmakers not to wait for the book, which is due to be published in March.
In tweets Wednesday, Mr. Trump, who has denied making any connection between Ukraine aid and investigating the Bidens, urged Republicans to reject calling witnesses and called Mr. Bolton's yet unpublished book ""nasty & untrue."" The White House's National Security Council said Wednesday that it told Mr. Bolton's lawyer last week that Mr. Bolton's manuscript contained ""significant amounts"" of classified information and couldn't be published in its current form.
In response, Chuck Cooper, Mr. Bolton's lawyer, said he sought immediate guidance last week on whether the NSC deemed classified any of the material in the chapter related to Ukraine, though he said he didn't believe that information ""could reasonably be considered classified."" Mr. Cooper said he didn't get a response to his email.
Sens. Collins, Murkowski and Mitt Romney (R., Utah), another juror who has said he is open to new testimony, asked the president's lawyers how the Senate should view a situation in which Mr. Trump might have more than one reason to withhold aid from Ukraine.
""All elected officials, to some extent, have in mind how their conduct, how their decisions, their policy decisions, will affect the next election,"" Mr. Philbin replied. He said that ""can't be a basis for removing a president from office.""
In a departure from what the Trump team has previously argued, Alan Dershowitz offered a new theory: that because Mr. Trump believes his re-election is in the public interest, even if he had political motivations in pressing Ukraine to open an investigation into the Bidens, it wouldn't be impeachable.
""Every public official that I know believes that his election is in the public interest,"" Mr. Dershowitz said.
Mr. Schiff shot back that if President Obama, a Democrat, had asked Russia to investigate Mr. Romney, his 2012 opponent, the Senate would have found it impeachable. ""All quid pro quos are fine, it's carte blanche? Is that really what we're prepared to say?"" Mr. Schiff said.
The question-and-answer portion of the trial will continue on Thursday.
Republican leaders on Wednesday worked to dissuade Republicans from joining Democrats on seeking subpoenas for Mr. Bolton or others who may have close knowledge of the Ukraine pressure campaign. Mr. McConnell met Wednesday morning with Ms. Murkowski, who had earlier said that she was curious about what Mr. Bolton had to say. After the meeting, Ms. Murkowski declined to discuss witnesses or her meeting.
Republicans sought to project confidence on Wednesday. ""I'm optimistic,"" Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the Republican whip, said of defeating the motion to bring in new witnesses.
The House last fall had sought Mr. Bolton's testimony but declined to subpoena him because of Democrats' wish to move quickly and not get bogged down in court fights.

WASHINGTON—House managers said President Trump was a threat to American democracy, while his defense team countered that Democrats were trying to undermine two elections, in their final arguments in his Senate
impeachment trial
on Monday.
With Democrats set to fall well short of the two-thirds threshold needed to remove Mr. Trump from office in the final vote later this week, they used their turns at the lectern to issue a warning to the Senate, focusing on what they saw as the danger presented by Mr. Trump remaining in office.
""He has betrayed our national security and he will do so again,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the lead impeachment manager and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee. ""He has compromised our elections and he will do so again. You will not change him. You cannot constrain him. He is who he is.… Now, do impartial justice and convict him.""
The
two articles of impeachment
center on Mr. Trump's pressing Ukraine
to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden
and other matters that could help Mr. Trump politically in this year's election, and the president's alleged efforts to obstruct Congress's inquiry into those actions.
Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing and again called impeachment a hoax on Twitter on Monday.
His legal team, in their presentation, painted Democrats' pursuit of impeachment as purely political, driven by a longstanding dislike of Mr. Trump, a Republican.
""At the end of the day, this is an effort to overturn the results of one election and to try to interfere in the coming election that begins today in Iowa,"" said White House counsel Pat Cipollone.
Iowa's caucuses
on Monday evening kicked off the Democratic and GOP nominating contests.
""What the House Democrats have done to this nation, to the Constitution, to the office of the president, to the president himself and to this body is outrageous,"" said another Trump team lawyer, Jay Sekulow.

How Republicans Scotched the Idea of Witnesses in Impeachment Trial

The two sides gave their final pitches Monday to the jury of 100 senators who had largely made up their minds on impeachment, broadly unmoved by three weeks of presentations and arguments.
An acquittal for Mr. Trump is expected on Wednesday. Twenty Republicans would have to join the entire Democratic caucus to vote to remove the president. No Republicans have said they favor impeachment, and just two supported Democrats' effort last week to seek more evidence in the trial, which failed 51-49.
Democratic senators emerged from the trial frustrated that most GOP senators
had rejected bringing in new witnesses and information
. Republicans countered that the House impeachment probe should have sought more evidence, which was blocked by the White House, before turning the matter over to the Senate.
""I'm trying to find the Senate rule that says for senators to plug their ears with cotton so they don't have to listen to the hard facts,"" Sen. Ron Wyden (D., Ore.) said.
Some Republicans, including Sens. Pat Roberts of Kansas and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, said they believe Mr. Trump engaged in improper behavior, but that it didn't rise to an impeachable offense. But others were unconvinced.
Mr. Trump's defense team ""raised a reasonable doubt as to the crime—the whatever—that was alleged,"" Sen. Bill Cassidy (R., La.) said.
Democrats allege in the first article of impeachment that Mr. Trump attempted to interfere with this year's presidential election by pressing Kyiv to probe Mr. Biden, a front-runner for the Democratic nomination. The second article accuses Mr. Trump of obstructing Congress's investigation by preventing witnesses from testifying and defying subpoenas for documentary evidence.
Mr. Trump and his allies have argued that Mr. Trump's interest in Mr. Biden was legitimate, alleging it was corrupt for Mr. Biden during the Obama administration to seek the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who once investigated a Ukrainian gas company where Mr. Biden's son Hunter sat on the board. Mr. Biden sought the prosecutor's removal as part of a broad international effort to combat corruption in Ukraine.
The Bidens have denied wrongdoing. Hunter Biden has said it was poor judgment on his part to serve on the Burisma board while his father was involved with Ukraine policy as vice president.
What isn't clear is whether the acquittal vote will be bipartisan. Some Democratic senators, such as Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Doug Jones of Alabama and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, are undecided. Mr. Jones, representing a state that backed Mr. Trump by 28 points in the 2016 election, is the most vulnerable Democratic senator this cycle.
Mr. Manchin said Monday he remained undecided on how he will vote on the impeachment articles, but introduced a measure to censure Mr. Trump, saying it would ""allow this body to unite across party lines…to formally denounce the president's actions.""
While censure was mentioned at times last year by some House Democrats as an alternative to impeachment, it hasn't been seriously discussed by Republican or Democratic leadership. Many Senate Republicans said Mr. Trump did nothing wrong, and those who find his actions problematic haven't called for him to be rebuked by Congress.
""Too late. It's too late,"" said Sen Roy Blunt (R., Mo.), a member of GOP Senate leadership, about censure.
Mr. Trump is scheduled to give his State of the Union speech Tuesday, in the chamber where the House approved the articles of impeachment against him in December. Some Republicans hoped he would move beyond impeachment in the annual speech.

A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll
published on Sunday found a majority of voters said they believed Mr. Trump abused his power by asking Ukraine to investigate a potential political opponent in order to influence the coming election, and that Mr. Trump obstructed Congress by not cooperating with the impeachment inquiry. But there wasn't majority support for removing him from office. The poll found 49% said he should be allowed to finish his term, compared with 46% who said he should be removed. Mr. Trump's job approval in the January poll stood at 46%, with 51% disapproving, in line with results throughout the Trump presidency.

DES MOINES, Iowa—In Iowa just days before the state's kickoff caucuses, President Trump pumped up a megarally while Vice President Mike Pence ordered a deluxe burger.
Showcasing their commitment to a key early-voting and general-election state, the president and vice president both traveled to Iowa on Thursday and illustrated their contrasting campaign styles.
The president descended into the state on Air Force One that night. He addressed thousands of screaming supporters packed into an arena at Drake University, declaring, ""We are going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats.""
His vice president arrived earlier for a daylong bus tour that included the kind of traditional political pit stops that his boss rarely makes, chatting with voters at fast-food joints and diners. He stopped by a Culver's—a Midwestern staple known for its ButterBurgers and frozen custard, where he greeted a pastor and a pleasantly surprised mother with her little girl and ordered a Culver's deluxe with bacon. Later he posed for pictures at Des Moines's Drake Diner.
With
Mr. Trump's impeachment trial
under way, both the president and vice president sought to redirect attention to the 2020 race and energize the state's Republicans days before the Feb. 3 caucuses. While Mr. Trump was free to hit the campaign trail, four senators seeking to unseat him were stuck in Washington, serving as jurors weighing the charges against him.
The visits by Messrs. Trump and Pence reflect their campaign's effort to boost turnout and test its organizational muscle in an important general-election state. They also illustrated the different roles the duo will play on the campaign trail, with Mr. Trump sticking to his signature megarallies and Mr. Pence checking in on smaller interest groups.
Speaking in Des Moines, Mr. Trump touted his new trade deal with Canada and Mexico, as well as the ""phase one"" trade agreement with China, framing the deals as important to the state's agricultural community.
""I have a place in my heart for the farmers,"" he said.
The president also cited the recent U.S. strike on an Iranian military leader, saying ""we ended his bloody rampage forever."" He said congressional Democrats are ""obsessed with a deranged witch hunt hoax,"" again referring to the impeachment proceedings as ""impeachment light."" And he criticized several Democratic presidential hopefuls, including Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden.
""Joe had a crowd that was so small the other day that they set up a round table,"" Mr. Trump said.
Mr. Pence crisscrossed Iowa on Thursday in a blue bus stamped with the campaign logo and a picture of the vice president flashing a wide grin beside Mr. Trump. During a speech before evangelical Christian voters in Sioux City, the vice president sought to keep the focus on his boss, declaring: ""I just spoke to him on the bus, told him I was in Sioux City, Iowa, and I think he sounded just a little bit jealous.""
Connie Schmett, co-chair of the Republican Party of Polk County, Iowa, said Messrs. Trump and Pence were a good pair because of their different styles.
""With President Trump, we have so many people that are so excited about this man because he is not the normal politician,"" she said. ""Vice President Pence is a little more mainstream. He's soft-spoken. He's a kind man. I think they complement each other.""
During his previous campaign, Mr. Trump largely eschewed the intimate campaigning that Iowa caucus voters expect. He placed second in the Republican contest to Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, who invested in traditional Iowa politicking, but won the state in the 2016 general election, exceeding Democrat Hillary Clinton's margin by nearly 10 percentage points.
Throughout his campaign stops, Mr. Pence hammered talking points that Trump aides believe will resonate with Iowa Republicans: He dismissed the Democratic candidates as radical socialists, emphasized the administration's efforts to restrict abortion access and to protect gun rights and highlighted the condition of the U.S. economy.
Mr. Pence also criticized impeachment proceedings seeking to remove Mr. Trump from office, on
charges of abuse of power
and
obstruction of Congress
, as a ""shameful attempt to overthrow the will of the American people.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What approach to campaigning do you prefer to see from presidential candidates? Why? Join the conversation below.
But Mr. Pence's approach leaves him more likely to come face to face with his critics, something that Mr. Trump rarely experiences at his rallies packed with adoring supporters.
On Thursday, during his stop at Drake Diner, Mr. Pence was confronted by a man who criticized the administration's recent plan to allow states to convert federal Medicaid funding to block grants. The change would let them impose changes such as eligibility requirements and prescription drug limits for millions of adults.
""There are people I see at the emergency department that can't get primary care doctors. Once they got Medicaid they can get primary care doctors. They stay out of the ER. They actually work more. They actually contribute to our community more,"" said Rob Davidson, who identified himself as the executive director of the Committee to Protect Medicare. ""Now, if you cut those people—sorry, you don't get your health care? That's going to be a real negative in their lives.""
Mr. Pence said he respectfully disagreed.
The president and vice president are campaigning for re-election in a way that seeks to leverage both traditional stumping and the appeal of Mr. Trump's rallies. Mr. Pence was meeting with evangelical voters and veterans Thursday, both important coalitions for their campaign.
White House officials said Mr. Pence's events are meant to counterbalance the president's rallies with a more targeted approach—a formula the vice president has repeated in other states, including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida.
""It's a chance for him to gauge the reaction in a community,"" said Marc Short, the vice president's chief of staff, of Mr. Pence's frequent stops at diners and local restaurants. The White House works with the president's re-election campaign to help determine which parts of key states to visit, aides said.
Mr. Pence's appearance in Iowa four days before the caucuses is sure to revive questions about his own political ambitions. The vice president is widely believed to be interested in running for president himself someday. But Mr. Pence's aides bristled at the suggestion that his visit had the secondary benefit of building groundwork for an eventual campaign of his own.
Mr. Trump's victory in Iowa in 2016 came after Barack Obama won the state in 2008 and 2012. Recent polls of Iowa show Mr. Trump in a close contest in hypothetical matchups against the leading Democratic candidates.
With no serious Republican challenger, the president is expected to win his party's caucuses easily, though GOP attendance is likely to be very light. Still, more than 80 campaign surrogates are scheduled to flood the state for the Feb. 3 voting, including cabinet officials, members of Congress and top campaign aides.

Party and politics aren't all that distinguish the billionaire New Yorker in the White House from the one seeking to displace him.
President Trump's Fifth Avenue apartment in Manhattan's Trump Tower feels ""like you're walking into a casino. Very lavish. A lot of gold,"" said John Catsimatidis, another billionaire New Yorker. He also has visited Michael Bloomberg's New York City townhouse. ""You walk into Bloomberg's home on 79th Street, it's like Louis XIV's home,"" he said. ""Very conservative.""
Mr. Trump, 73 years old, and Mr. Bloomberg, 78, lived about 20 blocks apart on Manhattan's East Side and miles apart in sensibility, say dozens of people who know them. Mr. Trump was seen as a celebrity whose marriages and divorces splashed across newsstand tabloids. Mr. Bloomberg was the data-driven businessman who served three terms as New York's mayor.
""Mike's more intellectual, more of a refined billionaire,"" said Don Peebles, a real-estate developer. ""Donald's more of a blue-collar billionaire.""
Mr. Bloomberg was raised in a working-class family outside of Boston and made his fortune selling data to Wall Street traders. Once established, he circulated easily in Manhattan's philanthropic circles, boardrooms and elite clubs.
Mr. Trump grew up in a wealthy New York real-estate family. He never fit among the city's old-money crowd, which viewed him more as a showman than a successful developer.
Mr. Bloomberg appears on the ballot for the first time in the Democratic primary contest on Tuesday, when more than a dozen states hold contests. He has spent more than $600 million on his presidential campaign.
For years, the two billionaires coexisted peacefully in the city, trading pleasantries in public when it suited them. Some of their children became friends. Whatever ill feelings the two men harbored stayed private. Not anymore.
Mr. Catsimatidis said he spoke with Mr. Bloomberg last fall, before the former mayor launched his bid, and he recalled Mr. Bloomberg clearly felt he was more qualified to be president. ""He considers himself so much smarter than Trump and so much richer than Trump,"" he said. ""And Trump is sitting in his chair. Bloomberg hates him.""
The prospect of a November election showdown between Mr. Trump and Mr. Bloomberg is hard to predict, but the two men are trading punches like crosstown rivals.
Mr. Bloomberg is ""a loser who has money but can't debate and has zero presence,"" Mr. Trump tweeted. He mocks the ex-mayor's height, calling him Mini Mike. Mr. Bloomberg tweeted that some of their mutual acquaintances in New York ""laugh at you & call you a carnival barking clown.""
The billionaires' bout ignited nearly four years ago, when Mr. Bloomberg took the stage at the Democratic National Convention. Mr. Trump, then the GOP presidential nominee, ""wants to run the nation like he's running his business. God help us,"" Mr. Bloomberg said. ""I'm a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one.""
Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said, ""Mike Bloomberg is not equipped to run this country and President Trump has made his thoughts on that clear.""
Mr. Bloomberg declined a request to be interviewed for this article. His spokesman, Stu Loeser said, ""Running a golf course is about the only thing"" Mr. Bloomberg would hire Mr. Trump to do.
Mr. Bloomberg, as mayor, and Mr. Trump, as a developer, occasionally crossed paths. They were never close, people familiar with their relationship said, yet they largely presented -- at least publicly -- a warm front.
Mr. Trump said in 2007 that Mr. Bloomberg would ""go down as one of the great mayors, if not the greatest"" in New York history. Mr. Bloomberg referred to Mr. Trump in 2011 as a ""New York icon."" Both called each other a friend.
Messrs. Trump and Bloomberg were photographed together on the golf course. Mr. Bloomberg twice appeared on ""The Apprentice,"" Mr. Trump's reality TV show. Mr. Trump was picked by the city to run a public golf course.
Given their personal differences, the cordiality rested on shaky ground. Mr. Bloomberg had little to gain from tangling with a high-profile TV personality. Likewise, Mr. Trump had little reason to antagonize the mayor, given the city's broad land-use authority.
When Mr. Bloomberg was elected in 2002, Mr. Trump's status as a New York real-estate developer was on the wane. After running into financial trouble in the 1990s, he would eventually shift to mostly licensing his name to developers around the globe. Yet he still had ambitions to develop in New York.
His dealings with the Bloomberg administration hit an early setback. City Hall officials rejected Mr. Trump's attempt to acquire 2 Columbus Circle, a property near Central Park in one of Manhattan's landmark intersections.
The city instead sold it to what is now called the Museum of Arts and Design. Dan Doctoroff, Mr. Bloomberg's deputy mayor for economic development, said he didn't hear from Mr. Trump again until the ""The Apprentice"" made its 2004 TV debut 18 months later.
""The next morning, I got a call from him out of the blue simply to tell me the ratings of 'The Apprentice,' which he then proceeded to do for the next three weeks in a row,"" Mr. Doctoroff said. ""In the development world that we were living in, that sort of post-9/11 period, we didn't have that much engagement with him.""
During Mr. Bloomberg's third term, Mr. Trump explored taking over Tavern on the Green, a restaurant in Central Park. He got a chilly response from City Hall. Then came Mr. Trump's shot at a golf course deal in the Bronx.
Adrian Benepe, commissioner of the parks and recreation department for most of Mr. Bloomberg's tenure, said the city had promised decades earlier to turn the Ferry Point landfill into a public golf course.
City officials tried without success to find a developer willing to handle the conversion, which required extensive and costly environmental remediation.
The city ended up building the course with taxpayer money, Mr. Benepe said. He praised Mr. Trump's operation of the Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point. But he was surprised to hear the Trump campaign in 2016 portray Mr. Trump's role as a single-handed rescue after years of municipal fumbling.
""It's a pants-on-fire lie,"" Mr. Benepe said. ""It was kind of a big telling moment that Trump would make up a completely fabricated story that was instantly and easily disprovable.""
A Trump Organization spokeswoman said, ""For over 30 years, before President Trump and the Trump Organization stepped in, Ferry Point was a stalled city project, in desperate need of rescue.""
R. Couri Hay, a publicist and New York society maven, said Mr. Bloomberg is a frequent guest at charity events and gala dinners in Manhattan and the Hamptons. ""Mayor Bloomberg likes to go out and about,"" Mr. Hay said. ""He's no stranger to putting on black tie, although often his is red.""
Mr. Trump ""famously doesn't go to a lot of parties,"" Mr. Hay said. ""He's more of a homebody.""
That wasn't always the case, said Jean Shafiroff, a Manhattan philanthropist. In the late 1980s, Mr. Trump and Ivana Trump, his wife at the time, ""were very big on the social scene and in philanthropy. They were at the New York City Ballet gala, pretty much everywhere.""
Mr. Bloomberg topped the Chronicle of Philanthropy's annual ranking of the top 50 biggest donors in the U.S. His charitable contributions totaled $3.3 billion in the past year. Mr. Trump hasn't made the list in its 20 years.
Mr. Bloomberg gets credit from many in New York's real-estate industry for helping rebuild lower Manhattan after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Mr. Trump was more of an outsider, with few close friendships among real-estate developers. As mayor, Mr. Bloomberg would attend the Real Estate Board of New York's annual banquet. Mr. Trump was never a member of the powerful trade group, a spokesman said.
With no access to either man's unredacted tax records, tallying wealth is an educated guess. Forbes estimated Mr. Trump's net worth at about $3 billion and Mr. Bloomberg's around $60 billion.
Mr. Bloomberg, a lifelong Democrat, switched to the Republican Party before his first race for mayor in 2001. He left the GOP in 2007 as he flirted with a 2008 presidential bid. When asked on CNN about Mr. Bloomberg's prospects at the time, Mr. Trump said Mr. Bloomberg would be a formidable candidate because he could ""spend the money that it takes to get elected.""
Mr. Bloomberg decided not to run. He instead sought permission from the City Council to bust a law prohibiting him from serving more than two terms. Mr. Trump joined a chorus supporting Mr. Bloomberg's bid for a third term.
""I think in New York City real estate, developers are forced into a position where they try to be accommodative to the politicians,"" said Stephen Meister, an attorney who has represented Mr. Trump and known him since the 1980s.
Messrs. Trump and Bloomberg took opposite sides of a national debate in 2010, but the dispute contained none of the vitriol now being volleyed between them.
That summer, Mr. Bloomberg stood on Governors Island, the Statue of Liberty behind him, to deliver a speech supporting a proposal to build a mosque and Islamic community center two blocks from where terrorists had toppled the World Trade Center.
Opposition grew, drawing in Mr. Trump. He offered to buy out one of the investors in the property on the condition no mosque be built within five blocks of ground zero. Mr. Trump said the proposed location wasn't appropriate.
Real-estate developer Sharif El-Gamal, one of the investors in the property, said he was surprised by Mr. Trump's offer.
""Even though he was polarizing against the project, what stood out for me is that he is a rational genius in a way,"" Mr. El-Gamal said. ""He is somebody that understands how to push buttons and is the greatest showman that I think we've ever seen.""
After Mr. Trump's offer was rebuffed, he appeared on CNN to criticize the proposal but not Mr. Bloomberg. ""He's a great mayor and he's a great friend of mine,"" Mr. Trump said in the TV interview. ""He feels very strongly about freedom of religion, and I understand that.""
In 2016, Mr. Bloomberg, who at that point had been unaffiliated with any political party for nearly a decade, briefly considered running for president as an independent.
Mr. Bloomberg's younger daughter, Georgina Bloomberg, told W Magazine after her father decided against the idea that she was happy to have avoided campaign mudslinging with the Trumps.
""Donald Trump and his family have always been very close,"" she told the magazine. ""I'm good friends with his kids. I was not looking forward to having to watch our fathers go against each other.""
Ms. Bloomberg and Ivanka Trump appeared in the 2003 documentary ""Born Rich.""
Mr. Bloomberg rejoined the Democratic Party in 2018 and launched his bid for the Democratic nomination last fall.
In October, Georgina Bloomberg and Eric Trump's wife, Lara Trump, were co-chairwomen of the Rescue Dogs Rock NYC charity gala. They planned to headline a charity event for rescue dogs at Mar-a-Lago, the president's Florida resort, in March. The Palm Beach Post reported neither would attend because of scheduling conflicts.
After Mr. Bloomberg's first debate appearance this month, largely panned, Mr. Trump lashed out at the former mayor.
""Mini Mike Bloomberg's debate performance tonight was perhaps the worst in the history of debates, and there have been some really bad ones. He was stumbling, bumbling and grossly incompetent,"" Mr. Trump tweeted. ""If this doesn't knock him out of the race, nothing will.""
Should Mr. Bloomberg face Mr. Trump in the general election, it will only get more heated, said New York public-relations executive Howard Rubenstein: ""There's some kind of war that will take place.""

WASHINGTON—Senators wavering on calling new witnesses in President Trump's impeachment trial hinted Wednesday at the factors they were considering, as Republican leaders tried to persuade lawmakers to bring the proceedings to a close later this week without fresh testimony.
After
several days of opening arguments
by each side that offered little give-and-take,
Wednesday's session
brought an opportunity for senators to direct questions at Mr. Trump's legal team and Democratic House members, who are serving as prosecutors in the trial. Mr. Trump's lawyers portrayed
Democrats' case for impeachment
as politically motivated and well short of the bar needed to remove a president from office. The Democratic lawmakers said they were trying to block Mr. Trump from cheating to win this year's election and argued that Republican senators were holding Mr. Trump to an unusually low standard.
Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell
was pushing Republicans to defeat a vote
to bring in new witnesses and information, while Democrats argued that a fair trial would include additional evidence, including testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton. While Mr. McConnell (R., Ky.) had said a day earlier that he didn't yet have the votes to block more witnesses, Republican leaders suggested Wednesday they would eventually get there. Democratic leaders in the Senate said procuring additional testimony would be an uphill battle.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What questions are you hoping get asked and to whom? Why? Join the conversation below.
The Senate is expected to vote Friday on whether to call for witnesses.
In one notable exchange, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska—two Republican senators who have said they are debating siding with Democrats on calling new witnesses—asked a question that is central to the impeachment case: whether the White House had any record of Mr. Trump's trying to end corruption in Ukraine before former Vice President Joe Biden entered the Democratic presidential race last spring. The president has said an overall concern with Ukraine corruption was behind his call to announce an investigation of Mr. Biden while he was freezing nearly $400 million in aid to the country.
In response to the two senators' questions, which were read aloud by Chief Justice John Roberts, deputy White House counsel Pat Philbin said he had no such record of a previous concern with corruption by Mr. Trump. But he said the Republican president had developed concerns about Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter, after his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, had been pushing for Ukraine to investigate the former vice president in January 2019. Mr. Biden started his campaign in April. ""The president…gets information from Rudy Giuliani,"" Mr. Philbin said.
Mr. Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart in July to investigate the elder Mr. Biden's actions in Ukraine as vice president while his son served on the board of a gas company there.

Mr. Bolton in a forthcoming book
wrote that the president told him in August that he was holding up the aid until Ukraine agreed to the investigations he was seeking. The aid to Ukraine was released in September amid a bipartisan uproar in Congress.
Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the chamber's Democratic leader, asked the House lawmakers, who are essentially acting as prosecutors in the trial, if there could be a fair trial without calling Mr. Bolton.
""The short answer to that question is no,"" Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, responded. He told lawmakers not to wait for the book, which is due to be published in March.
In tweets Wednesday, Mr. Trump, who has denied making any connection between Ukraine aid and investigating the Bidens, urged Republicans to reject calling witnesses and called Mr. Bolton's yet unpublished book ""nasty & untrue."" The White House's National Security Council said Wednesday that it
told Mr. Bolton's lawyer last week
that Mr. Bolton's manuscript contained ""significant amounts"" of classified information and couldn't be published in its current form.
In response, Chuck Cooper, Mr. Bolton's lawyer, said he sought immediate guidance last week on whether the NSC deemed classified any of the material in the chapter related to Ukraine, though he said he didn't believe that information ""could reasonably be considered classified."" Mr. Cooper said he didn't get a response to his email.
Sens. Collins, Murkowski and Mitt Romney (R., Utah), another juror who has said he is open to new testimony, asked the president's lawyers how the Senate should view a situation in which Mr. Trump might have more than one reason to withhold aid from Ukraine.
""All elected officials, to some extent, have in mind how their conduct, how their decisions, their policy decisions, will affect the next election,"" Mr. Philbin replied. He said that ""can't be a basis for removing a president from office.""
In a departure from what the Trump team has previously argued, Alan Dershowitz offered a new theory: that because Mr. Trump believes his re-election is in the public interest, even if he had political motivations in pressing Ukraine to open an investigation into the Bidens, it wouldn't be impeachable.
""Every public official that I know believes that his election is in the public interest,"" Mr. Dershowitz said.
Mr. Schiff shot back that if President Obama, a Democrat, had asked Russia to investigate Mr. Romney, his 2012 opponent, the Senate would have found it impeachable. ""All quid pro quos are fine, it's carte blanche? Is that really what we're prepared to say?"" Mr. Schiff said.
The hypothetical continued when Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Ted Cruz of Texas asked Mr. Schiff: If Mr. Obama had evidence that Mr. Romney's son was being paid $1 million a year by a corrupt Russian company and Mr. Romney had acted to benefit that company, would Mr. Obama then have legal authority to ask for that to be investigated?
Mr. Schiff said that hypothetical didn't have a direct correlation and said the U.S. had ways to investigate corruption that didn't involve the president seeking a foreign leader's help.
The president's lawyers also argued that using credible information from foreign sources was appropriate. ""Mere information is not something that would violate the campaign-finance laws,"" Mr. Philbin said. ""The idea that any information that happens to come from overseas is necessarily campaign interference is a mistake.""
Democrats said they were stunned by that stance. Mr. Schiff characterized the defense team's stance as: ""It's now okay to criminally conspire with another country to get help in a presidential election."" Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D., Mich.) said people around her were dumbfounded, turning to their neighbors to confirm that they had heard Mr. Philbin correctly.
Mr. Trump and his allies have defended the push for investigations in Ukraine by arguing that it was corrupt for the elder Mr. Biden to seek the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had once investigated the Ukrainian gas company where his son sat on the board. Mr. Biden sought the prosecutor's removal as part of a broad international effort to combat corruption in Ukraine. The Bidens have denied wrongdoing.
Hunter Biden has said it was poor judgment to serve on the Burisma board, a position for which he was paid about $50,000 a month, while his father was involved with Ukraine policy.
The question-and-answer portion of the trial will continue on Thursday.
Republican leaders on Wednesday worked to dissuade Republicans from joining Democrats on seeking subpoenas for Mr. Bolton or others who may have close knowledge of the Ukraine pressure campaign. Mr. McConnell met Wednesday morning with Ms. Murkowski, who had earlier said that she was curious about what Mr. Bolton had to say. After the meeting, Ms. Murkowski declined to discuss witnesses or her meeting.
Mr. Romney and Ms. Collins repeated their interest in hearing from Mr. Bolton on Wednesday while other Republicans said that if the resolution passes, they would push to hear from the Bidens and the whistleblower whose account of the Ukraine effort spurred the impeachment inquiry.
Republicans sought to project confidence on Wednesday. ""I'm optimistic,"" Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the former Republican whip, said of defeating the motion to bring in new witnesses.
The House last fall had sought Mr. Bolton's testimony but declined to subpoena him because of Democrats' wish to move quickly and not get bogged down in court fights.

Meanwhile, more revelations emerged about Mr. Bolton's concerns about the administration's dealings with Ukraine. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.) said that in a Sept. 23 phone call, weeks after Mr. Trump fired Mr. Bolton, Mr. Bolton urged him, unprompted, to have his committee look into the removal of the former ambassador to Ukraine, suggesting something ""improper"" had occurred.
Marie Yovanovitch's removal last spring is one of several key episodes in the impeachment inquiry. The former ambassador was for months targeted by Mr. Giuliani, who said he wanted to remove her because she was obstructing his push for investigations in Ukraine. Mr. Trump, who has the unilateral authority to fire ambassadors, ordered her removed after hearing complaints from Mr. Giuliani.

WASHINGTON -- In six days of arguments on the Senate floor, Democrats and the White House defense team sparred over whether the president abused the power of his office and obstructed Congress -- and whether those actions would merit his removal from office.
In one major development after the Democrats finished their arguments, the New York Times revealed that former national security adviser John Bolton, in a draft of his forthcoming book, wrote that President Trump told him aid to Ukraine was conditioned on investigations.
Here is a breakdown of the arguments the House Democratic impeachment managers made on key points, and how the Trump team responded:
Ukraine Aid
Impeachment Managers: The Democrats alleged Mr. Trump leveraged nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine to pressure Kyiv to undertake investigations that could benefit him politically. Democrats said that amounted to an effort to interfere in the 2020 election. The aid was released after pressure from Congress.
Trump's Defense: Mr. Trump's team noted the aid to Ukraine was released in September without any announcement of investigations by Ukraine. President Trump denied the conversation Mr. Bolton described in his book.
July 25 Call
Impeachment Managers: Democrats said the White House sought to cover up a July 25 phone call with the Ukrainian president -- in which Mr. Trump asked him to investigate Democrat Joe Biden and his son and alleged election interference -- by moving the transcript to a classified server typically reserved for the nation's top secrets.
Trump Defense: Lawyers said the White House wasn't seeking to hide the transcript of the July 25 phone call because it was both preserved on a White House server and, in September, made public. The lawyers also pointed to the fact that Mr. Trump didn't link aid to investigations on the call.
Articles of Impeachment
Impeachment Managers: Aside from blocking aid, Democrats said, the president obstructed the impeachment investigation by blocking evidence and testimony sought by House investigators.
Trump's Defense: The president's team argued the articles of impeachment are constitutionally deficient and overly broad. The lawyers also argued that Democrats don't allege that the president committed a crime, which they said is necessary to warrant removal from office.
Removal From Office
Impeachment Managers: The president poses a national security threat to the country and, said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), an ""imminent threat to the integrity of our democracy"" and therefore must be removed prior to the 2020 election.
Trump's Defense: Mr. Trump's lawyers said the president is up for re-election in less than 10 months and the choice should be left to the voters. The lawyers also countered Democrats' calls for urgency in removing the president from office by noting that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) waited a month to turn over the articles of impeachment to the Senate.
Senate Witnesses
Impeachment Managers: Democrats argued the Senate should call new witnesses who could offer first-hand accounts of the president's motivation for holding up aid to Ukraine.
Trump's Defense: The president's team said the House was responsible for collecting testimony and documents, and in voting for the articles of impeachment determined it had enough evidence to warrant the president's removal from office.

No experience as searing as a presidential impeachment trial -- dramatic, emotional and seen only twice before in American history -- can end without leaving lasting marks.
That will be the case in the aftermath of President Trump's Senate trial, which now is virtually certain to end with a decisive and largely partisan acquittal on Wednesday. The reverberations will roll out for years to come, affecting the state of presidential power, the national political climate and the byplay between the two parties in Washington.
1. It is Trump's party now
Perhaps most important, the impeachment drama has further shifted ground within the Republican party. Contrary to some expectations, impeachment drove Republican leaders even further into the embrace of a president they once viewed skeptically. By uniting so decisively behind Mr. Trump, Republicans find their fortunes locked with his, for better or as Democrats claim for the worse, in this year's election season.
For his part, Mr. Trump found himself dependent on a Republican establishment he once scorned, and ultimately became proud of its solid backing. If there was doubt before that the Republican party has become Mr. Trump's party, it has largely evaporated during the impeachment fight.
2. The country is even more polarized
The fight has driven the polarization already rampant in America's political system even deeper into the body politic. Here is just one sign: In the midst of the Senate impeachment trial, President Trump signed a new U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, perhaps the most important bipartisan accomplishment of his term and an achievement won in significant measure because House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rounded up Democratic votes of support.
Yet in the bitterness of an impeachment effort spearheaded by Mrs. Pelosi, neither she nor any other Democrats were invited to the signing ceremony, while some 70 Republicans were in attendance.
Some lawmakers pledge to try to bridge that divide in impeachment's wake. ""We need to get back to working on things on which we agree,"" says Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, a member of the Republican's Senate leadership team. He suggests starting with a bill to fund America's highways, normally a bipartisan task.
Still, he also says Democrats' ""partisan rhetoric"" in this election year will complicate such efforts.
3. The executive strengthens further
Impeachment appears to have continued a yearslong process of tilting the balance of power toward the executive branch and away from Congress. The president asserted his right to hold up, at least temporarily, legally appropriated foreign-aid funds for Ukraine, and then to resist all congressional attempts to subpoena witnesses and documents in the subsequent investigation.
Lawmakers from Mr. Trump's party defended the chief executive's right to resist congressional oversight, a precedent that won't be forgotten. By arguing, as Sen. Lamar Alexander did in opposing calling witness to the Senate trial, that Mr. Trump's actions in pressuring Ukraine were wrong but not impeachable, Republicans may have both clarified and pushed outward the line for any future impeachment effort.
Lawmakers from both parties have on multiple fronts -- among them war powers, trade strategy, spending and immigration policy -- steadily ceded power to the president over the last two decades. Republican conservatives, though traditionally leery of too much centralized power anywhere in government, have gone along.
""The broader partisan puzzle is how and why a party that has spent 50 years trying to shrink the scope of the federal government would now be an active partner in increasing presidential power beyond the reach of Congress or even the courts,"" says Wendy Schiller, chair of the political science department at Brown University and a former Democratic Senate staffer.
4. And there is an election coming. . .
With an election year unfolding, Republicans in the House as well as the Senate have closed ranks behind Mr. Trump, and there was little sign that the slings and arrows of Democrats did anything to hurt the president's standing among his fervent supporters around the country.
Scott Reed, who oversees political activity for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, contends it is not just impeachment but also a good economy and rising wages that have welded Mr. Trump and his congressional party together.
""Trump's success at governing has driven the GOP to him,"" he says.
Still, Democrats say the GOP's decision to link arms so tightly with the president carries considerable risk for party moderates. Five Senate Republicans -- Susan Collins of Maine, Joni Ernst of Iowa, Cory Gardner of Colorado, Martha McSally of Arizona and Thom Tillis of North Carolina -- face re-election this year in swing states where Mr. Trump is generally unpopular.
Mr. Trump's power within the party now is sufficient that they, like all lawmakers, have had to worry about incurring his wrath and his followers' during impeachment. But Democrats think impeachment also now leaves such Republicans vulnerable in a general election, where moderate voters hostile to the president now can be more easily mobilized to oppose them.
Rahm Emanuel, the former Chicago mayor who once was campaign chief for House Democrats, says Democrats won back control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections by advancing moderate candidates offering themselves as a check on Mr. Trump's power. ""I'll make a prediction,"" Mr. Emanuel says. ""Every Democrat will be running an ad about not giving Donald Trump unfettered control post-impeachment.""
5. Lessons from history
History doesn't offer clear guidance to either party on how impeachment fallout will drop to the surface. When there was a movement to impeach President Nixon, which led to his resignation in 1974, many Republicans bailed out on their president by urging him to leave. The party still suffered big losses that year.
When the move to impeach President Bill Clinton began in 1998, Republicans united against a president of the opposite party, much as Democrats did this time. Yet Republicans lost ground in that year's midterm election, a warning to Democrats now.
In any case, the political climate is markedly different now. There are fewer voters in the center, either in Congress or the electorate, and that is especially true when it comes to Mr. Trump.
When the impeachment process was getting under way in October, Mr. Trump's job-approval rating was at 45% among all voters, at 91% among Republicans, at 6% among Democrats and at 38% among independents in The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. Polling now shows those job-approval ratings basically unchanged -- except that Mr. Trump's approval actually has ticked up among independents.
Such findings leave the president's supporters buoyant in their belief that he has survived impeachment unscathed, and perhaps even strengthened slightly. Yet there is ample reason to believe that impeachment has simply heightened fervor on both sides of the Trump divide.

WASHINGTON—Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, once crowned by Republicans as their presidential nominee, became the lone member of his party on Wednesday to vote to convict and
remove President Trump from office
.
In so doing, Mr. Romney denied Mr. Trump the ability to present the acquittal as a unanimous decision among GOP senators. With the exception of Mr. Romney, the Senate voted along party lines to acquit the president, who has a 91%
approval rating among GOP voters
, according to recent polling by The Wall Street Journal/NBC News.
""The allegations made in the articles of impeachment are very serious,"" said Mr. Romney, a devout member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in an emotional speech on the Senate floor.
""As a senator-juror, I swore an oath, before God, to exercise 'impartial justice,' "" he said. ""I am a profoundly religious person."" His jaw shook as he struggled to keep his voice under control.
Early Thursday morning, Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, ""Had failed presidential candidate @MittRomney devoted the same energy and anger to defeating a faltering Barack Obama as he sanctimoniously does to me, he could have won the election.""
Mr. Romney's vote to convict is a defining moment in a lengthy political career that many thought had ended when he lost to President Obama in 2012. But Mr. Romney easily won an open Senate seat in 2018 in Utah, and won't face a re-election campaign until 2024, should he decide to run again.
As a Republican who built his career in deep-blue Massachusetts, the 72-year-old Mr. Romney has experience pulling against the political current.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Will Mr. Romney face retribution for his vote to convict a member of his own party? Join the conversation below.
The party that nominated Mr. Romney for president eight years ago is now Mr. Trump's party, and the two have a history of public clashes dating back to Mr. Romney's 2012 defeat, when Mr. Trump said the former Massachusetts governor ""blew it.""
During the 2016 presidential election cycle, Mr. Romney emerged as a prominent Trump critic and called for him to release his tax returns. He gave a speech attacking him, calling him a ""phony"" and a ""fraud,"" and urged Republicans to force a contested convention to choose a different candidate.
The speech fueled rumors that Mr. Romney was considering a presidential bid. Mr. Romney has said he voted for his wife for president.
The president ultimately endorsed Mr. Romney for his 2018 election, and Mr. Romney said in his senate speech on Wednesday that he supports a great deal of the president's agenda, noting that he has voted with the president 80% of the time.
But ""were I to ignore the evidence that has been presented, and disregard what I believe my oath and the Constitution demands of me for the sake of a partisan end, it would, I fear, expose my character to history's rebuke and the censure of my own conscience,"" he said.
""I knew from the outset that being tasked with judging the president, the leader of my own party, would be the most difficult decision I have ever faced,"" Mr. Romney said. ""I was not wrong.""
And yet, he said, the question the Constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act so extreme that it rises to the level of a high crime and misdemeanor.
""Yes,"" Mr. Romney said. ""He did.""
Few fellow senators were in the chamber to hear Mr. Romney's address before the vote. ""I was surprised and disappointed,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said of Mr. Romney's decision.
From their seats in a hushed Senate chamber, Democratic Sens. Brian Schatz (Hawaii), Chris Murphy (Conn.) and Patrick Leahy (Vt.) watched Mr. Romney's remarks silently.
The only Republican colleague who made an appearance was Roger Wicker (Miss.), who came in after Mr. Romney was already under way and left before he finished. Sen. David Perdue (R., Ga.), a close Trump ally, was presiding.
There are very few people, a visibly moved Mr. Schatz told reporters afterward, who put country above party, ""and Mitt Romney just did that,"" adding he had not known what Mr. Romney was going to say. ""But I came to the floor because I was hoping.""
After his Senate speech, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel—Mr. Romney's niece—tweeted that President Trump did nothing wrong, and the Republican Party is more united than ever behind him.
""I, along with the @GOP, stand with President Trump,"" the tweet said.
Mr. Romney ""can expect some pretty fierce blowback, and he knows that,"" said former Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who retired from the Senate after also suffering withering criticism from the president.
But Mr. Flake added, ""I don't know how you can hear that speech that he gave and the emotion that he had—and that's real—without knowing that this was a vote of conscience. And voters will usually respect that.""
Mr. Romney acknowledged that his vote would be fruitless, since all the other Republican votes for acquittal assure the president will remain in office.
Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), the Republican whip, told reporters that his colleagues know Mr. Romney as a very independent person. ""And obviously, we're going to continue to work with him,"" Mr. Thune said. ""There's always another day and another vote.""

WASHINGTON—Lev Parnas, an associate of Rudy Giuliani, said he warned a top aide to the newly elected president of Ukraine that the U.S. would halt aid to the country if it didn't announce investigations that could benefit President Trump politically.
In a May meeting with Serhiy Shefir, an aide to then-Ukrainian President-elect Volodymyr Zelensky, Mr. Parnas delivered the message at the direction of Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, he said in an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow on Wednesday.
""Rudy told me after meeting the president at the White House—he called me, the message was, it wasn't just military aid, it was all aid"" that the U.S. would cut off if Ukraine didn't announce investigations, Mr. Parnas said.
In addition to halting aid, he said he told Mr. Shefir that without an announcement of investigations, the relationships ""would be soured"" and no U.S. officials—including Vice President Mike Pence—would attend Mr. Zelensky's inauguration. Mr. Pence didn't attend the inauguration later that month, though a handful of other U.S. officials did.
The White House didn't respond to a request for comment. Mr. Shefir, in a statement last year, said that his conversation with Mr. Parnas and his associate, Igor Fruman, was about their request to arrange a meeting with Mr. Giuliani and that military aid wasn't brought up. Mr. Giuliani said he didn't know that Mr. Parnas had relayed such a message to Ukraine.
The efforts by the president, Mr. Giuliani and others to push Ukraine to announce investigations into alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election and into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden are at the center of the impeachment inquiry, which enters a new phase next week with the
start of the Senate trial
. Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani have denied wrongdoing, and the president has called the inquiry a hoax.
On Wednesday, Mr. Parnas broadly tied Mr. Trump to efforts by himself and Mr. Giuliani to press Ukrainian officials to announce those investigations.
""President Trump knew exactly what was going on,"" he said on MSNBC. ""He was aware of all of my movements. I wouldn't do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani and the president."" Asked why Mr. Trump said he didn't know him last fall, Mr. Parnas replied: ""He lied.""
The recorded interview—Mr. Parnas's first since his
arrest in October
on campaign-finance charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty—coincided with the release by House committees of more than 500 pages of documents Mr. Parnas turned over in recent days.
The documents show Mr. Parnas was in close contact with several high-level people in Mr. Trump's orbit about efforts in Ukraine. They also include several references to conversations with Mr. Trump or at the White House. ""Be there in ten was on phone with big guy,"" Mr. Giuliani told Mr. Parnas in January 2019. On March 24, Mr. Parnas texted another lawyer: ""On our way to White House.""
Mr. Parnas traded dozens of texts in the spring with Tommy Hicks Jr., who was chairman of the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action until he was named a co-chairman of the Republican National Committee in early 2019. The two exchanged links to articles and tweets suggesting Ukraine interfered in the
2016 U.S. election
and assessing Mr. Biden.
On several occasions, Mr. Hicks texted Mr. Parnas to ""show Rudy"" or ""tell R,"" and expressed interest in speaking to Mr. Giuliani directly.
Mr. Hicks, who is a close friend of Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, didn't respond to a request for comment.

Others affiliated with America First were in close contact with Mr. Parnas, the text messages show.
""What should I send Don to tweet,"" wrote Joseph Ahearn, director of development at America First Policies, the group's nonprofit arm, on March 20—a reference to Donald Trump Jr.
On March 24, Mr. Parnas sent Mr. Ahearn a link to a Daily Wire article about calls to remove Marie Yovanovitch, the ambassador to Ukraine, whom Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Parnas and others were seeking to remove because they believed she was an obstacle to their push for investigations.
Donald Trump Jr. tweeted that link the same day, and unfavorably compared Ms. Yovanovitch to the ambassador to Germany. ""We need more @RichardGrenell's and less of these jokers as ambassadors.""
Representatives for Donald Trump Jr. and America First declined to comment.
The president ordered Ms. Yovanovitch removed in April after hearing complaints from Mr. Giuliani and others. She has denied any wrongdoing and told House investigators last fall that she was alarmed that the State Department didn't seek to protect her.
The new documents also show discussions between Mr. Parnas and Harry Sargeant III, an American businessman and Trump donor who is influential in GOP circles, about efforts to oust Ms. Yovanovitch.
""She's gone,"" Mr. Parnas texted Mr. Sargeant on March 23. ""AWESOME!!!"" Mr. Sargeant responded.
On April 23, Mr. Giuliani texted Mr. Parnas: ""He fired her again."" Mr. Parnas relayed the information to Mr. Sargeant: ""The bomb is dropping tomorrow."" Ms. Yovanovitch was recalled from Ukraine the next day, she told the House in testimony last fall.
Chris Kise, an attorney for Mr. Sargeant, said in a statement that his client was ""not part of any plan to remove the U.S. Ambassador.""
Also on April 23, Victoria Toensing, a lawyer close to Mr. Giuliani and to the president, called Mr. Parnas and left a voice mail. ""VT here. We've got a request to talk to the big one, so I just wanted to get the latest from you if I could,"" Ms. Toensing said. She didn't respond to a request for comment.

WASHINGTON—House Democrats argued before the Senate Thursday that President Trump should be convicted of an abuse-of-power charge, rebuffing the White House's position that the Constitution requires a criminal act to remove a president from office.
In
the second day of arguments
in the impeachment trial, the Democratic impeachment managers also laid out Thursday Mr. Trump's alleged motive for seeking
investigations by Ukraine
into former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, saying Mr. Trump was determined to undercut a rival, not battle corruption, and that he put U.S. national security at risk as a result.
""A president who uses his office to ask for, or even worse, to compel foreign nations to meddle in our elections is a president who attacks the very foundation of our liberty,"" Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said on the Senate floor. He said it is ""without doubt a crime against the Constitution warranting, demanding, removal from office.""
Mr. Trump and members of the president's defense team as well as many Republican lawmakers have dismissed the impeachment trial as a political assault by Democrats. They also argue that the ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" cited in the Constitution's impeachment clause require the allegation of a crime.
Speaking to reporters during a break in the proceedings, Jay Sekulow, an attorney for Mr. Trump, said the president's defense team will advance ""multiple schools of thought"" about what is an impeachable offense as they argue for his acquittal. ""Our job here is to defend the president, the office of the presidency and the Constitution,"" he said.
One week after the senators were sworn in as trial jurors, Democrats remained hopeful of picking off some Republicans to support their calls for more documents and witnesses, such as hearing from former national security adviser John Bolton. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the chamber's Democratic leader, said his party's presentations at the trial ""may have planted the first seeds in their mind that, yes, perhaps the president did something very wrong here.""
But several Republicans said the presentation wasn't telling them anything new. ""There was certainly a lot of repetition,"" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska), who previously said she was open to supporting votes for new evidence.
Democrats need 51 votes in the GOP-controlled Senate to call witnesses, while a two-thirds supermajority would be required to remove Mr. Trump from office.
Under the rules governing the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history, the House managers and Mr. Trump's defense team each have 24 hours spread over three days to make their arguments. The House team used about eight hours of its time Wednesday and used about eight more Thursday.
Democrats are expected to turn to the second article of impeachment, focused on Mr. Trump's alleged efforts to block documents and testimony sought by House investigators, on Friday.
During his presentation, Mr. Nadler outlined the legal underpinnings of abuse of power, arguing that it has been at the center of previous presidential impeachments. ""The charges set forth in the first article of impeachment are firmly grounded in the Constitution of the United States,"" he said.
The managers played a series of clips, including decades-old videos of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) and Harvard Law Prof. Alan Dershowitz, now a member of Mr. Trump's defense team in which each argued that certain acts deserve impeachment even if they aren't illegal under criminal statutes.
Mr. Dershowitz, in a CNN interview Sunday, said he would argue on the Senate floor that even if House Democrats' allegations about the president are true, they don't rise to the level of an impeachable offense because they aren't crimes. He said he plans to paraphrase an argument made in the 1868 impeachment trial on then-President Andrew Johnson's behalf that only ""criminal-like conduct or conduct that is prohibited by the criminal law"" is impeachable.
The impeachment managers have argued that Mr. Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine as part of an effort to pressure Kyiv to open investigations into Mr. Biden. The Trump administration released the aid in September after protests from lawmakers in both parties.
Much of Thursday's arguments focused on Mr. Trump's request, during a
July 25 phone call
with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, that Ukraine probe Mr. Biden. Mr. Trump also mentioned the subject of aid during the call, but didn't tie the two together.
The impeachment managers addressed in detail Mr. Trump's desire to investigate Mr. Biden, who helped lead an international anticorruption push in Ukraine while vice president. Mr. Biden's son Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukranian natural gas company at the time.
Mr. Trump and his allies have accused Mr. Biden of working to replace a Ukrainian prosecutor to protect his son, but Mr. Biden pressed for the removal with the backing of U.S. allies at a time when the prosecutor's probe into Burisma, the gas company, was dormant.
The Bidens have strenuously denied any wrongdoing.
Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D., Texas), presenting on the Senate floor, said that Mr. Trump asked Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden to harm his presidential campaign and presented slides of polling data that showed Mr. Biden outpacing Mr. Trump. She also moved to debunk the idea that Mr. Biden sought to protect his son.
""The president asked Ukraine for this investigation for one reason and one reason only: because he knew it would be damaging to an opponent who was consistently beating him in the polls and therefore it could help him get re-elected in 2020,"" she said.
Citing testimony before the House from former Ukraine envoy Bill Taylor and former National Security Council official Fiona Hill, lead impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff said: ""There is no question that President Trump's political errand and our national security diverged.""

Later, in his closing remarks, the California Democrat said Mr. Trump posed a danger to the country unless removed from office.
""You can't trust this president to do what's right for this country,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""You can trust he will do what's right for Donald Trump. He'll do it now, he's done it before, he'll do it for the next several months. He'll do it in the election if he's allowed to.""
Some Republicans are pressing for the Senate to call Hunter Biden as a witness.
""The need for the Senate to hear the testimony of Hunter Biden and the need for the Senate to grant the White House lawyers the ability to take that testimony has become all the more relevant,"" said Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas).
The impeachment rules resolution, passed with only Republican support early Wednesday, allows for the Senate to vote on whether to consider new evidence after opening arguments and a 16-hour question-and-answer period are completed.

Republicans have rejected Democrats' calls for a guarantee of new witnesses and documents, arguing that the Democratically-controlled House should have secured them before sending the case to the Senate.
Democrat still hope to earn GOP support for witnesses and other new evidence later in the trial. Several Democrats said the trial so far has only underscored the necessity of obtaining additional materials.
""This isn't a question right now about who's going to be convicted or not convicted,"" said Sen. Michael Bennet (D., Colo.), who is running for president. ""This is a question about whether the American people can have access to these documents, have access to these witnesses.""
Republicans, for their part, have said they are already growing weary of the House managers' arguments.
""They've got 24 hours in which to make their case, but so far they've put about an hour and a half's worth of material,"" said Sen. Mike Rounds (R., S.D.). ""We're hearing it over and over again without new material being presented.""
Mr. Schumer said that if GOP senators are bored by a lack of new information, the solution is to allow new evidence and witnesses.
""The same Republicans who heard nothing new just voted nine times on Tuesday to hear nothing new,"" he said, referring to Democratic amendments defeated earlier in the week.
During his opening remarks, Mr. Schiff said the repetition was necessary to create a full sense of context for the Democratic arguments. ""There is some method to our madness,"" he quipped.

WASHINGTON -- Lev Parnas, an associate of President Trump's personal lawyer, said he warned a top aide to the newly elected Ukrainian president that the U.S. would halt aid to the country if Ukraine didn't announce investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump politically.
In a May meeting with Serhiy Shefir, an aide to Ukrainian president-elect Volodymyr Zelensky, Mr. Parnas delivered the message at the direction of Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's lawyer, he said in an interview with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow on Wednesday.
""Rudy told me after meeting the president at the White House -- he called me, the message was, it wasn't just military aid, it was all aid"" that the U.S. would cut off if Ukraine didn't announce investigations, Mr. Parnas said.
In addition to halting aid, he said he told Mr. Shefir that without an announcement of investigations, the relationships ""would be soured,"" no U.S. officials -- including Vice President Mike Pence -- would show up to Mr. Zelensky's inauguration.
The White House didn't respond to a request for comment. Mr. Shefir in a statement last year said his conversation with Mr. Parnas and his associate, Igor Fruman, was about their request to arrange a meeting with Mr. Giuliani and that military aid wasn't brought up. Mr. Giuliani said he didn't know that Mr. Parnas had relayed such a message to Ukraine.
The efforts by the president, Mr. Giuliani and others to push Ukraine to announce investigations into alleged interference in the 2016 U.S. election and into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden are at the center of the impeachment inquiry, which enters a new phase next week with the start of the Senate trial. Mr. Trump and Mr. Giuliani have denied wrongdoing, and the president has denounced the impeachment.
Mr. Parnas broadly implicated Mr. Trump in efforts by himself and Mr. Giuliani to press Ukrainian officials to announce those investigations.
""President Trump knew exactly what was going on,"" he said on MSNBC. ""He was aware of all of my movements. I wouldn't do anything without the consent of Rudy Giuliani and the president."" Asked why Mr. Trump said he didn't know him last fall, Mr. Parnas replied: ""He lied.""
The recorded interview -- Mr. Parnas's first since his arrest in October on campaign-finance charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty -- coincided with the release by House committees of more than 500 pages of documents Mr. Parnas turned over in recent days.
The documents show Mr. Parnas was in close contact with several high-level members of the president's orbit about his efforts in Ukraine. They also include multiple references to conversations with Mr. Trump or at the White House. ""Be there in ten was on phone with big guy,"" Mr. Giuliani told Mr. Parnas in January 2019. On March 24, Mr. Parnas texted another lawyer: ""On our way to White House.""
Mr. Parnas traded dozens of texts in the spring with Tommy Hicks Jr., who was chairman of the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action until he was named a co-chairman of the Republican National Committee in early 2019, the documents show. The two exchanged links to articles and tweets suggesting Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election and assessing Mr. Biden.
On several occasions, Mr. Hicks texted Mr. Parnas to ""show Rudy"" or ""tell R,"" and expressed interest in speaking to Mr. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, directly.
Mr. Hicks, a close friend of Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, didn't respond to a request for comment.
Others affiliated with America First were in close contact with Mr. Parnas, the text messages show.
""What should I send Don to tweet,"" wrote Joseph Ahearn, director of development at America First Policies, the group's nonprofit arm, on March 20 -- a reference to Mr. Trump Jr.
On March 24, Mr. Parnas sent Mr. Ahearn a link to a Daily Wire article about calls to remove Marie Yovanovitch, the ambassador to Ukraine whom Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Parnas and others were seeking to remove because they believed she was an obstacle to their push for investigations. Mr. Trump Jr. tweeted that link the same day.
Spokespeople for Mr. Trump Jr. and America First both declined to comment.
The president ordered Ms. Yovanovitch removed in April after hearing complaints from Mr. Giuliani and others. She has denied any wrongdoing and told House investigators last fall that she was alarmed that the State Department didn't seek to protect her.

WASHINGTON—An emboldened President Trump turned his focus Sunday to his re-election bid, arguing a growing economy would help him in November, as Democrats' lead impeachment manager vowed to press for the president's removal even as the Senate is virtually certain to acquit him.
""It was all nonsense,"" Mr. Trump said of impeachment during a Fox News interview. ""It's a very serious thing. It should never happen to another president.""
In a separate television appearance, Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) said that in closing arguments in the impeachment trial Monday, Democrats would continue pressing to remove Mr. Trump from office over his Ukraine pressure campaign.
""It's enormously important that the country understand exactly what this president did,"" Mr. Schiff said. The Senate should remove Mr. Trump from office, Mr. Schiff said, ""because he is threatening to still cheat in the next election by soliciting foreign interference.""
The televised comments by Messrs. Trump and Schiff came just ahead of the Iowa caucuses Monday, the State of the Union address Tuesday and the expected acquittal of Mr. Trump by Senate Republicans on Wednesday. They also came as
new polling showed voters' views of him
were little-changed by his impeachment.
In Iowa, site of the nation's first presidential nominating contest, Democratic contenders were crisscrossing the state trying to appeal to the many voters who have said they would make their choice based on who they think has the best chance to unseat the Republican president in November.
""I just want Trump out,"" said Sandy Suplee, a 58-year-old laborer from Pella, Iowa. She said she would set aside her personal preferences among the candidates to support former Vice President Joe Biden, whom she believes has the best odds of winning.
For Trump supporter Susan Ohnysty, a 60-year-old in West Des Moines, impeachment was a ""waste of time,"" adding that the articles of impeachment ""were not meeting the standards of a high crime.""
On Friday,
the Senate voted 51-49
to reject Democrats' demands to call new witnesses in the impeachment trial. That
effectively ended the impeachment effort,
even though the trial is set to resume for four hours of closing arguments Monday, followed by a vote on the articles of impeachment Wednesday.
A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found a majority of voters said they believed Mr. Trump abused his power by asking Ukraine to investigate a potential political opponent in order to influence the coming election, and also that Mr. Trump obstructed Congress by not cooperating with the impeachment inquiry.
But there wasn't majority support for removing him from office. The poll found 49% said he should be allowed to finish his term, compared with 46% who said he should be removed.
Mr. Trump's job approval in the January poll stood at 46%, with 51% disapproving, in line with results throughout the Trump presidency.
Mr. Schiff, when pressed in an interview on CBS on what Democrats would do after Mr. Trump's likely acquittal, said he wasn't looking beyond the trial.
""I'm not letting the senators off the hook,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""We're still going to go into the Senate this week and make the case why this president needs to be removed.""
Asked if Democrats would consider subpoenaing former national security adviser John Bolton—
whose coming book alleges
that the president told him he wanted to hold up aid to Ukraine until he got the investigations he wanted—Mr. Schiff declined to answer definitively but said there are several possible options.
In a separate television appearance on Sunday, one of the president's attorneys in the Senate trial, Alan Dershowitz, argued that there is no need to seek out new information.
""The articles of impeachment did not charge an impeachable offense,"" Mr. Dershowitz said on Fox News. ""So the right answer is to dismiss it and cut it off right there. No amount of witnesses could have changed that conclusion.""
Mr. Dershowitz also reframed one of his arguments last week, about whether Mr. Trump could have believed his re-election was in the national interest.
""If the president did something completely lawful, the fact that part of his motivation may have been to help his election cannot be the quid pro quo,"" he said. ""I don't believe that a president can do anything if he thinks it is in the national interest.""
The Senate impeachment trial commanded 11 days of attention and appeared to be heading for a final vote Saturday. But a decision to break until a resumption this week was bipartisan, Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.) said.
That gave Democratic senators campaigning for president a chance to hit the trail in Iowa, while others got a chance to relax.
Sen. Lindsey Graham headed home to South Carolina, where a pulled pork platter awaited him. ""We all need a break,"" Mr. Graham, a Republican, said. ""This is as close to purgatory as any of us want to get.""
Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democratic presidential hopeful, missed a scheduled campaign appearance at a Friday evening town hall in Des Moines, leaving her campaign co-leaders to hold down the fort.
However, the Senate trial adjourned in enough time for Ms. Warren to show up at a hastily arranged late-night campaign event at a brewery across the street from the town-hall venue.
Some in the White House saw an upside to the timing, with Mr. Trump giving his State of the Union address before his likely acquittal. Eric Ueland, the White House legislative liaison, told reporters it would bring focus to what he said were Mr. Trump's accomplishments while contrasting with the various investigations into the president.
""It's a strong one-two punch,"" he said.

WASHINGTON—Four federal prosecutors withdrew from the case against Roger Stone on Tuesday, with one resigning as an assistant U.S. attorney, as the Justice Department reversed itself and recommended less prison time for President Trump's longtime confidant.
The Justice Department's move to withdraw the recommendation it made on Monday to a U.S. judge and propose a more lenient one came hours after President Trump criticized in a tweet the original request that Mr. Stone spend more than seven years behind bars.
After the reversal became public, Assistant U.S. Attorney Jonathan Kravis, one of the government attorneys who prosecuted Mr. Stone, withdrew from the case and resigned from his post, according to a court filing. Three other prosecutors, Special Assistant U.S. Attorneys Aaron Zelinksy and Adam Jed and Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael Marando, also said in court filings that they were withdrawing from the case.
The fast-moving developments came one day after prosecutors asked for
a seven-to-nine-year sentence
following Mr. Stone's conviction last November for lying to Congress and witness tampering in connection with Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and any contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign.
It was a highly unusual reversal by the Justice Department, which typically hews closely to a set of legal guidelines when recommending punishments.
Mr. Trump had harshly criticized the initial request
in a tweet
and later did so at the White House. ""I thought the whole prosecution was ridiculous,"" he said in the Oval Office. ""I think it's a disgrace.""
Mr. Trump denied that he had intervened in the case and declined to discuss whether he would pardon Mr. Stone or commute his sentence.
Several leading Democrats said the developments suggested Mr. Trump was improperly influencing prosecutors' decisions. ""This is what we feared,"" said Sen. Chris Murphy (D., Conn.). ""The message is now clear: If you commit a felony in support of the president's re-election, there will be protection there for you. It's really, really, really dangerous for the republic.""
Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said officials reached the decision to revise the recommendation on Monday night, before Mr. Trump's tweet. A senior Justice Department official played down the differences in the two main filings, and said the agency wanted to clarify that it believed a sentence below the guidelines would still serve the interests of justice.
In a new sentencing memo filed in court Tuesday evening, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Crabb asked for ""a sentence of incarceration"" but said prosecutors would defer to the judge over the term. He wrote that the previous recommendation ""does not accurately reflect the Department of Justice's position on what would be a reasonable sentence in this matter.""
After the withdrawals, Mr. Crabb was the only prosecutor affiliated with the case.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said he would request that the Justice Department's office of inspector general investigate the matter.
Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the lead manager of the House's impeachment of Mr. Trump, said, ""It would be a blatant abuse of power if President Trump has in fact intervened to reverse the recommendations of career prosecutors at the Department of Justice.""
The ultimate decision on Mr. Stone's punishment rests in the hands of U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who is scheduled to sentence Mr. Stone on Feb. 20. She has the discretion to ignore the government's sentencing recommendations and could ask the government to explain the change.

Mr. Stone was found guilty last year
of misleading Congress about his efforts to make contact with the website WikiLeaks during the 2016 presidential campaign, and of threatening a witness who would contradict his testimony. While first-time offenders like Mr. Stone generally receive sentences of a few months for crimes that include lying to Congress, the witness-tampering count ratchets up Mr. Stone's potential punishment. It carries a 20-year maximum prison term.
Traditionally, presidents go to great lengths to avoid the appearance of interfering in law-enforcement matters. Charging and sentencing decisions are generally left to the line prosecutors and their supervisors.
The appropriate sentence for Mr. Stone has been a topic of some dispute within the Justice Department in recent days, according to people familiar with the matter.
Supervisors and senior Justice Department officials had pushed for more lenient treatment for the 67-year-old Mr. Stone, people familiar with the matter said. In addition, the reversal came just days after Attorney General William Barr named Timothy Shea, a close aide, to become the new U.S. attorney in Washington. Mr. Shea's name appeared on both main filings.
Reached for comment, Bruce Rogow, Mr. Stone's defense attorney, told The Wall Street Journal that he was ""just watching and reading"" the news. Mr. Stone's legal team called for a sentence of no incarceration, citing Mr. Stone's age and his lack of a criminal record.
The witness with whom Mr. Stone was convicted of tampering, New York comedian Randy Credico, asked Judge Jackson in a January letter not to send Mr. Stone to prison, saying such a sentence would be unnecessarily cruel.
Multiple defendants in Mr. Mueller's investigation received sentences of a few weeks in prison for lying to investigators or other crimes. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort has received the longest prison term to date: about 7½ years for tax and bank fraud.

WASHINGTON—President Trump's rare
prime-time speech Wednesday
was designed to reassure the nation about his administration's response to a quickly spreading coronavirus.
Instead, Mr. Trump's scripted speech included errors about health-insurance payments and European travel restrictions, people involved in the speechwriting said Thursday. He also inserted his own mistakes as he spoke, the people said.
During the 10-minute speech—and one stray word suggesting that the U.S. would ban cargo from Europe—stock futures fell sharply, and the global stock rout led to U.S. stocks'
worst drop since 1987
on Thursday.

Coronavirus
has challenged Mr. Trump's unusual leadership style—blunt, improvisational and shoot-from-the-hip—like no other issue to confront his administration. It also has threatened his
economy-focused re-election strategy
.
Mr. Trump in recent days has contradicted the statements of his administration's own experts, challenged official estimates of the mortality rate, misstated how soon a vaccine would be ready, and inaccurately claimed Americans who wanted a test could get one. He has accused Democrats and the media of hyping the virus and likened his handling of the situation to his ""perfect"" call with the Ukrainian president that helped lead to his impeachment by the House.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How has President Trump handled the challenges posed by the coronavirus thus far? Join the conversation below.
The missteps have eroded his political standing and privately frustrated his own team after they had been feeling especially confident. Just last month, Mr. Trump was
acquitted in his impeachment trial
and flexed his power by purging impeachment witnesses from his administration. He delighted in the fractious Democratic presidential primary as his preferred opponent surged. He raised $14 million in a three-day West Coast swing, boasting how his own campaign would reap benefits of a strong election-year economy.
Inside the West Wing, Mr. Trump has decentralized power beneath him, giving as many as a half-dozen White House staffers the ability to report to him directly and go around the chief-of-staff position. As aides were drafting the speech on Wednesday, it was unclear who had authority to approve changes, White House officials said. In some instances it was the vice president's office. Other aides said they sent changes to multiple senior officials, hoping the edits would be made.
The president encourages top advisers to argue in front of him, often deciding the direction of a policy based on which staffer argues more forcefully. He is rarely burdened by details, preferring graphics and bullet points to dense briefing books. And he insists on being his own communicator in chief.
That approach to handling the virus, so far, hasn't worn well with Americans, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Monday that showed 49% of those surveyed disapproved of Mr. Trump's response compared with 43% who approved. It has resulted in Mr. Trump at times playing down the seriousness of a virus that government health experts predict will get worse. His task force has been riven by internal divisions he has fostered for years.
Privately, Mr. Trump has been angered by the news coverage of his response, telling advisers that he viewed the outbreak of the novel virus on par with the flu or SARS, the severe acute respiratory syndrome that caused no deaths in the U.S.
Multiple White House officials said that the policies outlined by the president on Wednesday would help prevent a spike in virus infections in the U.S., adding that any errors from the speech were quickly corrected and that challenges always arise when trying to implement major actions with urgency. A spokesman pointed to the president's decision in January to stop travel from China as a key move that has already helped curb spread of the virus.
""This White House is working around the clock to protect all Americans from the coronavirus,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere said. ""As President Trump said last night, we are using the full power of the federal government and the private sector.""
The speech on Wednesday, a rare address to the nation from the Oval Office, was based on extensive dictation from the president and suggestions from Vice President Mike Pence, who told fellow White House officials that insurance executives had promised in a private meeting to waive copayments for coronavirus treatments, according to people familiar with the matter. Those companies dispute that claim.
It was written largely by Stephen Miller, the president's senior policy adviser, and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, and overseen by staff secretary Derek Lyons. The three men, all White House staffers since Mr. Trump took office, haven't been deeply involved in the coronavirus response, White House officials said.
Mr. Kushner hasn't attended a single task force meeting, according to one official who has attended each meeting. Many of the officials who have been working on the issue for weeks said they were cut out or ignored during the speech writing.
The result was a speech that White House officials said hit the correct themes, but was riddled with errors.
But the speech itself caused a divide inside the White House. Mr. Kushner was among those who thought it was important to deliver an address to calm fears and show the administration's seriousness. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway advised against it, telling colleagues that it was a terrible idea and the message could be conveyed through a videotaped message that the president could release on Twitter.
Mr. Trump signed off on the speech and the latest travel ban during a three-hour meeting in the Oval Office in which his top advisers offered competing viewpoints on the prohibition. Aides described the meeting as sober and calm, and one in which Mr. Trump wanted his team united behind the decision. Vice President Pence, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf were among about a dozen officials in the room.
Still, aides emerged from the meeting unsure if the speech would happen: Mr. Trump had more meetings lined up in the afternoon, including one with bank executives. Those were the types of meetings, aides warned, at which Mr. Trump would sometimes change his mind on previously agreed-upon decisions and upend the White House's fragile policy process.
The speech was being rewritten up until the time it was fed into the teleprompter, aides said. And there were multiple mistakes. Insurance companies aren't waiving deductibles for coronavirus treatment, as Mr. Trump read from the remarks. Nor are there exemptions in the new travel ban from Europe for Americans who have undergone health screenings; the ban is on foreign nationals, not Americans. The administration is working on a second parallel policy aimed at screening Americans returning home from abroad.
Mr. Trump then inserted his own costly mistake, according to a review of draft speeches and officials familiar with the process. Instead of saying that the travel ban won't apply to trade and cargo, Mr. Trump inserted an extra word, saying the prohibitions ""will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo."" White House aides who had been part of the task force meetings for the past week, where the EU ban was debated, were furious, and Mr. Trump later had to clean up the mistake via Twitter.
The Trump administration has issued multiple travel bans, including several aimed at Muslim-majority countries, two aimed at halting illegal immigration and, now, three related to the coronavirus. The latest ban mirrored the previous two, none of which applied to trade or cargo, a point that was raised at a task force meeting earlier in the day on Wednesday.
On a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week, Mr. Trump wore a red ""Keep America Great"" campaign hat and compared his handling of the outbreak to his phone call with the Ukrainian president, a conversation that directly led to his impeachment. ""This was not as perfect as that,"" Mr. Trump said. ""But pretty good.""
Mr. Trump disputed the virus's estimated death rate given by the World Health Organization,
citing his ""hunch""
that it was lower. He said a vaccine may be ready within months, despite doctors, drug company executives and his own administration's health officials telling him that it was at least a year away. He said that coronavirus tests were available for anyone who wants one, which was inaccurate then and remains so a week later.
""That's not how diagnostic testing works in the United States or, frankly, almost anywhere in the world,"" Mr. Azar said about the president's remark on March 10.
The president also has personalized the crisis, focusing closely on market declines, which he ties directly to his prospects for re-election. Last week, he didn't want a Carnival Corp. cruise ship with sick passengers aboard to dock on the West Coast because of how it would reflect on him.
""I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship,"" he said March 6. ""That wasn't our fault.""
The ship eventually docked.
The president also has spent weeks playing down the disease. On Feb. 26, he told reporters that there were only 15 people infected and the total ""within a couple days is going to be down to close to zero.""
He also was reluctant to sign off on the first virus-related travel ban aimed at China, concerned about the signal it would send to markets and his relationship with President Xi Jinping, aides said. He eventually agreed to it on the advice of Mr. Azar, aides said, and now touts it as one of his proudest actions during the crisis. Mr. Trump was more resigned this week to the idea of restricting between the U.S. and the Schengen region in Europe, aides said.
At the same time, the White House has been taking precautions to protect the president. Extra cleanings are happening in the West Wing. Hand sanitizer is widely available. And the Secret Service now checks if visitors have visited any foreign countries in the past 30 days.
Still, Mr. Trump has maintained an optimistic view of the potential effects of coronavirus from the start. In some of his first public remarks on the topic, during a meeting on Jan. 22 with Kurdistan President Masoud Barzani in Davos, Switzerland, the president said ""we've already handled it very well"" when asked if he had a plan for coronavirus in the U.S. ""We're in very good shape,"" he said.

The U.S. reported its first confirmed case that week and now has more than 1,300. The administration continues to struggle to provide enough test kits to health labs.
Mick Mulvaney, then the acting staff chief, assembled the first coronavirus meeting Jan. 27. It attracted a standing-room-only crowd of administration officials to the Situation Room, but there was no agenda and no seating chart.
For the next hour, senior officials opined and bickered, setting a tone for the divisions that continue.
Mr. Azar informed the group his agency would coordinate daily operations, putting several officials on the defensive. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao warned about the adverse economic side effects from restricting travel, a concern that came off as callous to some in the room. A spokesman for Ms. Chao disputed the characterization of her comments, saying she agreed with others in the meeting that the health and safety of Americans should be paramount.
""I don't think this is working,"" Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy secretary for Homeland Security, barked at the room, according to people present.
Mr. Pence entered the room about halfway through. He displaced Mr. Mulvaney from the head of the table and looked over his shoulder where he noticed the presidential seal hanging on the wall. With the rest of the room waiting, he swiveled around, reached up and removed it out of deference for the office.
Mr. Mulvaney asked for discretion from the room, noting that their internal discussion could impact financial markets.
The most sensitive detail discussed—the China travel ban—leaked into the public within 24 hours.

WASHINGTON -- An emboldened President Trump turned his focus Sunday to his re-election bid, arguing a growing economy would help him in November, as Democrats' lead impeachment manager vowed to press for the president's removal even as the Senate is virtually certain to acquit him.
""It was all nonsense,"" Mr. Trump said of impeachment during a Fox News interview. ""It's a very serious thing. It should never happen to another president.""
In a separate television appearance, Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) said that in closing arguments in the impeachment trial Monday, Democrats would continue pressing to remove Mr. Trump from office over his Ukraine pressure campaign.
""It's enormously important that the country understand exactly what this president did,"" Mr. Schiff said. The Senate should remove Mr. Trump from office, Mr. Schiff said, ""because he is threatening to still cheat in the next election by soliciting foreign interference.""
The televised comments by Messrs. Trump and Schiff came just ahead of the Iowa caucuses Monday, the State of the Union address Tuesday and the expected acquittal of Mr. Trump by Senate Republicans on Wednesday. They also came as new polling showed voters' views of him were little-changed by his impeachment.
In Iowa, site of the nation's first presidential nominating contest, Democratic contenders were crisscrossing the state trying to appeal to the many voters who have said they would make their choice based on who they think has the best chance to unseat the Republican president in November.
""I just want Trump out,"" said Sandy Suplee, a 58-year-old laborer from Pella, Iowa. She said she would set aside her personal preferences among the candidates to support former Vice President Joe Biden, whom she believes has the best odds of winning.
For Trump supporter Susan Ohnysty, a 60-year-old in West Des Moines, impeachment was a ""waste of time,"" adding that the articles of impeachment ""were not meeting the standards of a high crime.""
On Friday, the Senate voted 51-49 to reject Democrats' demands to call new witnesses in the impeachment trial. That effectively ended the impeachment effort, even though the trial is set to resume for four hours of closing arguments Monday, followed by a vote on the articles of impeachment Wednesday.
A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found a majority of voters said they believed Mr. Trump abused his power by asking Ukraine to investigate a potential political opponent in order to influence the coming election, and also that Mr. Trump obstructed Congress by not cooperating with the impeachment inquiry.
But there wasn't majority support for removing him from office. The poll found 49% said he should be allowed to finish his term, compared with 46% who said he should be removed.
Mr. Trump's job approval in the January poll stood at 46%, with 51% disapproving, in line with results throughout the Trump presidency.
Mr. Schiff, when pressed in an interview on CBS on what Democrats would do after Mr. Trump's likely acquittal, said he wasn't looking beyond the trial.
""I'm not letting the senators off the hook,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""We're still going to go into the Senate this week and make the case why this president needs to be removed.""
Asked if Democrats would consider subpoenaing former national security adviser John Bolton -- whose coming book alleges that the president told him he wanted to hold up aid to Ukraine until he got the investigations he wanted -- Mr. Schiff declined to answer definitively but said there are several possible options.
In a separate television appearance on Sunday, one of the president's attorneys in the Senate trial, Alan Dershowitz, argued that there is no need to seek out new information.
""The articles of impeachment did not charge an impeachable offense,"" Mr. Dershowitz said on Fox News. ""So the right answer is to dismiss it and cut it off right there. No amount of witnesses could have changed that conclusion.""
Mr. Dershowitz also reframed one of his arguments last week, about whether Mr. Trump could have believed his re-election was in the national interest. ""If the president did something completely lawful, the fact that part of his motivation may have been to help his election cannot be the quid pro quo,"" he said. ""I don't believe that a president can do anything if he thinks it is in the national interest.""
The Senate impeachment trial commanded 11 days of attention and appeared to be heading for a final vote Saturday. But a decision to break until a resumption this week was bipartisan, Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.) said. That gave Democratic senators campaigning for president a chance to hit the trail in Iowa, while others got a chance to relax.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) headed home, where a pulled pork platter awaited him. ""We all need a break,"" Mr. Graham said. ""This is as close to purgatory as any of us want to get.""
Some in the White House saw an upside to the timing, with Mr. Trump giving his State of the Union address before his likely acquittal. Eric Ueland, the White House legislative liaison, told reporters it would bring focus to what he said were Mr. Trump's accomplishments while contrasting with the various investigations into the president.

WASHINGTON -- Taking a victory lap a day after he was acquitted in the Senate impeachment trial, President Trump said he ""went through hell"" during what he deemed a politically driven investigation and called top Democrats ""very evil and sick people"" for seeking his removal from office.
Before an audience of aides and Republican allies, Mr. Trump offered freewheeling remarks from the East Room of the White House on Thursday. Speaking for just over an hour, he characterized the event as a celebration, while taking swings at political rivals who he alleged have been targeting him since he took office.
""We've been going through this now for over three years. It was evil, it was corrupt, it was dirty cops, it was leakers and liars, and this should never, ever happen to another president, ever,"" Mr. Trump said.
Holding up a copy of a newspaper with the headline ""Trump Acquitted,"" he quipped: ""It's the only good headline I've had in the Washington Post.""
He reiterated his stance that he did nothing improper regarding Ukraine, and called former special counsel Robert Mueller's earlier probe into possible ties between his 2016 campaign and Russia ""all bullshit.""
The remarks came one day after the Republican-led Senate acquitted Mr. Trump on two articles of impeachment stemming from his efforts to press Ukraine to announce investigations that would benefit him politically in this year's election, including a probe of former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic presidential candidate.
Mr. Trump's comments about Democratic leaders also came on the heels of his State of the Union speech on Tuesday, when he didn't shake the hand offered by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), and she ripped up her copy of his address at its conclusion.
""He is impeached forever, no matter what he says or the headlines he wanted to carry around,"" Mrs. Pelosi said in remarks to reporters on Thursday. She added that Mr. Trump was ""never getting rid of that scar.""
Mrs. Pelosi also defended tearing up the speech, calling the address ""a manifesto of mistruths"" and her action necessary to ""get the attention of the American people.""
The combative comments from Mr. Trump on Thursday and the vigorous response from Mrs. Pelosi made clear that the rancorous political climate between Democrats and Republicans will continue even with impeachment over.
Republicans cheered Mr. Trump's acquittal in the Senate and have called his impeachment part of a three-year effort to delegitimize the 2016 election and remove the president from office nine months before Democrats face him again at the ballot box.
Democrats said Mr. Trump's acquittal amounted to a defeat for the institution of Congress, and they warned that leaving Mr. Trump in office would free him to try to cheat again in this year's election.
In his White House event, the mood was triumphant, with guests slapping each other on the back. The crowd gave Mr. Trump more than a half-dozen standing ovations. He thanked various supporters in the room by name, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.). Mr. Trump also thanked his Senate impeachment legal team.
He didn't mention personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, whose efforts in Ukraine were at the center of the impeachment. Mr. Giuliani wasn't in attendance.
Mr. Trump also continued his criticism of Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah), who was the lone Republican to vote to convict the president on the first article of impeachment. Without naming him, Mr. Trump said there were ""some that used religion as a crutch"" and called him a failed presidential candidate.
Mr. Romney, the 2012 GOP candidate against President Obama, said Wednesday that he was a very religious person and reached an ""inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded"" that he vote to convict Mr. Trump.
Mr. Trump took two tacks toward Democrats in his White House speech. He called for bipartisanship, citing infrastructure and drug prices as areas of common interest. If Republicans and Democrats work together, ""what we can do is incredible,"" he said.
But he also continued to question the goodwill of Democrats. Earlier, in remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast, Mr. Trump appeared to reference Mrs. Pelosi, saying he doesn't like ""people who say, 'I pray for you,' when they know that's not so.""
Mrs. Pelosi, who was seated near the lectern, clapped as he entered the room. Later, she told reporters that she did pray for Mr. Trump, while criticizing his actions in office as ""so off the track of our Constitution, our values, our country.""
Mr. Trump's appearance at the breakfast marked the fourth year he has addressed the annual gathering, which is hosted by members of Congress and has been running since 1953.
Before Mr. Trump spoke, there was a keynote address from Arthur Brooks, former president of the American Enterprise Institute, who urged the audience to rise above the divided political climate.
Mr. Trump, known for his combative style, acknowledged the message when he took the lectern, but said: ""Arthur, I don't know if I agree with you.""

DES MOINES, Iowa -- In Iowa days before the state's kickoff caucuses, President Trump pumped up a megarally while Vice President Mike Pence ordered a deluxe burger.
Showcasing their commitment to a key early-voting and general-election state, the president and vice president both traveled to Iowa on Thursday and illustrated their contrasting campaign styles in the process.
The president landed in the state on Air Force One that night. He addressed thousands of supporters packed into an arena at Drake University, declaring, ""We are going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats.""
His vice president arrived earlier for a daylong bus tour that included the kind of traditional political pit stops that his boss rarely makes: chatting with voters at fast-food joints and diners. He stopped by a Culver's -- a Midwestern staple known for its ""ButterBurgers"" and frozen custard -- where he greeted a pastor and a mother with her little girl and ordered a Culver's deluxe with bacon. Later, he posed for pictures at Des Moines' Drake Diner.
With Mr. Trump's impeachment trial gripping Washington, both the president and vice president were seeking to redirect attention to the 2020 race and energize state Republicans days before Monday's caucuses.
The visits reflect their campaign's effort to boost turnout and test its muscle in an important general-election state.
Speaking in Des Moines, Mr. Trump touted his new trade deal with Canada and Mexico, as well as the ""phase one"" trade agreement with China, framing the deals as important to Iowa's agricultural community.
""I have a place in my heart for the farmers,"" he said.
The president said congressional Democrats are ""obsessed with a deranged witch hunt hoax,"" again referring to the impeachment proceedings as ""impeachment light."" And he criticized several Democratic presidential hopefuls, including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Vice President Joe Biden.
""Joe had a crowd that was so small the other day that they set up a roundtable,"" Mr. Trump said.
Mr. Pence crisscrossed Iowa on Thursday in a bus. During a speech before evangelical voters in Sioux City, the vice president sought to keep the focus on his boss, declaring: ""I just spoke to him on the bus, told him I was in Sioux City, Iowa, and I think he sounded just a little bit jealous.""
Connie Schmett, co-chair of the Republican Party of Polk County, Iowa, said Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence were a good pair.
""With President Trump, we have so many people that are so excited about this man because he is not the normal politician,"" she said. ""Vice President Pence is a little more mainstream. He's soft-spoken. He's a kind man. I think they complement each other.""
With no serious Republican challenger, the president is expected to win his party's caucuses easily. Still, more than 80 surrogates are scheduled to flood the state for the voting on Monday.

WASHINGTON—At a White House event celebrating his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial, President Trump singled out Rep. Bradley Byrne. The mention was brief: ""Bradley Byrne, Alabama. What a great place. Thank you, Bradley.""
Within hours, Mr. Byrne's Senate campaign had created an ad emphasizing the House lawmaker's support of the president and was pushing it on digital platforms. The next day, it was on television in Alabama.
The race to win the Republican primary in Alabama is a contest of fealty to President Trump, with top candidates competing to show who is the most loyal ahead of the
contest Tuesday
. Unless one candidate gets a majority, the top two finishers will advance to a runoff. The winner will face Sen. Doug Jones, the Democrat who narrowly won the
special election
in 2017.
The top three GOP candidates are former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who is working to win back the Senate seat he held for 20 years; former Auburn University football head coach Tommy Tuberville; and Mr. Byrne, a four-term House Republican.
""A key will be whether President Trump remains neutral or takes a side,"" said Alabama Republican Rep. Mo Brooks, adding he can envision a scenario in which Mr. Trump endorses any of the three top candidates. ""Who knows?""
A formal endorsement isn't expected to come before Tuesday. While the candidates are professing their loyalty to the president, all are being attacked for moments when they broke with him, a sign of the hold Mr. Trump has on his party as he runs for re-election. The president won Alabama by 28 percentage points in 2016.
""Each of them has something that dents that armor that forces them to not just double down but triple down on being the most Trumpian person out there,"" said Republican strategist Doug Heye of the race.
Candidates see the primary race as a tougher obstacle than the general election in the fall, in which Republicans are expected to turn out to support the president. Mr. Jones is the first Democrat to represent the state in the Senate since 1997. He won by just 2 percentage points after the Republican nominee, Roy Moore, was
accused by several women of sexual misconduct
that they say occurred when they were underage.
Mr. Moore denied the allegations. He is running again but isn't expected to make the runoff.
Mr. Jones heads into the race with $7.4 million cash on hand, more than double the amount any Republican candidate has raised, according to the Federal Election Commission. Mr. Byrne has raised $3.4 million and spent more than half of it on the primary, while Mr. Tuberville has raised $2.4 million and has $1.1 million left. Mr. Sessions has raised nearly $1 million in this cycle, though he had money available from previous campaigns.
While Mr. Sessions leads in many polls, he doesn't appear to have enough support to avoid a runoff. Though Mr. Sessions was the first U.S. senator to endorse Mr. Trump in his bid for the White House, Mr. Trump's supporters have criticized Mr. Sessions for recusing himself as attorney general from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The president needled Mr. Sessions repeatedly in tweets during the Alabaman's tumultuous time in the administration, forced him to resign and later said appointing him was his ""biggest mistake,"" a point that has been used by both Messrs. Byrne and Tuberville.
Alabama Republican Sen. Richard Shelby has been advocating for Mr. Sessions and is hoping he comes back to the Senate. Mr. Sessions himself has pledged his loyalty to Mr. Trump in many of his ads.
""He didn't stick with the president when the president really needed him,"" said Perry Hooper, a former state representative and a current member of the State Republican Executive Committee. He is backing Mr. Tuberville, who he says is an outsider to Washington, as the president was when he first ran for office.
Still, early in his campaign, Mr. Tuberville criticized Mr. Trump's handling of veterans' issues and said he was ""pissed off at Donald Trump"" over it. Mr. Sessions is running an ad calling the comments a ""vicious attack"" against the president. Mr. Tuberville has made veterans' care a central point of his campaign, and recent ads attack his opponents as being too oriented toward Washington.

How do you expect the policies and personality of President Trump to affect GOP Senate races? Join the conversation below.
""Weak-kneed career politicians aren't tough enough to stand with President Trump,"" he said in a television ad. ""But I am."" Mr. Tuberville didn't respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Byrne has highlighted his voting record, saying he votes with the president 97% of the time. But Mr. Byrne has been attacked for distancing himself from the president after video surfaced in October 2016 of Mr. Trump speaking to a host of NBC's ""Access Hollywood"" about grabbing women. Mr. Byrne now regrets criticizing the president for his comments.
""I think I spoke rashly,"" he said in an interview.

WASHINGTON -- House Democrats cited witnesses and documents the White House kept from impeachment investigators to press their case that President Trump has obstructed Congress, seeking to win over enough Republican senators to subpoena additional materials.
Friday marked the last chance for the Democratic managers -- House lawmakers acting as prosecutors -- to make their opening pitch to GOP senators who may be wavering on whether to subpoena witnesses and documents. Democrats say the material could bolster the allegation that Mr. Trump improperly withheld nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine as leverage for the country to open investigations into Vice President Joe Biden, a potential election opponent, then tried to cover it up.
Mr. Trump ""invited foreign interference in our elections and sold out our country's security for his personal benefit, and betrayed the nation's trust to a foreign power,"" House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) said.
Later, in his closing remarks in a tense Senate chamber, Mr. Schiff read out each allegation against Mr. Trump, then adding: ""The facts have been proved. Those facts are not contested. We have met our burden,"" he said. He concluded shortly before 9 p.m. with an appeal to senators: ""I ask you, I implore you, give America a fair trial.""
Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing. He derided the Democrats' presentation Friday, saying in an interview with Fox News: ""They've been telling so many lies, so many fabrications, so much exaggeration. And this is not impeachable.""
The president's legal team will kick off its three days of arguments Saturday morning, when it plans to speak for two to three hours, a person on the team said. The White House plans to save the bulk of its arguments for Monday and Tuesday, when there will be more TV viewers, a person familiar with the discussions said.
Rep. Jason Crow (D., Colo.) led off the Democratic arguments Friday, wrapping up managers' presentation of the first article of impeachment, alleging abuse of power. Mr. Crow ran through the chronology surrounding the frozen Ukraine aid, which was later released amid media reports and a bipartisan outcry in Congress. The hold on the aid ""was only lifted because President Trump had gotten caught,"" he said.
Managers spent the bulk of Friday, however, on the second article of impeachment, which accuses Mr. Trump of trying to thwart the House inquiry by directing witnesses not to testify, refusing to allow the release of documents and ordering executive-branch agencies to do the same.
""We are here today in response to a blanket order issued by President Trump directing the entire executive branch to withhold all documents and testimony from that inquiry,"" said Rep. Val Demings (D., Fla.). ""President Trump's obstruction of the impeachment inquiry was categorical, indiscriminate, and historically unprecedented.""
Mr. Schiff said the second impeachment article, alleging obstruction, was just as important as the first article, alleging abuse of power. If lawmakers ""lack the power to investigate a president, there will never be an article one, whether that article one is abuse of power, or that article one is treason, or that article one is bribery,"" he said. ""If you can't have the ability to enforce an impeachment power, you might as well not put it in the Constitution.""
Democrats said House committees issued 71 categories of document requests or subpoenas last year to the White House, the Office of the Vice President, the Office of Management and Budget and the State, Defense and Energy departments. The White House blocked all of the requests.
Senate Democrats have said they want to subpoena a slice of those documents, including emails from National Security Council officials who expressed concern about Mr. Trump's decision to delay aid to Ukraine, and about a July 10 meeting in which the U.S. ambassador to the European Union urged Ukrainian officials to announce investigations as a way to get a Oval Office meeting with Mr. Trump and his Ukrainian counterpart.
Senate Democrats also want to hear from at least four witnesses, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton. In total, 12 current or former administration officials declined to testify as part of the House impeachment inquiry.
It would take a simple majority of 51 senators to vote for the additional evidence, meaning that at least four Republicans would have to vote with all 47 senators in the Democratic caucus. If Democrats can't muster those four GOP votes, the trial could end as soon as next week.
Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee are among those who have said they would be open to witnesses.
White House officials have said they don't expect any Republicans to vote in favor of hearing from more witnesses, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) is privately far less certain, people familiar with the talks said.
During the trial, Mr. McConnell is using daily closed-door lunches as a venue for GOP senators to have frank exchanges and relay feedback to party leadership. Among the arguments some Republicans are making at lunch and in private conversations is that voting in favor of witness testimony would further prolong the trial, people familiar with the talks said. Mr. McConnell has made that case publicly.

WASHINGTON—President Trump's legal team said Democrats had failed to make a case for removing the president from office, arguing at his impeachment trial Saturday that there was no evidence he pushed Ukraine's president for an investigation of his political rival in exchange for aid.
In their first chance to address the Senate after three days of arguments by Democratic House impeachment managers, the president's lawyers sought to undercut the Democrats' case that Mr. Trump abused the power of his office by asking a foreign leader to investigate a political rival and obstructed Congress's impeachment inquiry.
The defense team, opting to use just two hours of its time, argued that the president's actions were in the national interest and that Democrats' investigation was politically motivated.
""They're asking you not only to overturn the results of the last election…they're asking you to remove President Trump from the ballot in an election that's occurring in approximately nine months,"" White House counsel Pat Cipollone told senators as he opened the session. ""We don't believe that they have come anywhere close to meeting their burden for what they're asking you to do.""
The defense team's arguments will pick back up on Monday. But unlike Democrats, who used nearly 24 hours over three days, the president's team is expected to use around eight hours of its allotted time, an administration official said.
With the chance of conviction in the Republican-controlled Senate virtually zero, the primary task facing the president's legal team is to dissuade on-the-fence Republican senators from voting in favor of hearing more testimony from witnesses. Democrats have tried to impress on the chamber the need to hear from witnesses whose testimony the White House blocked during the House investigation, among them acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton.
Mr. Trump's team took aim at House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, who also has been criticized by Mr. Trump. Republicans have accused Mr. Schiff's office of coordinating with the whistleblower whose complaint described Mr. Trump's efforts to solicit Ukraine's help in investigating former Vice President Joe Biden, a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination this year. Mr. Schiff denies that his office coordinated with the whistleblower.
Mr. Schiff has acknowledged the whistleblower approached a staff member in his office before filing a formal complaint, but his office said it informed the person to seek legal counsel, as it customarily does when approached by would-be whistleblowers. Mr. Schiff said last year he ""should have been much more clear"" when he previously said his committee hadn't been in touch with the whistleblower. Mr. Schiff said Friday that Republicans were merely trying to distract from the case.
Much of Saturday's session was focused on the transcript of the president's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which he
asked his counterpart to investigate
Mr. Biden and his son, as well as alleged interference by Ukraine in the 2016 U.S. election. Mr. Trump ordered nearly $400 million
in aid to Ukraine frozen
more than a week before that call.
Mr. Cipollone and his deputy, Mike Purpura, argued that the transcript shows the president didn't explicitly condition aid on the investigations, and that Mr. Zelensky repeatedly agreed with the president on the call. The lawyers also noted Mr. Zelensky's public statements that he didn't feel pressured by Mr. Trump.
While Mr. Trump didn't explicitly bring up aid, Mr. Zelensky told him his country wanted to order more Javelin missiles from the U.S., to which Mr. Trump responded: ""I would like you to do us a favor, though."" By the time of the call, Mr. Zelensky had been told by several administration officials and people close to the president that he needed to assure Mr. Trump he was willing to undertake the investigations if he wanted a White House meeting, according to testimony to House investigators.
The president's team sought to portray the Democratic House managers as disingenuous, punctuating their sentences with phrases such as: ""This is what the House managers didn't tell you."" They also took repeated jabs at the length of Democrats' arguments, promising the chamber to be ""respectful of your time.""
The lawyers tried to cast doubt on testimony by witnesses who said they understood the aid to be linked to an investigations, playing a video clip of Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland saying the words ""presume"" and ""presumption."" Democrats have noted that the White House has blocked from testifying officials who would have direct knowledge of the relationship between the frozen aid and the push for investigations.
The president's lawyers argued that Mr. Trump couldn't have been leveraging aid to pressure Ukraine to undertake investigations because Kyiv wasn't aware of the hold. But a top Defense Department official told House investigators in November that Ukraine inquired about the status of the aid on the day of the call with Mr. Zelensky.
Senate Democrats criticized the defense's presentation. ""I don't think the president's counsel did a very good job,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) told reporters. ""If you're a Republican and you think that the case that was made today was strong, then why not have witnesses and documents if you think both sides made their case?""
Four Republicans would need to join all 47 Democratic senators to pass a motion in favor of hearing more testimony from witnesses. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) is privately concerned that some Republicans could vote for more testimony, people familiar with the discussions said.
But Saturday's session appeared to have changed few Republicans' minds. ""I don't think there will be any need for witnesses at all,"" Sen. Ron Johnson (R., Wis.) said. ""The sooner we can conclude this, the better."" Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) said he would ""likely"" be in favor of calling witnesses, which he has said repeatedly in recent weeks.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Which points of the White House's defense do you agree with and which do you not? Why? Join the conversation below.
Saturday's truncated session arose partly because the White House wanted to present some arguments from Democrats and to provide fodder for Sunday television shows, but save the bulk of its arguments for Monday and Tuesday, when viewers will be more tuned in.
Mr. Trump on Friday complained about his team's turn starting on a Saturday, which he tweeted ""is called Death Valley in T.V.""

WASHINGTON -- President Trump's rare prime-time speech Wednesday was designed to reassure the nation about his administration's response to a quickly spreading coronavirus.
Instead, Mr. Trump's scripted speech included errors about health-insurance payments and European travel restrictions, people involved in the speechwriting said Thursday. He also inserted his own mistakes as he spoke, the people said.
During the 10-minute speech -- with its one stray word suggesting that the U.S. would ban cargo from Europe -- stock futures fell sharply, and the global market rout that followed led to U.S. stocks' worst drop since 1987 on Thursday.
Coronavirus has challenged Mr. Trump's unusual leadership style -- blunt, improvisational and shoot-from-the-hip -- like no other issue to confront his administration. It also has threatened his economy-focused re-election strategy.
Mr. Trump in recent days has contradicted the statements of his administration's own experts, challenged official estimates of the mortality rate, misstated how soon a vaccine would be ready, and inaccurately claimed Americans who wanted a test could get one. He has accused Democrats and the media of hyping the virus and likened his handling of the situation to his ""perfect"" call with the Ukrainian president that led to his impeachment.
The missteps have eroded his political standing and privately frustrated his own team after they had been feeling especially confident. Just last month, Mr. Trump was acquitted in his impeachment trial and flexed his power by purging impeachment witnesses from his administration. He delighted in the fractious Democratic presidential primary. He raised $14 million in a West Coast swing, boasting how his own campaign would reap benefits of a strong economy.
Inside the West Wing, Mr. Trump has decentralized power beneath him, giving as many as a half-dozen White House staffers the ability to report to him directly and go around the chief-of-staff position. As aides were drafting the speech on Wednesday, it was unclear who had authority to approve changes, White House officials said. In some instances it was the vice president's office. Other aides said they sent changes to multiple senior officials, hoping the edits would be made.
The president encourages top advisers to argue in front of him, often deciding the direction of a policy based on which staffer argues more forcefully. He is rarely burdened by details, preferring graphics and bullet points to dense briefing books. And he insists on being his own communicator in chief.
That approach to handling the virus, so far, hasn't worn well with Americans, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released Monday that showed 49% of those surveyed disapproved of Mr. Trump's response compared with 43% who approved. It has resulted in Mr. Trump at times playing down the seriousness of a virus that government health experts predict will get worse.
Privately, Mr. Trump has been angered by news coverage, telling advisers that he viewed the outbreak of the novel virus on par with the flu or SARS, the severe acute respiratory syndrome that caused no deaths in the U.S.
Multiple White House officials said that the policies outlined by the president on Wednesday would help prevent a spike in virus infections in the U.S., adding that any errors from the speech were quickly corrected and that challenges always arise when trying to implement major actions with urgency. A spokesman pointed to the president's decision in January to stop travel from China as a key move that has already helped curb spread of the virus.
""This White House is working around the clock to protect all Americans from the coronavirus,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere said. ""As President Trump said last night, we are using the full power of the federal government and the private sector.""
The speech on Wednesday from the Oval Office was based on extensive dictation from the president and suggestions from Vice President Mike Pence, who told fellow officials that insurance executives had promised in a private meeting to waive copayments for coronavirus treatments, according to people familiar with the matter. Those companies dispute that claim.
It was written largely by Stephen Miller, the president's senior policy adviser, and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, and overseen by staff secretary Derek Lyons. The three men, all White House staffers since Mr. Trump took office, haven't been deeply involved in the coronavirus response, officials said.
Mr. Kushner hasn't attended a single task-force meeting, according to one official who has attended each meeting. Many of the officials who have been working on the issue for weeks said they were cut out or ignored during the speech writing.
The result was a speech that White House officials said hit the correct themes, but was riddled with errors.
But the speech itself caused a divide inside the White House. Mr. Kushner was among those who thought it was important to deliver an address to calm fears and show the administration's seriousness. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway advised against it, telling colleagues that it was a terrible idea and the message could be conveyed through a videotaped message that the president could release on Twitter.
Mr. Trump signed off on the speech and the latest travel ban during a three-hour meeting in the Oval Office. Still, aides emerged from the meeting unsure if the speech would happen: Mr. Trump had more meetings lined up in the afternoon, including one with bank executives. Those were the types of meetings, aides warned, at which Mr. Trump would sometimes change his mind on previously agreed-upon decisions and upend the White House's fragile policy process.
The speech was being rewritten up until the time it was fed into the teleprompter, aides said. And there were multiple mistakes. Insurance companies aren't waiving deductibles for coronavirus treatment, as Mr. Trump read from the remarks. Nor are there exemptions in the new travel ban from Europe for Americans who have undergone health screenings; the ban is on foreign nationals, not Americans. The administration is working on a second parallel policy aimed at screening Americans returning home from abroad.
Mr. Trump then inserted his own costly mistake, according to a review of draft speeches and officials familiar with the process. Instead of saying that the travel ban won't apply to trade and cargo, Mr. Trump inserted an extra word, saying the prohibitions ""will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo."" White House aides who had been part of the task force meetings for the past week, where the EU ban was debated, were furious, and Mr. Trump later had to clean up the mistake via Twitter.
It was the latest in a series of misstatements about the health crisis that have drawn criticism.
On a visit to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last week, Mr. Trump wore a red ""Keep America Great"" campaign hat and compared his handling of the outbreak to his phone call with the Ukrainian president, a conversation that led to his impeachment. ""This was not as perfect as that,"" Mr. Trump said. ""But pretty good.""
Mr. Trump said a vaccine may be ready within months, despite his own administration's health officials telling him that it was at least a year away. He said that coronavirus tests were available for anyone who wants one, which remains inaccurate.
""That's not how diagnostic testing works in the United States or, frankly, almost anywhere in the world,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said about the president's remark on Tuesday.
The president also has personalized the crisis, focusing closely on market declines, which he ties directly to his prospects for re-election. Last week, he didn't want a Carnival Corp. cruise ship with sick passengers aboard to dock on the West Coast because of how it would reflect on him.
""I don't need to have the numbers double because of one ship,"" he said March 6. ""That wasn't our fault.""
The ship eventually docked.
The president also has spent weeks playing down the disease. On Feb. 26, he told reporters that there were only 15 people infected and the total ""within a couple days is going to be down to close to zero.""
He also was reluctant to approve the first virus-related travel ban aimed at China, concerned about the signal it would send to markets and his relationship with President Xi Jinping, aides said. He agreed to it on Mr. Azar's advice, aides said, and now touts it.
At the same time, the White House has been taking precautions to protect the president. Extra cleanings are happening in the West Wing. Hand sanitizer is widely available. And the Secret Service now checks if visitors have visited any foreign countries in the past 30 days.
Still, Mr. Trump has maintained an optimistic view of the coronavirus from the start. In some of his first public remarks on the topic, on Jan. 22 in Davos, Switzerland, the president said, ""We've already handled it very well"" when asked if he had a plan for coronavirus in the U.S. ""We're in very good shape,"" he said.
The U.S. reported its first confirmed case that week and now has more than 1,600.

WASHINGTON—The Senate opened the impeachment trial of President Trump on Thursday with Chief Justice John Roberts swearing in the senators, who pledged to deliver impartial justice, and the formal reading of the
two charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress
.
Hours before the senators took their oath, the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency, determined that Mr. Trump's administration
violated the law when it withheld aid to Ukraine
, an issue at the heart of the impeachment case against the president.
Democrats allege that Mr. Trump, a Republican, improperly withheld the aid to pressure Kyiv to launch investigations that would help him politically in the 2020 election.
Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing, calling the case against him a ""big hoax"" on Thursday. He is the third president in U.S. history to be impeached.
The GAO wrote that the White House Office of Management and Budget improperly froze Ukraine funding over the summer for policy reasons. It was later released after pressure from Congress. A spokeswoman for OMB said it disagreed with the GAO finding.
Meanwhile, Ukrainian authorities opened a criminal probe into whether U.S. citizens
placed the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine under surveillance
, as text messages suggest, before she was removed from her post last year by Mr. Trump. The information came to light after House Democrats released documents Tuesday showing that an associate of Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was sent text messages about tracking Marie Yovanovitch in Ukraine.
Democratic and GOP lawmakers continued to wrangle on Thursday over whether new witnesses and evidence will be allowed in the trial. Those issues aren't expected to be decided until well after the trial begins in earnest on Tuesday.
""If any of my colleagues had doubts about the case for witnesses and documents in a Senate trial, the stunning revelations this week should put those to rest,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the chamber's Democratic leader.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said it wasn't the Senate's job to shore up the case the House built in what he called a ""slapdash inquiry."" The Senate won't ""redo their homework and rerun the investigation,"" he said.
Mr. McConnell is set to release his plans for a trial framework on Tuesday, but Senate Republicans and White House officials said the contents of the resolution have largely been settled. Republicans briefed on the resolution have said they expect it to include a guaranteed vote on whether to subpoena witnesses and documents, as requested by some moderate Republicans.
GOP leaders believe they can keep Republicans united to block any efforts by Democrats to subpoena witnesses at the outset of the trial, according to people familiar with their plans. A vote on witnesses would be held later, after the House managers and Mr. Trump's legal team present their cases, a process expected to stretch over two weeks.
A guaranteed vote to dismiss the charges won't be built into the trial rules, according to these people. The White House and Senate Republicans are discussing holding a vote on a motion to dismiss after Democrats present their case but before Mr. Trump's team addresses the Senate, according to an administration official.
At least two-thirds of the senators would have to vote to convict Mr. Trump to remove him from office.
By noon on Thursday, the fighting over the scope of the Senate trial took a pause. Every senator was seated at his or her desk, a rare sight during the ordinary legislative business, when it is common to see senators delivering speeches to an empty chamber. Senators typically don't sit in their assigned seats even during roll call votes, preferring to stroll around and chitchat.
As they waited for the formal ""exhibition"" of articles, some senators scrolled on their cellphones or talked quietly to each other.
At 12:05 p.m.,
House managers
, who will act as prosecutors during the trial, arrived at the ornate doors of the Senate. They walked in two-by-two, led by Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) and Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.). Freshman Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D., Texas) trailed as the seventh. A Democratic aide said the order was chosen according to seniority.
All managers carried large blue folders containing their own copy of the articles of impeachment
passed by the House last month
and the resolution passed on Wednesday authorizing them as managers.
Silence fell and phones disappeared as the sergeant at arms warned senators to keep quiet ""on pain of imprisonment."" Then Mr. Schiff, the lead manager, began reading the articles aloud from the well of the Senate.
""Resolved, that Donald John Trump, president of the United States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors,"" he said.

The first article of impeachment stems from Mr. Trump
pressing Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden
, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, including by
withholding the almost $400 million in aid
to help Kyiv combat Russian aggression. The second article accuses Mr. Trump of impeding Congress's investigation by preventing witnesses from testifying and defying subpoenas for documentary evidence.
The senators watched, with stony faces, as Mr. Schiff spoke. Sen. Susan Collins (R., Maine) stifled a cough. Next to her, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) sat motionless with her hands folded in her lap. Sens. Rob Portman (R., Ohio), Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), Tammy Baldwin (D., Wis.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D., N.Y.) scribbled notes.
At 12:22, when Mr. Schiff had finished, the managers departed. They briefly huddled outside the chamber, once again got in order, and marched back toward the House side of the Capitol.
Shortly after 2 p.m., Chief Justice Roberts was escorted into the Senate by Sens. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), Roy Blunt (R., Mo.), Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.) and Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.).
Everyone in the chamber rose. The only sound was the scratching of reporters' pens.Then Chief Justice Roberts spoke: ""Senators, I attend the Senate in conformity with your notice for the purpose of joining with you for the trial of the President of the United States. I am now prepared to take the oath.""
Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), the Senate's president pro tempore, asked him to raise his right hand, place his left hand on the Bible, and swore him in.
Chief Justice Roberts then administered an oath to senators, who will act as the jury. ""Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, president of United States, now pending, you will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws, so help you God?""
""I do,"" the senators said.
Senators were then called in alphabetical order to the Senate clerk's desk to sign their names in an oath book. As the lawmakers waited to sign, there were flashes of bipartisan bonhomie. Sen. Cory Booker (D., N.J.) warmly shook Mr. Grassley's hand. Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.) patted the shoulder of Sen. Ben Sasse (R., Neb.), and the two shared a laugh with Sen. Tim Scott (R., S.C.). Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D., Md.) gave Mr. Portman's arm a squeeze.
All of the senators were present for the swearing-in except for Sen. Jim Inhofe (R., Okla.), who is at home with a family member facing a medical issue, according to his office. He plans to be sworn in next week, before the trial begins in earnest.
After the swearing-in, the Senate formally notified the White House of the pending trial and summoned Mr. Trump, who will be given until Saturday evening to reply.
Mr. McConnell also said the House has until Saturday at 5 p.m. to file a trial brief with the secretary of the Senate, and Mr. Trump has until noon on Monday to do so. The deadline for the House's rebuttal is noon on Tuesday. The Senate trial was then adjourned until Tuesday at 1 p.m.
Although historic, Thursday entailed mostly pomp and circumstance. The trial won't get under way substantively until the Senate reconvenes after the holiday weekend.
All 100 senators agreed on rules for the 1999 Clinton impeachment trial's initial phase. There is no such bipartisan agreement now, and while Mr. McConnell says all 53 Republicans in his caucus are united on the path forward, he hasn't released the text of his resolution
laying out the procedures
agreed upon by GOP senators.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What questions do you have about the impeachment process? Join the conversation below.
In 1999, a resolution dealing with witnesses passed a few weeks into the trial, along party lines. Three witnesses, including Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern with whom Mr. Clinton admitted an inappropriate relationship, were deposed privately in the presence of a senator from each party. Excerpts were shown by video during the trial.
There are 15 senators now serving who also voted in the Clinton impeachment trial, including Messrs. McConnell and Schumer.
""I remember the solemnity of this, when you see the chief justice sitting in the chair with his august robes, when you hear your name called and you hear the charges, your hair sort of stands on end,"" Mr. Schumer said in a recent interview.
Throughout the trial, all senators will be expected to be present and seated at their assigned desks. They won't be allowed to talk.
Any deliberations among senators likely will be held in closed session, meaning that no press or cameras will be allowed. The rest of the trial will be open.
""It is a solemn feeling when you're sitting in the seat, and you're listening closely to what's going on,"" said Sen. Mike Braun (R., Ind.).
Mr. Braun said he and other senators are worried about the precedent being set. ""Many senators have on their minds: Is this the new dynamic? Having two impeachments within 20 years of one another?"" he said. ""I don't think anybody likes that feeling.""

WASHINGTON—President Trump lashed out at his acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, earlier this month after learning that one of his subordinates had briefed the House Intelligence Committee about Russia's apparent preference for Mr. Trump in the 2020 presidential contest, people familiar with the matter said.
The Oval Office confrontation occurred after Mr. Trump learned that Shelby Pierson, the top election-security official in Mr. Maguire's office, delivered information on election interference in a classified hearing before bipartisan members of the House panel, alongside national security officials from other federal agencies, three of the people said.
During that hearing, Ms. Pierson said Russia appeared to favor Mr. Trump over Democratic challengers and might seek to act on that preference, two of the people said, in a move that would reprise Moscow's
efforts during the 2016 election to boost his candidacy
.
Mr. Trump grew irate after learning that the classified hearing, which took place on Feb. 13 and was attended by both Democrats and Republicans, occurred before his own meeting on election interference, which occurred the next day, those people said. The president also expressed his agitation over the substance of what Ms. Pierson told lawmakers about Russia's possible interest in interfering on his behalf, these people said, with one person describing it as a prolonged and pointed interrogation of Mr. Maguire. Officials from other agencies were also present in the room, these people said.
Mr. Trump on Wednesday
said he was replacing Mr. Maguire
, a retired Navy vice admiral, as acting director of national intelligence with Richard Grenell, the current ambassador to Germany. Mr. Grenell has scant experience with intelligence matters and is viewed by Democrats as an ardent loyalist to the president. Mr. Maguire had been rumored to be in the running to be nominated to the position full-time, and Mr. Trump had praised him publicly during his tenure.

Trump, With a Grin, Tells Putin: 'Don't Meddle in the Election'
(June 28, 2019)
On Thursday, Mr. Trump told reporters that among the candidates he is considering to serve as permanent director of national intelligence is Rep. Doug Collins, a conservative congressman and staunch defender of the president who is running against Sen. Kelly Loeffler to be the GOP candidate for a Georgia U.S. Senate seat. But Mr. Collins rejected the potential offer Friday morning, saying on Fox Business it was ""not a job that interests me at this time—it's not one that I would accept.""
The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee is Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who led the House's impeachment case against the president in the Senate. The Republican-controlled Senate earlier this month
acquitted Mr. Trump
of both charges passed by the Democratic House, obstruction of Congress and abuse of power related to his efforts to press Ukraine
to announce investigations that would benefit him politically
in his re-election campaign. Mr. Trump mentioned Mr. Schiff during the Oval Office meeting as a reason he was irritated lawmakers were briefed first, one of the people familiar with the meeting said.
One of the people familiar with the matter said Mr. Maguire was unlikely to be tapped for the permanent director of national intelligence position regardless of the Oval Office clash last week.
The White House had been discussing nominees for the job even before Maguire's ouster and will make an announcement on or before the March 11 deadline, according to a White House official.
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the House Intelligence Committee declined to comment. The White House didn't respond to requests for comment. Mr. Trump's rebuke of Mr. Maguire was
first reported
by the Washington Post.
In both public and private, Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed his skepticism at the conclusions reached by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 contest and did so to help him win, viewing that as part of plot by Democrats and career bureaucrats to diminish his victory and undermine his presidency. The continuing refusal to accept that consensus view played a part in his impeachment by the House, as Mr. Trump pressured the Ukrainian president in a July phone call to investigate the Biden family as well as a debunked theory that a Democratic computer server that could show Russia was framed for the election interference had been secretly whisked away to Ukraine.

Moscow interfered
in ""sweeping and systemic fashion"" in the 2016 election in an effort to boost then-candidate Trump's chances by spreading divisive social media content and hacking and leaking Democratic emails, according to the findings of former special counsel Robert Mueller. Russia has denied election interference.
Ms. Pierson was tapped to lead the Office of Director of National Intelligence's newly formed election threats group last summer. Dan Coats, the previous intelligence chief, installed her as one of his last acts before leaving his position in part to ensure the office continued to address the Russian threat to U.S. elections seriously, according to people familiar with the matter.
In her role, Ms. Pierson would have access to classified intelligence flowing from multiple government agencies, such as the National Security Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation, about election interference activity from Russia and other foreign actors.
But she has a reputation for being injudicious with her words and not appreciating the delicate work of corralling federal agencies, technology firms and state election officials to collaborate on election security, people familiar with her work have said.
A spokeswoman for Ms. Pierson didn't respond to a request for comment.
Last September, Ms. Pierson upset representatives from several technology companies during a meeting at Facebook Inc.'s headquarters when she accused them of not sharing enough
data about their users with the government
, the Journal previously reported.

WASHINGTON -- The Republican-led Senate acquitted President Trump of charges stemming from his efforts to press Ukraine to announce investigations that would benefit him politically, bringing to a close a bruising four-month battle fought almost entirely along party lines.
The third presidential impeachment in U.S. history intensified the nation's sharp divide over Mr. Trump and previewed many of the arguments likely to be heard ahead of the election this fall. During the trial, Democrats said the Republican president was trying to cheat in the coming election by trying to damage a potential opponent. Republicans said that Democrats were improperly inflating missteps into impeachable offenses and trying to overturn the results of the 2016 election.
The Senate vote to acquit marked a clear victory for the president, underscoring his primacy in the GOP and the end to a process that had hung over the past several months of his presidency. But while Mr. Trump had hoped for a forceful display of unity from Republicans in defense of his actions, he got something less: GOP senators strongly supported his acquittal, but several said the Democrats had proved that he acted improperly -- though not in a manner deserving of impeachment -- regarding Ukraine.
Mr. Trump was also denied a unanimous not-guilty verdict from Republican senators when Mitt Romney of Utah voted to convict on the first article of impeachment.
Given the GOP's 53-47 majority in the Senate and the Constitution's requirement that two-thirds of the Senate is required to convict, Mr. Trump's chance of acquittal was always strong. Mr. Trump now becomes the first president to run for re-election after having been impeached.
Mr. Trump and his campaign sought throughout the process to turn impeachment to his political advantage, frequently using his attacks on the investigation in fundraising emails.
On the first article of impeachment, abuse of power, all 47 Democratic-aligned senators and Mr. Romney voted to convict, falling short of the 67 needed to remove the president from office. On the obstruction of Congress article, the vote also failed, with all Democrats and no Republicans finding the president guilty.
The senators read their votes aloud from their desks, and Chief Justice John Roberts announced the outcome. ""Donald John Trump, president of the United States. . .is hereby acquitted,"" he said.
Mr. Trump, in a tweet after the vote, declared ""our Country's VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax"" and wrote that he would make a public statement about his acquittal on Thursday.
Republicans' arguments in favor of acquittal split broadly into two camps. Some argued that House impeachment managers' case was half-baked and that they should have gone to court to pursue the testimony of further witnesses who had been told by the White House not to cooperate. Others in the party said House Democrats had proved their case but that the president's conduct wasn't impeachable.
The impeachment probe grew out of a phone call last summer in which Mr. Trump asked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to announce an investigation into Joe Biden, a top Democratic presidential contender, while holding up congressionally approved aid to the country. Mr. Trump has defended the call as ""perfect"" and has said he did nothing wrong regarding Ukraine. The aid was later released after bipartisan outcry from lawmakers.
The most dramatic moment of the day came two hours before the acquittal vote, when Mr. Romney said in a floor speech that he had decided to vote to convict the president on the first article. ""The president is guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust,"" he said.
Mr. Romney was the first senator in U.S. history to vote to convict a president of his own party. In the impeachment trials of Democratic presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton, no Democratic senators voted to convict.
The White House, which as late as Wednesday morning had been predicting that all Republican senators would vote to acquit the president, was caught off-guard by Mr. Romney's announcement, aides said.
Immediately after Mr. Romney announced his vote, White House aides began planning to intensify attacks on the senator. Later that evening, Mr. Trump tweeted a video accusing Mr. Romney, the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, of ""posing as a Republican"" and trying to ""infiltrate"" the Trump administration.
Democrats said the acquittal amounted to a defeat for the institution of Congress and they warned that leaving Mr. Trump in office would make him free to abuse power again.
""The verdict of this kangaroo court will be meaningless,"" said Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, on Wednesday. ""You cannot be on the side of this president and be on the side of truth.""
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Democrats used impeachment for political goals. ""We should all agree that this is the precisely the type of recklessness that the Senate was created to stop,"" he said on the floor. ""The response to losing one election cannot be to attack the office of the presidency.""
In a news conference later in the day, Mr. McConnell declined to answer questions about whether he found the president's conduct appropriate.
In the months after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) opened the inquiry in September, the Democratic-led House called 17 witnesses and compiled hundreds of documents to build its case, formally impeaching the president in December. A month later, it handed the articles over to the Senate, which heard arguments from House impeachment managers and Mr. Trump's defense team but rejected calling witnesses it said the House should have pursued.
The tightly choreographed Senate trial was upended late last month by new revelations from former national security adviser John Bolton about the president's pressure campaign on Ukraine. The former official's revelations in a yet-unpublished memoir briefly raised the possibility a sufficient number of Republicans would join with Democrats to vote in favor of new witness testimony. But Republicans ultimately voted nearly in unison to oppose hearing from Mr. Bolton and other witnesses.
""Unless there's some bipartisan consensus of treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors, as there was in the Nixon case, then there shouldn't be an impeachment,"" Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.) said on Tuesday.
While a majority of voters in a recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll said they believed Mr. Trump abused his power and obstructed Congress, some 49% of respondents said he should be allowed to finish his term, compared with 46% who said he should be removed.
Impeachment also made little impact on Mr. Trump's job-approval rating, which stood at 46% in the January poll -- in line with his rating throughout his presidency.
Democrats made clear the trial settled nothing for them, with members of House leadership saying they would likely keep investigating. Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.) said Wednesday the House would likely subpoena Mr. Bolton and continue the investigation. Mr. Bolton's spokeswoman declined to comment on whether he would comply with any subpoena.
Despite his public attacks on the impeachment process, Mr. Trump stayed -- at Mr. McConnell's urging -- largely on the sidelines of Republican efforts to rally lawmakers against voting for new witnesses and approached his own legal team with a fairly light touch.
The president's sole recommendation to his team came after the defense's first day of arguments, an administration official said. After his lawyers argued for two hours, he called with a request: Put Pam Bondi on TV more. He told the team he wanted Ms. Bondi, a former Florida attorney general who joined the White House last fall as an adviser on impeachment, to continue arguing his case on TV in the evenings.
Instead, Mr. Trump focused his attention elsewhere. As the trial unfolded last week, White House officials huddled with GOP House members and their aides in a small room in the vice president's office in the Capitol that one GOP aide described as ""mission control."" The president, the aide said, insisted advisers not call it a ""war room,"" which he said wrongly suggested Republicans were embattled and that impeachment was an actual crisis.
