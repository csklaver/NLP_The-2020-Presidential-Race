| Jump to first hitWith Republicans now unified, it is difficult to find a district where a challenger can credibly claim that the incumbent has been insufficiently supportive of the president.DOYLESTOWN, Pa. -- The scene was almost quaint, this cowboy-hatted neophyte preaching his gospel as about 15 supporters, peering out from snow-drenched hoodies, nodded along. Glimpsed from afar, it seemed a reminder that even in 2020, politics still boils down to this: small-town voters braving the elements to listen to an underdog candidate speak truth to power.Except Andy Meehan, the star of that Saturday afternoon's generously termed ""rally,"" was not necessarily looking to stick it to The Man. He was there to ""FIGHT FAKE FITZ!"" -- a.k.a. Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, a Republican seeking re-election in Pennsylvania's First Congressional District. A conservative challenging Mr. Fitzpatrick for their party's nomination, Mr. Meehan is promising voters that he, unlike his ""disloyal"" opponent, will always be faithful to The Man.""President Trump is going to win in 2020,"" Mr. Meehan, a 55-year-old financial adviser, told his audience. ""Do you want a half-baked, fake Republican on the ticket who's going to get in on his coattails again? And then not support him?""He shook the snow off his cowboy boots and went on. ""I'm a man of principles,"" he said. ""I support the president's America First agenda, and I'm going to go to Washington, and I will vote for it.""Such is the nature of the Republican primary season in the Donald Trump era: self-proclaimed outsiders marketing themselves as loyalists to a man who is now the ultimate insider. Challenges to incumbents from the right are nothing new. But whereas conservative primary candidates once fashioned their campaigns as referendums on reckless federal spending or the elitist sensibilities of leadership, their pitches are much simpler now, carte blanche offerings of complete and total fealty to the president.And with Mr. Trump's stranglehold on his party, their targets are much fewer, too. Mr. Meehan's candidacy is significant not so much on its own merits but in that there are hardly any others currently like it: In this new moment of G.O.P. unity, it is difficult to find a district where one can claim -- at least credibly -- that the incumbent Republican has been insufficiently supportive of the president.But complete and total fealty is no longer a sure ticket to Mr. Trump's support. Hovering over all of these races is the Senate impeachment trial, and how Republican incumbents respond stands to be a critical consideration in how they are viewed by voters -- and by Mr. Trump. The president, who once seemed to believe that no slight was too small, no grievance too stale, now appears to regard lawmakers who covet his endorsement through the prism of impeachment alone. And with every House Republican having defended the president, G.O.P. primary challengers are now struggling to successfully argue that their opponents are disloyal.Pennsylvania's First is a rare district where support for Mr. Trump is not a given. Mr. Fitzpatrick has voted with Mr. Trump less than any other House Republican, and just 36.5 percent of the time in the current congressional session. In July 2019, he was one of four Republicans to formally condemn the president's comments about four progressive congresswomen as racist. Which is to say that the Make America Great Again faithful, in their quest to excise yet more of the president's dissenters from Congress in 2020, smelled blood.A handful of Trumpworld alumni have come together to lead Mr. Meehan's efforts, including Matt Braynard, the former director of data and strategy for the Trump campaign. Mr. Meehan's team is wishcasting the race as ""Cantor-Brat 2.0,"" a reference to the stunning Republican primary in 2014, when Dave Brat, an economics professor, defeated the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, in Virginia.The races are perhaps similar only in that Mr. Meehan's bid is a long shot. Mr. Fitzpatrick, 46, has the good will of voters who supported his late brother, Mike Fitzpatrick, a Republican who represented the district when it was known as the Eighth. In 2018, it was redrawn to give Democrats a slight edge, meaning Brian Fitzpatrick is likely to retain the support of local party leadership hoping to pick off independents in the general election. Indeed, the Bucks County Republican Committee chairwoman, Patricia Poprik, said her members ""stand behind Brian Fitzpatrick's commitment to individual liberty and freedom, and commend his common sense approach to dealing with issues in Congress,"" adding that Mr. Meehan ""does not represent the values of our party.""Still, Mr. Fitzpatrick has gone so far as to issue an attack ad against Mr. Meehan, calling him ""Pelosi's Pawn in PA-01.""""Fitzpatrick has to take it seriously, because outside MAGA interference can mobilize and fund-raise and have a significant effect in primaries, without any long-term strategy for the actual district,"" said Rory Cooper, Mr. Cantor's former communications director.Primaries like Mr. Fitzpatrick's are scarce in large part because G.O.P. lawmakers know precisely how to avoid them. In the last few years, Republicans who've dipped a toe in anti-Trump waters have quickly recoiled, as though a cottonmouth lurked just below the surface. Take Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina: On Feb. 25, 2019, he wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post that while he supported the president's ""vision on border security,"" he would ""vote against"" the declaration of a national emergency.Local Republican leaders excoriated Mr. Tillis for putting himself ""in opposition to the president."" They approached Representative Mark Walker of North Carolina's Sixth District about a primary challenge, and the Club for Growth, a conservative political action group, commissioned a poll on Mr. Walker and other state Republicans' chances against the senator.Not three weeks after his op-ed published, Mr. Tillis reversed course and voted for the national emergency. In June, Mr. Walker announced he would not pursue a primary.""Tillis was a wake-up call for everyone,"" said Tyler Sandberg, a Republican strategist. ""If you disagreed with something the president did, it was like, 'Be careful; you saw what happened to Tillis.""'The result is that the National Republican Congressional Committee is no longer consumed by the once inevitable task of neutralizing serious challenges to its members from the right. According to a G.O.P. official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share private discussions, apart from Mr. Fitzpatrick's race, only a few primaries this cycle have been deemed cause for concern.""The president's monopoly on Republican voters is more powerful than any ideological or stylistic divide,"" said Nathan Gonzales, editor of Inside Elections and an elections analyst for CQ Roll Call. ""There might be interest in challenging an incumbent from the right or as an outsider, but as long as that member stays close to Trump, there just isn't enough oxygen to get the job done.""But then there's Representative Kay Granger, the 12-term incumbent of Texas's 12th District. As ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee, she's one of the lower chamber's most powerful Republicans. Yet she finds herself confronting her most -- and arguably only -- competitive primary in her two-plus decades in Congress, a challenge driven by charges of a lackluster allegiance to Mr. Trump.On Sept. 24, a technology company executive named Chris Putnam, who promoted himself as an ""outsider"" ""just like President Trump,"" declared his candidacy. As The Texas Tribune reported, in the six days before the close of the quarter on Sept. 30, Mr. Putnam boasted a haul of $456,000, trouncing Ms. Granger's quarter-long effort of $284,000.Ms. Granger is certainly no Brian Fitzpatrick -- unlike her House colleague, she votes with Mr. Trump roughly 97 percent of the time. But flashes of dissent, including her call for Mr. Trump to ""remove himself from consideration as commander in chief"" after the release of the ""Access Hollywood"" tape in 2016, have been enough to buoy her opponent. In an interview, Mr. Putnam accused Ms. Granger of being a ""full-on Never Trumper"" during the last three years. ""We have to get people who are running for the right reasons,"" he said.That Saturday in Doylestown, Andy Meehan was eager to continue sharing his own reasons. After his rally, he and a few voters fled the snowfall and ducked into a coffee shop. Warming his hands on a mug of hot chocolate, he reminisced about the moment in May 2019 that he decided to challenge Mr. Fitzpatrick, when he saw that the Pennsylvania congressman was one of eight House Republicans to vote for the Equality Act.The sweeping legislation, which bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, prompted blowback from conservatives and others who argued that the bill would undermine female athletes by making sports effectively co-ed. ""And I was on social media,"" Mr. Meehan recalled, ""saying, 'What is this guy doing?""'In Mr. Meehan's view, Mr. Fitzpatrick was yet another politician falling prey to political correctness, the opposite of the president. Since introducing his campaign by cellphone video on July 4, Mr. Meehan has tried to channel Mr. Trump, railing against identity politics and promising to protect ""election integrity"" from undocumented immigrants.That message appears to have resonated with at least some conservatives. ""We need a fighter because Trump is a fighter,"" said Millie Hillgrube, a 51-year-old sales coordinator, prompting a low chorus of mmhmms around the table.Mr. Meehan and his team are hopeful that his support will catch the president's attention. With little money, and with national Republican leaders already stumping for Mr. Fitzpatrick, a nod from Mr. Trump probably represents Mr. Meehan's best chance. ""I think the White House could potentially choose to become involved,"" said Mr. Braynard, the former Trump campaign data director who is running Mr. Meehan's campaign. ""Because Andy would be a real ally in the president's second term.""But while the terms dictating Republican primaries may be simpler than ever, so is the president's logic on whether to meddle in them.It's true that Mr. Fitzpatrick voted to condemn the president's words as racist. And it's true that Ms. Granger once called for Mr. Trump to drop out of the 2016 race. But as his eager embrace of Representative Jeff Van Drew, who recently left the Democratic Party to become a Republican, suggests, the president seems willing to forgive such sins in exchange for support in one crucial moment. Mr. Van Drew, of course, voted against impeachment. Mr. Fitzpatrick and Ms. Granger did, too.In other words, those single votes could render campaigns like Mr. Meehan's -- centered on the apostasy of their opponents -- moot. Which means the 2020 primary season, rather than usher in a small new class of Trump die-hards, could instead leave behind a slate of former candidates whose downfall was demanding more loyalty to the president than the president demanded for himself.Indeed, when asked if the president planned to involve himself in Mr. Fitzpatrick's primary, a senior White House official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, said Mr. Trump had never discussed it.The official then waved off any concerns about Mr. Fitzpatrick's allegiance to the president. Sure, he may have gone against him on a number of issues, the official said. But he had, after all, voted against impeachment.PhotographAndy Meehan, above, a Trump loyalist who is trying to unseat Representative Brian Fitzpatrick, at left in 2019, in Pennsylvania's First Congressional District, at a rally this month.

| Jump to first hitThe Maine senator became the latest Republican to condemn President Trump's conduct but argue it did not warrant his removal.WASHINGTON -- Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said on Tuesday that she would vote to acquit President Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, calling his conduct ""wrong"" but saying she could not support removing him from office.""I do not believe that the House has met its burden of showing that the president's conduct, however flawed, warrants the extreme step of immediate removal from office,"" Ms. Collins said in a speech from the Senate floor.Ms. Collins, a moderate who is facing a steep re-election challenge this year, was one of only two Republicans to break with the party last week and vote in favor of considering new witnesses in Mr. Trump's impeachment trial. But in announcing her vote on the verdict on Tuesday, she joined a growing chorus in her party who has argued that removing the president for his misconduct little more than nine months before he faces re-election was excessive.""It is my judgment that except when extraordinary circumstances require a different result, we should entrust to the people the most fundamental decision of a democracy -- namely who should lead their country,"" Ms. Collins said.She said that Mr. Trump's call to President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, in which he asked for an investigation of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., was ""improper and demonstrated very poor judgment,"" but said there had been ""conflicting evidence in the record"" about Mr. Trump's motivations.In an interview with CBS, Ms. Collins said she believed that Mr. Trump had ""learned from this case"" and that he will be ""much more cautious in the future."" But the president has never acknowledged any wrongdoing, instead insisting his call with Mr. Zelensky was ""perfect.""Ms. Collins's speech came as senators took turns on the Senate floor on Tuesday announcing how they would vote when they render a verdict on Wednesday in the third presidential impeachment trial in the nation's history.The bitterly divided Senate is all but certain to acquit Mr. Trump on both charges. It would take a two-thirds vote, or 67 senators, to convict and remove him, a threshold that neither side expects to materialize.Mr. Trump is accused of pressuring Ukraine to interfere in the 2020 presidential campaign on his behalf, by withholding military aid and a White House meeting to lean on the country to investigate his political rivals. The impeachment trial was not formally meeting on Tuesday, before Mr. Trump's State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress. But their comments on Tuesday were the last opportunity for senators to explain their positions before voting on the verdict, and they appeared to be aimed at their constituents, their core supporters, and in some cases, the president himself.Here's a roundup of what other key senators said.McConnell blasts Trump's impeachment as 'dangerous.'Taking a victory lap for what he called the ""sober and stable Senate,"" Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, issued a stern rebuke of the House Democrats' case and strategy, casting it as a politically motivated attack that amounted to the ""most rushed, least fair and least thorough presidential impeachment inquiry in American history.""""Washington Democrats think President Donald Trump committed a high crime or misdemeanor the moment he defeated Hillary Clinton,"" Mr. McConnell said, referring to the president's victory in 2016. ""That is the original sin of this presidency: that he won and they lost.""In his most detailed remarks on the impeachment managers' case to date, Mr. McConnell undercut an argument that the White House defense team had presented: that impeachment requires the violation of a criminal statue. But while Mr. McConnell said he did not subscribe to that legal theory, he condemned House Democrats all the same for sailing into ""new and dangerous waters.""Schumer says the Senate trial 'fails the laugh test.'Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York, spoke only briefly, to rebut what he called the majority leader's talking points.Defending the House managers' case as ""compelling,"" Mr. Schumer denounced Senate Republicans for blocking his motion to consider hearing from additional witnesses -- including John R. Bolton, the president's former national security adviser who had offered to testify -- and receive more evidence. The trial they created, he said, ""fails the laugh test.""""The Republicans refused to get the evidence because they were afraid of what it would show,"" Mr. Schumer said, ""and that's all that needs to be said.""Ernst argues the voters should decide Trump's fateSenator Joni Ernst, Republican of Iowa, who is up for re-election in November, adopted an argument similar to one outlined by Mr. Trump's defense team on their final day of arguments: that to remove the president months before the election would be to subvert the will of voters.""The House managers' arguments have argued that the American people cannot be trusted to render their own judgment on this president,"" Ms. Ernst said. ""I reject this premise, the complete distrust of the American people, with everything in my heart.""Ms. Ernst did not directly address the president's conduct, but jabbed at House Democrats for trying to impose their own conventional wisdom onto how Mr. Trump conducted diplomacy. Foreign policy, Ms. Ernst said, is an ""art, not a science"" and ""trying to insert a formula into every presidential interaction with a foreign leader,"" she continued, was to veer onto a ""path towards ineffectiveness.""Kaine laments 'a toxic president' who has infected the SenateSenator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, pledged to vote to remove Mr. Trump, and lamented the Senate's ""capitulation,"" a turn of events, he said, that surprised him.""We have allowed a toxic president to infect the Senate and warp its behavior,"" Mr. Kaine said. ""And now the Senate's refusal to allow a fair trial threatens to spread a broader public anxiety about whether 'impartial justice' is a hollow fiction.""Mr. Kaine, known in the Senate for his optimism, sounded a dark warning, insisting that an acquittal would only embolden Mr. Trump to engage in worse conduct. ""I will not be part of this continual degradation of public trust,"" he said.PhotographSenator Susan Collins, above, who is facing a steep re-election challenge in Maine, called President Trump's conduct ""wrong"" but said she would vote for acquittal.

| Jump to first hitA whipsaw week of charged decisions by the Justice Department, some favored by the president and others not, has bewildered much of Washington.WASHINGTON -- When President Trump learned that the Justice Department was dropping a case against a former F.B.I. official whom he considered one of his longtime enemies, his immediate response was anger. As he flipped on the television Friday and watched how the story was being covered, that anger only mounted.Since taking office, Mr. Trump has searched for an attorney general who would function much as Roy Cohn did for him as his personal lawyer and fixer in the 1970s -- a warrior committed to protecting him and going after his foes. The president thought he had found that person in William P. Barr. But now, people close to Mr. Trump say, he is not so sure.The president was cheered this week when Mr. Barr moved to reduce the sentence of a convicted presidential friend, only to be shocked when the attorney general publicly called on Mr. Trump to stop tweeting about it. And after his livid reaction to the Justice Department's decision to drop a separate case, which he heard about without any advance notice, he learned that Mr. Barr was intervening more favorably on behalf of another presidential ally.The whipsaw events of recent days have bewildered much of Washington, including some of the people around the president and his attorney general. Once seen as a lock step partnership, it now may be the most complicated relationship in town. The six blocks between the White House and the Robert F. Kennedy Department of Justice Building have become a political buffer zone and no one can be entirely sure what comes next.Critics assume it is all a Kabuki dance, cynical theater meant to preserve Mr. Barr's credibility as he executes Mr. Trump's personal political agenda while pretending to look independent. And it is certainly true that, even now, Mr. Barr continues to demonstrate a willingness to personally take charge of cases with Mr. Trump's interests at stake.But insiders insist the tension is real, with potentially profound consequences for an administration that has redrawn the lines at the intersection of politics and law enforcement. Barely a week after being acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial, Mr. Trump is demanding that some of the people whose actions he believes led to his troubles be charged, convicted and sent to prison, and it is not clear that even Mr. Barr is willing or able to go as far as the president wants.In his only comment on the matter on Friday, Mr. Trump pushed back against Mr. Barr a day after the attorney general told ABC News that the president was making it ""impossible for me to do my job"" by tweeting about criminal cases and declared that he was ""not going to be bullied.""Mr. Trump cited another comment Mr. Barr made in the same interview affirming that the president had never actually asked for any specific actions in a criminal case. ""This doesn't mean that I do not have, as President, the legal right to do so, I do, but I have so far chosen not to!"" Mr. Trump added. The ""so far"" in there, of course, hung online as a kind of sword of Damocles waiting to fall.Only in the hours after that tweet did the news emerge that Mr. Barr's department was dropping a case against Andrew G. McCabe, the former deputy F.B.I. director blamed by Mr. Trump for his role in the investigation into Russian election interference. Two people close to the matter said the Justice Department did not give the president a heads up about the decision.Then came the more welcome news for the Oval Office that Mr. Barr had ordered a re-examination of the case of Michael T. Flynn, the president's former national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. about his contacts with Russia. The new review raised the question of whether Mr. Flynn will actually go to prison.Mr. Trump has bitterly decried ""what Flynn has gone through"" while believing that Mr. McCabe has unfairly walked, people close to him said. The president on Friday was angrier about the decision not to prosecute Mr. McCabe than he was at Mr. Barr's comments in his interview, the people said.Mr. Trump made no mention of any of those newer developments on Twitter or in several encounters with reporters before flying to Florida for the weekend. But he sometimes waits to publicly respond to such news until after an evening watching Fox News or hearing from friends.On the fifth floor of the Justice Department, Mr. Barr's team braced for what they feared would be a stream of critiques and humiliations from the president in what one predicted could be a death by a thousand cuts, not unlike what happened to the last attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who was tormented by the president after recusing himself from the Russia investigation.Mr. Sessions, like other cabinet members, stoically absorbed Mr. Trump's invectives, rarely standing up for himself or his employees, even as the president paralyzed, undercut and neutered him. Like other original cabinet members, he left the administration publicly humiliated and vastly diminished.Mr. Barr faced many risks in speaking out on ABC, according to people close to him. But he knew that no amount of public fealty would stave off a public drubbing or even an abrupt dismissal.For now, though, there is no expectation at the Justice Department or the White House of an escalation to that level. While Lou Dobbs on Fox Business Network excoriated Mr. Barr for rebuking the president, other Fox hosts who have Mr. Trump's ear, like Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, were generally supportive of the attorney general. Tucker Carlson, another trusted television personality, treated Mr. Barr's ABC interview like a nonevent on his Fox News show Thursday night.Ms. Ingraham, who is close to Mr. Barr, said the attorney general was not breaking with the president but, in effect, reassuring him that the Justice Department's leadership would carry out Mr. Trump's wishes to clean up what they see as the corruption of his predecessor and that the tweets were neither necessary nor helpful.""Barr was basically telling Trump, 'Don't worry, I got this,""' Ms. Ingraham said on her show.Some of the attorney general's critics saw it the same way. Nine Democratic senators, including two presidential candidates, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, sent a letter to Mr. Barr on Friday calling on him to resign.His protestations of independence were not credible, they wrote, given his department's behavior. ""It demonstrates that you lied to Congress during your confirmation hearing when you stated that you would 'keep the enforcement process sacrosanct from political influence,' and it reveals your unwillingness or inability to maintain the integrity of the D.O.J. and to uphold justice and the rule of law,"" the senators wrote.Ms. Warren and three other Democratic senators also unveiled legislation barring an attorney general and other top Justice Department officials appointed by a president from participating in matters related to the president, his family or his campaign associates.Although Mr. Trump and Mr. Barr both said the president has not directly asked for any specific inquiries, the president has long pressured law enforcement officials both publicly and privately to open investigations into political rivals and to drop inquiries into him or his associates.Since Watergate, past presidents in both parties have had a tradition in place aimed at preventing political influence from the White House on Justice Department investigations, especially criminal inquiries that involved administration officials or friends of the president.""It tries to prevent the interference by forcing all White House contact to go through a funnel at the top of the Justice Department,"" said John Yoo, a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley who served in the Justice Department under President George W. Bush.Mr. Trump's first White House counsel, Donald F. McGahn II, issued similar rules in a Jan. 27, 2017, memo that prohibited White House officials from communicating with most Justice Department officials about ""ongoing or contemplated cases."" Only the president, vice president or White House counsel was allowed to initiate such communications, Mr. McGahn wrote, and they must be directed to the attorney general or three other top Justice Department officials.""In order to ensure that D.O.J. exercises its investigatory and prosecutorial functions free from the fact or appearance of improper political influence, these rules must be strictly followed,"" Mr. McGahn wrote.But scholars said Mr. Trump is right that he has the power to intervene if he chooses. Under Article II of the Constitution, any president has the authority to directly oversee criminal cases carried out by the Justice Department. There are no statutes that limit the contact between the White House and the Justice Department.""The president can do what he wants,"" said Bruce Green, a law professor at Fordham University. ""His only restraints are self imposed. There are no legislative restraints.""The only real recourse, he added, would be impeachment. ""If a president attempted to misuse the Justice Department and its criminal justice power for private ends, that's an abuse of power that is potentially impeachable,"" Mr. Green said. ""We can guess in 2020 how that would play out.""Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Katie Benner and Michael Crowley from Washington.PhotographPresident Trump on Friday.

Conway III has described the work of his wife, Kellyanne Conway, for President Trump in terms usually reserved for hostage situations: brainwashed by a cult, suffering from Stockholm syndrome, an overwhelmed mother protecting a destructive man-child.And if you think it's all shtick, some wink-and-nod act by a couple who fights by day and snuggles by night, planning a payday after Mr. Trump leaves the scene, think again, say some people close to America's oddest political couple.""Those who think this is a 14-dimensional chess game are mistaken,"" said Rick Wilson, who with Mr. Conway and several other Republicans formed the Lincoln Project, an effort to beat Mr. Trump in the 2020 election.Mr. Conway ""has taken unequivocal and irreversible actions that have established his bona fides as someone who opposes Donald Trump, and she's going to be for Donald Trump until the last dog dies,"" he said, adding a question that many Americans have asked themselves about the Conways: ""Who knows the secrets of the human heart?""In a sense, the passions in the Conway household have come to represent the societal agonies of the Trump era, a couple and a nation deeply divided, unsettled by the storms around the presidency, and asking themselves, when it's all over, can there be reconciliation?The Conways bring to mind a previous Washington ""It"" couple: Mary Matalin, who worked for President George Bush, and James Carville, the Democratic strategist who helped engineer President Bill Clinton's 1992 victory over Mr. Bush. Ms. Matalin and Mr. Carville turned their political dissonance into a lucrative brand, joking about their vast differences.The Conways agree politically on most things because Mr. Conway, for all his anti-Trump activities, remains deeply conservative. But the couple does not appear to be having much fun.""Coming of political age in 1992 is significantly different than coming of age in 2017,"" Mr. Carville said. ""Trump people have much more of a sense of personal assault or grievance, and the Trump opponents have a high, high dose of doing the right thing for the country. You can hardly even tell jokes about it anymore.""Ms. Conway, 53, Mr. Trump's senior counselor and 2016 campaign manager, has largely held her tongue about her husband, though she told The Washington Post in 2018 that his sniping ""disrespects his wife.""In recent months, Mr. Conway, 56, a constitutional lawyer by trade and Trump opponent by conversion, has become more embittered, and more public. During the presidential impeachment, he took to CNN and Twitter as a commentator, calling Mr. Trump a ""criminal,"" ""pathological liar"" and ""Idiot-in-Chief.""To mark Mr. Trump's acquittal by the Senate, Mr. Conway wrote a sarcastic, bitter column, concluding, ""I believe the president's call was perfect. I believe he is deeply concerned about corruption in Ukraine."" Mr. Conway live-tweeted his derision as the president celebrated last week in the East Room of the White House. ""Let it out, @realDonaldTrump. Let it all out,"" he mocked.For someone who labored in Republican legal vineyards for decades -- in the 1990s, he was a lawyer for Paula Jones, who accused Mr. Clinton of sexual misconduct -- Mr. Conway did not cut much of a swath in Washington social circles. He rode his wife's coattails into the nation's capital.But of late, he has surpassed her on Washington's party circuit.""She was the superstar for two and a half years, and now George is the superstar,"" said Sally Quinn, a journalist, author and Washington hostess who has been inviting Mr. Conway, but not Ms. Conway, to her parties in Georgetown.The Conways met in the summer of 1999, when Mr. Conway was a securities lawyer and partner at the New York firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Ms. Conway was a Republican pollster who appeared frequently on television. Mr. Conway told a mutual friend, the conservative commentator Ann Coulter, that he wanted to meet Ms. Conway, known then by her maiden name, Kellyanne Fitzpatrick. The future Ms. Conway drove out to a Hamptons beach house, rented by Ms. Coulter, and the couple remained planted at the house's kitchen table, chatting for hours.They married in 2001 and moved into a Trump tower in Manhattan. Mr. Conway impressed the future president by taking his side in a condo board battle over removing the name ""Trump"" from the building, and he introduced Ms. Conway to Mr. Trump.Politics was less bruising then. In 2005, Ms. Conway teamed up with Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, to write a book about how American women were erasing political lines. By reputation, Ms. Conway was smart and empathetic, the type who remembered birthdays and weddings.The Conways now have four children: the twins, George IV and Claudia, 15; Charlotte, 11; and Vanessa, 10; and a pair of Corgis, Skipper and Bonnie, which Mr. Conway nicknamed Concerned and Troubled after the terms that Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, has used to describe her reaction to Mr. Trump's behavior.Friends say the Conways are staying together for their children, although the couple is not always in the same city. Mr. Conway spent chunks of time last year in New York before leaving his firm, while Ms. Conway remained in Washington, where the Trump crowd has largely blackballed her husband.In November, Mr. Conway attended a ""Resistance"" party at the New York apartment of Molly Jong-Fast, an author and daughter of Erica Jong. The comedian Kathy Griffin posted a photograph on Instagram of Mr. Conway hiding coyly behind the liberal journalist Soledad O'Brien. Nearby were E. Jean Carroll, a writer who has accused Mr. Trump of rape, and the Hillary Clinton stalwart Philippe Reines.In Washington, Mr. Conway tends to hole up in his home office, writing opinion pieces and firing away on Twitter. In a July piece titled ""Trump Is a Racist President,"" he wrote about the first time he heard someone tell his mother, who emigrated from the Philippines, ""'Go back to your country.""'The gulf between the Conways developed slowly before turning into a chasm. After Mr. Trump's victory, the Conways jumped into Washington with both feet, buying a 15,000-square foot house with eight bedrooms and 11 bathrooms. ""Kellyanne Conway Just Bought This $8 Million D.C. Mansion,"" blared Town & Country magazine, though Mr. Conway's legal partnership accounts for most of the couple's net worth of about $40 million.Mr. Conway wept for joy on election night and called his wife's achievement ""the best thing that ever happened to her."" He turned down two potential posts in the Justice Department, calling the administration ""a dumpster fire,"" though he told the president at the time that he supported him.In those days, Ms. Conway went out alone, or with Adrienne Arsht, a philanthropist and arts patron with homes in Miami and across the street from the Conways. Ms. Arsht, who calls Ms. Conway ""a lovely neighbor, a great mother"" and ""a fabulous cook,"" played down their relationship.""Our garages face each other, so why not go out together to save on emissions?"" she asked.Early on, Mr. Conway tweeted his disapproval of the president's tweets about the travel ban, then hastened to tweet his support for the president and ""my wonderful wife.""In February 2019, at a British Embassy party for female members of Congress, Ms. Conway approached Ms. Quinn, the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd and the NBC News journalist Andrea Mitchell.""It was like, 'Oh, I love your shoes and what a great bag, blah blah,""' Ms. Quinn recalled, until she asked Ms. Conway about her husband, and Ms. Conway, she said, grew angry that Ms. Quinn had even brought him up. ""She just took off on all three of us,"" Ms. Quinn said. ""She really went crazy.""""I said, 'Kellyanne, you're married, and you're working for the president, and he's writing against the president,""' Ms. Quinn recalled. ""'Guess what? This is a story.""'The next month, the Conway marriage appeared to have become an issue in the White House. Mr. Trump had spent the weekend of March 16 retweeting conspiracy theorists and insulting Senator John McCain when Mr. Conway tweeted, ""His condition is getting worse.""The next day, Brad Parscale, who now manages Mr. Trump's re-election campaign, tweeted that Mr. Conway ""hurts his wife because he is jealous of her success."" The president piled on, ""A total loser!""Mr. Conway then gave an interview to The Washington Post, saying that he tweets ""so I can get it off my chest and move on with my life that day."" He added, referring to his wife, ""Frankly, it's so I don't end up screaming at her.""Mr. Trump clapped back: ""George Conway, often referred to as Mr. Kellyanne Conway by those who know him, is VERY jealous of his wife's success & angry that I, with her help, didn't give him the job he so desperately wanted. I barely know him but just take a look, a stone cold LOSER & husband from hell!""It fell to Ms. Conway to spin Mr. Trump's attacks on her spouse.""He left it alone for months out of respect for me,"" Ms. Conway said of the president in an interview with Politico. ""But you think he shouldn't respond when somebody, a nonmedical professional, accuses him of having a mental disorder?""Mr. Conway has not let up. In October, he used clinical terms in The Atlantic to say Mr. Trump's narcissism made him unfit for office.At Ms. Quinn's home recently, Mr. Conway and William F. Weld, the former Massachusetts governor and Mr. Trump's long-shot 2020 primary challenger, embraced like lost brothers, then posed for a photo with the former Democratic presidential candidate and self-help author Marianne Williamson.Mr. Conway ""was one of the last to leave,"" Ms. Quinn recalled. ""He was just glowing, you know?""Kitty Bennett contributed research.PhotographKellyanne Conway, senior adviser to President Trump, with her husband, George, a day before the inauguration. Though he wept for joy on election night, his views on the president soon soured. Ms. Conway, right, has defended Mr. Trump's attacks on him.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump's national security adviser intimated that the Russians were backing Bernie Sanders, as Joe Biden blamed Mr. Trump and other Republicans for the continued interference.As accusations swirled Sunday about Russia's efforts to interfere with the 2020 election, President Trump's national security adviser and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. could not agree on what Moscow is, or is not, doing.Their disagreement came as intelligence officials disputed reports that emerged last week about a briefing of the House Intelligence Committee. The officials now maintain that the House members either misheard or misinterpreted a key part of the briefing, and that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not mean to say that it believes the Russians are currently intervening in the election explicitly to help President Trump.They do believe that Russia is intervening in the election, and that Moscow prefers Mr. Trump, a deal maker it knows well. But at least for now, those two objectives may not be linked.The differing interpretations only made it easier for the Trump administration and Democrats to put forward their own version of what the Russians are doing. As the national security adviser, Robert C. O'Brien, defended Mr. Trump and intimated that the Russians favored the Democratic presidential front-runner, Senator Bernie Sanders, Mr. Biden blamed the president and other Republicans for allowing Russia to continue to interfere in the election.Mr. O'Brien, who took office at the end of last summer, insisted on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" that he had never seen any intelligence suggesting that the Russians were interfering on behalf of Mr. Trump.""There's no briefing that I've received, that the president has received, that says that President Putin is doing anything to try and influence the election in favor of President Trump,"" Mr. O'Brien said, referring to the Russian leader, Vladimir V. Putin. ""We just haven't seen that intelligence. If it's out there, I haven't seen it.""He was referring to an assessment provided to the House Intelligence Committee on Feb. 13. That briefing outlined the breadth of Russian efforts to get involved in the November election -- from hacking into voting systems to disinformation.At the root of the confusion is what Shelby Pierson, a senior intelligence official responsible for overseeing the issues of election interference, said in that briefing.Ms. Pierson, a longtime intelligence official, said there was no doubt the Russians were continuing to insert themselves in the election process. That would be consistent with past intelligence reports, and the effort by the United States Cyber Command in 2018 to block Russian intelligence from manipulating social media before the midterm congressional elections.But some intelligence officials said Ms. Pierson did not say that the current interference was explicitly on Mr. Trump's behalf. Others in the briefing said that in response to lawmakers' follow-up questions, officials made the connection between the Russian preference for Mr. Trump and Moscow's efforts to interfere in the election.The difference between actively backing Mr. Trump and preferring his re-election is a subtle nuance, officials say, but an important one: It is probably too early for the Russians to begin any significant move to bolster a specific candidate. In 2016, they at first sought to cause chaos and hurt Hillary Clinton, intelligence reports released later that year said, but only in the last few months before the election did they actively work to elect Mr. Trump.If they go the same route now, it would not be inconsistent with backing Mr. Sanders for the Democratic nomination, in part because Mr. Sanders has voted against new sanctions on Russia and because he is considered a noninterventionist. And they may conclude, rightly or wrongly, that Mr. Trump could beat Mr. Sanders.Mr. O'Brien seemed to have little doubt that the Russians preferred Mr. Sanders. ""What I've heard from the F.B.I.,"" he said, ""is that Russia would like Bernie Sanders to win the Democrat nomination. They'd probably like him to be president, understandably, because he wants to spend money on social programs and probably would have to take it out of the military.""He did not give the source of that intelligence.Mr. Sanders has denounced Russia and warned it not to interfere in the election.Mr. Trump also leapt into the fray on Sunday, accusing Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, of leaking information from the briefing.He demanded in on Twitter that someone tell ""Adam 'Shifty' Schiff to stop leaking Classified information or, even worse, made up information, to the Fake News Media.""""Someday he will be caught, & that will be a very unpleasant experience!"" Mr. Trump added.When Mr. Trump made similar comments earlier on Sunday, Mr. Schiff accused the president of deflection.""Your false claims fool no one,"" he said in a tweet. ""You welcomed Russian help in 2016, tried to coerce Ukraine's help in 2019, and won't protect our elections in 2020. Now you fired your intel chief for briefing Congress about it. You've betrayed America. Again.""Mr. Biden, who was in office as the Obama White House struggled over how to respond to Russian interference in 2016, saw some advantage in claiming he was the candidate Mr. Putin hated.""The Russians don't want me to be the nominee,"" he said on ""Face the Nation."" ""They spent a lot of money on bots on Facebook, and they've been taken down, saying Biden is a bad guy. They don't want Biden running. They're not -- no one's helping me to try to get the nomination. They have good reason.""Mr. Biden said he had not been informed of any specific intelligence. But intelligence officials say the reports they have generated have been consistent: Russian activity did not end with the 2016 election.Mr. Biden suggested that Mr. Trump was still denying Russia's involvement in 2016, even though American intelligence officials have testified on the issue every year of his presidency.""The president denies they're involved,"" Mr. Biden said. ""They've been involved. I was deeply involved in the intelligence apparatus and how it functioned before we left the vice presidency. It was clear they were involved. The president continues to deny their involvement. It's overwhelming. And the fact is that everybody knows.""He accused the Republican leadership in the Senate of failing to act to secure electoral systems.While Congress allocated several hundred million dollars for election security immediately after the 2016 election, gaping holes in the system remain, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has repeatedly blocked additional legislation from coming to the floor for a vote.PhotographRobert O'Brien said that Russia favors Senator Bernie Sanders as the Democratic nominee.

| Jump to first hitBarred so far from presenting witnesses, the House managers prosecuting the president have focused on turning his own words against him.WASHINGTON -- The House managers prosecuting President Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors have failed so far to persuade Senate Republicans to let them call new witnesses in his impeachment trial. But in their own way, they have come up with a star witness they can bring to the floor: Mr. Trump himself.Barred at this point from presenting live testimony, the managers have offered up the president as the most damning witness against himself, turning his own words against him by quoting from his public remarks, citing accounts of private discussions and showing video clips of him making audacious statements that the House team argues validate its case.Thanks to screens set up in front of the senators, Mr. Trump's voice has repeatedly echoed through the Senate chamber the past three days. There he was on the South Lawn of the White House publicly calling on Ukraine to investigate a campaign rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. There he was calling on China to go after Mr. Biden, too. There he was declaring that he would willingly take foreign help to win an election. And there he was back in 2016 calling on Russia, ""if you're listening,"" to hack into Hillary Clinton's email.The strategy seeks to capitalize on Mr. Trump's astonishingly unfiltered approach to politics, which has led him again and again to say openly what other presidents with more of an understanding of the traditional red lines of Washington -- or at least more of an instinct for political self-preservation -- would never say in front of a camera.In effect, the managers are challenging the president's own penchant for announcing his motivations without apparent regard for whether it could get him into trouble. At the same time, the managers are challenging the senators to take Mr. Trump at his word about what really drove him to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into Mr. Biden and other Democrats.While Mr. Trump's lawyers have argued that he was legitimately concerned with corruption in Ukraine when he held up nearly $400 million in security aid to that former Soviet republic, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California and the other House Democrats on the managers team have pointed to the president's own words to contend that he cared only about tarnishing his domestic rivals.In his presentation on Thursday, Mr. Schiff played about a half-dozen video clips of Mr. Trump, including one of the president on the South Lawn of the White House on Oct. 3 speaking with reporters who asked him what he was hoping to get Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to do when they talked by telephone on July 25.""Well, I would think that if they were honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the Bidens,"" the senators saw Mr. Trump saying.""So here we hear again from the president's own words what his primary object is,"" Mr. Schiff then told the senators, ""and his primary object is helping his re-election campaign, help to cheat in his re-election campaign.""Mr. Schiff said Mr. Trump's own words made clear that he learned nothing from the Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. ""He was at it again,"" Mr. Schiff said, ""unrepentant, undeterred, if anything emboldened by escaping accountability from his invitation and willful use of Russian hacked materials in the last election.""Under the trial rules, the president's lawyers have had no chance to respond to their client's star turn on the Senate floor over the last two days, but they are poised to open their own case on Saturday and almost surely will argue that the managers have misinterpreted or twisted Mr. Trump's words. In the meantime, Mr. Trump's team has been left to defend him in the hallways during breaks.""You're only hearing one side of the story here,"" said Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana, one of a squadron of House Republicans enlisted by the president to serve as an adjunct of his defense team, working the cameras outside the chamber rather than the senators inside.Mr. Johnson said it was wrong to contend that Mr. Trump was not concerned about corruption in Ukraine and elsewhere around the world. ""Of course he was,"" Mr. Johnson told reporters. ""He's been talking about it as a central theme of his campaign before he was president. When he ran on the priority of America first, that's what he meant. He wanted to make sure that American taxpayer dollars are spent wisely.""Mr. Trump is not the only person who has been presented to the Senate via video clips during the prosecution arguments, but even the other witnesses against him were largely drawn from his own team. Many of them testified during House hearings last fall about their concerns over the president and his allies pressuring Ukraine for help with his domestic politics.Among the prosecution's key witnesses are officials appointed by the Trump administration itself, including Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union; Kurt D. Volker, the former special envoy to Ukraine; Fiona Hill, the president's former Europe and Russia adviser, and her successor, Tim Morrison; Christopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director; Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff; William B. Taylor Jr., the former top diplomat in Ukraine; and Thomas P. Bossert, the former White House homeland security adviser.Others brought electronically into the chamber over the last three days include career public servants like Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine; Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a National Security Council staff member; and State Department officials like George P. Kent and David Holmes.""Why did President Trump's own officials -- not so-called Never Trumpers, but public servants -- report this in real time?"" Mr. Schiff asked, referring to the mixing of politics with Ukraine policy. ""Because they knew it was wrong.""Indeed, the managers used Mr. Trump's own appointees to rebut his assertion that he was right to push Ukraine to investigate its own supposed interference in the 2016 presidential election, a conspiracy theory that American intelligence agencies have called a Russian disinformation operation. The managers showed clips of Mr. Wray, Mr. Bossert and Dr. Hill all debunking the theory.But the most compelling voice in the chamber this week has been that of the president himself. In his three years in office, Washington has learned that when it wants to understand what Mr. Trump is doing or thinking, he will most likely spell it out in bracingly candid terms in front of a microphone or on Twitter -- and not always follow the official party line offered by his aides.That uninhibited style appeals to supporters who love that he does not hew to standard talking points, but it can make him a frustrating client for lawyers who would prefer he be more circumspect at the very least. Either way, it makes his statements more important in judging him. Which is presumably one reason his legal team has resisted Mr. Trump's suggestions that perhaps he should attend the trial and testify himself.Absent that, there will be the television clips and quotes from the rough transcript of his call with Mr. Zelensky and recollections of people like Mr. Sondland.Mr. Schiff played one clip after the other that he said exposed Mr. Trump's true intentions. In one, Mr. Trump told reporters: ""There was a lot of corruption having to do with the 2016 election against us. We want to get to the bottom of it.""When the clip was shown, Mr. Schiff focused on the ""us"" in Mr. Trump's comment: ""What does that president say? Corruption against us. He is not concerned about actual corruption cases, only matters that affect him personally.""But the managers had it easy the last couple of days with exclusive access to the microphone and the screens on the Senate floor, and unchallenged by either the White House legal team or the senators. On Saturday, the president's lawyers will have their chance to explain what Mr. Trump meant and provide the other side of the story, one that will interpret his words in a far different light than Mr. Schiff.Jay Sekulow, one of the president's lawyers, told reporters during a break on Thursday that the managers had presented nothing new and hardly proved their case.""I saw nothing that has changed in the last day and a half, two and a half days, we've been going here,"" he said. ""We're going to begin a robust case when the Senate says it's time to start.""PhotographRepresentative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York, discussed notes with other House impeachment managers on Thursday.

| Jump to first hitA classified briefing to House members is said to have angered the president, who complained that Democrats would ""weaponize"" the disclosure.WASHINGTON -- Intelligence officials warned House lawmakers last week that Russia was interfering in the 2020 campaign to try to get President Trump re-elected, five people familiar with the matter said, a disclosure to Congress that angered Mr. Trump, who complained that Democrats would use it against him.The day after the Feb. 13 briefing to lawmakers, the president berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing it to take place, people familiar with the exchange said. Mr. Trump was particularly irritated that Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the leader of the impeachment proceedings, was at the briefing.During the briefing to the House Intelligence Committee, Mr. Trump's allies challenged the conclusions, arguing that he had been tough on Russia and that he had strengthened European security.Some intelligence officials viewed the briefing as a tactical error, saying the conclusions could have been delivered in a less pointed manner or left out entirely to avoid angering Republicans. The intelligence official who delivered the briefing, Shelby Pierson, is an aide to Mr. Maguire and has a reputation for speaking bluntly.Though intelligence officials have previously told lawmakers that Russia's interference campaign was continuing, last week's briefing included what appeared to be new information: that Russia intended to interfere with the 2020 Democratic primaries as well as the general election.On Wednesday, the president announced that he was replacing Mr. Maguire with Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and an aggressively vocal Trump supporter. And though some current and former officials speculated that the briefing might have played a role in that move, two administration officials said the timing was coincidental. Mr. Grenell had been in discussions with the administration about taking on new roles, they said, and Mr. Trump had never felt a kinship with Mr. Maguire.Spokeswomen for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and its election security office declined to comment. A White House spokesman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.A Democratic House Intelligence Committee official called the Feb. 13 briefing an important update about ""the integrity of our upcoming elections"" and said that members of both parties attended, including Representative Devin Nunes of California, the top Republican on the committee.In a tweet on Thursday evening, Mr. Schiff said that it appeared that Mr. Trump was ""again jeopardizing our efforts to stop foreign meddling"" with his objections to the briefing.Mr. Trump has long accused the intelligence community's assessment of Russia's 2016 interference as the work of a ""deep state"" conspiracy intent on undermining the validity of his election. Intelligence officials feel burned by their experience after the last election, when their work became a subject of intense political debate and is now a focus of a Justice Department investigation.Part of the president's anger stemmed from the administration's reluctance to provide delicate information to Mr. Schiff. He has been a leading critic of Mr. Trump since 2016, doggedly investigating Russian election interference and later leading the impeachment inquiry into the president's dealings with Ukraine.Mr. Trump complained that Mr. Schiff would ""weaponize"" the intelligence about Russia's support for him, according to a person familiar with the briefing. And he was angry that he was not told right away about the briefing, the person said.Mr. Trump has fixated on Mr. Schiff since the impeachment saga began, pummeling him publicly with insults and unfounded accusations of corruption. In October, Mr. Trump refused to invite lawmakers from the congressional intelligence committees to a White House briefing on Syria because he did not want Mr. Schiff there, according to three people briefed on the matter.The president did not erupt at Mr. Maguire, and instead just asked pointed questions, according to the person. But the message was unmistakable: He was not happy.Ms. Pierson, officials said, was delivering the conclusion of multiple intelligence agencies, not her own opinion. The Washington Post first reported the Oval Office confrontation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Maguire, but not the substance of the disagreement.The intelligence community issued an assessment in early 2017 that President Vladimir V. Putin personally ordered a campaign of influence in the previous year's election and developed ""a clear preference for President-elect Trump."" But Republicans have long argued that Moscow's campaign was intended to sow chaos, not aid Mr. Trump specifically.Some Republicans have accused the intelligence agencies of opposing Mr. Trump, but intelligence officials reject those accusations. They fiercely guard their work as nonpartisan, saying it is the only way to ensure its validity.At the House briefing, Representative Chris Stewart, Republican of Utah, who has been considered for the director's post, was among the Republicans who challenged the conclusion about Russia's support for Mr. Trump. Mr. Stewart insisted that the president had aggressively confronted Moscow, providing anti-tank weapons to Ukraine for its war against Russia-backed separatists and strengthening the NATO alliance with new resources, according to two people briefed on the meeting.Mr. Stewart declined to discuss the briefing but said that Moscow had no reason to support Mr. Trump. He pointed to the president's work to confront Iran, a Russian ally, and encourage European energy independence from Moscow. ""I'd challenge anyone to give me a real-world argument where Putin would rather have President Trump and not Bernie Sanders,"" Mr. Stewart said in an interview, referring to the nominal Democratic primary race front-runner.Under Mr. Putin, Russian intelligence has long sought to stir turmoil among around the world. The United States and key allies on Thursday accused Russian military intelligence, the group responsible for much of the 2016 election interference in the United States, of a cyberattack on neighboring Georgia that took out websites and television broadcasts.The Russians have been preparing -- and experimenting -- for the 2020 election, undeterred by American efforts to thwart them but aware that they needed a new playbook of as-yet-undetectable methods, United States officials said.They have made more creative use of Facebook and other social media. Rather than impersonating Americans as they did in 2016, Russian operatives are working to get Americans to repeat disinformation, the officials said. That strategy gets around social media companies' rules that prohibit ""inauthentic speech.""And the Russians are working from servers in the United States, rather than abroad, knowing that American intelligence agencies are prohibited from operating inside the country. (The F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security are allowed to do so with aid from the intelligence agencies.)Russian hackers have also infiltrated Iran's cyberwarfare unit, perhaps with the intent of launching attacks that would look like they were coming from Tehran, the National Security Agency has warned.Some officials believe that foreign powers, possibly including Russia, could use ransomware attacks, like those that have debilitated some local governments, to damage or interfere with voting systems or registration databases.Still, much of the Russian aim is similar to its 2016 interference, officials said: search for issues that stir controversy in the United States and use various methods to stoke division.One of Moscow's main goals is to undermine confidence in American election systems, intelligence officials have told lawmakers, seeking to sow doubts over close elections and recounts. American officials have said they want to maintain confidence in the country's voting systems, so confronting those Russian efforts is difficult.Both Republicans and Democrats asked the intelligence agencies to hand over the underlying material that prompted their conclusion that Russia again is favoring Mr. Trump's election.Although the intelligence conclusion that Russia is trying to interfere in the 2020 Democratic primaries is new, in the 2019 report of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, there is a reference to Russian desires to help Mr. Sanders in his presidential primary campaign against Hillary Clinton in 2016. The report quoted internal documents from the Internet Research Agency, a troll factory sponsored by Russian intelligence, in an order to its operatives: ""Use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest except for Sanders and Trump -- we support them.""How soon the House committee might get that information is not clear. Since the impeachment inquiry, tensions have risen between the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the committee. As officials navigate the disputes, the intelligence agencies have slowed the amount of material they provide to the House, officials said. The agencies are required by law to regularly brief Congress on threats.While Republicans have long been critical of the Obama administration for not doing enough to track and deter Russian interference in 2016, current and former intelligence officials said the party is at risk of making a similar mistake now. Mr. Trump has been reluctant to even hear about election interference, and Republicans dislike discussing it publicly.The aftermath of last week's briefing prompted some intelligence officials to voice concerns that the White House will dismantle a key election security effort by Dan Coats, the former director of national intelligence: the establishment of an election interference czar. Ms. Pierson has held the post since last summer.And some current and former intelligence officials expressed fears that Mr. Grenell may have been put in place explicitly to slow the pace of information on election interference to Congress. The revelations about Mr. Trump's confrontation with Mr. Maguire raised new concerns about Mr. Grenell's appointment, said the Democratic House committee official, who added that the upcoming election could be more vulnerable to foreign interference.Mr. Trump, former officials have said, is typically uninterested in election interference briefings, and Mr. Grenell might see it as unwise to emphasize such intelligence with the president.""The biggest concern I would have is if the intelligence community was not forthcoming and not providing the analysis in the run-up to the next election,"" said Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former intelligence official now with the Center for a New American Security. ""It is really concerning that this is happening in the run-up to an election.""Mr. Grenell's unbridled loyalty is clearly important to Mr. Trump but may not be ideally suited for an intelligence chief making difficult decisions about what to brief to the president and Congress, Ms. Kendall-Taylor said.""Trump is trying to whitewash or rewrite the narrative about Russia's involvement in the election,"" she said. ""Grenell's appointment suggests he is really serious about that.""The acting deputy to Mr. Maguire, Andrew P. Hallman, will step down on Friday, officials said, paving the way for Mr. Grenell to put in place his own management team. Mr. Hallman was the intelligence office's principal executive, but since the resignation in August of the previous deputy, Sue Gordon, he has been performing the duties of that post.Mr. Maguire is planning to leave government, according to an American official.Adam Goldman, Julian E. Barnes and Nicholas Fandos reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York. Eric Schmitt and David E. Sanger contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographAmerican intelligence agencies concluded that Russia, on the orders of President Vladimir V. Putin, interfered in the 2016 election.

| Jump to first hitAs Republicans rallied behind President Trump, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, the party's 2012 presidential nominee, joined Democrats in voting to convict, the only senator to cross party lines.WASHINGTON -- After five months of hearings, investigations and revelations about President Trump's dealings with Ukraine, a divided United States Senate acquitted him on Wednesday of charges that he abused his power and obstructed Congress to aid his own re-election, bringing an acrimonious impeachment trial to its expected end.In a pair of votes whose outcome was never in doubt, the Senate fell well short of the two-thirds margin that would have been needed to remove the 45th president. The verdicts came down -- after three weeks of debate -- almost entirely along party lines, with every Democrat voting ""guilty"" on both charges and Republicans uniformly voting ""not guilty"" on the obstruction of Congress charge.Only one Republican, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, broke with his party to judge Mr. Trump guilty of abuse of power.It was the third impeachment trial of a president and the third acquittal in American history, and it ended the way it began: with Republicans and Democrats at odds. They disagreed over Mr. Trump's conduct and his fitness for office, even as some members of his own party conceded the basic allegations that undergirded the charges, that he sought to pressure Ukraine to smear his political rivals.But in a sign of the widening partisan divide testing the country and its institutions, the verdict did not promise finality, which members of both parties conceded would come only after the November election.The president himself did not directly address his acquittal, but shortly afterward, he announced on Twitter that he would make a public statement on Thursday at the White House about what he called ""our Country's VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax."" He then tweeted an attack ad against Mr. Romney that called the senator a ""Democrat secret asset.""At the Capitol earlier in the day, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who presided over the trial, put the question to senators shortly after 4 p.m.: ""Senators how say you? Is the respondent, Donald John Trump, president of the United States guilty or not guilty?""Seated at their mahogany desks, senators stood one by one to answer ""guilty"" or ""not guilty"" to each of the two articles of impeachment.""It is, therefore, ordered and adjudged that the said Donald John Trump be, and he is hereby, acquitted of the charges in said articles,"" declared Chief Justice Roberts after the second article was defeated.Democratic leaders immediately insisted the result was illegitimate, the product of a self-interested cover-up by Republicans, and promised to continue their investigations of Mr. Trump.""The verdict of this kangaroo court will be meaningless,"" Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said moments before the vote. ""By refusing the facts -- by refusing witnesses and documents -- the Republican majority has placed a giant asterisk, the asterisk of a sham trial, next to the acquittal of President Trump, written in permanent ink.""The president's Republican allies excoriated Democrats for a proceeding they said had damaged the country and its institutions in the name of saving them.""We will reject this incoherent case that comes nowhere near justifying the first presidential removal in history,"" said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader.Yet at a news conference after the vote, Mr. McConnell declined several times to answer reporters who asked whether he considered Mr. Trump's actions appropriate.""This decision has been made,"" Mr. McConnell said curtly. ""As far as I'm concerned, it's in the rearview mirror.""As expected, the tally in favor of conviction on each article fell far below the 67-vote threshold necessary for removal. The first charge was abuse of power, accusing Mr. Trump of a scheme to use the levers of government to coerce Ukraine to do his political bidding. It did not even garner a majority vote, failing 48 to 52, with Mr. Romney voting with the Democrats. The second article, charging Mr. Trump with obstruction of Congress for an across-the-board blockade of House subpoenas and oversight requests, failed 47 to 53, strictly on party lines.Like this one, the trials of Presidents Andrew Johnson and Bill Clinton also ended in acquittal -- a reflection of the Constitution's high burden for removing a chief executive.But in a stinging rebuke of the country's leader aimed at history, Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, said that Mr. Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine was ""the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine."" Though he voted against the second article, Mr. Romney became emotional on the Senate floor in the hours before the verdict on Wednesday as he described why he deemed Mr. Trump guilty of abuse of power, calling it a matter of conscience. He was the first senator ever to vote to remove a president of his own party.""I am sure to hear abuse from the president and his supporters,"" Mr. Romney said. ""Does anyone seriously believe I would consent to these consequences other than from an inescapable conviction that my oath before God demanded it of me?""Mr. Romney's defection, which he announced a couple of hours before the final vote, was a stark reflection of the sweeping transformation of the Republican Party over the past eight years into one that is now dominated almost entirely by Mr. Trump. And it deprived the president of the monolithic Republican support he had eagerly anticipated.Still, the White House declared victory.""Today, the sham impeachment attempt concocted by Democrats ended in the full vindication and exoneration of President Donald J. Trump,"" said Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary. ""As we have said all along, he is not guilty.""Mr. Trump's re-election campaign moved quickly to capitalize on the moment, distributing a fund-raising email declaring, ""Sorry haters, I'm not going anywhere.""Several Republican senators ultimately acknowledged the heart of the House case -- that Mr. Trump undertook a concerted pressure campaign on Ukraine to secure politically beneficial investigations into his rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., using nearly $400 million in military aid as leverage.But most argued that the conduct was not sufficiently dangerous to warrant the Senate removing a president from office for the first time in history -- and certainly not with an election so near. Others dismissed Democrats' arguments altogether, insisting their case was merely an attempt to dress up hatred for Mr. Trump and his policies as a constitutional case.Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, two Republican swing votes who have tilted against the president in the past, both voted against conviction and removal. And two Democrats from traditionally conservative-leaning states, Senators Joe Manchin III of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, voted to convict Mr. Trump, denying him the bipartisan acquittal he coveted.Although the verdict was never in doubt, Democrats lobbied to expand the scope of the Senate trial to include witnesses and documents that the president refused to provide during the House inquiry, working to pressure vulnerable Republicans facing challenging re-election contests, like Ms. Collins, to join them or risk being portrayed as beholden to Mr. Trump. All but two Republicans refused, making the trial the first impeachment proceeding in American history to reach a verdict without calling witnesses.As they closed their case, the seven Democratic House managers who prosecuted it warned that Mr. Trump would emerge only emboldened in his monarchical tendencies and that those who appeased him would be judged harshly by history. Republicans, they said, had chosen to leave the president's future up to voters despite evidence that he had tried to cheat in the election, and would continue to do so.Seldom used in American history, impeachment is the Constitution's most extreme mechanism for checking a corrupt or out of control officeholder. In unsheathing it, Democrats took on political risk that could backfire in November on their presidential nominee or their incumbents in Congress, including moderates in conservative districts and states where Mr. Trump is popular.At least one Democrat, Senator Doug Jones of Alabama, glancingly acknowledged that his vote to convict would most likely contribute to his loss this fall in deeply conservative Alabama.""There will be so many who will simply look at what I am doing today and say it is a profile in courage,"" Mr. Jones said before the vote. ""It is not. It is simply a matter of right and wrong.""For now, the impeachment of Mr. Trump appears to have evenly divided the nation. Public opinion polls suggest that even though a growing number of Americans agreed that the president most likely abused his office and acted improperly, more than a slight majority never agreed that he should be removed from office.If Mr. Trump's standing among the public has been hurt by the trial, it is not yet evident. To the contrary, the latest Gallup poll, released on Tuesday, showed that 49 percent of Americans approved of his job performance -- the highest figure since he took office three years ago. The same survey showed that Republicans' image has improved markedly, with 51 percent viewing them favorably compared with 43 percent in September.The possibility of impeachment has hung over Mr. Trump's presidency virtually since it began, but Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, initially resisted it. After Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who investigated Russia's election interference in 2016 and possible collaboration with the Trump campaign, found 10 instances of potential obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, she said impeachment was too divisive a remedy to pursue.Her calculations changed in September with the emergence of an anonymous C.I.A. whistle-blower that accused the president of marshaling the powers of government to press Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden and a theory that Democrats had colluded with Ukraine in the 2016 election. In authorizing the impeachment inquiry, Ms. Pelosi tasked the House Intelligence Committee to investigate the scheme and build a case.Mr. Trump issued a blanket directive to all government agencies not to comply with the inquiry, robbing investigators of key witnesses and facts that could have filled out their case, and ultimately giving rise to the obstruction of Congress charge.Still, more than a dozen administration officials came forward, offering testimony in private and then in scintillating public hearings that confirmed and expanded on the whistle-blower complaint. On Dec. 18, the House impeached Mr. Trump on both counts.To protect his Senate majority as much as the presidency, Mr. McConnell promised a swift acquittal -- and he delivered it. It was just 20 days from the time the articles of impeachment were first read on the Senate floor to Wednesday's vote. By comparison, the Clinton trial in 1999 lasted five weeks, and in 1868, the Senate took the better part of three months to try Johnson.The final shift in defenses by all but the most conservative of Mr. Trump's allies came last week, when The New York Times reported the first in a series of articles revealing that in August, Mr. Trump told John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, that he would not release the military aid for Ukraine until the country helped out with investigations into Mr. Biden and other Democrats.Impeachment was seriously contemplated for a president only once in the first two centuries of the American republic; it now has been so three times since the 1970s, and two of the past four presidents have been impeached.Reporting was contributed by Emily Cochrane, Catie Edmondson, Patricia Mazzei, Michael D. Shear and Sheryl Gay Stolberg.Reporting was contributed by Emily Cochrane, Catie Edmondson, Patricia Mazzei, Michael D.

| Jump to first hitWe sat down again with Democratic presidential candidates and asked them a new set of questions. Here's what they had to say.MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERG Former mayor of New York City, 77 Mr. Bloomberg's surprise entry in November shook up the Democratic race. A billionaire media executive who served three terms as mayor of New York City, Mr. Bloomberg is running as a business-minded centrist with a record of advocacy on issues like gun control and climate change. PETE BUTTIGIEG Former mayor of South Bend, Ind., 38 Mr. Buttigieg has framed his candidacy around themes of generational change and center-left policy proposals. He has stressed his identity as a gay military veteran who is not yet 40 years old, and urged Democrats not to imperil the general election by running too far to the left. AMY KLOBUCHAR Senator from Minnesota, 59 A three-term senator, Ms. Klobuchar has been campaigning as a Midwestern moderate with a left-of-center agenda on issues such as health care and business regulation. Pointing to her electoral record in Minnesota, she has been making the case that she is uniquely equipped to win states like Wisconsin and Michigan. TOM STEYER Former hedge fund executive, 62 A former hedge fund investor from California, Mr. Steyer is a major bankroller of Democratic causes, first focusing on climate change and more recently on the impeachment of President Trump. He has repeatedly explored running for office, but this is the first time he has actually become a candidate. ELIZABETH WARREN Senator from Massachusetts, 70 A former law professor-turned-senator, Ms. Warren entered the 2020 race with a reputation for battling Wall Street and has structured her candidacy around a detailed and wideranging progressive policy agenda. She has made the case that only a candidate pledging ""big, structural change"" can win the general election. ANDREW YANG Former tech executive, 45 Mr. Yang, a former technology executive, has emerged from political obscurity to build a substantial following around his proposal to establish a government-guaranteed monthly income for all Americans.The New York Times reached out to nine Democratic presidential candidates to ask them the same set of questions on video. Seven accepted the invitation. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey was interviewed in December, but has since dropped out of the race. Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont declined to participate. Most of the candidates visited the studio in our New York City office. We traveled to Los Angeles for two interview sessions. The interviews took place between Dec. 10 and Jan. 22. During the sessions, we asked candidates for a terse, direct reply before explaining their views at greater length. How would you handle a general-election debate against President Trump? Voters often bring up how they imagine different candidates faring against Mr. Trump. This question was intended to get the candidates to talk explicitly about how they would approach that challenge. In every case, they said they would not seek to fight fire with fire, but instead harry the president in a way that would undercut the foundations of his political strength. Number one, don't waste your time criticizing him and telling everybody what he's done wrong. People know that. Tell them what you're going to do right. I think Donald Trump is not the right person for the job. I said, so at the Democratic convention back in 2016. The key to dealing with President Trump in a debate is to deny him his ability to change the subject. This is going to take a huge amount of discipline. And obviously he will do things that you have to respond to or deal with when he lies. You have to correct the lie. We are the ones with the right answer. And as the nominee, knowing that the American people will agree with me on most of the issues, I will summon the discipline to deny this president his famous power to change the subject. The most important thing is to keep focusing on an optimistic economic agenda for this country because he is the king of distraction. He loves to take things as he does when he governs in places, which really, when you step back, aren't the things that people are thinking about in their everyday lives. The second is to not go down every rabbit hole with him. And the third is to use humor back at him and to sort of point out some of the absurdities. I don't think you can put up with him bullying you. And I don't think you can put up with his lies. I think you've got to be very aggressive in terms of saying how he's lying, how he's incompetent. I think the big thing is to be yourself and not let him bully you. The first rule is you never back down from a bully. I'm not letting the guy get behind me and I'm not backing off. But the other half is, I'm not making a debate all about Donald Trump. We got to get out there and talk about the reason to vote for a Democrat. We got to get out there and make our case. You know, the Trump show -- he's going to keep running it. And frankly, I think a lot of people are getting either tired or scared of that show. I cannot wait to debate Donald Trump, in large part because I believe I would make him seem totally ridiculous. I would use humor and defuse some of his more blatant misstatements and untruths. I am laser-focused on many of the same problems that got Donald Trump elected in 2016. The fact that we blasted away four million manufacturing jobs and many communities never recovered. The fact that we're going through the greatest economic transformation in our country's history and more and more Americans are being left behind. Do you think the next administration will need to investigate President Trump or members of his family? Nearly every Democratic candidate we interviewed left the door open to investigations. But they suggested they would defer to the Justice Department on how to handle Mr. Trump and his family. There is no argument that when it's over, we don't need the continued chaos. On the other hand, I hate to see somebody who did something wrong go without being called to account for it. That's a ways down the road. The first thing we should focus on right now is having the Republican-led Senate do its job and conduct an investigation after Pelosi sends the articles of impeachment over. I view this as a process that is separate from what's going on in the Oval Office. The less that things like criminal prosecution have to do with politics, the better, and it's why I will trust the Department of Justice to think for themselves to enforce the law and to do it without political interference one way or the other from me. It's not the administration that does the investigation. It's prosecutors, and they should be free from political interference. That is up to the attorney general and the Justice Department. All I know is that I will put very good people in to run that department that will make decisions about all kinds of cases. I think it's going to be really important that we have a president that gets the difference between the Justice Department and the president, and that the job of lawyers at the Justice Department is to make decisions about cases. It is not the job of the president. I don't think there's any question but that Mr. Trump has broken the law. I think that Michael Cohen is in jail for some actions that he took at the behest of Mr. Trump. I think that that's a legal question for the Justice Department. But I imagine that he's aware that he's going to be investigated, because people have gone to jail for doing things that he asked them to do. Equal treatment under the law. I believe that's still the law of the land unless it's been revoked while we've been sitting here talking. Yes. I believe that we should have Justice Department that's willing to investigate lawbreaking. Nobody is above the law, not even the president of the United States, not even the family. The law is the law. And we have a Justice Department that's there to say, ""Equal justice under law means it applies across the board to everybody. I think it's a very bad pattern to fall into where the administration of a government investigates the previous administration. We've seen this pattern play out in developing countries around the world where the new president throws the former president in jail, in part because they want to eliminate a rival. It's much more of an American tradition to try and move the country forward and unify around the new president. And that would be the direction I would prefer. What is the most important thing foreign leaders should know about you? Some of these candidates are relatively well known abroad. Most of them are not. We wanted to know how they would introduce -- or reintroduce -- themselves on the world stage. Nearly all the candidates stressed their honesty and candor. That Bloomberg is honest, Bloomberg is smart, Bloomberg cares and has a worldview. My record has been out there -- 12 years in City Hall. Everybody knows what I stand for; everybody knows what my abilities are. And everybody knows what I did. Not everything worked. But I think in looking back, a vast majority of the things that the team that I put together did work. That I will keep my word. Our allies and our adversaries should expect a United States that will govern based on our values, that will participate in the international community in leading other nations to tackle big problems, and to uplift those values, from human rights and democracy to freedom of the press. That I am someone that actually likes to be with people. I think they also need to know that I am a person of trust, that I keep my threats and keep my promises, which I think we need in a foreign leader. And that's something that President Trump has been wrong on. I am a fair partner. But I am a resolute representative of the American people. I can be a trusted partner, but you have to be in return a trusted partner to me. That I am what I appear to be. I am the daughter of a janitor who got a chance in life to do what I most wanted to do: become a public school teacher. And I got that chance because of a commuter college that cost $50 a semester and opened one door for me and then another. That what moves my soul is opportunity, that I believe in the good that we can do together as a people, as a government, when we invest in opportunity. That I want to find common ground and rebuild our historic partnerships and alliances. To me, the Trump administration will be seen as a one-term aberration, and the rest of the world will know that America's open for business to solve problems that concern everyone. Do you see Saudi Arabia as a U.S. ally? The American relationship with Saudi Arabia is under historic strain, as a result of Saudi human rights violations, a brutal war in Yemen and the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Every candidate expressed some level of concern about the American relationship with the Saudis, though some were more pointed than others. Saudi Arabia is certainly a key to us keeping peace in the Middle East. I think some of the things that I see in Saudi Arabia -- Khashoggi thing is just inexcusable. On the other hand, it is a country that's trying to change and become more Western. And if you talk to women in Saudi Arabia, they would say they're getting more rights. But we have to have relationships. We have a lot of military commitments there and a lot of allies on the military side. Saudi Arabia has been considered an ally. But they're also an example of how the disappearance of U.S. leadership has resulted in bad behavior. Saudi Arabia needs to hear the message that from things like the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi to the civil war in Yemen and the atrocities and humanitarian catastrophe that we've seen there, that the United States expects more from our allies. The United States certainly looks to Saudi Arabia as an ally, but they are testing the boundaries of that friendship. They are an ally in many ways, but that doesn't mean that you don't call them out when they do something really horrific. The killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a newspaper journalist at an American newspaper, was killed and dismembered. They did that. And I think that the president should have been much firmer in how he responded. And of course, you can see it in my record, where I voted against the arm sales and their activity in Yemen. We have a complicated relationship with Saudi Arabia. I believe that as someone who puts climate as my No. 1 priority, we're going to have to have a different relationship with Saudi Arabia going forward. I would consider them currently an ally. And I would believe that it's possible that we'll work together. But as someone who puts climate at the forefront of my No. 1 priority, this is the country with the biggest oil reserves in the world. And, you know, we cannot afford to develop all the fossil fuels in the world, period. I think we have to think hard about our relationship with Saudi Arabia. The war in Yemen, the fact that the Saudis clearly have not only undermined a free press but killed a journalist solely because he questioned authority. This, this really raises issues about our relationship with the Saudis and makes me very uneasy about the way that, in the Trump administration, we've continued to support them and continued arm sales. I think it's a real problem. We have had an alliance in relationship with Saudi Arabia for years, but it's unacceptable for an ally to dismember a journalist the way that they did. So if that's the sort of behavior of an ally, we need to re-examine that relationship and let the world know that there are serious consequences for these kinds of actions.Does the United States have a role to play in Hong Kong? The democracy movement in Hong Kong has been one of the most important news stories in the world over the last year. With few exceptions, the candidates said the American president should be a public champion of democratic values, including in Hong Kong. It doesn't seem that there's any easy solution to satisfy everybody. But I think the People's Republic should work very hard. It would be a big loss to the world and to China if Hong Kong was not a stable commercial hub. I think it is so charged, you'd have to do a backdoor, quietly, make the Chinese understand what your views are. But the people of Hong Kong certainly don't need us weighing in and increasing the tension. Those who are rising up in Hong Kong demanding democracy deserve to know that they have a friend in the United States of America. And it is shameful that they have not heard a peep of even moral support from the American president. I stand with those who are seeking a better life. And I want those who are there in Hong Kong to know that in the future, when I'm president, the United States will encourage their rightful aspirations to live in peace, prosperity and democracy. Yes, the United States should be a beacon of democracy around the world, and we should be reasserting American values. And I am very glad that we passed a bill to allow for sanctions against China when it comes to how they handled Hong Kong. I would also add how they horrifically handled the Uighurs and that they've literally taken people from their homes and put them in modern-day work camps. The U.S., as part of a coalition of democracy- and freedom-loving countries, has a role to play standing up for the rights of people in Hong Kong. We have a very complicated relationship with China. It goes across multiple vectors. It's our most important foreign relationship right now, and it will be our most important foreign relationship going forward in that context. We have a responsibility to make it clear that we believe in democracy and the rights of the people in Hong Kong. Yes. And that role should have started when the protests first began in Hong Kong. Standing up for people who are protesting for their democratic rights, I think we ought to be standing up for that all around the world. That ought to be a big part of who and what America stands for. I lived in Hong Kong for a semester. I still have family there, and when I see the scenes that are taking place, it's jarring and almost incomprehensible. We have to do all we can to stand up for the rights of the people in Hong Kong, people who are protesting for self-determination and democracy, recognizing, though that Hong Kong is in a gray area diplomatically. It's a semiautonomous region of China. So we have to approach it with that in mind. What is the most urgent economic challenge facing the United States? Unless a recession takes hold in the coming months, Democrats are likely to be campaigning next fall against an incumbent who is personally unpopular but presiding over a steady economy and low unemployment. But they all have critiques of President Trump's economic record, and in some cases the underlying health of the economic system. Too many people are left out of this economy. Partly it's income inequality, but partly it's lack of opportunity. We've got to make sure that people get the kind of education and the abilities to move up that everybody should have. If people can't see a future that's better for themselves and their children, they're not going to be happy, and they have a right to be upset. The most urgent economic challenge today is that people aren't being paid enough. Among the many complex things that we have to pay attention to in our economy, some of them are abundantly simple. And the biggest on my mind is making sure that Americans' incomes increase. It's why when I'm president, the No. 1 measure of economic performance will not be the G.D.P. It will be the income growth of the 90 percent. Shared prosperity. The problem that while people may have jobs, they can't afford things. It's really hard for them to afford, say, their prescription drugs. Well, there's a good reason for that. And the prices have been skyrocketing. And we have a president that made them a bunch of promises and haven't done anything about it. It's the inequality in income that people face. The distribution of the income of the United States is shockingly unfair. The most urgent is the corruption. Until we beat back the influence of money on decision-making in Washington, of campaign contributions and lobbying money and bought-and-paid-for experts, we can't make the changes we need to make. We've had 40 years of trickle-down economics. And it's been a complete disaster for everyone except the rich. We're going through the greatest economic and technological transformation in our country's history, and it is leaving millions of Americans behind. We blasted away four million manufacturing jobs that were primarily based in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Wisconsin, Missouri and Iowa, all swing states that Donald Trump needed to win and did win. Would it be important to you to get Republican support for your agenda? There are deep differences between the candidates on policy and ideology. One of the most important practical disagreements is over the value of bipartisanship: whether it is more of an occasional necessity for governing or a genuine virtue for its own sake. I think there's no question that you have to bring this country together. The Republicans and the Democrats in the Senate office building don't even share bread; they don't sit at the same table. We need both sides to pass legislation. You want as much support as you can get from every source for every policy you put forward. The good news is on issues ranging from economic fairness to even gun reform, there's a majority of Americans that includes lots of Republicans who agree that we have to take these steps. Yes, because I am all about winning big and bringing people with me. I think one of the key focuses of this campaign should be to bring people with me, not shut them out. And that is what I've done in all my elections. So that's how you govern as well. It's been well over a decade since Republicans deigned to compromise with Democrats. So as far as I'm concerned, what we really need to do is make sure that the people of the United States are on our side, that that's actually the way we're going to get things done. Two of my three brothers are Republicans. I reached out to Republicans pretty much every day. And I want to bring as many people on board as I can. But let's be clear, the most important thing is we make the changes we need to make. The way we're going to make real change is we're going to build a grass-roots movement across this country. And we're going to take back control of our government and make it work not just for rich folks -- make it work for everyone. My campaign is drawing in thousands of Trump voters, independents, libertarians, and Republicans as well as Democrats and progressives, because I'm not ideological, and people can sense I'm just about trying to improve our way of life. I think it is important to draw in Americans from every part of the political spectrum to solve the problems that face us all. Do you think Barack Obama made any mistakes as president? Democratic candidates have shown little to no interest in reassessing the Obama administration. We wanted to know if any of the candidates would admit to thinking the Obama administration had any flaws at all. While all of them swathed their answers in lavish praise for the Obama record, several offered revealing hints of criticism. Everybody makes mistakes all the time. I'm sure he would not say that he didn't make mistakes. Over all, I think he had a reasonably successful presidency. And he certainly came out with his reputation intact, which is the most important thing that he probably thinks about and he should. I think where the president could have done more, perhaps, was in appointing judges at the very beginning, although I'm sure he had some reasons to why it took so long. It's easy with the benefit of hindsight to point to things that should have been different. Of course, there was unfinished business, more work to do around inequality, immigration and beyond. But we should also recognize what was achieved in those eight years. Every president makes mistakes, but I admire the Obama presidency as one of the greatest in modern times. I always think of Barack Obama. And I think we don't know what we've got till it's gone. If there's one thing that really I wish I would have done and he would have done, it would be to push the pharmaceutical issue as part of the Affordable Care Act. That was an opportunity and I know there was some resistance within the Democratic Party. But I think, over all, when historians look back at Barack Obama record, they do now and they will then consider him a great president. I think Barack believed that he were, if he was decent, honest, a good -- an honest broker -- that Republicans would compromise with him. He's not perfect. He was very good, but he's not perfect. I thought he trusted the Republicans too much, too long. And it shows what a good person he is and that he has a high estimation of human nature. It just turned out he trusted some people who never compromised with him and never traded fairly with him. There are no two people who agree on everything. But President Obama faced an extraordinary crisis in this country -- an economy that at the time he took over was just hurtling over a cliff and on its way down, down, down -- and he turned that around. Every time I think of Barack Obama, I think of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, because he stood up for that agency, and he's how we got it passed into law. And that agency has forced giant financial institutions to return more than $12 billion. It's hard to play armchair quarterback when the entire economy was at stake. But I believe the biggest missed opportunity was in the wake of the financial crisis. When we had a fundamental choice to either recapitalize the banks or keep Americans in their homes, we chose the banks, we bailed out Wall Street to the tune of $4 trillion. And to me, there was a real missed opportunity that in some ways we have not yet recovered from. What is the last book you read? Presidential candidates have so little time or mental energy for anything besides the campaign. We were wondering what kind of reading they do in the free time they have. ""Catastrophe 1914"" by Max Hastings. Story of World War I. Fascinating book. In one year we went to war, and the war never changed for the next four or five years. There was no reason to go to war, and it was lack of leadership, and we can't let that happen again. I just finished a book by Seneca. It was a very short book with his commentary on the shortness of life. He says life is plenty long as long as you know how to live it, something like that. And with all the noise going on right now, it's a good time to go back to the Stoics. I am reading now ""Desk 88,"" which is the book of my colleague Sherrod Brown, and it's an incredibly beautifully written book, where he goes through the history of his desk, and all the people that had it before him and carved their names into the desk, which includes Robert Kennedy. The first senator who had the desk was Hugo Black, who was of course later appointed by F.D.R. to the U.S. Supreme Court and was a major player in the New Deal. The last book I finished, which I think was the day before yesterday, is called ""The Good Assassin."" And it's a study on American involvement in Cuba around the end of the Batista regime and when Castro was just taking over. I just finished Malcolm Gladwell's ""Talking to Strangers."" He puts together all these different studies from different areas in order to tell stories about what's gone wrong when strangers talk to each other. The story he starts with and the story he ends with is the story of Sandra Bland, and what went wrong in the communications between Sandra Bland and the police officer. And the whole book is a cautionary tale. That was really interesting. I read a book called ""Project Drawdown"" about ways that we can reduce carbon emissions and help get us down to zero.PhotographWord count: 4651Show lessYou have requested ""on-the-fly"" machine translation of selected content from our databases.

| Jump to first hitThe chief justice was sworn in as the presiding officer and senators swore to do ""impartial justice,"" as the Senate opened only the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history.WASHINGTON -- The Senate formally opened the impeachment trial of President Trump on Thursday, bracing for a deeply divisive debate over his fate as senators swore to deliver ""impartial justice"" and installed Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. to preside over the proceeding.In a somber ceremony that initiated only the third presidential impeachment trial in the nation's history, Chief Justice Roberts vowed to act ""according to the Constitution and the laws."" He then administered the same, 222-year-old oath of impartiality to the senators, setting in motion the final stage of a process that has roiled Congress and could shape the outcome of the 2020 elections, along with Mr. Trump's legacy.Even as the ritual unfolded in the chamber, with senators signing their names one by one in an oath book near the marble Senate rostrum, new evidence was emerging about Mr. Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine that is at the heart of the charges against him.A trove of texts, voice mail messages, calendar entries and other records handed over by Lev Parnas, an associate of the president's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, offered additional detail about the scheme. And the Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan federal watchdog, found that Mr. Trump's decision to withhold military aid from Ukraine, which the House charges was part of his pressure campaign, was a violation of the law.In Ukraine, officials announced Thursday that they had opened a criminal investigation into ""possible violations of Ukrainian law and of the Vienna Convention"" by allies of Mr. Trump's after documents from Mr. Parnas suggested that his associates had conducted surveillance on a United States ambassador while she was stationed in Kyiv.While Thursday's ceremony was dictated by tradition and senatorial courtesy, Mr. Trump's trial promises to be an unpredictable affair, as Democrats press their case for removing a Republican president they argue abused his power and obstructed Congress.Mr. Trump is almost certain to be acquitted in the Republican-controlled chamber, but even the president's allies were divided on Thursday about how best to defend him in a trial with heavy political stakes, some pushing for a quick dismissal and others staying open to calling witnesses who could offer new information.At the White House, Mr. Trump sought to distance himself from Mr. Parnas and raged about the trial, telling school prayer advocates that impeachment was a ""hoax"" fabricated by his enemies. The president called Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the lead House impeachment manager, a ""corrupt person.""His comments came hours after Mr. Schiff strode across the Capitol, flanked by the six other House prosectors, to present the articles of impeachment to a Senate chamber hushed by the sergeant-at-arms, who shouted, ""Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye,"" to bring the trial to order.Mr. Schiff read aloud the charges against Mr. Trump, accusing the president of a scheme to solicit foreign interference in the 2020 election for his own benefit by pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations into his political rivals, withholding $391 million in military aid and a White House meeting as leverage, and then by trying to conceal his actions from Congress.""President Trump,"" Mr. Schiff said, ""warrants impeachment and trial, removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.""Later, the president used Twitter to express his outrage.""I JUST GOT IMPEACHED FOR MAKING A PERFECT PHONE CALL!"" he wrote, apparently referring to the July phone call in which he asked President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to ""do us a favor"" and investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden.As the public debate intensifies, the arcane rules of impeachment trials require the senators to remain virtually silent throughout the proceedings -- on ""punishment of imprisonment,"" according to the text -- for hours on end, six days a week, as the world watches.The televised trial will play out against the backdrop of the president's re-election campaign and in the shadow of the Democratic Party's nominating contest, scheduled to begin with the Iowa caucuses in less than three weeks. Never in modern history has a president been the subject of an impeachment trial in an election year, adding to a sense of uncertainty in both parties.Four Democratic candidates for president -- Senators Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Michael Bennet of Colorado -- sat quietly in their seats on Thursday for the start of a trial that is likely to keep them off the campaign trail for much of the time before the Feb. 3 caucuses.""I would rather be in Iowa today,"" Mr. Sanders said, noting the coming caucuses and the contests soon to follow in New Hampshire and Nevada. ""But I swore a constitutional oath as a United States senator to do my job and I'm here to do my job, and I think the people of the United States understand that.""Less than an hour before the impeachment charges were read, the Senate performed one last bit of legislative business, giving final approval to Mr. Trump's revised North American trade deal. The vote sent the overwhelmingly bipartisan trade pact to the president's desk for his signature, handing Mr. Trump a victory as the trial began.Only hours later, in its first official action as a presidential impeachment court, the Senate issued a summons formally notifying Mr. Trump that he was on trial for high crimes and misdemeanors, and giving him and his legal team until Saturday evening to respond in writing. Senators gave the president's lawyers and the House managers who will prosecute the case the weekend to file trial briefs laying out their arguments for and against conviction.Then Chief Justice Roberts adjourned the trial until Tuesday, banging the Senate's small ivory gavel and clearing the way for arguments to begin next week.Behind the scenes, Republicans were divided over how to proceed, with moderates and conservatives at odds over whether to try to dismiss the case altogether, as Mr. Trump has suggested he would like and some of his staunchest allies are eager to do.Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, was drafting trial rules that would not guarantee a vote to do so, rankling some conservatives but potentially sparing moderates a politically risky move. And in another bow to centrists who have insisted on it, Mr. McConnell was planning to allow votes on whether to call witnesses after opening arguments from both sides and questions by senators.Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said Thursday that she would be inclined to vote in favor of new testimony at that point.""While I need to hear the case argued and the questions answered, I tend to believe having additional information would be helpful,"" she said in a statement. ""It is likely that I would support a motion to call witnesses at that point in the trial, just as I did in 1999.""The issue will be hotly debated when the trial resumes Tuesday, and the Senate is scheduled to vote on the rules for the proceeding.Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, said he would immediately call for a vote to subpoena witnesses and documents that could provide new information about Mr. Trump's actions. Democrats have said the new evidence from Mr. Parnas proves that the Senate should press for documents that the administration refused to provide during the House investigation.The evidence provided by Mr. Parnas adds significant detail to the public record about how the pressure campaign played out and new political peril for Mr. Trump as his lawyers seek to exonerate him. On Wednesday, Mr. Parnas told The New York Times that he believed the president knew about the efforts to dig up dirt on his political rivals.Representative Val B. Demings, Democrat of Florida and one of the seven impeachment managers, tweeted Thursday that the assertions by Mr. Parnas confirmed that Mr. Giuliani and others were ""working on the presidents orders.""Democrats have also demanded that the senators hear from John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser; Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff; Robert Blair, a top aide to Mr. Mulvaney; and Michael Duffey, a top budget official.But Mr. Schumer's motion is all but certain to fail. Mr. McConnell has said he has the votes to open the trial without promising witnesses, and will take up the matter later.Stephanie Grisham, the press secretary, said the White House expected Mr. Trump's formal response to the impeachment charges would prove he did nothing wrong, and she dismissed the stream of new details emerging about the Ukraine pressure campaign.Aides said Mr. Trump was not watching the pomp and circumstance happening at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, although the White House postponed the event he had scheduled with school prayer advocates until after the televised oath-taking was over.If he had tuned in, Mr. Trump would have seen an elaborate ritual that fulfilled one of the few constitutional requirements for an impeachment trial, that senators and the chief justice of the United States take a special oath that dates to 1798.On Thursday, it was administered to Chief Justice Roberts by Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the longest-serving Republican.""Do you solemnly swear that in all things appertaining to the trial of the impeachment of Donald John Trump, president of the United States, now pending, you will do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws, so help you God?"" Mr. Grassley read.""I do,"" the chief justice replied before delivering the same oath to the senators.Reporting was contributed by Emily Cochrane, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Annie Karni and Adam Liptak.Reporting was contributed by Emily Cochrane, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Anni Karni, and Adam Liptak.PhotographChief Justice John G.

| Jump to first hitAs President Trump renewed his attacks on Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrats, his press secretary threatened payback against them.WASHINGTON -- President Trump and his Republican allies focused on exacting payback against his political opponents on Thursday after his acquittal in his Senate impeachment trial, signaling that the conflict that has consumed Washington for months may only escalate rather than recede.Choosing retaliation over reconciliation, Mr. Trump lashed out at Democrats and the one Republican senator who voted for conviction. He turned a prayer breakfast into a launching pad for political attacks and then staged a long, rambling venting session at the White House where he denounced ""evil"" and ""crooked"" lawmakers and the ""top scum"" at the F.B.I. for trying to take him down.Mr. Trump's team indicated that his desire to turn the tables on his foes may go beyond just tough language. The White House press secretary declared that Democrats ""should pay for"" impeaching the president, and the Trump administration worked to facilitate a Senate Republican investigation of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the goal of Mr. Trump that was at the heart of his impeachment.""It was evil,"" Mr. Trump said of the investigations that led to his Senate trial in an hourlong stream-of-consciousness address to supporters in the East Room of the White House, tossing aside the more calibrated text prepared by his staff. ""It was corrupt. It was dirty cops. It was leakers and liars, and this should never ever happen to another president, ever. I don't know that other presidents would have been able to take it.""Democrats showed little sign of backing down either. House Democrats have already said they are likely to resume their investigation into Mr. Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to incriminate the Bidens, while a Senate Democrat on Thursday called for an inquiry into whether the administration covered up related information by improperly classifying it.Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who sat just feet from Mr. Trump as he questioned her faith during the annual National Prayer Breakfast, later pushed back against his implication that she was disingenuous for saying she prayed for him. Some of his remarks, she said, were ""particularly without class"" and ""so inappropriate at a prayer breakfast.""She also suggested that Mr. Trump appeared to be on medication during his State of the Union address on Tuesday. ""He looked to me like he was a little sedated,"" she told reporters. ""Looked that way last year, too.""Mr. Trump's vituperative performance on Thursday was the diametrical opposite of how President Bill Clinton responded to his own acquittal after a Senate impeachment trial in 1999. On the day he was cleared of charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, Mr. Clinton appeared alone in the Rose Garden, said he was ""profoundly sorry"" and called for ""reconciliation and renewal.""His Republican opponents at the time were just as eager to move on, feeling burned after losing seats in midterm elections and watching not one but two of their House speakers step down. One important difference is that Mr. Clinton was in his second term, while Mr. Trump is seeking re-election in a campaign framed in part by the impeachment debate.For Mr. Trump, the Senate's rejection of the two articles of impeachment against him on Wednesday was marred by the fact that Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, was the only senator to break rank, joining every Democrat in voting to convict Mr. Trump for abuse of power.Angry at Mr. Romney's defection, Mr. Trump waited a day to appear in person with supporters in the East Room in a ceremony that veered between celebration and confrontation.Mr. Trump held up a copy of The Washington Post to show its banner headline, ""Trump Acquitted,"" then reviewed the long litany of investigations against him over the last three years, dismissing them as partisan efforts to stop him from serving as president.""We first went through Russia, Russia, Russia,"" he said, mocking the investigations into the Kremlin's interference in the 2016 presidential election on his behalf and ties between his campaign and Moscow. ""It was all bullshit,"" he said, the first time he or any president has been known to use that profanity in a formal event on camera in the East Room, according to Factba.se, a research service.The talk included a greatest-hits string of attacks on some of Mr. Trump's top villains, including the former F.B.I. director James B. Comey (""that sleazebag""), his onetime deputy Andrew G. McCabe, the former F.B.I. officials Lisa Page and Peter Strzok (""two lowlifes""), the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele, as well as Hunter Biden, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.He called Ms. Pelosi ""a horrible person,"" Mr. Romney ""a failed presidential candidate"" who used ""religion as a crutch"" and Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the lead House manager, a ""corrupt politician.""The president thanked his lawyers and congressional Republicans, praising them one by one for their support. In particular, he highlighted Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader and his most important defender in the Senate. ""You did a fantastic job,"" Mr. Trump told him.He called out more than a dozen other Republican defenders, including Representatives Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader; Jim Jordan of Ohio; Mark Meadows of North Carolina; and Elise Stefanik of New York. Noticeably absent, and unmentioned by the president, were Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer at the center of the Ukraine pressure campaign, and Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of his most outspoken allies.""This is sort of a day of celebration, because we went through hell,"" Mr. Trump said. ""But I'm sure they'll try and cook up other things,"" he added of the Democrats, ""because instead of wanting to heal our country and fix our country, all they want to do -- in my opinion, it's almost like they want to destroy our country. We can't let it happen.""In the wake of Mr. Trump's acquittal, Republican senators pressed their inquiries into Hunter Biden's finances, seeking to prove that the president was right to insist that Ukraine investigate him and the former vice president.A spokeswoman for Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said the Treasury Department had readily complied with a request by the Republican majority for documents related to Hunter Biden's business dealings in Ukraine, contrasted with the administration's refusal to provide papers for the House impeachment inquiry.For their part, Democrats were still seeking investigations, too. Senator Christopher S. Murphy of Connecticut asked the Government Accountability Office to review whether the Trump administration misused classification power to hide information about the president's Ukraine pressure campaign. And House Democrats have already said they will probably subpoena John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, to ask about Ukraine.Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said Democrats should be made to answer for what she called a dishonest attack on Mr. Trump. ""Maybe people should pay for that,"" she said on Fox News. Asked to elaborate, she equated Mr. Trump with the United States. ""People should be held accountable for anything they do to hurt this country and this president,"" she said.Mr. Trump's speech at the National Prayer Breakfast was as overtly political as any president has delivered at the annual event, traditionally a bipartisan affair marked by talk of faith and common ground. He triumphantly held up newspapers reporting his acquittal, cited rising stock markets, boasted about his approval rating and urged the audience to vote in the fall.Mr. Trump's speech followed a keynote address by Arthur Brooks, a Harvard professor and prominent conservative thinker, who called on Americans to ""love your enemies."" At one point, Mr. Brooks asked the audience, ""How many of you love somebody with whom you disagree politically?"" Hands around the room shot up. ""I'm going to round that off to 100 percent,"" he said. But Mr. Trump did not raise his hand.""Contempt is ripping our country apart,"" Mr. Brooks continued. ""We're like a couple on the rocks in this country."" Without directly mentioning Mr. Trump, Mr. Brooks added: ""Ask God to take political contempt from your heart. And sometimes when it's too hard, ask God to help you fake it.""Mr. Trump made no effort to fake it. ""Arthur, I don't know if I agree with you,"" he said when he took the microphone. ""I don't know if Arthur is going to like what I'm going to say.""He then launched into his grievances. ""As everybody knows, my family, our great country and your president have been put through a terrible ordeal by some very dishonest and corrupt people,"" he said.Without naming them, Mr. Trump singled out Mr. Romney and Ms. Pelosi. ""I don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong,"" Mr. Trump said of Mr. Romney. Then, referring to Ms. Pelosi, he said, ""Nor do I like people who say, 'I pray for you,' when they know that's not so.""It was the first time the speaker and the president had appeared together since the State of the Union address, when Mr. Trump refused to shake Ms. Pelosi's hand before his speech and she ripped up her copy of his speech after he gave it. When Ms. Pelosi gave a short talk at Thursday's breakfast about the poor and persecuted, Mr. Trump refused to look at her, glowering with undisguised antipathy.By the end of his own speech at the prayer breakfast, Mr. Trump recognized that his message did not fit the love-your-enemies theme. ""I apologize. I'm trying to learn,"" he said. ""It's not easy. It's not easy. When they impeach you for nothing, then you're supposed to like them? It's not easy, folks. I do my best.""At a news conference later at the Capitol, Ms. Pelosi dismissed Mr. Trump's comments. ""I don't know if the president understands about prayer,"" she told reporters, but said she prays ""hard for him because he's so off the track of our Constitution, our values.""""He really needs our prayers,"" she added. ""He can say whatever he wants. But I do pray for him.""Reporting was contributed by Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Alan Rappeport, Michael Crowley and Maggie Haberman.PhotographPresident Trump on Thursday claimed vindication, and one by one lauded the lawmakers who helped him in the impeachment case.

| Jump to first hitWEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Trump on Friday pushed out Mick Mulvaney, his acting White House chief of staff, and replaced him with Representative Mark Meadows, a stalwart conservative ally, shaking up his team in the middle of one of the biggest crises of his presidency.Mr. Trump announced the change on Twitter after arriving in Florida for a weekend at his Mar-a-Lago estate, choosing to make one of the most significant switches he can make in his White House on a Friday night when most of the country had tuned out news for the weekend. As a consolation prize, the president named Mr. Mulvaney a special envoy for Northern Ireland.Mr. Trump's decision to push out Mr. Mulvaney came as the president confronted a coronavirus outbreak that has unsettled much of the country, threatened the economy and posed a new challenge to his re-election campaign. But the decision was seen as a long-delayed move cleaning up in the aftermath of the Senate impeachment trial as he shuffles his inner circle for the eight-month sprint to Election Day.In taking over the White House, Mr. Meadows, 60, a retiring Republican from North Carolina, becomes Mr. Trump's fourth chief of staff in 38 months, the most that any president has had in such a short time. His arrival almost surely signals more changes to follow, as most of Mr. Mulvaney's deputies and others on his team are expected to leave, too, possibly including Emma Doyle, his top lieutenant, and Joe Grogan, the domestic policy adviser.Hope Hicks, one of Mr. Trump's most trusted advisers, returns on Monday in a new role working for Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser. Mr. Mulvaney, who technically retained his post as budget director while serving as acting chief of staff, will surrender that, too, and the acting director, Russell T. Vought, appears poised to take the job permanently, an appointment he has quietly lobbied for for months.The change has been a long time coming. The president soured on Mr. Mulvaney a while ago but was warned by advisers not to get rid of him until after his Senate trial, which ended with Mr. Trump's acquittal on Feb. 6. Throughout the impeachment battle, Mr. Mulvaney was at near-open war with the White House counsel Pat A. Cipollone, at one point seen as a potential successor as chief of staff.Mr. Mulvaney had increasingly been on the losing side of policy battles and appeared less often at Mr. Trump's side. Some saw a sign of impending dismissal last month at the wedding of Stephen Miller, the president's senior adviser, and Katie Waldman, the spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence. Mr. Trump sat with Mr. Meadows and his wife along with other advisers at one table, while Mr. Mulvaney was left at a lower-tier table, according to a witness. Wedding guests whispered about the optics of the scene, right in front of so many people.Mr. Trump called Mr. Meadows on Thursday to offer him the job, according to a person familiar with the discussion. Mr. Mulvaney, who took an annual trip to Nevada this week, learned of the decision on Friday, another person familiar with the events said. Mr. Mulvaney did not travel with Mr. Trump to Florida; instead, he sent Ms. Doyle.The president wanted to announce the news on Twitter earlier in the day, but ended up waiting until after a day of travel to Tennessee to survey tornado damage and to Georgia to tour the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to another person close to the situation. Some aides assumed he would therefore wait until Sunday and were taken off-guard at the Friday night tweet.The replacement was widely seen in the West Wing as a chance for the president to reinvigorate his staff, over which Mr. Mulvaney was seen as losing control. Some of the president's conservative advisers, including Fox News hosts, had been pressing him to replace Mr. Mulvaney.In Mr. Meadows, Mr. Trump will have an ally he considers a confidant and bellwether of congressional conservatives. ""I have long known and worked with Mark, and the relationship is a very good one,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. At a closed-door fund-raiser on Friday evening, he told donors that Mr. Meadows would be ""my James Baker,"" according to a person in the room, referring to the chief of staff to Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Mr. Baker is generally considered the gold standard in the post.In a statement of his own, Mr. Meadows praised Mr. Mulvaney for doing ""a great job,"" adding, ""This president and his administration have a long list of incredible victories they've delivered to the country during this first term, with the best yet to come.""A founder of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, Mr. Meadows has been one of the president's most ardent defenders. For months during the impeachment battle, Mr. Meadows was a ubiquitous face on television arguing forcefully that the president had done nothing wrong, appearances that cemented his relationship with Mr. Trump.First elected in 2012, Mr. Meadows announced in December that he did not plan to seek re-election, hinting at the time that he might work for Mr. Trump in some capacity. ""My work with President Trump and his administration is only beginning,"" he said.Mr. Mulvaney, 52, a former Republican congressman from South Carolina, served as chief of staff for more than 14 months in an ""acting"" capacity without ever formally being given the title. Mr. Mulvaney brushed off the snub by telling people that everyone in Mr. Trump's White House was effectively in the job on an acting basis, but the seeming lack of faith or respect invariably made it harder for him to impose authority.Witnesses placed Mr. Mulvaney at the heart of the events that led to Mr. Trump's impeachment for pressuring Ukraine to incriminate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats. Mr. Mulvaney carried out Mr. Trump's order to suspend $391 million in aid to Ukraine, an action declared illegal by the Government Accountability Office. Some advisers later told the president that Mr. Mulvaney had helped ensnare him in impeachment, even though he was following Mr. Trump's wishes.At a news briefing in October, Mr. Mulvaney contradicted the president's denial that he had imposed a quid pro quo on the assistance to benefit his own political fortunes. Mr. Mulvaney told reporters that the White House had withheld aid to Ukraine in part to force Kyiv to commit to investigating a widely debunked theory that Ukraine intervened in the 2016 presidential election on behalf of the Democrats, a story that American intelligence agencies have called Russian disinformation.""Absolutely. No question about that,"" Mr. Mulvaney said. He added, ""That's why we held up the money. ""Later that afternoon, Mr. Mulvaney issued a written statement trying to take it back, denying any quid pro quo between the aid and the investigation.The conflicting statements bolstered Democratic critics and dismayed Republican defenders, who were relying on his assurances that the aid suspension was not tied to his demands that Ukraine investigate Democrats. Mr. Mulvaney defied a House subpoena to testify, but House managers prosecuting Mr. Trump in the Senate played his comments from the briefing repeatedly as part of their case.Fiona Hill, a former White House aide, told House investigators last fall that Mr. Mulvaney had been involved in arranging a White House visit for President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine that was tied to whether he would conduct the investigations sought by Mr. Trump and his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. She testified that Mr. Mulvaney was working with Gordon D. Sondland, who was then the ambassador to the European Union.John R. Bolton, then the president's national security adviser, was alarmed at the machinations and ordered Ms. Hill to report the matter to a White House lawyer. ""I am not part of whatever drug deal Sondland and Mulvaney are cooking up,"" Mr. Bolton told her to tell the lawyer.Unlike his predecessor John F. Kelly, a retired Marine general who left in late 2018, Mr. Mulvaney made a point of not trying to control the famously mercurial president and instead let Trump be Trump. Mr. Kelly said in October, as the House was pursuing its Ukraine inquiry, that he had previously warned the president that such an approach would mean that ""you will be impeached.""As Mr. Trump's first budget director, Mr. Mulvaney helped enact $1.5 trillion in tax cuts, the president's signature legislative victory, and rolled back environmental and other regulations. But he was frustrated in his attempts to pare back spending and wound up presiding over a period of rocketing budget deficits that are projected to top $1 trillion a year for the next decade.During Mr. Mulvaney's time as acting chief of staff, the economy remained strong, and by the end of his tenure, Mr. Trump's approval rating had risen to 49 percent in Gallup's poll, the highest of his presidency. He made a point of using Camp David to build ties with lawmakers and aides who otherwise previously felt neglected.Mr. Mulvaney recently told an audience in Britain that he regularly conflicted with the president over various decisions but made a point of keeping that private. ""I disagree with the president every single day,"" he said. ""You just don't hear about it -- that's not my job.""Reporting was contributed by Maggie Haberman from New York, and Annie Karni, Katie Rogers, Michael D. Shear and Sheryl Gay Stolberg from Washington.PhotographRepresentative Mark Meadows, left, a stalwart defender of the president, will take over for Mick Mulvaney, above, who will become a special envoy for Northern Ireland.

| Jump to first hitThe House impeachment managers sought to put the Senate on trial while the president's defense team argued he that had done nothing wrong.WASHINGTON -- In their final appeals in President Trump's impeachment trial, House Democrats argued on Monday that he had corrupted the presidency and would continue to put American interests at risk if the Senate failed to remove him from office. Mr. Trump's defenders, denouncing the case against him, said he had done nothing wrong and should be judged by voters.Making their closing arguments from the well of the Senate, the House managers and the president's lawyers invoked history and the 2020 presidential campaign as Democrats and Republicans prepared to take the fight over Mr. Trump's fate to the broader public arena. Neither side expected to change the outcome of the final vote on Wednesday, when the Senate is all but certain to acquit the president, largely along party lines.The Democratic impeachment managers, led by Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, warned that Mr. Trump had tried to rig the 2020 election in his favor -- by withholding military aid from Ukraine in an effort to pressure the country to investigate his political rivals -- and had put a blot on the presidency that would stain those who failed to stand up to him. Calling the president ""a man without character or ethical compass,"" Mr. Schiff insisted that now was the time for members of his own party to choose between normalizing corruption or removing it.""Truth matters to you. Right matters to you,"" Mr. Schiff said, making a case aimed at Republicans. ""You are decent. He is not who you are.""Casting the impeachment managers' case as shoddily constructed, the president's defense team issued a scathing indictment of the House Democrats' argument, contending that removing Mr. Trump from office would subvert the will of the electorate and fundamentally alter the functioning of the separation of powers. Their final word sounded as much like a campaign pitch as a legal defense.""This is an effort to overturn the results of one election and to try to interfere in the coming election that begins today in Iowa,"" said Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, speaking only hours before voting began in the caucuses there. ""The only appropriate result here is to acquit the president and to leave it to the voters to choose their president.""In an awkward confluence of events, Mr. Trump will have an unimpeded platform to make his own final case on Tuesday, when he is to deliver his annual State of the Union address from the floor of the very House that impeached him in December.The abbreviated closing arguments constituted the substantive end of Mr. Trump's impeachment trial, the third such proceeding in American history. In a mark of just how entrenched both sides were in their positions, senators skipped a period of deliberation and instead made their way to Senate floor one by one to announce their positions ahead of Wednesday's final vote on the House's abuse of power and obstruction of Congress charges. In 1999, the Senate spent three days weighing President Bill Clinton's fate during his impeachment proceeding.One moderate Democrat, Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, broached the idea on Monday of censuring Mr. Trump after the trial concludes, a largely symbolic gesture that he said could attract bipartisan support.""His behavior cannot go unchecked by the Senate,"" Mr. Manchin said, ""and censure would allow a bipartisan statement condemning his unacceptable behavior in the strongest terms.""But given the stark polarization in the chamber -- where most Republicans are reluctant to criticize Mr. Trump and Democrats are almost uniformly in agreement that he should be removed for his behavior -- there was no serious discussion of that option.Despite the president's lawyers' frequent references to the Iowa caucuses, few senators needed a reminder of the political calendar. Just after the arguments concluded, three senators sitting in judgment of Mr. Trump who are running for the Democratic presidential nomination -- Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota -- raced to catch planes back to the Midwest for rallies. A fourth, Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, traveled to New Hampshire, which will hold the 2020 race's first primary next week.So far, the senators who have stated their decisions on acquittal or conviction have lined up along party lines, with Democrats echoing the House managers as they announced support for conviction and Republicans insisting the president's removal was unsupportable on varied grounds.""Simply asserting -- at least 63 times -- that their evidence was quote unquote overwhelming doesn't make the House of Representatives' allegations proven or an impeachable offense,"" said Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the longest serving Senate Republican, on Monday as he announced his acquittal vote.But several moderate Republicans and Democrats, whose votes could swing against their parties, had yet to declare their intentions. It would take a two-thirds vote of the Senate -- 67 senators -- to convict and remove Mr. Trump, an outcome that appeared far out of reach. Still, the president is eager to be acquitted by a bipartisan vote and to avoid the spectacle of having even one Republican vote to convict him.Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, another potential swing vote, announced that she would vote to acquit Mr. Trump, while also taking jabs at both parties for devolving in a partisan brawl and calling the president's conduct ""shameful and wrong.""""His personal interests do not take precedent over those of this great nation,"" Ms. Murkowski said. But, she added, ""the response to the president's behavior is not to disenfranchise nearly 63 million Americans and remove him from the ballot.""Mr. Manchin said he was still undecided.Monday's closing remarks made evident just how far apart the two sides remained after two weeks of heated arguments before the Senate. They disagree not only on how to interpret the facts of the case, but on what actually constitutes an impeachable offense, too. Lawyers for the president advanced a theory rejected by most scholars that neither abuse of power nor obstruction of Congress met the definition of high crimes and misdemeanors.The House managers insisted that they had compiled a mountain of evidence capped by new disclosures by John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser, that Mr. Trump had acted corruptly and with his own interest in mind when he conditioned nearly $400 million of military aid to Ukraine and a meeting at the White House on investigations into his political rivals.Mr. Schiff portrayed it as part of an insidious pattern of conduct -- dating to Mr. Trump's embrace of Russian election interference on his behalf in 2016 -- that continues to put the country at risk.""The short, plain, sad, incontestable answer is no, you can't, you can't trust this president to do the right thing,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""Not for one minute, not for one election, not for the sake of our country. You just can't. He will not change, and you know it.""Mr. Trump then tried to shield himself and hide his wrongdoing from the public and Congress, the managers said, by mounting a defiant campaign of obstruction, blocking witness after witness from testifying while refusing to produce a single subpoenaed document.""We know what the president did and why he did it. This fact is seriously not in doubt,"" said Representative Sylvia R. Garcia, Democrat of Texas. ""Senators on both sides of the aisle have said as much. The question for you now is, does it warrant removal from office? We say yes.""Mr. Trump's lawyers condemned the impeachment managers' case as a hastily thrown together partisan enterprise, noting that the only bipartisan vote in the House was in opposition to impeachment.""This is exactly and precisely what the founders feared,"" said Jay Sekulow, one of Mr. Trump's personal lawyers. ""This was the first totally partisan presidential impeachment in our nation's history, and it should be our last.""Mr. Trump's defenders vigorously denied that he withheld the military aid to Ukraine and a White House meeting with the nation's president as leverage for investigations into his political rivals, dismissing ample evidence to the contrary. But their claims were narrowly tailored, carefully skirting the new disclosures from Mr. Bolton.Taking aim at the second article of impeachment, charging Mr. Trump with obstruction of Congress, Patrick Philbin, the deputy White House counsel, upbraided the House for jumping ""straight to the ultimate nuclear weapon of the Constitution."" The president, he said, was empowered by decades of precedent to stonewall the House's subpoenas, and to assert otherwise would be ""antithetical to the proper functioning of the separation of powers.""The dueling arguments were a prelude to the senators' final vote, capping the five-month impeachment drama.Michael D. Shear, Patricia Mazzei and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.PhotographJay Sekulow, a lawyer for President Trump, condemned the ""totally partisan impeachment."" Representative Adam B. Schiff, near left, told Republicans that Mr. Trump ""is not who you are.""

| Jump to first hitPrivately, some aides were skeptical that broad numbers of black voters, whose views of the president are overwhelmingly negative, would be persuadable this fall.WASHINGTON -- In front of an audience of 102 million Super Bowl viewers Sunday night, Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old African-American woman, became the unlikely face of President Trump's re-election campaign.In a 30-second spot that cost Mr. Trump's campaign millions of dollars, Ms. Johnson's face fills up the screen as she tearfully thanks ""President Donald John Trump"" for her early release from prison. Mr. Trump commuted her sentence in June 2018, after the reality television star Kim Kardashian West personally appealed to the president on her behalf. Ms. Johnson had been serving a life sentence for a nonviolent drug conviction.Even before the ad, Ms. Johnson was already something of a touchstone for Mr. Trump, who invited her to attend his State of the Union address last year and highlighted her story in his speech. But elevating the administration's work on criminal justice reform to Super Bowl status was another effort by Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to reach black voters.The Johnson ad was made late last year and was tested with focus groups months in advance, aides said. Mr. Trump himself made edits to the spot and ultimately settled on it as the ""most impactful"" of a flight of ads he was given to choose from in the days leading up to the Super Bowl, people familiar with the process said.Mr. Trump was not wrong: Salesforce data indicated that online, the ad featuring Ms. Johnson was the most talked about one of the game, and that most of the chatter around it was positive.But privately, several senior Trump aides expressed skepticism of Mr. Kushner's belief that broad numbers of black voters, whose views of the president are overwhelmingly negative, are persuadable. Running an ad aimed at black voters -- which could also have the effect of reassuring white suburban women, a worrisome demographic for the campaign, that the president is not racist -- was a change of strategy from Mr. Trump's previous efforts to simply energize and turn out his base.Many public polls back up the skeptics in Mr. Trump's orbit. According to a Washington Post/Ipsos poll released last month, for instance, more than 80 percent of black respondents said that they believed Mr. Trump was racist and that he had helped to make racism a bigger problem in the country. Nine out of 10 black Americans in the poll said they disapproved of Mr. Trump's job performance.[Video: Watch on YouTube.]Mr. Trump himself was a motivating factor for turning out African-American Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections. Voter participation among black people in 2018 grew from the 2014 midterms, according to data from the Pew Research Center.Despite those numbers and the skepticism from colleagues, Mr. Kushner has been advising Mr. Trump that black voters can be converted into supporters if they are simply educated on his policies. Mr. Trump's biggest challenge, Mr. Kushner has told people, is a ""knowledge gap"" on many of the president's accomplishments, particularly on the issue of criminal justice reform, which Mr. Kushner has spearheaded.Mr. Kushner has hosted black leadership summits at the White House. And two of the lone African-American White House staff members, Scott Turner and Ja'Ron Smith, have been traveling to black communities to make a pitch for Mr. Trump.Even some of Mr. Trump's most vociferous Republican critics said it was not an off-the-wall idea, although Mr. Trump had only a thin record to run on and a political career marked by racial invective and a proposed Muslim ban to run from.""They don't need to reinforce the base at this point,"" said William Kristol, the conservative writer and prominent ""Never Trump"" Republican. ""If they can chip away a little bit at the African-American vote, or make it harder to mobilize them against Trump, it's not a foolish expenditure of money.""Mr. Kushner has pointed people to public polls, including Rasmussen, that are outliers but that have shown Mr. Trump winning up to 30 percent of the African-American vote. In 2016, Mr. Trump won just 8 percent of the black vote, according to exit polls.But Mr. Kushner has told people that in Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, they faced a candidate who had been popular in the black community for decades, while Mr. Trump was then an unknown quantity. In 2020, Mr. Kushner has argued, voters need to be reminded of the president's accomplishments and that their ""worst fears have not been realized.""Mr. Trump's goal is finding a way to shave off enough supporters from the Democratic nominee to compensate for an expected loss of suburban voters in swing states like Michigan and Pennsylvania.Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, said that in three states that were key to Mr. Trump's victory -- Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- even a small change could matter.""Given how close many states were, but actually the three Rust Belt states that put him in the White House, any little bit helps at the margins of any demographic group,"" Mr. Ayres said.Mr. Trump has professed bafflement that his numbers with black voters are not higher, telling allies he assumed he would fare better because the economy is doing well and unemployment among African-Americans has dropped.Cornell Belcher, a progressive pollster whose firm worked on President Barack Obama's campaign and who is black, described the efforts by Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner as laughable. ""It's almost as if they think we're all kin to each other,"" he said, adding that passage of the First Step Act, the criminal justice bill that Mr. Trump signed in 2018, ""does not erase this man's record of just absolute, over-the-top racist rhetoric and policies that frankly hurt African-American communities.""The campaign's decision to use the Super Bowl as an opportunity to expand its coalition of voters is a change from how Mr. Trump was positioning himself less than two years ago.For years, Mr. Trump repeatedly criticized National Football League players who took a knee when the national anthem was played before games, a form of silent protest against social inequality and police brutality. He directed Vice President Mike Pence to walk dramatically out of an N.F.L. game in Indianapolis in 2017 when a group of football players knelt during the anthem.At the time, his political advisers noted that the fight with N.F.L. players like Colin Kaepernick was not some distraction, but the essence of Mr. Trump's re-election strategy: enmeshing himself in culture wars and heightening racial tensions as a method to fire up his political base.Jessica Jackson Sloan, the national director of #Cut50, a prisoner advocacy group, said the ad was helpful to her work on the state level, regardless of any political advantage Mr. Trump was trying to achieve.""We've heard many times what happened to this country when the Republican candidate for president was playing Willie Horton ads,"" Ms. Sloan said, referring to an infamous ad in the 1988 presidential race that highlighted the story of a black man who had raped a white woman and assaulted her husband while free on a prison-furlough program supported by Michael Dukakis, the Democratic candidate.""Regardless of what reasons he did it,"" she added of Mr. Trump, ""the fact we have a sitting Republican president campaigning on criminal justice reform is 180 degrees from where we've been in the past. It's really going to help us with some of these Republican state legislatures.""The Trump campaign did not announce the subject of the ad until after Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor running for president as a Democrat, unveiled his own ad, which featured an African-American mother grieving the loss of her son to gun violence.Mr. Trump had said he would air a 60-second ad during the Super Bowl, and previewed a generic ad showcasing his economic accomplishments. But what played during the game was a 30-second spot featuring Ms. Johnson, followed by a 30-second one afterward about the president's economic record.Mr. Trump's campaign emphatically denied making any decision in reaction to Mr. Bloomberg. ""He had nothing to do with it,"" said Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman. ""How we would use our 60 seconds was always an internal decision based on no outside factors.""Reached on the phone, Ms. Johnson declined to say when she learned the ad in which she appears would run.PhotographThe Super Bowl commercials this year included a 30-second campaign advertisement for the president featuring a black former convict named Alice Marie Johnson.

| Jump to first hitThe first in-person presidential appearance at the annual event in its 47-year history is President Trump's latest gesture of support for a cause dear to his evangelical base.WASHINGTON -- President Trump plans to address an annual rally of anti-abortion demonstrators on Friday in Washington, in what would be the first appearance by a sitting president at the March for Life, one of the movement's marquee events.Mr. Trump's surprise announcement, made on Twitter on Wednesday as the Senate began hearing opening arguments in his impeachment trial, is his latest gesture of support for a cause dear to evangelical Christians who are a core part of his conservative base.No president has personally attended the march in its 47-year history. Past Republican presidents might have been inclined to attend, but either on the advice of staff or their own instincts saw it as a step too far and instead showed their support in less visible ways, like through remote messages or by meeting with activists.Mr. Trump, who once called himself ""very pro-choice,"" has until now addressed the group only remotely and welcomed some marchers at the White House.But as he has battled for political survival in the face of multiple investigations and a re-election campaign, he has made increasingly warm overtures to evangelicals and sought to cast himself as the most firmly anti-abortion president in at least a generation.His administration has already embraced the march, which draws thousands of attendees, in unprecedented ways. In 2017, Mike Pence became the first sitting vice president to attend the event, and the next year, Mr. Trump became the first president to address the rally by video. In his speech, the president vowed that his administration would ""always defend the very first right in the Declaration of Independence, and that is the right to life.""Many of the evangelical Christians who most strongly oppose abortion find Mr. Trump's two divorces, penchant for profanity and lack of demonstrated interest in religion before he entered politics to be unsettling. But as a political bloc, they have stood by him loyally as he hands them long-sought judicial appointments and policy changes.In a statement, Jeanne Mancini, the president of March for Life, praised the president for appointing anti-abortion judges, cutting taxpayer funding for abortions in the United States and abroad, and outspokenly opposing late-term abortions.""President Trump and his administration have been consistent champions for life,"" she said, ""and their support for the March for Life has been unwavering.""Mr. Trump's announcement comes a few days after the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion political action group, announced that it would spend $52 million to support the president and other Republican candidates in the 2020 election cycle, a sum the group called a record.The group's president, Marjorie Dannenfelser, a former chairwoman of the 2016 Trump campaign's Pro-Life Coalition, said in a statement that Mr. Trump's attendance at the March for Life ""signals a watershed moment for the pro-life movement.""The March for Life, which has its headquarters in downtown Washington, says its mission is to ""promote the beauty and dignity of every human life by working to end abortion -- uniting, educating, and mobilizing pro-life people in the public square.""On Twitter, Ilyse Hogue, the president of NARAL Pro-Choice America, called the president's announcement ""a desperate attempt to divert attention from his criminal presidency and fire up his radical base.""Writing in the conservative news outlet The Daily Wire on Wednesday, Russell T. Vought, Mr. Trump's acting director of the Office of Management and Budget, called him ""the most pro-life president in history"" and celebrated what he called ""a golden chapter for our movement.""PhotographPresident Trump, who once called himself ""very pro-choice,"" has until now addressed the March for Life only remotely.

| Jump to first hitThe president who believes he can control events is confronted by further evidence that he cannot.On Monday, President Trump was already having a bad week.The coronavirus was spreading, the stock market was plummeting and his administration was getting blamed for an inadequate response to a health crisis.Then came Tuesday. Joseph R. Biden Jr., whom Mr. Trump was so eager to paint as corrupt that his attempts to do so led to his impeachment, pulled off one of the most remarkable political comebacks in recent history, winning nine states and joining Senator Bernie Sanders as a front-runner in the Democratic presidential race.U.S. stocks did make a comeback on Wednesday, closing nearly 1,200 points up, which counted as good news for a president betting the farm on a healthy economy. The bad news was the reason many analysts cited for the gains was Mr. Biden's Super Tuesday victories.For Mr. Trump, whose belief in his own ability to shape external events is a source of comfort, it has been a week of confronting the fact that almost nothing is in his control right now.He has dealt with the coronavirus, the first external crisis of his administration, by repeating a string of falsehoods rather than delivering reassurance. He has claimed, falsely, that a vaccine would be ready within months when in reality, it won't be ready for more than a year. And his insistence that his administration deserves an ""A+++"" for its response has done little to calm the rattled markets or an anxious electorate.There has long been a disconnect between the way Mr. Trump sees politics and the way his more seasoned advisers do. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has been focused on Mr. Sanders and his longtime rival Michael R. Bloomberg. But privately, several advisers said on Wednesday that they were not surprised that Democrats rallied around Mr. Biden, even if the president was.And they anticipated an ugly slog of a campaign going forward, with the brutal 2016 general election race against Hillary Clinton serving as a reminder of how Mr. Trump will try to tarnish his rivals, even as voters on Tuesday appeared to favor a candidate who projected calm stability over upheaval and uncertainty.Trump campaign officials said on Wednesday that they viewed Mr. Biden as ""Hillary Clinton Lite,"" a candidate who they will argue generated little enthusiasm of his own while coasting off the opposition to the president and Mr. Sanders among Democrats. They said they planned to undercut his support from black voters by highlighting Mr. Biden's vote for the now-controversial 1994 crime bill, while talking up Mr. Trump's work on criminal justice reform.And they said they would seek to elevate his backing of trade policies like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a deal that originated under President Barack Obama.But they face a daunting challenge. Mr. Obama remains deeply popular with Democratic voters, and highlighting Mr. Biden's work with him could simply energize his supporters to turn out for him in the fall if he is the nominee. And unlike Mrs. Clinton, who was viewed negatively by a large swath of voters over decades, Mr. Biden may have a stronger bond with some voters in his party.Mr. Trump's frustration over the election results was evident in one of his early-morning Twitter posts on Wednesday -- a screed against Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general who was forced into a runoff for his old Senate seat in Alabama, and whom Mr. Trump still blames for the two-year inquiry into a possible conspiracy between his 2016 campaign and Russian officials.""This is what happens to someone who loyally gets appointed Attorney General of the United States & then doesn't have the wisdom or courage to stare down & end the phony Russia Witch Hunt. Recuses himself on FIRST DAY in office, and the Mueller Scam begins!"" Mr. Trump tweeted, after Mr. Sessions fell short of securing a majority in the Republican primary.In a moment of uncertainty, Mr. Trump appeared to be grasping at the equivalent of comfort food: attacking Mr. Sessions. It was, people close to the president said, his reward for staying quiet during Mr. Sessions's primary race, and also a way for the president to highlight a race in which his sustained attacks on Mr. Sessions before the campaign ultimately affected his ability to cleanly win.It was also clear that Mr. Trump's attempt to dictate the contours of the Democratic presidential contest has had little comparable effect.For months, Mr. Trump has told aides he believes he can shape the Democratic race to his own advantage by focusing on specific candidates. And he has been more overt than any incumbent in trying to influence the nominating contest of another party, training his Twitter feed on his potential rivals and trying to deepen authentic divisions in the Democratic Party by stoking fears that the establishment was trying to rob Mr. Sanders of the nomination.In January, he floated the idea that the Senate impeachment trial was intended to keep Mr. Sanders grounded in Washington instead of campaigning in Iowa before the caucuses there.""They are rigging the election again against Bernie Sanders, just like last time, only even more obviously,"" Mr. Trump tweeted. That month, Trump aides also began to see Mr. Sanders as their ideal Democratic opponent in November and sought to elevate his profile.The president began singling out Mr. Sanders at his ""Keep America Great"" rallies as well as on Twitter. ""Bernie is going up,"" Mr. Trump said in January at a rally in Toledo, Ohio. ""He's surging. Crazy Bernie, he's surging."" He has also highlighted the senator's surges in the polls.Another target was Mr. Bloomberg, who spent millions of dollars on ads attacking Mr. Trump and had no compunction contrasting his wealth with the president's.On Tuesday, as polls opened in 14 states, the president tried a directive to voters in Texas and Oklahoma. ""Mini Mike Bloomberg will kill your drilling, fracking and pipelines,"" he tweeted. ""Petroleum based 'anything' is dead. Energy jobs gone. Don't vote for Mini Mike!""Mr. Bloomberg's withdrawal from the race on Wednesday may provide Mr. Trump with a small measure of comfort. But it also presents a looming challenge for his campaign, as Mr. Bloomberg has promised to spend $1 billion to help the Democratic nominee and immediately threw his support to Mr. Biden.Also a challenge is the surprise surge of a candidate with a genuine connection with African-American voters, the essential element to Mr. Biden's success on Super Tuesday.The Trump campaign has recently put money and time into trying to expand the president's popularity among black voters, employing tactics like opening storefronts in black neighborhoods and devoting a Super Bowl ad to overhauling the criminal justice system. Mr. Trump won only 8 percent of the black vote in 2016, but his campaign operatives thought that facing a candidate like Mr. Sanders, who had his own challenge winning over African-American voters, created an opportunity for Mr. Trump.But for months, Mr. Biden's son, Hunter Biden, and his work for Burisma, a problem-plagued energy company in Ukraine, have been the main concern of the president and his advisers. That effort was central to the impeachment inquiry into whether Mr. Trump tried to pressure Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens in exchange for releasing military aid.The damage to the president was obvious, but the former vice president's candidacy also suffered. His poll standing fell as he struggled to answer questions from reporters and voters about his son.But the revival of Mr. Biden illustrates the limits of Mr. Trump's influence.""I think Democratic primary voters are numbing to Trump's buffoonery -- black voters in particular,"" said Addisu Demissie, who managed Senator Cory Booker's presidential campaign. ""They are the ones who have breathed life back into Biden's campaign and, if anything, they may relish seeing Biden take him down.""The only real role that Mr. Trump appeared to play on Tuesday was to ensure that electability was a chief concern for Democratic voters and was the basis for Mr. Biden's support.""I would describe him as Sideshow Bob in this process,"" said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. ""There's no evidence that he's commanding a large army of voters who are affecting Democratic primaries.""Despite his lack of influence, Mr. Trump appeared eager on Wednesday to continue his kibbitzing-from-the-sidelines role. ""No question on the election?"" he asked reporters in the Roosevelt Room, where he met with airline executives about the coronavirus.The president smiled as White House aides quickly shuffled reporters out of the room.PhotographPresident Trump outside the White House on Tuesday.

| Jump to first hitAt a State of the Union watch party in Michigan, the president's most loyal supporters dug in their heels.NOVI, Mich. -- It was billed, in appropriately Trumpian fashion, as the largest State of the Union watch party in the country.The event, held in a movie theater and hosted by Michigan's 11th Congressional District Republican Committee, was centered on one of the more traditionally staid affairs in American politics, but could easily have passed as the overflow room of a Trump rally.Uniforms included ""Make America Great Again"" hats in every color; T-shirts reading ""Keep Trump, Impeach Congress""; ""Trump 2020"" rhinestone brooches; and buttons featuring a swooping yellow tuft of fuzz in homage to the president's mane.Voters who'd forgotten their flair could stop by the front of the theater, where a row of card tables offered ""Trump hairy pins"" and Trump toboggans for purchase. New gear in tow, they might then grab a bag of popcorn at the next table, or register to vote at the next, or perhaps take a selfie with the life-size cardboard cutout of the president standing nearby.Why had approximately 350 people decided to devote five hours of a Tuesday to this?""We're tired of watching President Trump be beat up,"" Dawn Thorburn, 51, a retiree, explained. ""This impeachment thing going on is a big farce, and we just want to show support for him, because it's a joke what they're trying to do.""There was a time when voters like Ms. Thorburn may well have rationalized staying home on a night like this, watching the address in their pajamas, unshackled by the event's one-popcorn-per-person rule. It was Mr. Trump himself who warned that winning might get tiring, that spoiling his supporters risked lulling them into a false sense of security ahead of the 2020 election.""The Trump base -- they're working. They're busy. They don't want to have to keep fighting for the president,"" said Meshawn Maddock, a co-founder of Michigan Trump Republicans. ""We've all got a lot of other things we could be doing.""But if the president's core supporters have shown signs of flatlining, his impeachment has jolted them alive again. Of the near-dozen people interviewed at the watch party, almost all said the impeachment inquiry and trial had motivated a spike in their own activism, whether it was knocking on doors or registering as a precinct captain.They seemed driven not so much by a desire to litigate the charges against Mr. Trump -- though, to be clear, they believe he did nothing wrong -- as by a mandate to protest the act of investigation altogether. Because in their view, Democrats, through impeachment, had committed the gravest of sins against the president: They'd disrespected him.""It fires people up. It gets them mad,"" Ms. Maddock said. ""I mean, it's exactly what the Trump base needed.""Julia Nichols, 52, who works in the automotive industry, was among the fired-up and mad. Wearing a baby-pink MAGA hat and gold hoop earrings, reclining slightly in the theater's plush chairs, she welcomed the feeling.""What the Democrats have shown me is that they cannot be trusted. So that's why I've become more of an activist, why I've gotten more active with the current campaign,"" she said of impeachment. ""I'm not going to take this crap sitting down.""Ms. Nichols said she's long believed the greatest threat to President Trump's re-election was not the incumbent himself -- what he's done, what he hasn't -- but rather his own supporters.""People can easily become complacent,"" she said. ""Because right now the economy is booming, people are doing good. And they may not feel that urgency to get out there.""""That's the greatest vulnerability,"" she went on, ""us not communicating to our family, friends, and neighbors what's at stake in this election.""As the president delivered his address, his visage casting the theater in a soft orange glow, the crowd made sure to vocalize their sense of the stakes. Whenever a Democrat appeared onscreen, the crowd erupted in boos, along with a stray ""Send them back!"" for Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.They saved their loudest jeers for Speaker Nancy Pelosi -- laughing as the president appeared to ignore her outstretched hand before the speech, booing as she ripped up her copy after it was over.As Mr. Trump condemned Venezuela strongman Nicolas Maduro as ""a tyrant who brutalizes,"" and Ms. Pelosi initially appeared expressionless, one man scoffed. ""She loves him!"" he shouted. ""She's his pen pal!"" And when Ms. Pelosi recoiled at Mr. Trump's claim that her party supports free health care for undocumented immigrants, twice mouthing ""not true,"" the same man laughed. ""Oh, Pelosi,"" he said. ""Stew, baby -- stew!""Mr. Trump and his administration, on the other hand, earned deafening cheers. As the president and his cabinet entered the lower chamber, the crowd reacted as if hyping an NBA team's starting lineup. ""BARR!"" one man shouted when the cameras panned to William P. Barr, the attorney general. Even the briefest shot of Melania Trump, the first lady, seated in the balcony in head-to-toe black, sparked joy. ""So beautiful,"" much of the audience could be heard whispering.Not once in his speech did the president mention the Senate impeachment trial, or the vote set for Wednesday afternoon.Hours before the address, Ms. Maddock said she was eager to see how Mr. Trump would handle the topic. ""They're talking about how the president, he's not even going to say the word 'impeach' in the speech,"" she said of fellow Trump supporters.Ms. Maddock wasn't so sure. ""He's going to look out into that room,"" she predicted, ""and he's going to see all the Democrats not standing, he's going to look at the senators voting against him, or who've threatened to, and he's going to go after them.""Instead, Mr. Trump did not mention impeachment once, leaving it to his supporters -- the ones who've been reinvigorated by the ""sham"" of it all, as one woman in Novi put it -- to carry the torch.Ultimately, many of those at the watch party seemed to prefer it that way. Throughout the night, voters spoke of Mr. Trump in a distinctly protective manner. They did so with pride, too -- as if the task of defending the president, batting back his naysayers, was uniquely theirs, a solemn charge handed down from the man himself.""We don't go out there screaming and crying and yelling, but we are going to go out there and make sure that President Trump is treated with respect,"" Ms. Thorburn said. ""That's what we want to protect -- his position as president.""""However,"" she added, ""I do think President Trump can protect himself.""Ms. Nichols quickly interjected. ""But,"" she argued, ""we do need to have his back.""Ms. Thorburn nodded. ""That's right,"" she said. ""We do need to have it.""Until that point, Sandra Wood, 60, who volunteers for Republican campaigns in Michigan, had hardly spoken. But she wanted to quibble with her new friend's earlier point -- that the president's supporters didn't need to scream or cry or yell to get their message across.Before impeachment, Ms. Wood said, she might have agreed. But Democrats had finally overplayed their hand -- Mr. Trump's likely acquittal be damned. From now until November, ""we are going to scream,"" she pledged. ""We have to.""PhotographRepublicans gathered in a movie theater Tuesday in Novi, Mich., to watch the State of the Union.

| Jump to first hitRepublicans made last-minute changes to their proposed rules to placate moderates, but they held together to turn back Democratic efforts to subpoena documents.WASHINGTON -- A divided Senate began the impeachment trial of President Trump on Tuesday in utter acrimony, as Republicans blocked Democrats' efforts to subpoena witnesses and documents related to Ukraine and moderate Republicans forced last-minute changes to rules that had been tailored to the president's wishes.In a series of party-line votes punctuating 12 hours of debate, Senate Republicans turned back every attempt by Democrats to subpoena documents from the White House, State Department and other agencies, as well as testimony from White House officials that could shed light on the core charges against Mr. Trump.The debate between the House impeachment managers and the president's legal team stretched into the early hours of Wednesday morning in a Senate chamber transformed for the occasion, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. presiding from the marble rostrum and senators sworn to silence looking on from desks piled with briefing books. It was the substantive start of the third presidential impeachment trial in American history.Tensions grew so raw after midnight that Chief Justice Roberts cut in just before 1 a.m. to admonish the managers and the president's lawyers to ""remember where they are"" and return to ""civil discourse.""""They are addressing the world's greatest deliberative body,"" he said.On its face, the prolonged debate was about the rules and procedures. But it set the stage for a broader political fight over Mr. Trump's likely acquittal and will help shape the 2020 campaign.Democrats were laying the groundwork to argue that the trial was rigged on Mr. Trump's behalf and to denounce Republicans -- including the most vulnerable senators seeking re-election -- for acquiescing. Republicans, for their part, insisted that the Senate must move decisively to remedy what they characterized as an illegitimate impeachment inquiry unjustly tarring the presidency.Standing in the well of the Senate, the Democratic House impeachment managers urged senators to reject proposed rules from the majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, that would delay a debate over witnesses and documents until the middle of the trial, with no guarantee that they would ever be called.""If the Senate votes to deprive itself of witnesses and documents, the opening statements will be the end of the trial,"" said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the lead manager. He said Mr. McConnell's proposal was tantamount to saying, ""Let's have the trial, and maybe we can just sweep this all under the rug.""But Republicans were unpersuaded and, just before 2 a.m. Eastern, voted along party lines, 53 to 47, to ratify Mr. McConnell's trial plan. As adopted, the resolution would pave the way for oral arguments against Mr. Trump to begin as soon as Wednesday.They rejected 10 other amendments by the same margin. An 11th Democratic proposal, to lengthen the timetable for the prosectors and defense to file trial motions, gained the support of one Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, but still failed.At the heart of the trial are charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress approved last month by the Democratic-led House. They assert that Mr. Trump used the power of his office to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into his political rivals, withholding as leverage nearly $400 million in military aid and a White House meeting. The president then sought to conceal his actions from Congress, the charges say, by blocking witness testimony and documents.Mr. Trump's legal team argues that the charges are baseless and amount to criminalizing a president's prerogative to make foreign policy as he sees fit. In a break with most constitutional scholars, they also claim that the impeachment was unconstitutional because the articles of impeachment do not outline a specific violation of a law.But on Tuesday, the debate focused principally on what would constitute a fair trial.""This initial step will offer an early signal to our country,"" Mr. McConnell said before it got underway. ""Can the Senate still serve our founding purpose?""Mr. McConnell also received a sharp reminder about the limits of his power to control an inherently unpredictable proceeding.Under pressure from Republican moderates, he was forced early in the day to make some last-minute changes to the set of rules he unveiled on Monday, which would have squeezed opening arguments by both sides into two 12-hour marathon days. Mr. McConnell's rules also would have refused to admit the findings of the House impeachment inquiry into evidence without a separate vote later in the trial.The compressed timetable was in line with a White House request to quickly dispense with opening arguments so that Mr. Trump's team could complete his defense before the weekend.But Ms. Collins, Rob Portman of Ohio and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, among others, objected privately to those provisions, which they believed departed too much from procedures adopted unanimously for the 1999 trial of President Bill Clinton and could further expose Republicans to accusations of unfairness.The objections were raised at a closed-door luncheon just before the trial was to begin, according to aides familiar with the conversation. Mr. McConnell rushed to submit a revised copy of the resolution -- with lines crossed out and changes scrawled in pen in the margins -- when it was time for the debate.When the resolution was read aloud on the Senate floor, two days had been extended to three and the House's records would be automatically admitted into evidence, though Mr. McConnell inserted a new provision that would allow Mr. Trump's team to move to throw out parts of the House case.The last-minute reversal underscored the influence of a small group of moderate Republicans in the narrowly divided Senate whose interests and demands could prove decisive in a more formal debate over witnesses and documents to come.Half a world away, Mr. Trump sought to use the global stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, to project confidence about his standing at home. He swatted away questions from reporters about the trial, instead bragging about the strength of the American economy under his leadership.But in the Senate chamber, Mr. Trump's lawyers replayed many of his most frequent and personal grievances, accusing Democrats in only slightly more lawyerly terms of conducting a political search-and-destroy mission.""It's long past time that we start this so we can put an end to this ridiculous charade and go have an election,"" said Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel.The historically rare debate was rendered even more unusual by the traditional Senate rules that prohibit senators from speaking on the chamber floor for the duration of the proceedings and instead empower the House managers and White House defense lawyers to debate the proposals. The effect was that on the trial's first day, the Senate chamber split cleanly into partisan factions, with the managers siding with Senate Democrats and Mr. Trump's lawyers taking the place of the Republicans.Mr. Cipollone rose first, delivering a brief statement urging senators to support Mr. McConnell's proposed rules and accusing Democrats of seeking to use the Senate to complete their sloppy investigative work.""We believe that once you hear those initial presentations, the only conclusion will be that the president has done nothing wrong,"" Mr. Cipollone said, ""and that these articles of impeachment do not begin to approach the standard required by the Constitution.""Democrats, who came armed with slick digital slides and video clips to drive home their arguments, spent hours detailing the factual record compiled by the House investigation and cataloging the witnesses and thousands of pages of highly relevant documents Mr. Trump had succeeded in withholding. Senators facing such a grave decision as removing a president, they argued, have a responsibility to try to push all the facts to light.""With the backing of a subpoena authorized by the chief justice of the United States, you can end President Trump's obstruction,"" said Representative Zoe Lofgren of California, the first woman in history to speak on the Senate floor as an impeachment manager. ""If the Senate fails to take this step, you won't even ask for the evidence. This trial and your verdict will be questioned.""Just an hour or so before the trial began, the seven House managers submitted one final written rebuttal to arguments put forward against their charges by Mr. Trump's lawyers. In 34 pages, they rejected the lawyers' assertion that abuse of power was not an impeachable offense and that Mr. Trump had acted legally when he ordered administration officials not to appear for questioning in the House or provide documents for the impeachment inquiry.Locked in silence for much of the day, senators were able to talk only before the proceeding began or during brief breaks. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday morning, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, denounced Mr. McConnell's rules as deeply unfair and skewed toward Mr. Trump.""It is completely partisan. It was kept secret until the eve of the trial,"" he said. ""The McConnell rules seem to have been designed by President Trump and for President Trump, simply executed by Leader McConnell and Senate Republicans.""Inside the chamber, Mr. Schumer forced votes on demanding documents and compelling testimony from four current and former Trump administration officials who were blocked from speaking with the House: John R. Bolton, the former White House national security adviser; Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff; Robert B. Blair, an adviser to Mr. Mulvaney; and Michael Duffey, a White House budget official.Each time, Mr. McConnell moved to kill the proposal before it could be considered, and was sustained by unified Republican support. At one point, he offered to short-circuit the debate to speed up the votes, but Democrats who want a full account of Mr. Trump's blockade on record declined.""This is the fair road map for our trial,"" Mr. McConnell declared. ""We need it in place before we can move forward.""Even after Tuesday's changes, Mr. McConnell's proposal makes way for potentially the fastest presidential impeachment trial in American history, particularly if the Senate declines to call witnesses.Only two other American presidents have stood trial in the Senate for high crimes and misdemeanors. Andrew Johnson was impeached in 1868, and his trial took the better part of three months, featuring testimony from dozens of witnesses and extended periods for discovery, before he was ultimately acquitted by just a single vote. Mr. Clinton's trial lasted five weeks, included testimony from just three witnesses and resulted in an overwhelming acquittal.Without witnesses, Mr. Trump's trial could conclude by the end of January. If senators ultimately do call witnesses, that timeline could stretch weeks longer.Catie Edmondson and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.PhotographRepresentative Adam Schiff, the Democrats' lead impeachment manager, spoke in the Senate as the trial of President Trump began.

| Jump to first hitSome conservatives want to recall him and others want to censure him. In the state he represents, though, many view speaking out against President Trump as an act to admire, not an apostasy.SALT LAKE CITY -- Phil Lyman wanted to do something swift and stern.Within hours of Senator Mitt Romney's vote to remove President Trump from office on Wednesday, Mr. Lyman, a freshman state representative from southern Utah who keeps an autographed ""Make America Great Again"" hat in a plexiglass case in his office, was at work drafting a resolution to censure the senator.""I mean, I respect a guy that will stand up for his opinion, but it's not without some repercussions,"" Mr. Lyman said. ""His action warrants an additional action on the part of the State Legislature.""But just as swiftly came the pushback to Mr. Lyman from Utah's Republican leadership.""Censuring Senator Romney for voting his conscience is a tricky place to be,"" the speaker of the state House, Brad Wilson, said in an interview.The governor, Gary Herbert, told The Salt Lake Tribune, ""I think that would be just a mistake to go down that road.""The president of the State Senate, J. Stuart Adams, pleaded for reconciliation. ""What I don't want to do is move into the negative rhetoric I think is coming from Washington, D.C.,"" he said at a news conference on Friday.Barely eight years ago, Mr. Romney was the Republican nominee for president and putative leader of the party. Today, the way many Republicans accept and even encourage the attacks on him from Mr. Trump, who last week accused him of using ""religion as a crutch"" to justify the impeachment vote, vividly illustrates the turn the party has taken.Utah Republicans never quite fell for Mr. Trump as hard as the rest of their party did. The state's political sensibilities, heavily influenced by its Mormon culture, are more agree-to-disagree than salt-the-earth. The president's coarse language, belittling nicknames and aversion to humility help explain why his approval ratings over all in Utah have been below 50 percent for most of the last three years.And while they support Mr. Trump as their president -- very few Republicans here say they would have voted to convict him as Mr. Romney did -- they have refused to join the pile-on they see happening back east on Fox News sets and in social media feeds of the president's followers, where their junior senator is being vilified as a ""coward"" and ""Judas"" who should be expelled from the Republican Party.Not only does Mr. Lyman's censure resolution appear to be dead on arrival, but the leader of the State Senate, Mr. Adams, also said last week that he would rather not vote on or debate any action related to Mr. Romney at all. He stressed that anything his chamber took up should be ""positive"" -- a word he used repeatedly as he spoke to reporters at the State Capitol on Friday. He said he preferred something like a unanimously agreed-to statement that affirmed Mr. Trump's strengths as president.""It may feel right -- you want to swing at someone -- but I think it's better off to do what's right,"" Mr. Adams said in an interview. Though he disagreed with how Mr. Romney voted, he added, ""I have respect for what he did.""Utah is one of the rare places where the few Romney-style Republicans who remain are relatively safe from a challenge from their right, where speaking out against the president can be an act to admire, not an apostasy.With the most vitriolic condemnation of Mr. Romney coming from outside Utah, there has been something of a rallying effect around the senator.""Not everyone hates Romney,"" read the headline on an opinion article in The Tribune this weekend. ""In spite of the loud voices who are busy calling him names, there are many of us out here who are cheering for him,"" wrote the author, Holly Richardson, a former Republican legislator.Salt Lake City's other major paper, The Deseret News, which is owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, published an editorial arguing against a censure of the senator and has run numerous other supportive pieces, including one declaring that his vote was ""what a Christian conscience demands.""Chris Karpowitz, a professor of political science at Brigham Young University, said the disputes between Mr. Romney and Mr. Trump illustrated two different visions about what it means to be a Republican.""Sometimes they line up on policy,"" Dr. Karpowitz added. ""But in terms of style and rhetoric and commitment to what in previous years were thought of as core values, they couldn't be more different.""No state as heavily Republican has been so chilly to the president. Though active registered Republicans outnumber Democrats in Utah by more than three to one, Mr. Trump won only 45 percent of the vote in Utah in 2016. Hillary Clinton and Evan McMullin, a former intelligence officer who ran as a third-party candidate, split up the rest of the vote.Last week, national conservative activists promoted a ""Recall Romney"" effort online and shared stories about a proposal circulating in the legislature that aimed to give voters the ability to recall their United States senators.Aimee Winder Newton, a Republican candidate for governor, said that such a move would have worrisome repercussions. ""I get that many state legislators are disappointed,"" she wrote on Twitter. ""But creating a culture of censuring could come back their way.""In reality, the recall bill was drafted months ago and has little support in Salt Lake City. Its sponsor has said that it has nothing to do with Mr. Romney or impeachment, and is instead meant to bolster the rights of Utahans to hold all senators accountable.Lawmakers and constitutional experts said the measure would probably not survive a court challenge anyway.""My strong impression,"" said Edward Foley, the director of election law at Ohio State University, ""is that this kind of recall would be clearly unconstitutional. After all, the Constitution itself specifies six-year terms for senators, and has no mechanism -- other than expulsion by the Senate itself -- for a state to end a U.S. senator's service before the six years are up.""Mr. Romney is by no means infallible among Utahans. And Mr. Trump is more popular here now than he was four years ago, thanks to a strong economy and his dedication to filling the courts with conservative judges.Though Mr. Romney is often associated with Utah because of his role in leading Salt Lake City's effort to prepare for the 2002 Winter Olympics, he had spent most of his life living elsewhere before deciding to run for Senate in 2018 -- a liability in a state where many families can trace their lineage back to the mid-19th century, when Mormons arrived in the Salt Lake Valley. His campaign ran into trouble early on with activist Republicans when he lost to a little-known legislator at the state convention, which forced a primary he later won. In the general election he won with almost 63 percent of the vote statewide.But the objections of grass-roots conservatives who have outsize influence in state conventions had little to do with Mr. Romney's history of feuding with Mr. Trump. Instead, they bristled at an attempt by Mr. Romney to gather enough signatures to circumvent the convention.Mr. Romney has worked diligently to cultivate relationships with Republicans in Salt Lake City. After he left Washington the day of his vote on the president, one of his first stops was at the State Capitol to meet Republican lawmakers to explain himself. He spoke at two different meetings, one with House members and another with the Senate leadership.He delivered a version of the speech he gave on the Senate floor last Wednesday in which he said his oath to God and faith guided him toward ""the most difficult decision I have ever faced."" Some legislators questioned his motives, asking why they should believe that he wasn't just trying to get even with the president. Others worried about Utah suddenly finding itself in the president's cross hairs and whether it would damage its relationship with the federal government, which controls about two-thirds of the state's land.""For a lot of us,"" said Speaker Wilson, ""the question was: 'What does this decision mean for your effectiveness as our senator?""'The meeting was intended primarily for legislative leaders, but Mr. Lyman, the author of the censure resolution, was invited as well. In an interview, he said that Mr. Romney had earned his respect for showing up, but not for his vote.He had only a few seconds to address Mr. Romney as the senator was leaving and used the opportunity to defend Mr. Trump for reducing the size of protected federal land in Utah so it could be used for commercial purposes.""There's a lot of talk in politics,"" Mr. Lyman recalled telling the senator. ""And President Trump actually came out here and did something.""But even Mr. Lyman's disappointment with Mr. Romney has its limits. Next to the bookcase in his office at the Capitol where he has his autographed MAGA hat stands another political memento he is proud of: a life-size cutout of Mr. Romney.PhotographSome in the Utah G.O.P. said that Senator Mitt Romney voted to remove President Trump out of conscience.

| Jump to first hitAn initial pact, cooling tensions in an election year, follows months of escalating tariffs and a trade war that seemed as if it would never end.WASHINGTON -- President Trump signed an initial trade deal with China on Wednesday, bringing the first chapter of a protracted and economically damaging fight with one of the world's largest economies to a close.The pact is intended to open Chinese markets to more American companies, increase farm and energy exports and provide greater protection for American technology and trade secrets. China has committed to buying an additional $200 billion worth of American goods and services by 2021 and is expected to ease some of the tariffs it has placed on American products.But the agreement preserves the bulk of the tariffs that Mr. Trump has placed on $360 billion worth of Chinese goods, and it maintains the threat of additional punishment if Beijing does not live up to the terms of the deal.""Today we take a momentous step, one that has never been taken before with China toward a future of fair and reciprocal trade with China,"" Mr. Trump said at a ceremony at the White House. ""Together we are righting the wrongs of the past.""The deal caps more than two years of tense negotiations and escalating threats that at times seemed destined to plunge the United States and China into a permanent economic war. Mr. Trump, who campaigned for president in 2016 on a promise to get tough on China, pushed his negotiators to rewrite trade terms that he said had destroyed American industry and jobs, and he imposed record tariffs on Chinese goods in a gamble to get Beijing to accede to his demands.""As a candidate for president, I vowed strong action,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Unlike those who came before me, I kept my promise.""The agreement is a significant turning point in American trade policy and the types of free-trade agreements that the United States has typically supported. Rather than lowering tariffs to allow for the flow of goods and services to meet market demand, this deal leaves a record level of tariffs in place and forces China to buy $200 billion worth of specific products within two years.To Mr. Trump and other supporters, the approach corrects for past trade deals that enabled corporate outsourcing and led to lost jobs and industries. To critics, it is the type of managed trade approach that the United States has long criticized, especially with regard to China and its control over its economy.While other presidents have tried to change China's economic approach, Mr. Trump has leaned into it. The agreement stipulates that ""China shall ensure"" that its purchases meet the $200 billion figure by 2021, all but guaranteeing an export boom as Mr. Trump heads into the 2020 election.""Although the administration claims it wants to enhance market forces in China, the purchase commitments hailed by the president will only strengthen the role of the state in the economy,"" said Daniel Price, a former George W. Bush administration official and the managing director of Rock Creek Global Advisors.The president's approach may pay off politically. He will head into a re-election campaign with a commitment from China to strengthen its intellectual-property protections, make large purchases of American products and pursue other economic changes that will benefit American business.China's leader, Xi Jinping, said in a message conveyed to Mr. Trump that the deal is ""beneficial to both China, the U.S. -- and the world."" Mr. Xi also said the agreement showed that the two countries, ""based on equality and mutual respect, through dialogue and consultations,"" can find proper and effective solutions to problems.At a lavish White House ceremony crowded with cabinet members, lawmakers and executives from America's biggest companies, Mr. Trump seized on the signing as a counterweight to impeachment proceedings that were taking place across town, where lawmakers were about to vote to approve House prosecutors for a Senate trial.""They have a hoax going on over there -- let's take care of it,"" he said.But the agreement has plenty of critics in both parties, who say that Mr. Trump's tactics have been economically damaging and that the deal leaves many important economic issues unresolved.Those include cybersecurity and China's tight controls over how companies handle data and cloud computing. China rejected demands that the text include promises to refrain from hacking American companies, insisting it was not a trade issue.And the deal does little to resolve more pernicious structural issues surrounding China's approach, particularly its pattern of subsidizing and supporting crucial industries that compete with American companies, like solar energy and steel. American businesses blame those economic practices for allowing cheap Chinese goods to flood the United States.""A ceremony at the White House can't hide the stark truth about the 'Phase 1' China trade deal: The deal does absolutely nothing to curtail China's subsidies to its manufacturers,"" Scott Paul, president of the Alliance for American Manufacturing, which includes manufacturers and the United Steelworkers union, said in a tweet. ""All those 'forgotten men and women' in U.S. factories have, once again, been forgotten.""The administration has said it will address some of these changes in Phase 2 of the negotiations and is keeping tariffs in place in part to maintain leverage for the next round of talks. Mr. Trump said he would remove all tariffs if the two sides reach agreement on the next phase.""I will agree to take those tariffs off if we're able to do Phase 2,"" he said.But Mr. Trump has already kicked the deadline for another agreement past the November election, and there is deep skepticism that the two countries will reach another deal anytime soon.As part of the deal, Mr. Trump agreed to reduce the rate on tariffs imposed in September and forgo additional import taxes in the future. But the United States will continue to maintain tariffs covering 65 percent of American imports from China, according to tracking by Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute of International Economics. That leaves the United States with an overall tariff rate higher than that of any other advanced nation, as well as China, India and Turkey.China will still tax 57 percent of imports from the United States in retaliation, according to Mr. Bown, though it's possible some of those levies may be waived in the weeks to come.The two sides did not immediately distribute copies of the agreement in Chinese, raising the question of whether translation issues had been fully resolved and whether the final text would be as demanding of the Beijing government in the Chinese version as in the English version.""We also need to be sure that the wording of the agreement is the same in both the Chinese and English versions -- history has shown that mismatches become easily exploited loopholes,"" said Ker Gibbs, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.While updates about the trade war transfixed investors for much of the last two years, the official signing of the deal was greeted with something of a shrug. The S&P 500 rose roughly 0.2 percent. A gauge of semiconductor companies, which have been particularly sensitive to the trade war, fell more than 1 percent.The deal came under fire from top Democrats, including Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, who criticized the agreement for failing to address China's state-owned enterprises and industrial subsidies. He suggested that President Xi was privately laughing at the United States and that China has ""taken President Trump to the cleaners.""""This Phase 1 deal is an extreme disappointment to me and to millions and millions of Americans who want to see us make China play fair,"" Mr. Schumer said on the Senate floor.Wendy Cutler, a vice president at the Asia Society Policy Institute who negotiated trade pacts for the Obama administration, called the gains ""meaningful, but modest.""""Because the United States was willing to compromise with China and not press them on the most difficult issues, they were able to reach positive ground,"" she said.The trade deal contains a variety of victories for American industry, including opening up markets for biotechnology, beef and poultry. Banks, insurers, drug companies and the energy industry are also big beneficiaries.China has also agreed not to force American companies to hand over their technology as a condition of doing business there, under penalty of further tariffs. And it will refrain from directing its companies to obtain sensitive foreign technology through acquisitions. The agreement also includes a pledge by both countries not to devalue their currencies to gain an advantage in export markets.The president trumpeted many of China's concessions during the signing ceremony, singling out audience members who will benefit. He called out a litany of Wall Street executives, many of whom have been pressing for greater access to China's financial services market, including Stephen A. Schwarzman, the chief executive of the private equity firm the Blackstone Group, and Kenneth C. Griffin, the billionaire founder of the hedge fund Citadel. He also mentioned the chiefs of Boeing, Citibank, Visa and the American International Group, and the chip makers Micron and Qualcomm.Referring to the energy purchases in the agreement, Mr. Trump told Senator Joni Ernst, the Iowa Republican, who was in attendance: ""You got ethanol, so you can't be complaining.""But those victories have come at a heavy price. The uncertainty created by Mr. Trump's tariff threats and approach to trade has weighed on the economy, raising prices for businesses and consumers, delaying corporate investments and slowing growth around the globe. Businesses with exposure to China, like Deere & Company and Caterpillar, have laid off some workers and lowered revenue expectations, in part citing the trade war.And other sources of tension remain in the United States-China relationship. The Trump administration has taken a tougher approach to scrutinizing Chinese investments and technology purchases for national security threats, including blacklisting Chinese companies like Huawei, the telecom firm.""I think it's maybe a useful pause in the downward spiral of U.S.-China relations,"" Susan Shirk, a professor at the University of California, San Diego, said of the trade deal.Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from BeijingPhotographPresident Trump, left, had lunch with China's trade delegation and others after signing the trade accord, in which China agreed to buy more American farm goods.

| Jump to first hitThe narrow vote came after Republican senators said they did not need to hear more evidence, and pressed toward acquitting President Trump next week.WASHINGTON -- The Senate brought President Trump to the brink of acquittal on Friday of charges that he abused his power and obstructed Congress, as Republicans voted to block consideration of new witnesses and documents in his impeachment trial and shut down a final push by Democrats to bolster their case for the president's removal.In a nearly party-line vote after a bitter debate, Democrats failed to win support from the four Republicans they needed. With Mr. Trump's acquittal virtually certain, the president's allies rallied to his defense, though some conceded he was guilty of the central allegations against him.The Democrats' push for more witnesses and documents failed 49 to 51, with only two Republicans, Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine, joining Democrats in favor. A vote on the verdict is planned for Wednesday.As they approached the final stage of the third presidential impeachment proceeding in United States history, Democrats condemned the witness vote and said it would render Mr. Trump's trial illegitimate and his acquittal meaningless.""America will remember this day, unfortunately, where the Senate did not live up to its responsibilities, when the Senate turned away from truth and went along with a sham trial,"" said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. ""If the president is acquitted, with no witnesses, no documents, the acquittal will have no value because Americans will know that this trial was not a real trial.""Even as they prepared to vote against removing him, several Republicans challenged Mr. Trump's repeated assertions that he had done nothing wrong, saying they believed he had committed the main offense of which he was accused: withholding nearly $400 million in military aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats.Still, those Republicans said, they were unwilling to remove a president fewer than 10 months before he is to face voters.""If you are persuaded that he did it, why do you need more witnesses?"" said Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, a critical swing vote on the issue whose late decision to oppose considering new evidence all but sealed Mr. Trump's swift acquittal. ""The country is not going to accept being told that they can't elect the president they want to elect in the week the election starts by a majority for a merely inappropriate telephone call or action.""""You don't apply capital punishment for every offense,"" Mr. Alexander added.The vote signaled the end of a saga that has consumed Washington and threatened Mr. Trump's hold on the presidency for the past five months, since the emergence in September of an anonymous whistle-blower complaint accusing him of using the levers of government to push Ukraine to interfere on his behalf in the 2020 election.Senators recessed the trial for the weekend and will return Monday for closing arguments, with a vote on the verdict on Wednesday.The timetable will rob Mr. Trump of the opportunity to use his State of the Union address scheduled for Tuesday night to boast about his acquittal, a prospect he has relished for several weeks. Instead, he will become the second president to deliver the speech during his own impeachment trial.The senators adopted the plan by a partisan vote on Friday night, but only after Democrats tried once last time to subpoena four administration officials, including the former national security adviser John R. Bolton, and a collection of documents relevant to the case.At the White House, Mr. Trump raged against a process he has dismissed from the start as a ""witch hunt"" and a ""hoax,"" preparing to make Democratic attempts to remove him a centerpiece of his re-election campaign.""No matter what you give to the Democrats, in the end, they will NEVER be satisfied,"" the president wrote on Twitter. ""In the House, they gave us NOTHING!""The outcome of the final vote was not in doubt. It would take a two-thirds majority -- 67 senators -- to convict Mr. Trump and remove him from office.The president has insisted that he did nothing wrong, calling a July telephone conversation in which he asked the president of Ukraine to investigate his political rivals ""perfect"" and the impeachment inquiry a ""sham."" For months, he has demanded that his allies deliver nothing less than an absolute defense of his actions. But while they were poised to acquit him, several Republicans offered words of criticism, instead.Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said that ""some of the president's actions in this case -- including asking a foreign country to investigate a potential political opponent and the delay of aid to Ukraine -- were wrong and inappropriate.""Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who challenged Mr. Trump for the Republican nomination in 2016, suggested that he did not necessarily consider the president innocent, either.""Just because actions meet a standard of impeachment does not mean it is in the best interest of the country to remove a president from office,"" he said. ""I will not vote to remove the president because doing so would inflict extraordinary and potentially irreparable damage to our already divided nation.""Not every Republican senator thought Mr. Trump acted improperly. ""For three-plus years, Democrats have been trying to parse every one of his words, add their traditional view and find themselves often perplexed,"" said Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota. ""Part of the problem is that most of America likes the straight talk and occasionally forgives if he doesn't say exactly the right thing.""Reflecting the depth of the country's divisions, both sides were already looking past the trial to begin framing the fight over Mr. Trump's conduct ahead of the November election. The first voting of the season is Monday in Iowa.With the threat of conviction removed, Mr. Trump enters the election season as the first impeached president in modern history to face voters. But his expected acquittal is also likely to leave the president emboldened. He will argue that Democrats, unelected bureaucrats and the mainstream news media have targeted him because of their disdain for his supporters, and that his fight for political survival is theirs as well.Democrats, too, planned to capitalize on the impeachment fight by urging voters to punish Republicans for refusing to demand a more thorough trial and for sticking with Mr. Trump despite evidence of his misdeeds. But they faced the risks of a potential backlash.After resisting impeachment for months, Speaker Nancy Pelosi embraced it amid revelations of Mr. Trump's actions toward Ukraine last fall. In doing so, she calculated that her party could not fail to act against a president whose actions it saw as clearly outrageous. But she confronted what she knew to be an unmovable reality in the Senate, where Democrats were certain to fall far short of removing him.Senate Republicans made a wager of their own that it was better to withstand the short-term criticisms rather than to allow the proceeding to stretch on and risking damaging revelations. In doing so, they are strapping their political fate to that of a polarizing president who enjoys unparalleled loyalty among conservative voters.The Republican victory was sealed on Friday just moments after the debate was gaveled open and Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, issued a statement saying that a vote for additional witnesses would only extend what she called a ""partisan"" impeachment. Still, she lamented that the Senate trial had not been fair and that Congress had failed its obligation to the country.Ms. Murkowski did not indicate how she would vote on the final articles of impeachment, which she denounced as ""rushed and flawed."" But she offered an unusually sharp rebuke of the institution in which she serves, appearing to cast blame on both parties and both chambers of Congress for letting excessive partisanship overtake a solemn responsibility.""Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate,"" she said. ""I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything.""""It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed,"" Ms. Murkowski addedSpeaking from the well of the Senate before the vote, the Democratic House managers made a final, urgent appeal for additional witnesses during a two-hour presentation on Friday. They warned senators that a refusal to hear new evidence would ensure that Mr. Trump would never be held accountable and would undermine the nation's democratic order and the public's faith in the institutions of government.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the lead House manager, seized on a New York Times report published in the hours before the vote to hammer home his point. The article revealed that Mr. Trump had asked Mr. Bolton last May to assist in his pressure campaign on Ukraine.""The facts will come -- out in all of their horror, they will come out,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""The witnesses the president is concealing will tell their stories,"" he added. ""And we will be asked why we didn't want to hear that information when we had the chance. What answer shall we give if we do not pursue the truth now?""Mr. Trump's defense team vigorously argued the opposite view, telling senators they had all the evidence they needed to dismiss the charges before them, and warning that calling new witnesses would set a dangerous precedent by validating a rushed and incomplete case presented by the House.""The Senate is not here to do the investigatory work that the House didn't do,"" said Patrick Philbin, a deputy White House counsel.Reporting was contributed by Carl Hulse, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Catie Edmondson, Emily Cochrane and Patricia Mazzei.Reporting was contributed by Carl Hulse, Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Catie Edmondson, Emily Cochrane and Patricia Mazzei.PhotographSenator Lisa Murkowski, top, Republican of Alaska, said calling witnesses would only extend a partisan impeachment.

| Jump to first hitMr. Trump was the first sitting president to speak in person at the annual March for Life.WASHINGTON -- Demonstrators flooded the National Mall on Friday morning in anticipation of a historic moment for the anti-abortion movement: the first sitting president to address the annual March for Life in person.President Trump did not disappoint them.""Unborn children have never had a stronger defender in the White House,"" he told the crowd of religious-school groups and anti-abortion activists who packed the mall to hear him speak.Past Republican presidents who opposed abortion sent video messages or delegated a surrogate to speak in their place at the march. But when Mr. Trump announced this week on Twitter that he planned to speak in front of the group, he made it clear he was intent on solidifying his support with socially conservative voters on the day House Democrats were making their final formal argument for his removal from office.In his remarks, which he delivered on a gray day from behind a plate of bulletproof glass, Mr. Trump spoke about what was at stake in the next election.""The far left is actively working to erase our God-given rights,"" Mr. Trump said, adding that they wanted to ""silence Americans who believe in the sanctity of life.""The president accused Democrats of supporting infanticide, singling out Gov. Ralph S. Northam of Virginia for supporting a late-term abortion bill that Mr. Trump falsely said would ""execute a baby after birth."" In his chilling accusation, the president was reiterating a messaging strategy that conservative activists have been using to rally his base to the polls in November.As if to emphasize his message on Friday, the Trump administration announced plans to withhold federal money from California if it did not drop a requirement that private insurers cover abortions. It gave the state 30 days to commit to lifting the requirement.But at the march, it was Mr. Trump's mere presence, more than any of his promises or his ominous warnings, that was cause for excitement.Roy Hagemyer, 62, a pastor from Mohave Valley, Ariz., who was standing at the corner of 15th Street and Constitution Avenue and handing out signs reading, ""Human Rights Begin in the Womb,"" could barely contain his excitement before Mr. Trump's speech.""The president is going to speak here today, the first time in history,"" he said, smiling. ""That really puts a lot of horsepower behind our movement.""Mr. Hagemyer said Mr. Trump's support makes him even more optimistic about the future. ""I firmly believe that in my lifetime we will see Roe v. Wade overturned,"" he said referring to the landmark 1973 Supreme Court ruling that extended federal protections to abortion. ""The tide is turning. People are starting to realize abortion is not something we should be doing.""But Alexis McGill Johnson, the acting president and chief executive of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund, pushed back on that idea in a statement after Mr. Trump's appearance.""While Trump stands with the small number of Americans who want politicians to interfere with their personal health decisions, we'll be standing with the nearly 80 percent of Americans who support abortion access,"" Ms. Johnson said. ""We will never stop fighting for all of the people in this country who need access to sexual and reproductive health care, including abortion.""Mr. Trump's relationship with the anti-abortion movement has been a transactional one since he entered politics in the 2016 presidential campaign. He has focused his efforts in particular on white evangelicals and Catholics, a critical part of his base in that campaign who could be even more important this November.In exchange for the appointment of anti-abortion judges, his unwavering support for Israel and his attempts to protect the rights of students to pray in schools, they have generally overlooked Mr. Trump's own complicated past with the issue and his own history of three marriages and two divorces.In an interview in 1999 on NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Mr. Trump described himself as ""pro-choice in every respect,"" but he officially reversed positions in 2011, when he was considering running against President Barack Obama, and told the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, ""I'm pro-life."" It was a move encouraged by his advisers at the time to get the issue out of the way early.It was not quite that easy. Four years ago this month, leading abortion opponents including Marjorie Dannenfelser, the president of Susan B. Anthony List, wrote a letter urging Iowans ""to support anyone but Trump"" in the Republican caucus because ""on the issue of defending unborn children and protecting women from the violence of abortion, Mr. Trump cannot be trusted.""That changed once he won the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. Ms. Dannenfelser led Mr. Trump's Pro-Life Coalition, and Mr. Trump wrote to anti-abortion leaders and publicly committed to pursuing their core policy objectives, and they worked to elect him. And evangelical misgivings about Mr. Trump, widely voiced during the campaign, have largely disappeared as a result of his efforts as president.More than 80 percent of white evangelical voters supported him in 2016, but a critical editorial last month in Christianity Today, a flagship evangelical magazine, raised concerns in the White House about the depth of Mr. Trump's support.But the president now routinely talks about mothers ""executing babies"" and brands Democrats the ""party of late-term abortion."" And the political movement to end legalized abortion has become even more interwoven into the core strategy of Republican efforts to re-elect Mr. Trump by motivating white evangelical and Catholic voters.""The difference between 2016 and now is how fully the Republican Party has accepted the issue as a driving force at the center of elections,"" Ms. Dannenfelser said in a phone interview.""This president is the reason why,"" she said. ""He took it on, put it at the center of his campaign-fulfilled promises and is putting this cause at the center of his re-election this year.""Aides like Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor were quick to promote him this week as the ""most pro-life president in history,"" while hours before Mr. Trump took the stage in Washington, Vice President Mike Pence discussed the March for Life with Pope Francis during a trip to the Vatican.For the anti-abortion movement, Mr. Trump's appearance at the March for Life is its most significant moment since it began in 1974, the year after the Supreme Court legalized abortion nationwide. His presence signified just how mainstream he has made their cause, which for years lacked power and resources compared with Planned Parenthood and other abortion rights groups.For many at the march, the president's presence symbolized a victory after years of complaints that their views were dismissed by the mainstream news media.""He understands that physical presence communicates commitment and attachment,"" Ms. Dannenfelser said. ""Phoning it in is just what it sounds like -- it was a signal that the life movement was to be kept at arms distance. But no more.""And for many in the crowd, seeing Mr. Trump and hearing his anti-abortion priorities far outweighed the impeachment trial happening in the Senate chamber at the other end of the mall.Karen Rains, 42, a dental hygienist from Henderson, Texas, stood with her daughter, 19, and mother, 72, waiting to see the president. People in her small town, she said, were not paying attention to impeachment at all.""It's a waste of time; people are laughing at it,"" she said, holding a pink ""Women for Trump"" flag.""I can't believe we are getting to do this,"" she went on. ""It's still not real!""Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.PhotographOn Friday morning, President Trump became the first sitting president to speak in person at the annual March for Life.

| Jump to first hitWhile members of his administration tried to convey a calm and steady response, President Trump hosted another free-form political rally where he accused his enemies of stoking panic.NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. -- Larry Kudlow, the president's chief economic adviser, stood in the White House briefing room on Friday urging the public -- and the plunging financial markets -- not to panic over the coronavirus outbreak, while Vice President Mike Pence spread a similar message to officials and residents at an event in Florida.Later, as the authorities revealed a second person in California had been found to be infected with the coronavirus without having any known risk factors, President Trump suggested the panic over the issue was being manufactured by his enemies.In South Carolina on Friday night at his latest freestyle ""Keep America Great"" rally, the president accused Democrats of treating alarm over the coronavirus as ""their new hoax,"" and said the news media was in ""hysteria mode"" over his administration's handling of the outbreak, continuing an attempt to shift blame for a public health crisis onto his political adversaries.""Now the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus,"" Mr. Trump told a crowd of supporters, who roared in response. ""They can't even count their votes in Iowa.""""We have 15 people"" with the virus ""in this massive country, and because of the fact that we went early,"" referring to an earlier decision to close American borders to travelers from China, ""we could've had a lot more than that.""The president added that ""so far, we have lost nobody"" to the coronavirus.""It doesn't mean we won't,"" he said.(By late Friday, two more unexplained cases of the coronavirus had been confirmed in the West, one in Oregon and one in Washington State.)Mr. Trump, who overnighted this week in India and who, according to his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, has barely slept since, spent nearly 90 minutes mixing his views about the coronavirus with insults about the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates.He also sprinkled in free-associative rants about his popularity with black voters and topics further afield. The president at different points mused about the Rev. Al Sharpton's weight -- ""He looked better when he was heavy"" -- and the Academy Awards -- ""Seriously, the Academy Awards has gone way, way down in ratings. You know why? Because they started attacking us, and we don't believe in it anymore. That's why.""But he always found his way back to partisan politics.""On Jan. 31, I ordered the suspension of foreign nationals who have recently been in China from entering the United States,"" Mr. Trump said to loud cheers about his decision to seal the borders to travelers, ""an action which the Democrats loudly criticized and protested, and now everybody's complimenting me.""Experts have questioned the effectiveness of border closures and quarantines when so much about the coronavirus is unknown. Yet Mr. Trump appeared to tie his administration's response with his case for tighter immigration policies: ""We must understand that border security is also health security.""In recent days, the president has appeared more interested in his prospects for re-election than in conducting a measured response to a public health crisis. On Friday morning, Fox News -- usually a reliable ally -- drew Mr. Trump's ire for releasing polling that showed him faltering in matchups against potential rivals in November.""Worst Polls, just like in 2016 when they were so far off the mark, are the @FoxNews Polls,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Why doesn't Fox finally get a competent Polling Company?"" (At the rally, he remarked that the unnamed Fox pollster ""hates Trump's guts."")The Keep America Great rally in South Carolina, a state that Mr. Trump won handily in 2016, was intended to draw attention away from the Democratic primary, scheduled for Saturday. With both of the state's Republican senators, Lindsey Graham and Tim Scott, in tow, the president became the latest national politician to visit a state that has been overwhelmed by them.Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the billionaire businessman Tom Steyer, both running for the Democratic presidential nomination, are betting that South Carolina will revive their flagging campaigns, and the president had words for them.""I thought I knew all the wealthy people,"" he said of Mr. Steyer, whom he mocked as ""Mr. Impeachment."" He then teased Mr. Biden for mixing up the names of states he has visited. ""He did that like seven times,"" Mr. Trump said.""If I did that once, it would be the end of the road, right?"" he added. ""They'd say Trump has lost it.""He paused before saying, ""They like to say that anyway, I guess.""Mr. Trump poll-tested various candidates with the crowd -- ""We won't include Steyer, he's a loser"" -- before disparaging Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as a ""mean one"" and dismissing Michael R. Bloomberg as ""gone"" and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota as ""not going to happen."" The president then asked his supporters who they thought was the weaker candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont or Mr. Biden.""Who the hell is easier to beat? Crazy Bernie? Or Sleepy Joe?"" he said, before concluding that his best chances lie with Mr. Sanders.Among other topics, Mr. Trump assessed his own effectiveness with minority voters, regaling the crowd with a story about a ""love fest"" event at the White House at which he hosted African-Americans. His campaign recently announced a push to open storefronts in swing states targeting black voters with ""Woke""-themed merchandise and pamphlets.""One of the things I asked them,"" Mr. Trump said, ""I've been thinking about this for a long time -- great people, some of them are here tonight -- 'Do you like the name African-American or black?' And they said, 'Black!' all at the same time. True. I tell you. Because you say African-American or black. And they said almost, like, immediately, 'Black.""'On and off the rally stage, the president has zeroed in on Mr. Bloomberg for his performances in recent debates. Earlier Friday, Mr. Trump spread an unfounded Twitter rumor that Mr. Bloomberg was thinking of ending his presidential bid.""Shouldn't you be worrying about the coronavirus?"" Mr. Bloomberg replied on Twitter. ""Listen to your scientists. Prepare your people. Be the leader America needs. If only just this once.""The South Carolina rally was just the latest stop on Mr. Trump's grievance roadshow. He has visited every state that has held a primary or caucus so far this year, making trolling Democratic candidates a cornerstone of his re-election campaign strategy.Democrats say that this penchant to chase them around the map is evidence that Mr. Trump is not confident about his chances. But Erin Cassese, a political science researcher at the University of Delaware who studies the psychology of voters, said that the president was capitalizing on the anger felt by Republican voters who have been bombarded with messaging they do not necessarily agree with.""There's how much you like your own party and then there's almost how much you dislike the opposing party,"" Ms. Cassese said. ""I see Trump as riding the wave of negative partisanship by following Democrats through these early primary states. And the rally is kind of a pressure valve.""At the rally, Mr. Trump summoned Mr. Graham, a fervent defender of the president's, onstage for a round of praise.""Do you know why you're going to win?"" the senator asked Mr. Trump. ""You've been a damn good president."" Mr. Graham then thanked the president for putting up with what the senator described as never-ending obstacles, though Mr. Graham used an expletive instead.Later, as Mr. Trump spoke about immigration, he celebrated a federal appeals court ruling that determined that his administration would not have to provide funding to so-called sanctuary cities, and he recounted in grisly detail stories of an undocumented immigrant who had been arrested and charged with sexual assault and murder. He said the man was also a member of the MS-13 gang, a vicious criminal organization.""He should never have been in our country,"" Mr. Trump said as the crowd roared and started a ""Build the Wall"" chant. ""He should not have been allowed.""PhotographSupporters cheered as President Donald Trump took the stage Friday night for a rally at an arena in North Charleston, S.C.

""The Trump administration is aware of the situation, and we will continue regular communication with all appropriate government officials.""The attendee has been quarantined in New Jersey, the statement said.Mr. Trump said on Saturday that he was not worried that the infections seemed to be getting closer to the White House.""No, I'm not concerned at all, no,"" he told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, where he was spending the weekend.He said he had no plans to curtail his campaign rallies even though other large gatherings of people were being canceled across the country.""We're going to have tremendous rallies,"" he said.Praising health officials for a ""fantastic job,"" he added, ""We've had tremendous cooperation with other countries and all over the world and we've made it very, very tough, very strong, stringent borders.""Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, said in a statement that there was ""no indication that either President Trump or Vice President Pence met with or were in close proximity to the attendee.""""The president's physician and United States Secret Service have been working closely with White House staff and various agencies to ensure every precaution is taken to keep the first family and the entire White House complex safe and healthy,"" Ms. Grisham said.Others who spoke at the conference included Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Secretary of Labor Eugene Scalia and Elaine Chao, the transportation secretary. Also in attendance were Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and adviser, and Donald Trump Jr., the president's eldest son.Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland said in a statement that state health officials were informed by the New Jersey Department of Health that the person who tested positive for the virus was in Maryland from Feb. 27 to March 1, attending the conference in National Harbor.The statement said those who attended or worked at the conference ""may be at some risk"" for contracting the virus.""Due to the scale of this conference, we are urging attendees who are experiencing flulike symptoms to immediately reach out to their health care provider,"" Mr. Hogan said.The American Conservative Union said the event drew thousands.The group's chairman, Matt Schlapp, said he had had ""incidental interaction with the person,"" and added, ""I feel bad for my friend who is in the hospital.""""We've talked to him,"" Mr. Schlapp said. ""He sounds very good.""Alexandra Altman, a spokeswoman for Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey, says the attendee who tested positive for the coronavirus is a 55-year-old man and lives in Englewood, N.J.Health officials said the man was hospitalized and was in stable condition.At the conference, Mr. Trump gave his administration good grades for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, while his acting chief of staff at the time, Mick Mulvaney, said in a separate speech that journalists were hyping the coronavirus because ""they think this will bring down the president.""Mr. Mulvaney also minimized concerns over the virus.""The flu kills people,"" he said. ""This is not Ebola. It's not SARS, it's not MERS. It's not a death sentence; it's not the same as the Ebola crisis.""Founded in 1974, CPAC was for years a major gathering where libertarians and establishment Republicans mingled with fringe conservative activists. This year, the theme of the conference was ""America vs. Socialism,"" and it turned into a stage for Mr. Trump and his top advisers and allies to fire up his base and market-test messages for the 2020 presidential election.Republicans who have broken with the president and his agenda, like Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, were disinvited from the conference, and the mention of Mr. Romney's name by one conservative speaker elicited boos from the audience.Peter Baker, Annie Karni and Tracey Tully contributed reporting.PhotographOfficials said the attendee who tested positive did not come in contact with President Trump.

| Jump to first hitOn the eve of Super Tuesday, the president traveled to North Carolina to once again stage a rally in a state about to hold a Democratic nominating contest and eagerly mocked the candidates.CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- President Trump inserted himself on Monday into the Democratic presidential nomination contest on the eve of its biggest day, belittling the resurgent Joseph R. Biden Jr. as a feebleminded has-been while fanning resentment among supporters of Bernie Sanders.Traveling to one of the larger states holding a Democratic primary on Super Tuesday, Mr. Trump eagerly sought to undercut Mr. Biden at the very moment the former vice president revived his flagging campaign, taunting him for verbal gaffes and memory lapses and portraying him as an old man who even if elected would not govern but instead be committed to a retirement home.As he has for weeks, the president likewise sought to encourage disenchantment on the left by promoting the notion that the Democratic Party establishment was trying to somehow illegitimately take away the nomination from Mr. Sanders. But Mr. Trump did not neglect the rest of the shrinking Democratic field, firing off barbs at the other candidates still in contention and even those who dropped out in the past 48 hours and threw their support to Mr. Biden.""The Democrat party has gone crazy,"" Mr. Trump said to a stadium full of cheering supporters.The president wrapped up his rally not long before Mr. Biden's own election-eve rally in Dallas got underway, and Mr. Trump seemed especially focused on the former vice president as a potential opponent in the fall.He gleefully repeated recent misstatements by Mr. Biden, including his confusion over names and states, his statement that he was a candidate for the Senate, his reference to Tuesday's primaries as ""Super Thursday"" and his head-spinning comment that 150 million Americans have been killed by guns since 2007.""That means 50 percent of our country!"" Mr. Trump said of the gun comment. ""That's a big story!""""Sleepy Joe,"" Mr. Trump continued, ""he doesn't even know where he is or what he's doing or what office he's running for. Honestly, I don't think he knows what office he's running for.""If Mr. Biden won the presidency, Mr. Trump said, his staff would actually do the governing. ""They're going to put him into a home, and other people are going to be running the country,"" the president said, ""and they're going to be super-left, radical crazies. And Joe's going to be in a home and he'll be watching television.""A revival of Mr. Biden's candidacy could scramble the election dynamics, giving Mr. Trump as much at stake on Tuesday as the Democrats. The president and his staff have been excited by the rise of Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator who calls himself a democratic socialist, seeing the contrast as a favorable one in the November general election. But Mr. Trump made clear he would happily go after Mr. Biden if he emerges, too.The rally in North Carolina was the fifth time in a row that the president has flown to a state holding a Democratic contest just before voting opened to force his way into the news cycle and try to shape the conversation. ""We like to troll,"" he boasted to the crowd in Charlotte.As is often the case, the Monday night rally was more of a Trumpian stream of consciousness than a recitation of the official text sitting on the teleprompter in front of him. He accused Democrats of ""trying to politicize the coronavirus"" even as he focused on the politics of coronavirus and asserted that ""fringe globalists"" wanted to keep the borders open to infected visitors.Mr. Trump peppered his speech with a string of false or misleading statements. ""Mexico's paying for the wall,"" he insisted, even though it is not. ""Yes, they are. You'll see. You'll see. You understand."" He boasted of preserving protections for pre-existing conditions even though his administration went to court to overturn the law guaranteeing such protections and supported legislation that would have weakened them.As he sometimes does in these off-the-cuff riffs, he trailed off into comments that raised eyebrows. Twice at different points in his speech, he noted that he knew many parents who ""don't love their children very much."" At another point, he summoned Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, to the stage and gushed over him as if he were a younger brother.""We all have your back,"" declared Mr. Graham, who lost the Republican presidential nomination to Mr. Trump in 2016, when the senator called the eventual winner a ""kook"" who was unfit for office. ""Mr. President, you're going to kick their ass in November.""""Oh, my Lindsey, my Lindsey,"" Mr. Trump said.The president ridiculed the other Democratic candidates, calling former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York ""a disaster waiting to happen"" and ""a mess,"" while again mocking his would-be challenger's height. He recalled how Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, whom he once again mocked with a racial slur, ""Pocahontas,"" eviscerated Mr. Bloomberg at a recent debate. ""She's mean, she's very mean,"" he said. ""She came after him and he started choking.""Two candidates who just left the race likewise came under fire: former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Without any evidence, Mr. Trump contended that they made an illicit pact with Mr. Biden for their support.""Sounds like they made a deal,"" he said. ""They both supported Sleepy Joe. You know why? They made a deal. You know why? Quid pro quo. That's why."" Alluding to his own impeachment for using the power of his office to coerce campaign aid from Ukraine, Mr. Trump shouted: ""Impeach them! They should be impeached! They should be impeached! Quid pro quo!""He seemed particularly keen on fomenting discord within the Democratic Party by suggesting that the gathering support for Mr. Biden constituted a conspiracy to deny Mr. Sanders the nomination for a second election cycle in a row.""It's being rigged against Crazy Bernie,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Crazy Bernie's going to go crazy, crazy.""Maggie Haberman reported from Charlotte, and Peter Baker from Washington.PhotographPresident Trump, speaking in Charlotte, N.C., mocked Joseph R.

| Jump to first hitThe president assumed economic levers would guide the countries' national interests. Now, he confronts twin challenges in an election year.President Trump entered the new year facing flare-ups of long-burning crises with two old adversaries -- Iran and North Korea -- that are directly challenging his claim to have reasserted American power around the world.While the Iranian-backed attack on the United States Embassy in Baghdad seemed to be under control, it played to Mr. Trump's longtime worry that American diplomats and troops in the Middle East are easy targets and his longtime position that the United States must pull back from the region.In North Korea, Kim Jong-un's declaration on Wednesday that the world would ""witness a new strategic weapon"" seemed to be the end of an 18-month experiment in which Mr. Trump believed his force of personality -- and vague promises of economic development -- would wipe away a problem that plagued the last 12 of his predecessors.The timing of these new challenges is critical: Both the Iranians and the North Koreans seem to sense the vulnerability of a president under impeachment and facing re-election, even if they are often clumsy as they try to play those events to their advantage.The protests in Iraq calmed on Wednesday, and Mr. Kim has not yet unveiled his latest ""strategic weapon."" But the events of recent days have underscored how much bluster was behind Mr. Trump's boast a year ago that Iran was ""a very different nation"" since he had broken its economy by choking off its oil revenues. They also belied his famous tweet: ""There is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea.""Today the most generous thing one could say about those statements is that they were wildly premature. Many foreign policy experts say he fundamentally misjudged the reactions of two major American adversaries. Neither seems to fear him, precisely the critique he leveled at Barack Obama back in the days when Mr. Trump declared America's toughest national security challenges would be solved as soon as a president the world respected was in office.The core problem may have been Mr. Trump's conviction that economic incentives alone -- oil profits in Tehran and the prospect of investment and glorious beach-front hotels in North Korea -- would overcome all other national interests.He dismissed the depth of Iran's determination to re-establish itself as the most powerful force in the region. He also underestimated Mr. Kim's conviction that his nuclear arsenal is his only insurance policy to buoy one of the last family-controlled Stalinist regimes.""After three years of no international crises,"" Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said on Tuesday, Mr. Trump is ""facing one with Iran because he has rejected diplomacy and another with North Korea because he has asked too much of diplomacy.""""In neither case has Trump embraced traditional diplomacy, putting forward a partial or interim pact in which a degree of restraint would be met with a degree of sanctions relief.""Mr. Trump does not engage such arguments. He simply repeats his mantra that Iran will never be allowed to obtain nuclear weapons and that North Korea -- which already has fuel for upward of 40 of them, much of it produced on Mr. Trump's watch -- has committed to full denuclearization, even though that overstates Mr. Kim's position.His top national security officials, starting with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, offer a somewhat more nuanced view, saying that over time Iran will realize it has no choice but to change its ways and expressing optimism that ""Chairman Kim will make the right decision and he'll choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war.""Increasingly, though, such lines sound like a hope, not a strategy. That is Mr. Trump's fundamental problem as he enters 2020. He does not have a comprehensive plan to unite the nation's estranged allies into a concerted course of action.The absence of a common approach is hurting the most in Iran. When Mr. Trump abandoned the 2015 nuclear deal -- declaring it a ""terrible"" piece of Obama-era diplomacy because it did not create permanent restraints on Iran's ability to produce nuclear fuel -- his aides sounded confident that Europe, China and Russia would follow suit. They did not.Europe has flailed in its efforts to counteract American sanctions against Iran, but has insisted that the deal remains in place, even though both Washington and Tehran are violating key aspects of it.Russia and China have taken the next step. Last week they opened joint naval exercises with Iran in the Gulf of Oman. The exercises were not militarily significant, and the three nations have plenty of differences. But to the Iranians, the military drills symbolized having two nuclear-armed superpowers on their side.Vice Admiral Gholamreza Tahani of Iran was quoted in the Financial Times declaring that ""the most important achievement of these drills"" was the message ""that the Islamic Republic of Iran cannot be isolated.""It is possible that the Trump administration's strategy will still bear fruit: Mr. Pompeo was doing everything he could in recent weeks to express support for Iranians who were mounting protests inside their own country. But the history of past protests -- most notably in 2009 -- offers little hope that they can threaten the government. Hundreds of protesters appear to have been killed by internal security forces this time.The Iranians have a fine sense that ""maximum pressure"" campaigns work in both directions. They are vulnerable to cutoffs in oil flows. But the United States is vulnerable to highly public attacks on troops and tankers.The attack on the outer walls of the American Embassy in Baghdad, even if short-lived, was clearly intended to send a shiver down the spine of Mr. Trump's political aides, who remember well that a hostage crisis helped lead to President Jimmy Carter's re-election defeat 40 years ago.In recent months, Iran has repeatedly mounted a strike and pulled back, including its attacks on oil tankers, an American drone and Saudi oil facilities.The Iranians have made clear what Mr. Trump needs to do to reopen negotiations: Essentially return to the deal struck with Mr. Obama, largely by lifting sanctions Mr. Trump imposed starting in May 2018. There are signs Mr. Trump is eager to resume talks, including his effort to lure President Hassan Rouhani to the phone when the Iranian leader was in New York in September for United Nations meetings.That diplomatic initiative will doubtless continue in secret. But the Iranians have found new leverage in the ability to turn anti-Iran protests in Iraq into protests against American troops, complete with Iran's signature ""death to America"" street chants.On Tuesday, he revived an old talking point, emphasizing that he did not want a war but warning Iran that any conflict ""wouldn't last very long.""North Korea is a harder problem because Mr. Trump had initiated a bold and imaginative diplomatic process with Mr. Kim. By breaking the mold and agreeing to meet the North Korean leader face to face, he would be the first American president to do so since the end of the Korean War.But he made key mistakes. He failed to get a nuclear freeze agreement from the North in return for the meeting, meaning that the country's nuclear and missile production continued to churn along.Mr. Trump's team, internally divided, could not back itself out of the corner the president created with his vow of no serious sanctions relief until the arsenal was disbanded. Mr. Trump did cancel joint military exercises with South Korea -- over Pentagon objections -- but that was not enough for Mr. Kim.Perhaps Mr. Trump's biggest miscalculation was over-relying on the personal rapport he built with Mr. Kim, and overinterpreting the commitments he received from the young, wily North Korean leader.That continues. At a news conference on his way to a New Year's Eve party at his Mar-a-Lago club, the president focused on their relationship, as if Mr. Kim's declaration that he was no longer bound by any commitment to cease missile and nuclear testing did not exist. ""He likes me, I like him, we get along,"" Mr. Trump said. ""He's representing his country, I'm representing my country. We have to do what we have to do.""Then he misrepresented the agreement he reached with Mr. Kim during their meeting in Singapore in June 2018, describing it as if it were a real estate deal. ""But he did sign a contract,"" Mr. Trump said of the vague declaration of principles they agreed on.In fact, it was not a contract, it had no binding force and it referred to the ""denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."" That phrase means something very different in Pyongyang than it does in Washington: It means the North expects the United States to pull back its own nuclear-backed forces, including submarines and ships that can deliver such weapons to the peninsula.So now Mr. Trump finds himself awaiting a new missile test.It may be a solid-fuel, intercontinental missile, according to some experts, to show that the North has finally mastered a weapon that can be rolled out and launched with little warning. And it may carry some kind of payload to demonstrate that the country now knows how to make a warhead that can withstand re-entry into the atmosphere, a difficult technology.But buried in Mr. Kim's New Year's statement was a suggestion of what he really had in mind: talks with the United States about the ""scope and depth"" of the North's nuclear force. That means he really is not interested in denuclearization at all. He is interested in arms-control talks, like the United States conducted for decades with the Kremlin.And arms control, of course, would achieve what Mr. Kim, his father and his grandfather all sought: that insurance policy for the family.PhotographThe attack on the American Embassy in Baghdad underscored President Trump's concerns about diplomats and troops in the region.

| Jump to first hitThe House impeachment managers walked the articles of impeachment across the Capitol after a long-anticipated vote to start what promises to be a partisan impeachment trial of President Trump.WASHINGTON -- The House of Representatives voted on Wednesday to transmit two articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate, sending the president and his party into uncharted territory in a deeply divisive trial fraught with history and political risk.In a choreographed ritual, the House formally appointed seven Democrats to serve as impeachment managers prosecuting the case before the Republican-controlled Senate. The group silently marched two charges of high crimes and misdemeanors, encased in slim blue folders, across the Capitol to set in motion the third presidential impeachment trial in American history.The proceedings commencing on Thursday will play out in a Capitol already rived by politics during a contentious election year. Among the senators who will be sitting in judgment of Mr. Trump will be four Democrats who are running for president, juggling their campaigns to defeat him with their duties as jurors.The trial is laden with peril for Mr. Trump. He will face weeks of public discussion of the allegations that he solicited foreign help in the 2020 presidential election, abusing the power of his office and obstructing a congressional inquiry in the process. But the president is almost certain to cast his likely acquittal as a complete exoneration and turn the considerable apparatus of his campaign to stoke public outrage.Democrats believe the proceeding will put pressure on Republicans -- particularly those facing tough re-election challenges -- to condemn Mr. Trump or risk being cast as an apologist for the president. Yet they, too, risk a backlash if voters sour on the impeachment effort, dismissing it as a political stunt.""We are here today to cross a very important threshold in American history,"" Speaker Nancy Pelosi said as she spoke on the House floor before a vote to transmit the articles. Regardless of the outcome, she added, Mr. Trump would be ""impeached for life.""The House impeached Mr. Trump last month on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, formally accusing him of pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political opponents while withholding as leverage a nearly $400 million package of military assistance and a White House meeting with the country's president.Wednesday's vote, almost exactly a month later, was largely along party lines. Only one Democrat, Representative Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota, joined every Republican in voting ""no.""The action deputized the seven impeachment managers who will present the House's case. The group, mostly lawyers, included a former police chief and reflected the geographic and demographic diversity of the Democratic caucus, with three women, two African-Americans and one Latina.Hours later, after an elaborate signing ceremony, they walked two by two through a hushed Capitol, carrying the articles -- embossed with a gold seal and bearing the signatures of Ms. Pelosi and the House clerk -- to the Senate. More than two dozen Democrats, but only two Republicans -- Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and Senator Kevin Cramer of North Dakota -- sat in the chamber awaiting their arrival.At the White House, the president denounced the effort to remove him anew as a ""hoax"" that Republicans would soon debunk -- ""let's take care of it,"" he told members of the House attending a ceremony in the East Room not long before the vote. Senior administration officials projected confidence, calling theirs an ""easy case"" and predicting that the Senate would acquit the president in two weeks without hearing from any witnesses.But the path ahead in the Senate was far from clear, as the normally staid chamber braced for a potentially fractious proceeding and some Republicans agitated for a lengthier and more thorough process.Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, confirmed that she and a small group of fellow Republicans -- Senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Mitt Romney of Utah -- had worked with Mr. McConnell to ensure there would be a vote on whether to call witnesses or collect new documentary evidence, once each side had presented its case and senators had a chance to ask questions.""It's important that we have an up-or-down vote on the issue of subpoenaing witnesses and documents,"" Ms. Collins told reporters, ""and I've worked very hard to get that included, with all my colleagues that I've mentioned, into the governing resolution.""The president himself is ""of two minds"" on the matter, said Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, saying that Mr. Trump was vacillating between wanting a prolonged trial with a robust public defense of his actions and a quick dismissal.""I think he feels that he's been unjustly accused, and would like to present his side of it,"" Mr. Paul said in an interview on Wednesday. But he added, ""I think it's hard to sort of turn down the idea that we could have a motion to end this thing.""Mr. McConnell accepted the articles late Wednesday afternoon and invited the managers to exhibit them at noon Thursday. The Senate will then summon Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who will preside over the trial, to administer an oath binding senators to render ""impartial justice"" and issue a summons asking the president to answer to the charges against him.The trial, however, will not begin in earnest until Tuesday, with debate on a resolution to set the rules followed by opening arguments by the House managers and the president's legal team.After weeks of sharp words, Mr. McConnell sounded an unusually somber note on the Senate floor, in a nod to the weight of the occasion.""This is a difficult time for our country, but this is precisely the kind of time for which the framers created the Senate,"" he said. ""I'm confident this body can rise above the short term-ism and factional fever and serve the long-term best interests of our nation. We can do this and we must.""Ms. Pelosi withheld the articles from trial for nearly a month to try to increase pressure on Republicans like Ms. Collins to vote for new evidence. Democrats argued aggressively that a trial without it is tantamount to an extension of Mr. Trump's attempts to cover up his actions.Pressing their case, just as lawmakers were preparing to transfer the articles across the Capitol, the House made public another tranche of newly received texts, calendar entries, notes and other records illustrating aspects of Mr. Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine that could be used by prosecutors in the trial.They came from Lev Parnas, an associate of Mr. Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, and appeared to detail attempts to dig up dirt in Ukraine on Mr. Trump's political rivals, actions that lie at the heart of the House's case. In an interview with The New York Times, Mr. Parnas asserted that Mr. Trump had been fully aware of his efforts, though the two men never spoke about it.""Time has been our friend in all of this because it has yielded incriminating evidence, more truth into the public domain,"" Ms. Pelosi told reporters.To lead the team of managers to prosecute the case, Ms. Pelosi turned to one of her most tested deputies, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, a former federal prosecutor who oversaw the House's Ukraine inquiry as the chairman of the Intelligence Committee.The group also includes Representatives Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee; Zoe Lofgren of California, a veteran of three presidential impeachment debates; Hakeem Jeffries of New York, a fast-rising Democratic leader and the party's messaging chief; Val B. Demings of Florida, a former police chief; and Jason Crow of Colorado and Sylvia R. Garcia of Texas.Several of the lawmakers have courtroom experience of some kind, a quality Ms. Pelosi said she had sought. Two, Mr. Crow and Ms. Garcia, are both first-term members, and Mr. Crow has military experience allowing him to speak to the national security implications of some of Mr. Trump's actions.The managers met for the first time as a group on Wednesday to discuss strategy in the basement chambers of the Intelligence Committee, where the impeachment inquiry unfolded last fall.In the coming days and weeks, the managers will try to lift their arguments against Mr. Trump above ordinary politics. Like Mr. Trump's defense team, they will aim their case not only at the 100 senators gathered at trial but at voters who will go to the ballot box in November and serve as the ultimate appeals court on Mr. Trump's presidency.They will seek to recreate the highlights of the two-month investigation of the Ukraine matter, relying on testimony from more than a dozen senior American diplomats and White House officials who defied the president's orders not to cooperate.Those witnesses outlined a broad campaign by Mr. Trump to use the levers of his government to exert pressure on Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and claims that the Democrats colluded with Ukraine in the 2016 election. The president, the House concluded, ultimately withheld the military aid earmarked for Ukraine and a coveted White House meeting for its new leader as leverage.But the managers must also contend anew with Mr. Trump's successful stonewalling. His across-the-board refusal to produce documents or top aides to investigators resulted in the second impeachment charge, obstruction of Congress, but also holes in the factual record that the senators have already made clear they will call into question.""This trial is necessary because President Trump gravely abused the power of his office when he strong-armed a foreign government to announce investigations into his domestic political rival,"" Mr. Nadler said during a brief debate on the House floor before the vote. ""But we still have not heard the whole truth.""Republican leaders on both sides of the Capitol appeared unmoved. Mr. McConnell called the House's three-month Ukraine investigation ""a pale imitation of a real inquiry."" Representative Kevin McCarthy, Republican of California and the minority leader, called the whole process a ""national nightmare.""Emily Cochrane and Annie Karni contributed reporting from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.PhotographSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, center, with the House's new impeachment managers, said, ""We are here today to cross a very important threshold in American history.""

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump had a busy morning on Twitter and the radio, in a tirade that rivaled his most grievance-filled moments since becoming president.WASHINGTON -- President Trump made a number of staff moves on Thursday to ensure he will be surrounded by a cadre of loyalists at the White House even as he raged against an ever-growing cast of perceived enemies that included his former chief of staff, an impeachment witness, a juror he accused of bias and a Democratic rival.The White House announced the return of Hope Hicks, the president's former communications director and one of his closest advisers. The move consolidated the position of Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and adviser, and signaled the waning influence of Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff.Ms. Hicks will serve as a counselor to the president, reporting to Mr. Kushner. Her return to the president's side after his acquittal in the impeachment inquiry is an indication that Mr. Trump is seeking to reassemble as best he can the small, intensely devoted team of family members and friends who helped guide him to an improbable victory in 2016.Johnny McEntee, the ""body man"" who trailed Mr. Trump as a candidate and in the White House, will be elevated to oversee the Presidential Personnel Office, according to four people briefed on the move. Mr. McEntee, who was forced from his job in 2018 over gambling debts that threatened his security clearance, recently returned to his old role as a personal aide to Mr. Trump.The West Wing changes came just hours before Attorney General William P. Barr issued a remarkable rebuke of Mr. Trump, saying the president's attacks on the Justice Department over the case of Roger J. Stone Jr. made it ""impossible for me to do my job"" and asserting that ""I'm not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody.""Earlier Thursday, Mr. Trump engaged in an hourslong series of rants on Twitter and in a radio interview, hurling insults and unproved accusations in a tirade that rivaled his most grievance-filled moments since becoming president.In rapid-fire fashion, Mr. Trump alleged bias from a juror in the trial of Mr. Stone, his longtime friend, and belittled John F. Kelly, his former chief of staff, as an ineffective aide who ""misses the action & just can't keep his mouth shut."" In a speech on Wednesday, Mr. Kelly had defended Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, the decorated national security official who testified in the impeachment inquiry and was removed from his job last week.The president said Colonel Vindman's exit from the White House -- he was escorted out by security officers -- was applauded by ""the whole building."" Moments later, Mr. Trump mocked the physical stature of Michael R. Bloomberg, a Democratic candidate for president and the former mayor of New York.""Mini Mike is a 5'4"" mass of dead energy who does not want to be on the debate stage with these professional politicians,"" Mr. Trump said, sneering at the idea that Mr. Bloomberg might stand on a box during a debate. ""No boxes please."" Mr. Bloomberg is actually 5-foot-7.Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire who has already spent more than $350 million in his bid for the Democratic nomination, wasted no time returning fire at the man he hopes to face in November's election.""We know many of the same people in NY,"" he wrote. ""Behind your back they laugh at you & call you a carnival barking clown. They know you inherited a fortune & squandered it with stupid deals and incompetence. I have the record & the resources to defeat you. And I will.""In his speech at Drew University in New Jersey, first reported by The Atlantic, Mr. Kelly said that Colonel Vindman was right to raise questions about a telephone call with the president of Ukraine in which Mr. Trump pressed for investigations into his political rivals.""He did exactly what we teach them to do from cradle to grave,"" Mr. Kelly said. ""He went and told his boss of what he just heard. We teach them: 'Don't follow an illegal order. And if you're ever given one, you'll raise it to whoever gives it to you that this is an illegal order, and then you'll tell your boss.""'The remarks drew a swift response from the president, who tweeted on Thursday morning that Mr. Kelly, who served as the chief of staff for 17 months before resigning early last year, was ""way over his head"" in the job. He also suggested that Mr. Kelly's public comments violated a ""military and legal obligation"" to remain silent.John R. Bolton, the president's former national security adviser, who clashed with Mr. Kelly when the two were White House colleagues, came to his defense. Mr. Kelly has ""always served his country faithfully,"" Mr. Bolton said in a statement, and called on conservatives to ""reject baseless attacks upon him.""In the radio interview with Geraldo Rivera, Mr. Trump also renewed his attacks on Colonel Vindman, describing him as ""very insubordinate"" and claiming that Colonel Vindman's colleagues applauded his departure last Friday.""Vindman was the guy that, when we took him out of the building, the whole building applauded,"" Mr. Trump said. A senior National Security Council official said later that Mr. Trump's description was accurate, but did not say he had firsthand knowledge of it.David Pressman, a lawyer for Colonel Vindman, did not address a question about the applause, but said in a statement that the ""continued public attacks by the president of the United States on an active-duty officer in the military are designed to intimidate and to punish."" He added, ""By using the power of his office to repeatedly humiliate and punish those following the law, the president is encouraging breaking the law.""Mr. Trump also suggested during the radio interview that he could stop the tradition of allowing numerous national security officials to listen to his phone calls with foreign leaders, as Colonel Vindman did with the Ukraine call. ""I may end the practice,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I may end it entirely.""The changes at the White House will bring familiar faces back to the West Wing. Always obsessed with the threat of leaks, Mr. Trump has become more concerned about loyalty since a whistle-blower came forward last year to express concerns about the Ukraine call.Ms. Hicks, 31, worked on Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign from its inception and followed him to the White House, eventually becoming communications director. Her return will come as his re-election campaign intensifies and as his advisers say the superstitious president has talked about recreating some aspects of that first race.Ms. Hicks's title when she left belied her influence with Mr. Trump, who felt more personal comfort with her than with almost any other adviser. A senior administration official said that Ms. Hicks would work on projects that Mr. Kushner oversees, including the re-election campaign. She will not rejoin the communications office.""There is no one more devoted to implementing President Trump's agenda than Hope Hicks,"" Mr. Kushner said in a statement. ""We are excited to have her back on the team.""Ms. Hicks's time with Mr. Trump began when she was working as an aide for his elder daughter, Ivanka Trump, on her fashion brand. He hired her for his skeleton staff when he began his campaign for president in 2015, and because the campaign was so small, Ms. Hicks was constantly at Mr. Trump's side.Since last fall, Ms. Hicks had been working as the chief communications officer at Fox.Eileen Sullivan and Michael Crowley contributed reporting.PhotographJohn F.

| Jump to first hitThe president, who lost the state by a few thousand votes in 2016, now has the support of the Republican establishment. But not all Republicans are convinced.MANCHESTER, N.H. -- In 2016, Donald J. Trump came within a few thousand votes of winning New Hampshire in the general election. This time around, fueled by a stockpile of donations, his campaign is looking at New Hampshire and its four electoral votes as a key target in its efforts to expand the map.There are some factors working in his favor. Instead of a feud with one of the Republican Party's few female senators as well as a former governor, the president has the state party apparatus backing him. And his advisers think the policies he has implemented fit the contours of the state.But securing victory in a state that has been won by a Democrat in every presidential election since 2000 will be a test of both the president's durability and his political operation.Mr. Trump's allies say the issues are with him. The unemployment rate in the state was 2.6 percent in October 2019, lower than the national figure. Mr. Trump has highlighted his administration's efforts to stem the opioid crisis in a state that continues to rank among the top five in opioid-related deaths.The president's new North American trade deal, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, affects New Hampshire businesses importing timber, syrup and dairy from Canada, campaign officials said. Officials also pointed to efforts by the Interior Department to eliminate the Seamounts Marine National Monument, located off the Atlantic Coast, as a move that appeals to New Hampshire voters because it could open up previously protected areas to commercial uses like fishing.Corey Lewandowski, Mr. Trump's first 2016 campaign manager and a New Hampshire resident who considered running for the Senate seat held by the Democrat Jeanne Shaheen, said that those factors, ""coupled with the fact that the president should have won last time,"" work in his favor -- an apparent reference to the relatively little party support Mr. Trump had in his losing battle with Hillary Clinton.Yet if the New Hampshire Republican Party now belongs to the president, it has also seen a significant decline in enrollment.""New Hampshire is going to be a challenge for him to win in November,"" said Jennifer Horn, the former New Hampshire Republican chairman and a staunch critic of Mr. Trump. ""A week ago, we had more than 20,000 fewer registered Republicans than there were Election Day in 2016.""Ms. Horn noted that Republican candidates lost large, consistently red areas in the 2018 midterm elections, and that the same thing could happen here to Mr. Trump. While other state Republicans played down concerns about the drop in party members on the voter rolls as the natural ebb and flow that happens in a state with same-day voter registration, Ms. Horn said 20,000 was ""way outside the norm.""And the state's demographics reflect the type of place where Mr. Trump will face challenges: concentrations of working-class whites, but multitudes of college-educated voters, who polls show have been abandoning the Republican Party.""We've had great success in the municipal elections, and of course we had the historic wins in 2018,"" said Ray Buckley, the state Democratic chairman. ""There's a lot of energy on the ground here. We've built a year-round organization.""Aware of some of the challenges ahead, the Trump campaign appears eager to get a head start.While Pete Buttigieg was trying to emerge from the Democratic field and Joseph R. Biden Jr. was trying to stay in it, Mr. Trump turned up in Manchester for a rally Monday night and Trump surrogates fanned out Tuesday to diners and polling sites throughout the state, even though he faces only token opposition in the Republican primary.Their mission: talk up Mr. Trump's policies, distract attention from Democrats and set the stage for the general election.""We're trying to fly the Trump flag when all the action is on the other side,"" said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who strolled into Bedford High School, just outside Manchester, to greet voters on Tuesday morning. ""If the economy stays good, I think he's very much in play here.""Senator Rick Scott of Florida was on hand outside Manchester on Tuesday morning to paint Democrats with the brush of ""socialism."" Donald Trump Jr., the president's eldest son, spent the day at diners and high schools campaigning for his father. Representatives Steve Scalise of Louisiana, Mark Meadows of North Carolina and Greg Pence of Indiana, among others, stayed behind after Mr. Trump's rally on Monday night and made diner visits and talked with local news media.Two supporters who were scheduled to campaign on the ground for him -- Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida -- hitched a ride home Monday night on Air Force One instead, to deal with legislative matters in Washington or attend the transfer of remains for two soldiers killed over the weekend in Afghanistan. Taking their place were prominent New Hampshire Republicans, a change from four years ago.Gov. Chris Sununu bound into a local high school, where he purchased a box of Krispy Kreme doughnuts from a student bake sale and stayed on message.""The Trump tax cuts here worked,"" he said. ""The U.S.M.C.A., very powerful, for a lot of our businesses that trade with our friends to the north. The regulatory reform streamlined the process."" He also credited the administration with investing $50 million in the state to battle the opioid crisis.The last time Mr. Trump was running, John H. Sununu, the current governor's father and a former governor himself, questioned Mr. Trump's history of business losses and said his coarse language was ""demeaning of the office he's seeking.""Trump campaign officials said they blamed the president's 2016 loss in large part on his feud with Kelly Ayotte, a senator at the time who was locked in a close re-election race and tried to thread the needle by saying she would vote for Mr. Trump but not endorse him. Ms. Ayotte lost her seat, and Mr. Trump lost the state, an outcome one campaign official described as a political murder-suicide.Monday found Ms. Ayotte campaigning for the president at a ""Cops for Trump"" event with Ivanka Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. Reached on the phone on Tuesday, Ms. Ayotte hung up on a reporter. ""I'm busy. I have to go,"" she said when asked to comment on the state of the race in New Hampshire.But the show of Republican force appeared to be having its desired effect of sparking fears among Democratic voters about the strength of their own candidates.Mark Goodridge, 75, of Bedford, said he was voting for Mr. Biden. But he said he was anxious that he might lose to Mr. Trump.""You see the Trump signs out there? Did you see how many are out there?"" he asked, pointing to the pop-up stand of Trump campaign T-shirts and gear set up outside the school's entrance.His wife, Margaret, 76, chimed in. ""I think it depends on who the Democrats pick,"" she said. ""If we get the right candidate ... "" Her voice trailed off, before she added, ""Which is kind of a worry.""PhotographPresident Trump on Monday in New Hampshire, which has been won by a Democrat in every presidential election since 2000.

| Jump to first hitMost are paying attention, get what it's all about and have strong opinions about impeachment -- but not always the opinions you'd expect.""A fit of partisan rage"" is how Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader of the Senate, characterized the bid to remove President Trump from office. The president's behavior, in the view of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, left House Democrats with ""no choice"" but to impeach.But what do the American people think?With the Senate trial of Mr. Trump now underway, we deployed a team of journalists to find out. We contacted hundreds of voters who had responded to an online survey saying they would be willing to be interviewed. We reached 81 people, from nearly 30 states.They were Democrats, Republicans and independents. They were retirees and real estate agents, teachers and stay-at-home parents. The youngest was 21; the oldest was 82. Even before the opening statements at the trial had begun, most had already made up their minds on their preferred verdict.As one independent voter from Ohio put it, ""maybe they should ask the people what they should do. It should be our vote.""Though the case against Mr. Trump is complex, most people grasp the basics.The last time a president was impeached, in the 1990s, the allegations were like something out of a soap opera: President Bill Clinton was accused of lying under oath about his sexual encounters with a White House intern.This time around, the charges stem from something much more complicated and less familiar than a sex scandal: using the power of the presidency to extract foreign help against a domestic rival.We wondered how closely Americans were following the complicated case. ""I think it's about them interfering with the election or something? I'm not sure. It's very confusing,"" said one Republican who didn't think the evidence was very strong. One Democrat who thought Mr. Trump should be removed acknowledged, ""I don't really know what the evidence is.""But most people, across the political spectrum, were well versed in the basics, and some could even reel off names of key witnesses and documents.Here are some of their descriptions of the case, in their own words.The accusation is that he withheld foreign aid money in exchange for Ukrainians investigating Joe Biden and his son. Kyle Sims, 46, a Republican from North CarolinaThere are two articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Bill Oberjohn, 82, a Democrat from OhioSupposedly he was colluding, or he was proposing to the leaders of -- I can't think of the name of the country. Not Czechoslovakia. Joe Biden and his son had gotten involved a few years ago in the Ukraine. It's the Ukraine, right? Tim Tucker, 73, a conservative independent who splits his time between Indiana and FloridaGoing to Ukraine and asking their government for interference for our election and digging up dirt on a political opponent. Bottom line, he was asking for the quid pro quo. Melissa Reese, 32, a Democrat from Allentown, Pa.I'm confused on what they're accusing him of, but it just has to do with the communication with the Ukrainian president. They haven't been able to glom onto anything yet and this was as close as they could get after all the pressure that they've gotten. Amy, 47, a Republican from IllinoisOne side sees impeachment as a ploy in a wider partisan war against Mr. Trump.People we spoke with who said they did not want Mr. Trump to be removed from office tended to view impeachment as an intensely personal attack on the president, mounted by Democrats who despise Mr. Trump and resent his election victory in 2016.I'm convinced of my view because of the blatant disrespect that President Trump has been shown by those who oppose him. It seems as though they would have him impeached at any cost, with no regard to truth or proper proceedings. Bethany McGraw, 21, a Republican from FloridaThey just don't like the man because he's not a politician. They can't reconcile their 2016 defeat of a career politician by a businessman. They can't stand it that he's outthinking them and outmaneuvering them on every issue. Gerald Wilson, 50, a conservative Democrat from OklahomaI think the whole thing is ridiculous. You can tell that the Democrats are just out to get Trump. It's just obvious. I feel like there's no grounds to impeach him. It's just insane. Cherece Mendieta, 46, a conservative from HoustonAs a former law enforcement officer, there is no case there. Absolutely no case. The president did not do anything wrong. It's a shame that so many people hate the president to the point where they will try to make the case where there is none. Bill Marcy, 73, a Republican from MississippiThe other side sees the Ukraine allegations as just the tip of the iceberg.For Democrats and others who said they want the president removed, asking about the freezing of military aid to Ukraine was like opening a Pandora's box of other presidential decisions they disagreed with -- and, in some cases, thought could be impeachable offenses in their own right.I'm upset with the Democrats. They should have listed about 50 things. They should have just buried him. I think that he's guilty of crimes against humanity with regard to immigrants. Now that it's come out that he planned six weeks ago to commit an assassination on a foreign national, to me that's an international crime. Terry Scott, 55, a liberal from Kent, Wash.This is bigger than this particular case -- his mental ramblings, his strong support of strongmen in other countries, his completely flouting the democracy that we have. He's polarizing the nation, putting children in cages. There are so many reasons, but right now, I support that they are impeaching him for obstructing Congress and trying to do their job. Gina Fields, 54, a Democrat from Los AngelesWe have a very big character issue with him. He's made fun of people, he's attacked people's ethnicity, he's attacked people's capabilities, especially making fun of people who might have severe learning issues. He name-calls. Yes, the economy is doing well and he's going to take all of the credit, and I don't know if that is right or wrong. But I think we are at the worst possible time, in terms of the divisiveness of the country, that we have been in my lifetime. Jimmy Welch, 53, a Republican from Louisville, Ky., who voted for President Trump in 2016 but is considering voting against him in 2020I think those are the ones that the House thought would stick, but I do think he's been doing a pretty bad job locally and internationally. His use of hate speech in order to rally supporters. Him closing the borders. America was a country that was built on immigration in the beginning. Desiré Hardison, 37, a Democrat from New York CityI believe even before this case came up to the attention of the American people, Trump's rhetoric on immigration, linking south border refugees to criminals, is an invitation to incite riots and frontiersman's approach to justice. That was enough to be considered a high crime in my mind. Yin Yeh, 81, a liberal Democrat from CaliforniaNot everything is partisan. Sometimes it's complicated.Over all, our interviews captured views of impeachment that largely break along partisan lines. But at the same time, they also offered a refreshing reminder that people are complicated, and often defy political and demographic stereotypes.Would you have guessed that the 21-year-old we mentioned was a Republican, and the 82-year-old a Democrat?When we asked people where they got their news, many cited outlets that aligned with their political bents. But others listed an array of sometimes contradictory sources, like the moderate who said his media diet included both MSNBC, with its liberal-leaning prime-time opinion shows, and a podcast by the conservative commentator Ben Shapiro. One California man in his 70s told us he gets almost all his information from YouTube.And we found that negative feelings about Mr. Trump did not always translate into a desire to see him impeached.The Senate should probably not remove him from office at this point. Probably his misdeeds do not amount to high crimes and misdemeanors, and the uproar from his supporters would dislocate life in the U.S. for years. Terry Morrison, 82, a Democrat from WisconsinAs far as news goes, I've got CNN right next to Fox News on my Sirius satellite. William Johnson, 50, a conservative from TexasHas he done inappropriate things? Yeah, I hate to tell you, every president has. I don't like the man personally. I can understand why they don't like him. But that's not grounds for impeachment. Richard Thomas, 73, a Republican from Avondale, Ariz.I don't think he should've been elected in the first place, but I think it's bad for an impeachment to be this close to an election. He should not be removed. William Hogan, 35, a moderate from AtlantaAnd finally, a few choice outtakes.You've got me fired up here on a Wednesday afternoon. I have to go visit a 100-year-old lady that's in the nursing home. Mr. Tucker, a retiree whom we caught between golf rounds in FloridaI can say, damn near everything I've ever been accused of, I did it. Jonathan Swenson, 38, from Utah, who says he originally registered Republican but isn't so sure nowFiona Hill -- that would be a great name for an alternative band. Jerry Iannacci, 52, an independent from Pennsylvania, praising an impeachment witnessIf you can think of some way to bring America back together, I would pat you on the back and give you an award. Mary Moerles, 73, a conservative independent from MissouriMethodology: We obtained a list of more than 1,000 people who had responded to an online survey and said they were voters and were willing to be interviewed by a reporter. We reached out to several hundred of those voters -- covering a wide range of ages, races and ethnicities, political leanings and home states -- and conducted interviews with 81 of them; their views are presented here. Quotations were edited for brevity and clarity. The interviews do not constitute a scientific sampling of opinion.PhotographThe impeachment proceedings against the president, from the early investigation to the trial that started this week, have animated people in Battle Creek, Mich., at far left, Doylestown, Pa., at right, and many other places besides. Most are paying attention, get what it's all about, and have strong opinions about what's happening -- but not always the ones you'd expect.

| Jump to first hitThe social media company has had a permissive policy about truthfulness in political content. But it drew the line on interfering with the national census.WASHINGTON -- Facebook said on Thursday that it had removed misleading ads run by President Trump's re-election campaign about the 2020 census, in a stand against disinformation ahead of the decennial population count that begins next week.Earlier this week, Trump Make America Great Again, a joint fund-raising arm of Donald J. Trump for President Inc. and the Republican National Committee, started running ads on the social media site that Facebook said could have caused confusion about the timing of the census.""President Trump needs you to take the Official 2020 Congressional District Census today. We need to hear from you before the most important election in American history,"" the ad said. The campaign asked followers to ""respond NOW"" to help our campaign messaging strategy, with an appeal to text ""TRUMP to 8022.""The Census Bureau will not begin to survey the public for its population survey until next week. The ad linked the census to the Trump campaign, a misrepresentation of the official government survey, said civil rights groups.The census has become another disinformation test for social media companies. Facebook, Twitter and YouTube have come under pressure for their handling of political speech and what has been a piecemeal approach to policing their platforms. Candidates in this year's presidential election are expected to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on political ads, and the companies have already struggled to enforce consistent policies.Facebook has taken the most permissive -- and most criticized -- approach to political speech, allowing candidates and their campaigns to post misleading information and target those messages to specific audiences.When Mr. Trump posted an altered video of Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Facebook and Twitter refused to take the video down. A 30-second video ad on Facebook in October also falsely accused former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. of blackmailing Ukrainian officials to stop an investigation of his son.But Facebook said on Thursday that the Trump campaign's message violated its policy against interference in the census, an important survey and population count used to draw electoral maps. Facebook bars the misrepresentation of dates, locations, times and methods for census participation.""There are policies in place to prevent confusion around the official U.S. census and this is an example of those being enforced,"" Facebook said in a statement.President Trump's re-election campaign declined to comment on the ads.The decision to remove the ads was an exception to Facebook's lenient political speech policy. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said last fall in a speech at Georgetown University that his company would not arbitrate the harms of speech from political leaders. The speech drew strong criticism from civil rights groups and some Democrats.Facebook does maintain some exceptions to its policy on political speech, including a ban on hate speech and speech that could interfere with the census.Civil rights groups, which have been warning Facebook about the possibility of disinformation around the census, alerted Facebook to the misleading ads Wednesday evening. Judd Legum, a reporter for the newsletter Popular Information, first reported about the ads by Mr. Trump's campaign.At first, Facebook declined to remove Mr. Trump's campaign ads on the census, according to Mr. Legum and Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference Education Fund. Ms. Gupta said she communicated over email on Thursday morning with Mr. Zuckerberg and Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. The company changed its position by Thursday afternoon, she said.Ms. Gupta has warned that the social network could be a target for misinformation on census information, a concern among civil rights leaders, who fear a miscount of the population could affect districting for voters and lead to voter suppression.""While we're gratified that Facebook shut down Trump's attempt to sow confusion about how and when to participate in the 2020 census, it's disturbing that the ads weren't immediately removed,"" Ms. Gupta said in a statement. ""We will continue to hold Facebook accountable to enforce it. Nothing should distract from making sure everyone gets counted.""Other civil rights leaders said the delay in action by Facebook showed weakness in its own enforcement. They added that the social media network was not being proactive enough and had placed the burden on the public to inform them about abuses on the site.""While Facebook has now committed to removing the misinforming post in question, the damage is done,"" said Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, a civil rights group. ""Going forward, harmful and misleading ads must be flagged in a pre-posting review process, not after they've hit hundreds, if not thousands, of news feeds,""PhotographFacebook bars false dates, locations and methods for census participation.

| Jump to first hitExuberant over the candidates' performances, he continued his tour through the West.LAS VEGAS -- Flying to Las Vegas from Phoenix on Wednesday night on Air Force One, President Trump was glued to the Democratic presidential primary debate.He liked what he saw, and all day Thursday, as strategists and pundits sifted through the aftermath, the president shared his own conclusions.""'The real winner last night was Donald Trump,""' Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, quoting Michael R. Bloomberg's remarks to a group of supporters. ""Mini Mike Bloomberg. I agree!""And by the time the president landed in Colorado Springs for a ""Keep America Great"" rally, on the third day of his trip out West, he seemed interested in taking a victory lap.""I don't know if anybody watched last night's debate,"" Mr. Trump said shortly after he took the stage. ""It got very big ratings, and you know what? Mini Mike didn't do very well last night. I was going to send him a note saying, 'It's not easy doing what I do, is it?""'Indeed, at times during the rally, it was difficult to follow exactly what it was he was doing during the 90-plus minutes he spent onstage.During a free-associative speech, Mr. Trump directed an aide to bring him a sheaf of news clippings, reminisced at length about his 2016 victory, criticized windmills and provided xenophobic pop culture commentary. He criticized the movie ""Parasite"" for winning Best Picture at the Academy Awards -- ""The winner is a movie from South Korea? What the hell was that all about?"" -- before calling the actor Brad Pitt ""a little wise guy.""Eventually, the president found his way back to the slate of Democratic presidential candidates, saving special ire for Mr. Bloomberg and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. He said that both of them had ""choked"" on the debate stage. And at one point, Mr. Trump put his hands to his throat and said, ""I can't breathe.""Though a spate of recent polls show the president faring badly against possible Democratic opponents, including Mr. Bloomberg and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Mr. Trump and his advisers say the contentious debate left them feeling bullish about the president's re-election prospects, especially with the impeachment phase of his presidency behind him. In Colorado, Mr. Trump instructed his supporters to ignore the polling.""Don't believe stories and don't believe polls,"" the president said, ""because the polls are worse than the stories.""Mr. Trump spent a substantial amount of time regaling the crowd with stories of his 2016 campaign, calling Dan Scavino -- his social media manager and ""the most powerful man in politics,"" the president said -- up to the stage to hand him a stack of news clippings. The president read aloud from them individually, insulting journalists who had declared he had done poorly on the debate stage against Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent that year, and attacking Fox News personalities he considers too critical of him.""I did great in the debates,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I became president because of the debates.""At the Colorado rally, he was expected to try to bolster the fortunes of Senator Cory Gardner, a vulnerable Republican up for re-election in a state that is trending increasingly liberal. ""You're going to help get Cory Gardner across that line because he's been with us 100 percent,"" he told the crowd.Democrats have pointed out that the president's track record on lending support to embattled candidates is mixed at best. But Mr. Trump is practiced at trying to turn any anti-Trump words spoken by Democrats against them, as he did when he paid particular attention to remarks that Mr. Bloomberg delivered to supporters on Thursday morning at an event in Salt Lake City.""Look, the real winner in the debate last night was Donald Trump because I worry that we may be on the way to nominating somebody who cannot win in November,"" Mr. Bloomberg said. ""If we choose a candidate who appeals to a small base, like Senator Sanders, it will be a fatal error.""Mr. Bloomberg's somewhat chastened reaction was the cherry on top for the president, who has spent most of the week drawing energy -- and money -- from enthusiastic supporters. According to a Trump campaign official, Mr. Trump has raised $17 million for his re-election efforts since arriving on the West Coast.""America likes winners, not whiners,"" Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to the president and a former Trump campaign manager, said of his post-debate confidence. ""President Trump has survived every petty, partisan, pathetic attempt to remove him from office and is well positioned to do it one more time: on Election Day.""Donald Trump Jr., Mr. Trump's eldest son and a campaign surrogate who watched the debate aboard Air Force One with his father, said that Mr. Bloomberg's performance amounted to a ""great night"" for his father.""Bloomberg was the victim of a political homicide and was clearly not prepared for the onslaught coming his way at the debate,"" Donald Trump Jr. said in remarks relayed through a spokesman. ""If he can't handle Grandpa Joe or Pocahontas on the debate stage, what makes anyone think he can handle Trump?""Before he left Las Vegas for Colorado, Mr. Trump treated an official White House event as something of a mini campaign rally. He traveled to the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, where he delivered a commencement address for a program for former offenders -- but not before attacking the F.B.I. and Mrs. Clinton and commenting about the sentencing of Roger J. Stone Jr., a onetime political adviser.Mr. Trump, who approved a slate of pardons and sentence commutations this week, told the crowd that he wanted to see the sentencing process play out but believed that Mr. Stone would be exonerated. Mr. Stone was sentenced to 40 months in prison for obstructing a congressional inquiry in a bid to protect the president.""At some point, I'll make a determination,"" Mr. Trump said. ""But Roger Stone and everybody has to be treated fairly. And this has not been a fair process.""At the event, Mr. Trump also seemed to marvel that impeachment had happened at all.""I didn't do anything wrong and they impeached me a few weeks ago,"" he told the group. ""I said: 'What happened? What did I do?' The good news, my numbers went through the roof.""PhotographPresident Trump at a rally Thursday in Colorado where he took aim at a range of topics including windmills and the film ""Parasite.""

| Jump to first hitWhen it comes to the Democratic presidential primary candidates, President Trump is worried about Mike Bloomberg while his campaign sees an opportunity in Bernie Sanders.President Trump's advisers see Senator Bernie Sanders as their ideal Democratic opponent in November and have been doing what they can to elevate his profile and bolster his chances of winning the Iowa caucuses, according to Republicans familiar with the plans.But their new focus on Mr. Sanders, independent of Vermont, comes at a time the president himself has been closely watching Michael R. Bloomberg, a late arrival to the Democratic primary race, unnerved by his campaign spending and his suggestion he might spend $1 billion of his own fortune on opposing Mr. Trump, even if he does not emerge as the nominee.It has left the president and his campaign focused on two different candidates in the weeks before Democrats cast their first votes in Iowa -- one, a populist running with a grass-roots movement behind him, and the other, a liberal billionaire who could refashion the general election because of his bottomless bank account.Neither is the national front-runner, but Mr. Sanders is believed to have gained significant ground in Iowa, and both are on the minds of the president and his team.Most of Mr. Trump's advisers see his biggest looming threat as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has maintained a steady level of support despite an onslaught of attacks from the president and his team. But there is often a divide between how Mr. Trump and his aides view opponents.Over the past few weeks, aides to the president in a series of conversations have discussed how to keep the focus on Mr. Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist who favors a significant expansion of government health programs and who is currently at the top of some Iowa polls. They see attacking him as a way to excite his base and draw attention away from other Democrats.Such efforts tend to be haphazard and revolve around Mr. Trump's comments at rallies and on his Twitter feed, as does much of the messaging of his campaign. The president, his advisers say, has been in need of a clear target for months, and he believes he is actually hurting Mr. Sanders.Mr. Trump's advisers do not necessarily share that view. But they find utility in trying to elevate Mr. Sanders, and aides are discussing ways to keep attention on Mr. Sanders in the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3.""Wow! Crazy Bernie Sanders is surging in the polls, looking very good against his opponents in the Do Nothing Party,"" Mr. Trump posted Sunday on Twitter, after a Des Moines Register poll showed Mr. Sanders leading in the state. ""So what does this all mean? Stay tuned!""""It means you're going to lose,"" Mr. Sanders tweeted in response.At a rally last week in Toledo, Ohio, the president singled out Mr. Sanders for his criticism of Mr. Trump's Jan. 3 drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani at Baghdad International Airport.""Bernie is going up,"" Mr. Trump said. ""He's surging. Crazy Bernie is surging.""Most of the president's advisers see Mr. Sanders, if he were to become the nominee, as helping to solve Mr. Trump's problem with suburban voters in states like Virginia, where the 2018 midterm elections showed that moderate and independent voters have recoiled from the president's behavior, controversies or policy positions.But some have concerns that Mr. Sanders might be more durable in the Rust Belt states, like Michigan and Wisconsin, with high concentrations of white working-class voters that emerged as trouble spots for the president in the 2018 elections.The advisers say that in their voter research Mr. Sanders registers with his own supporters as authentic -- the same quality that Mr. Trump's base ascribed to the president in 2016. They view Mr. Sanders as a more difficult opponent than Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, but less of a challenge than Mr. Biden.And Mr. Trump's advisers are discussing rolling out policies to counter Mr. Sanders's populist appeal.In recent days, Mr. Trump's team has been interested in focusing attention on Mr. Sanders's comments after the strike that killed the General Suleimani, arguing that he will appear too dovish for the general electorate.""We have no preference in potential opponents because President Trump will beat any one of them handily,"" Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, said in a statement. ""However, over the last two weeks Bernie Sanders has proved himself to be dangerous -- not as an opponent but as a potential president -- by excusing and appeasing Iran's aggression and belligerence.""""Bernie Sanders would not protect American interests as president and his weakness is something that begs to be highlighted,"" he added.Mr. Sanders's campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, pointed out that Mr. Trump ran as the candidate who ""would stop the endless wars"" and is now attacking the senator as weak. He added of Mr. Trump's efforts to tar Mr. Sanders: ""There's no 'there' there.""As for Mr. Bloomberg, the president has made clear he is aware of the money Mr. Bloomberg, a former New York mayor, is pouring into the race -- especially into the attack ads hitting him in 118 media markets across the country. And this week he responded on Twitter to a TV spot focused on the top issue for Democrats in the 2018 midterms: health care.""Mini Mike Bloomberg is spending a lot of money on False Advertising,"" Mr. Trump tweeted, going on to misrepresent his role in the health care debate. ""I was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your Healthcare, you have it now, while at the same time winning the fight to rid you of the expensive, unfair and very unpopular Individual Mandate.""Bloomberg aides noted that the ads highlight a core weakness for Mr. Trump, one that he seemed cognizant of defending himself over.""My view from watching the president's tweets is that he is clearly seeing our ads, he's clearly concerned about their impact,"" said Howard Wolfson, a senior adviser to Mr. Bloomberg. ""It's a massive television buy that is nationwide, attacking his biggest vulnerability and contrasting his failed record on health care.""Mr. Bloomberg spent over $100 million in 2018 through his super PAC, involving himself in two dozen races across the country, and that has made him and his team confident they have identified his weaknesses.""We amassed an enormous amount of data about what works in terms of identifying targeting the president's vulnerabilities,"" Mr. Wolfson said.But the Trump campaign has waved away concerns about Mr. Bloomberg's spending, arguing that it will only encourage Republican megadonors like Sheldon G. Adelson to spend more money for Mr. Trump.Despite Mr. Trump's own history of upending expectations of which candidates succeed, his aides insist they do not view Mr. Bloomberg as a serious contender for his party's nomination, and they believe that the power of his money is limited, noting that Mr. Bloomberg's aides would be legally prohibited from direct coordination with the Democratic nominee's campaign, unlike the national party committees.""Hillary Clinton said she 'inherited nothing' from the D.N.C., which is as broke today as it was when she lost,"" said Mike Reed, a spokesman for the Republican National Committee. ""Growing a $300 million data-driven field operation like we have at the R.N.C. takes years. Liberal billionaires can spend as much outside money as they want, but the eventual nominee cannot coordinate with anything they build.""Campaign finance experts, however, said the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee were underestimating the effect of Mr. Bloomberg's cash infusion into the race and that Mr. Trump was right to be concerned.""If Bloomberg does this, it will be unprecedented in American history,"" said Fred Wertheimer, the founder and president of Democracy 21, a nonprofit watchdog group. ""They will probably have more organizers than the R.N.C. will have. They will have loads of people in the battleground states, they'll have TV ads, they'll have digital ads.""""It will neutralize any financial advantages he thought he had,"" Mr. Wertheimer said, referring to the president, ""and if they're not worried, they're kidding themselves.""Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, agreed that Mr. Bloomberg should not be dismissed.""By any traditional measure, it's a pipe dream, but if we learned anything in 2016 it's that just because something has never happened before doesn't mean it can't happen now,"" he said. ""No one has ever talked about spending remotely as much money as he's talking about spending on this race.""PhotographSenator Bernie Sanders on Sunday at a rally in Iowa City.

| Jump to first hitAs senior officials are shown the door, a new personnel chief orders a search for political appointees as well as career officials deemed insufficiently supportive of the president.WASHINGTON -- In some of the most critical corners of the Trump administration, officials show up for work now never entirely sure who will be there by the end of the evening -- themselves included.Even for an administration that has been a revolving door since Day 1, this has become a season of turmoil. At a moment when first-term presidents are typically seeking a stable team to focus on their re-election, President Trump has embarked on a systematic attempt to sweep out officials perceived to be disloyal.The headquarters of the nation's intelligence apparatus roiled with the ouster of the acting director Joseph Maguire and his replacement by a sharp partisan amid a dispute over Russian election interference. The Justice Department remained on edge with whispers of further resignations, including perhaps even that of Attorney General William P. Barr, after the president's intervention in a case involving one of his friends. Witnesses from the impeachment inquiry into Mr. Trump have been summarily dismissed. Dozens of policy experts have been cleared out of the National Security Council staff as part of a restructuring that will mean fewer career professionals in range of the president. A deputy national security adviser dogged by innuendo about disloyalty was exiled to the Energy Department. A Trump appointee's nomination for a top Treasury Department post was pulled. The No. 3 official at the Defense Department was shown the door.And Johnny McEntee, a 29-year-old loyalist just installed to take over the Office of Presidential Personnel and reporting directly to Mr. Trump, has ordered a freeze on all political appointments across the government. He also convened a meeting to instruct departments to search for people not devoted to the president so they can be removed, according to people briefed about the session, and informed colleagues that he planned to tell cabinet secretaries that the White House would be choosing their deputies from now on.""Trump appears to be launching the biggest assault on the nation's civil service system since the 1883 Pendleton Act ended the spoils system,"" said Paul C. Light, a New York University professor who has studied presidential personnel.But career professionals are not the only ones in the cross hairs. Also facing scrutiny are Republican political appointees considered insufficiently committed to the president or suspected of not aggressively advancing his agenda.Allies of the president say he should be free to make personnel changes, even if it amounts to shedding people who are not seen as loyal to Mr. Trump.""It is not unusual at all that these types of assessments are done and thereafter changes are made,"" said Bradley A. Blakeman, a Republican strategist and former White House official under President George W. Bush.Nonetheless, the tumult and anxiety come at a time when the Trump administration confronts enormous challenges, including the coronavirus outbreak, Iranian and North Korean nuclear development and Russian determination to play a role again in America's next election. Democrats, for example, have expressed concerns about the administration's ability to respond if there were a severe coronavirus outbreak in the United States, noting that a global health security expert position on the National Security Council has been left vacant for almost two years.Mr. Trump has long been obsessed with loyalty, a view only exacerbated by his impeachment and the various investigations over the last three years that have convinced him that he is surrounded by a deep-state enemy within that is leaking, lying and sabotaging his presidency.He has also been frustrated by the decision-making process of government, aggravated at competing centers of power that have shaped the modern presidency but have, in his view, hindered his ability to enact policies.With a more loyal team in place, he hopes to make more progress on initiatives that have been slow-walked by institutional inertia or resistance like tougher rules on trade and immigration. But it could mean less dissent and less open debate with surviving officials fearing the loss of their jobs if they are seen as stepping out of line.From the beginning, his administration has been a turnstile of people who fall in and out of favor with the president. Including those with ""acting"" designations, he is on his third chief of staff, his fourth national security adviser, his fourth defense secretary, his fifth secretary of homeland security, his sixth deputy national security adviser and his seventh communications director.According to data compiled by Kathryn Dunn Tenpas, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, turnover among what she calls Mr. Trump's ""A team,"" meaning his senior staff, has hit 82 percent, more in three years than any of the previous five presidents saw in their first four years. Moreover, the Trump administration has been notable for a high level of serial turnover, with 38 percent of the top positions replaced more than once.""Many key departments and White House entities have been hollowed out,"" Ms. Tenpas said. The president has thus been left with acting officials in many key areas. ""He seems completely unbothered,"" she said. ""He claims that actings give him flexibility, but fails to see that temporary leaders cannot advance his policies nearly as well as a Senate-confirmed appointee who has the stature and all the powers to do so.""While some of the reliance on acting officials owes to a dysfunctional Senate confirmation process, Mr. Trump seems to prefer to keep senior advisers on edge as to whether they will keep their job. Mick Mulvaney, his acting White House chief of staff, a position that does not require Senate confirmation, is finishing his 14th month with an ""acting"" in front of his title for no reason that has ever been publicly articulated and he may be forced out without ever having been granted the full title.Mr. Mulvaney has shrugged it off, saying that anyone who works for Mr. Trump is by definition an acting official who could be dismissed at any time. But the president's refusal to bestow the full title strikes many as a form of ritual humiliation depriving him of stature, influence or job security.Just a few days ago, Mr. Mulvaney seemed to speak out in a way that caused many to wonder whether he may leave soon, voluntarily or not. During a session with the Oxford Union in England, he said that the United States was ""desperate"" for more immigrants and that Republicans seemed to stop caring about rising deficits when Mr. Trump took office. He added that ""I disagree with the president every single day"" but did not talk about it publicly.The newest power center at the White House is Mr. McEntee, a former assistant to the president who was fired by the previous chief of staff, John F. Kelly, but has been brought back as presidential personnel director. Mr. McEntee has made clear that his mission is to establish a more loyal team around the president. His meeting last Thursday with cabinet liaisons in which he called for rooting out disloyal officials was first reported by Axios.The ousters have extended beyond impeachment witnesses like Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman and the ambassador Gordon D. Sondland. John C. Rood, who was removed as under secretary of defense for policy, did not speak out publicly but had written internal emails skeptical of the freeze on security aid to Ukraine that was at the center of the impeachment inquiry.In National Security Council staff meetings, however, Mr. Rood was a constant voice of skepticism over the administration's troop reductions in Syria, its pending peace deal with the Taliban and other issues. With Mr. McEntee's arrival, that dissenting voice was no longer welcome, said a person familiar with the matter.Supporters of Jessie K. Liu, a Trump backer who served as the United States attorney in Washington, suspect her nomination for under secretary of Treasury was pulled because of dissatisfaction with her prosecution of Roger J. Stone Jr., the president's adviser convicted of obstruction and witness intimidation to protect Mr. Trump.Victoria Coates, a deputy national security adviser, was dispatched to the Energy Department despite denials that she was the anonymous official who wrote an Op-Ed and book critical of the administration.Mr. Maguire, the acting director of national intelligence who angered the president by allowing intelligence officials to tell House lawmakers that Russia was already intervening in the 2020 election on Mr. Trump's behalf, was replaced by Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and a vocal conservative with no background in intelligence.One of Mr. Grenell's first moves was to push out Andrew P. Hallman, the popular principal executive, who had been acting as the top deputy. Arriving with Mr. Grenell was Kashyap Patel, a senior National Security Council staff member and former key aide to Representative Devin Nunes, Republican of California and a former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.Mr. Patel has been viewed warily by intelligence officers especially since news reports that his mandate was to clean house. Some top civil servants told colleagues they were contemplating quitting or feared being fired.But Mr. Grenell also began a charm offensive with senior officials and his initial meetings have put some at ease while making others think they should give the new boss a chance. It is also not clear who placed Mr. Patel in the office, with one official saying it was not Mr. Grenell's idea.Some allies of the administration cautioned against overanalyzing the developments in the intelligence office. Mr. Maguire was scheduled to leave next month anyway under a vacancies law, although administration officials had been looking for ways to extend him, and Mr. Grenell is only temporary while the president comes up with a nominee to send to the Senate. ""The O.D.N.I., I think, is less than meets the eye,"" said James Jay Carafano, a national security scholar at the Heritage Foundation, using the initials for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence.Even so, it has added to the wave of concern across the administration, even among Trump appointees. And that may be part of the point. Convinced that so many officials in government have been working against him, Mr. Trump does not mind if they are more than a little unsettled.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York, and Julian E. Barnes and Noah Weiland from Washington.PhotographPresident Trump has long been obsessed with loyalty, a view only exacerbated by his impeachment and various investigations.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump hailed his acquittal in the Senate impeachment trial as vindication, but the struggle now moves back to the House, the campaign trail and, ultimately, the voters.WASHINGTON -- When the history books are written about this day, they will surely record it as the culmination of a monumental three-year political battle that tested American democracy and delivered victory to an enraged and enraging president over his relentless foes. But they will not record it as the end of the struggle.President Trump's acquittal on Wednesday after a fiery three-week Senate impeachment trial provided him a moment of triumph, a sense of validation, a shot of momentum -- anything but the finality that he might want. The president who vowed to bring an end to endless wars overseas remains at the center of an endless war at home, one that now moves to the campaign trail and will not be resolved until November at the earliest.Rather than reaching out to bind the wounds, as President Bill Clinton did after his own Senate impeachment trial in 1999, Mr. Trump made clear minutes after the final roll call that he planned to go on the offensive. He opted to wait until Thursday to make a public appearance, on the advice of aides concerned about complicating the lives of Republicans who cast tough votes for him, but his Twitter feed and staff statements taunted his opponents and boasted of the ""Country's VICTORY on the Impeachment Hoax!""Nor was the other side ready to surrender.Deflated by the nearly party-line vote, House Democrats took heart in winning over one Republican, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, and quickly signaled that they would continue their investigations into the president. Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he was now ""likely"" to subpoena John R. Bolton, the president's former national security adviser, whose offer to testify in the Senate was rejected by the Republican majority.The prospect of continuing conflict over the president's effort to coerce Ukraine into helping him against his domestic rivals will presumably shape the national debate that is coming into focus as the Democrats begin voting to decide who will challenge Mr. Trump in the general election this fall.""It's a referendum on whether we remain a constitutional republic,"" Representative Tom Malinowski, Democrat of New Jersey, said in an interview. ""We can easily survive four years of this,"" he added, but ""it's a very different landscape if he's re-elected after this. It illuminates what's at stake in the election.""Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, one of Mr. Trump's strongest Republican allies, agreed that rather than being settled by the vote on Wednesday, the battle now moved to the campaign trail. ""The only way this is going to end permanently is for the president to get re-elected,"" Mr. Graham said on the floor, ""and he will.""For the president, that may be perfectly fine. The self-described counterpuncher appears eager to prosecute his case against his prosecutors. Even before the Senate vote, he tweeted or retweeted a barrage of messages attacking Speaker Nancy Pelosi for ripping up her copy of his State of the Union address (without mentioning that he had refused to shake her hand). After the verdict, he quickly turned his fire to Mr. Romney, posting an attack video mocking the senator.""The vote today will open the floodgate for Trump to go after those who have wronged him in this process,"" said Jack O'Donnell, a former president of Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City, N.J., who has broken with Mr. Trump. ""The so-called hate list which he carries around will be expanded, and efforts to hurt those on the list will begin. He will have no fear, not that he ever had much when going after his enemies.""Conciliation and acknowledging mistakes are not in his nature. Gwenda Blair, a biographer of the Trump family, pointed to the president's mentor, Roy Cohn. ""Never say you're wrong, always claim victory, get in people's face, repeat; if they accuse you of something, throw it back at them, double down, triple down,"" she said. ""He's taken Roy Cohn's mantra of total and complete belligerence and aggression not just to the next level but several levels past that.""While Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, said this week that she believed Mr. Trump had learned from the experiences that had prompted his impeachment and would recalibrate his actions in office accordingly, some who have studied him said that would not be in keeping with the president's history.""I doubt he will be chastened by the impeachment or the trial,"" said Shirley Anne Warshaw, a presidential scholar at Gettysburg College. ""In fact, he will probably feel, unlike Susan Collins suggests, that he has open season now to do anything he wants because no one will rein him in for the next eight months.""In decisively winning acquittal, Mr. Trump demonstrated a command of his Republican Party that would have been almost unthinkable when he came into office. While Mr. Romney generated much attention for his vote to convict, the fact that he was the only Republican to break with Mr. Trump was a powerful affirmation of the president's success at building brand loyalty in the party.By not backing down, not even an inch, he forced Republicans to choose between him and his critics, and they almost universally chose him.From Mr. Trump's point of view, the trial was simply the latest chapter in a campaign by his enemies to nullify his election that started before he even took office. He sees many of the developments of the last three years through that lens. The special counsel investigation into Russian election interference, the various congressional inquiries, the demands for his tax returns, the prosecution of so many of his former aides and associates all fit together in what he considers a scorched-earth effort to find something, anything, to take him down.But some of his allies said the president understands that the conflict is only part of the calculation over whether he will win a second term, which is why he made no mention of impeachment during his State of the Union address this week even though it almost certainly absorbed him for most of the other 22 and a half hours that day. Instead, he focused the speech on promoting his economic record, his military spending, his crackdown on immigration and his appointment of conservative judges.""Some of what the president does is theater, which he revels in,"" said Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a friend of Mr. Trump's. ""But he knows that the voters will really judge him on results, and that's why he's more bottom-line focused than people think.""For Mr. Trump and his opponents, that bottom line is coming in the form of another up-or-down vote in 272 days. At that point, it will be clear whether it will provide the ending in the history book or just another page to turn.PhotographSpeaker Nancy Pelosi, at left, meeting with impeachment managers before the Senate vote on Wednesday.

Gen. Qassim Suleimani.Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have been involved in a he-said, she-said clash about whether he said during a private meeting in 2018 that a woman could not win the presidency. Ms. Warren said he did, while Mr. Sanders has denied ever making such a statement.Mr. Trump, who in recent weeks has been seeking to elevate Mr. Sanders's Democratic presidential primary campaign, believing that he could beat him in November, weighed in on the side of the man over the woman.""A woman can win for president,"" Mr. Trump said. ""That could happen, who knows.""""I don't believe Bernie said that, I really don't,"" he said. ""It's not the kind of a thing he'd say.""It was not clear that validation from the president would help Mr. Sanders in an intraparty feud. But it was a classic Trump offer of an unsolicited two cents from the sidelines in the hopes of somehow influencing the debate.At Mr. Trump's rally, in a state he won in 2016 by fewer than 23,000 votes, he also mocked Democrats for questioning whether there was any imminent threat from Iran, hoping to capitalize politically on the killing of General Suleimani, which campaign aides said had delivered him a small bump in their polling.""Great percentages of people don't have legs or arms because of this son of a bitch,"" Mr. Trump told a raucous crowd of supporters, who had lined up on the gray, snow-covered streets of Milwaukee for hours to see him speak.He said that it ""doesn't matter"" to Democrats that General Suleimani had killed ""hundreds of thousands of people,"" and that ""they'll start a new investigation"" over whether there was really any imminent threat.Mr. Trump, who had previously claimed that four American embassies were under threat -- a charge his own administration could not back -- also appeared on Tuesday evening to imply that the number could have been higher, but that the threat was vaguer.""If I didn't kill him, and let's say we lost three, four, five embassies or bases,"" he said, trailing off.His breezy dismissal of the entire discussion of an imminent threat came after the administration had insisted for more than 10 days that General Suleimani, Iran's most important military official, was planning myriad ""imminent"" attacks.The president said that ""Democrats are outraged that we killed this terrorist monster,"" calling General Suleimani the ""king of roadside bombs"" and blaming President Barack Obama for not taking him out. ""He should have been killed 20 years ago,"" Mr. Trump said.It was the president's first campaign rally in Wisconsin since April, and its early billing on his 2020 rally calendar signaled the importance that both parties plan to place on a state where Mr. Trump's victory four years ago blindsided Hillary Clinton's campaign.""I shouldn't even be here tonight,"" Mr. Trump said, ""but I love the people of Wisconsin.""Eager to overcome the narrative that Mrs. Clinton lost the 2016 election, in part, because of her infamous decision to not visit the state even once, Democrats have selected Milwaukee as the city to host their nominating convention in July. And Priorities USA, one of the leading Democratic super PACs, has been outspending the Trump campaign on digital ads in the state since last July.Mr. Trump came to Wisconsin to promote his campaign theme of ""Promises made, Promises kept."" But in reality, dairy farmers in the state have been struggling since he took office, with some farms even shutting down. Democrats attribute the loss of dairy farms and related jobs to Mr. Trump threatening a trade war with China.The president, however, put forth his trade policies as reasons to support him.""What we've done with China, what we've done with the U.S.M.C.A., what we've done with Japan,"" he said. ""You've got to love Trump. You've got to love Trump.""Meantime, Democrats signaled that they would invest heavily to win back the state.""Wisconsin is going to be one of the states that decides this election, and we're investing in the state accordingly,"" said Cassidy Geoghegan, the Wisconsin outreach director for Priorities USA. She said that health care costs in the state were on the rise and that ""farmers are having to sell their cows and close down their operations,"" while wages were not keeping up.During the rally -- which started before the Democrats took the stage for their debate in Des Moines -- Mr. Trump also singled out Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., mocking him for not knowing what state he was campaigning in. ""When you do that, you can't really recover,"" the president. ""You can be Winston Churchill. But you get killed. He does that every time.""In reality, Mr. Trump has also suffered his share of confusion about his speaking locations or where tragedies have occurred under his watch. In a somber, televised speech in August after two mass shootings, for instance, Mr. Trump blessed ""the memory of those who perished in Toledo,"" referring to a city more than 100 miles away from Dayton, the scene of an Ohio massacre.Mr. Trump's rally was the centerpiece of a two-day push in Wisconsin, with top Trump aides and family members making stops at smaller venues around the state.Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and a senior adviser, flew commercial with Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, to Milwaukee from Washington on Tuesday morning to lead a discussion about prisoner re-entry programs.Lara Trump, who is married to Eric Trump, the president's second eldest son, visited Rib Mountain on Monday to speak to voters. And Vice President Mike Pence made an unannounced visit to a Culver's restaurant in Milwaukee to talk to voters in the kind of small, intimate venue that Mr. Trump does not often frequent himself.For his part, Mr. Trump delivered what has become his standard, rambling stump speech, which combines inflated boasts about his record, rosy memories about his 2016 victory and grievances about the way he has been treated by Democrats. His remarks, delivered in an uncharacteristically hoarse voice, were punctuated by individual protesters in a sea of enthusiastic supporters clad in red Trump campaign T-shirts and hats.On the eve of the official beginning to the formal start of the Senate impeachment trial against him, Mr. Trump claimed, once again, that Democrats were trying to impeach him because of his success with the economy and rebuilding the military.He targeted Speaker Nancy Pelosi, noting that ""her district is filthy dirty,"" filled with syringes and cautioned her to spend more time at home.But he said he was confident about his chances. Calling the 2016 election the most important election in history, he noted that 2020 ""maybe, in its own way, will be just as important.""PhotographPresident Trump's rally on Tuesday was part of a campaign push this week in Wisconsin, a state that helped deliver his 2016 victory.

| Jump to first hitThe House impeachment managers began presenting their oral arguments against President Trump in the Senate trial, arguing that his conduct warranted his removal.WASHINGTON -- The House Democratic impeachment managers began formal arguments in the Senate trial on Wednesday, presenting a meticulous and scathing case for convicting President Trump and removing him from office on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the lead House prosecutor, took the lectern in the chamber as senators sat silently preparing to weigh Mr. Trump's fate. Speaking in an even, measured manner, he accused the president of a corrupt scheme to pressure Ukraine for help ""to cheat"" in the 2020 presidential election.Invoking the nation's founders and their fears that a self-interested leader might subvert democracy for his own personal gain, Mr. Schiff argued that the president's conduct was precisely what the framers of the Constitution had in mind when they devised the remedy of impeachment, one he said was ""as powerful as the evil it was meant to combat.""""If not remedied by his conviction in the Senate, and removal from office, President Trump's abuse of his office and obstruction of Congress will permanently alter the balance of power among the branches of government,"" Mr. Schiff said in his opening remarks. ""The president has shown that he believes that he's above the law and scornful of constraint.""The Senate proceeding, the third impeachment trial of a president in the nation's history, was fraught with partisan rancor and political consequence both for Mr. Trump and for the two parties grappling over his future.In a series of speeches, Mr. Schiff and the six other impeachment managers asserted that the president pressured Ukraine to announce an investigation of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter Biden, while withholding as leverage nearly $400 million in security aid for Kyiv and a White House meeting for its president. When he was caught, they said, Mr. Trump ordered a cover-up, blocking witnesses and denying Congress the evidence that could corroborate his scheme.""President Trump withheld hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to a strategic partner at war with Russia to secure foreign help with his re-election,"" Mr. Schiff declared. ""In other words, to cheat.""The Democrats will continue to lay out their now-familiar case on Thursday, although there is little doubt about the outcome of the trial. It is all but certain to end in Mr. Trump's acquittal in the Senate, where it would take 67 votes to convict and remove him. But the contours of the trial remained up in the air, as Republicans and Democrats continued to feud over whether to consider additional evidence, including witnesses the president has forbade from cooperating with the inquiry.Mr. Trump -- impatient for his legal team to have a chance to mount a vigorous defense of his behavior -- was on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, hurling insults at the impeachment managers and telling reporters he would like to personally attend the Senate trial in order to ""sit right in the front row and stare into their corrupt faces.""At a news conference in Davos, Switzerland, where he was attending the World Economic Forum, Mr. Trump said that John R. Bolton, the former White House national security adviser, could not be allowed to testify because he ""knows my thoughts on certain people and other governments, war and peace and different things -- that's a national security problem.""Mr. Schiff insisted in his opening arguments that fairness demanded hearing from Mr. Bolton, who has pledged to testify if the Senate subpoenas him, and other White House officials. Democrats angrily rejected the suggestion that they might agree to call Hunter Biden in exchange for Mr. Bolton's appearance.""This isn't like some fantasy football trade,"" Mr. Schiff said before the trial commenced Wednesday. ""Trials aren't trades for witnesses.""Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, told reporters the idea was ""off the table.""Campaigning in Iowa, Joseph Biden was adamant in rejecting any testimony trade-off. ""This is a constitutional issue,"" he said. ""We're not going to turn it into a farce, into some kind of political theater.""A set of closed-door negotiations among senators appears likely to soon intensify as Democrats plot their strategy for winning a vote on witnesses, which would require the votes of a handful of centrist Republican senators who have signaled they are open to the idea. Votes on the matter are likely next week, after the House managers and White House lawyers complete their arguments and senators have had a chance to submit questions about the case.On the first day of oral arguments, Mr. Schiff opened with a plea for patience, telling senators that ""we have some very long days yet to come."" But senators already seemed restless; many passed notes to each other, and as the hours wore on, a handful of seats were frequently empty as lawmakers from both parties slipped out of the chamber for brief respites from the weighty -- and often very tedious -- arguments.A protester in the Senate gallery briefly interrupted arguments from Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York, shouting ""Schumer is the devil"" and yelling that Democrats support abortion before being dragged out by Capitol Hill police officers.On the floor, the managers sought to place Mr. Trump's Ukraine pressure campaign in the context of what they called a broader impulse by the president to cede America's foreign policy to Russia. It was no coincidence, Mr. Schiff argued, that Mr. Trump had asked the president of Ukraine for investigations into his rivals just one day after Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel who investigated Russia's interference in the 2016 election, issued his report.""President Trump, believing he had escaped accountability for Russia meddling in the first election, and welcoming of it, asked the Ukrainian president to help him undermine the special counsel's conclusion and help him smear a political opponent,"" Mr. Schiff said.For now, the president's legal team must sit silently in the chamber as the president's House accusers have exclusive access to the microphone. Under the rules of the trial adopted on Tuesday, the House managers have 24 hours over three days to present their case, leaving White House lawyers to take in their searingly argued case about Mr. Trump's actions, with no opportunity for immediate rebuttal.The president vented his spleen about the process on Twitter, firing off so many posts that he set a record for any single day in his presidency.As of 11:30 p.m., Mr. Trump had posted or reposted 142 messages on Twitter, surpassing the previous record of 123 set in December. Most were retweets of messages from allies and supporters assailing Mr. Schiff and others prosecuting the case.During a dinner break on Wednesday, the president's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow raced to face reporters, vowing to eventually respond ""to what the House managers have put forward, and we are going to make an affirmative case defending the president.""The tables will turn this week, most likely on Saturday, when the defense team will be given its own 24 hours of uninterrupted time to play to the cameras from the Senate floor, with House Democrats sidelined. The defense of the president could continue into early next week after a break on Sunday.The oral arguments on Wednesday began only hours after the conclusion of a lengthy fight over witnesses and documents that stretched into the wee hours of the day and cleaved the Senate along party lines. It was dominated by bitter exchanges between the Democratic House managers and the president's legal defense team that grew so personal and hostile after midnight that they drew a reprimand from Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is presiding over the trial.Several senators said they were particularly piqued by the managers' repeated insistence -- put most bluntly by Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who at one point accused Republican senators of ""treacherous"" behavior -- that the Senate was abetting a cover-up of Mr. Trump's misconduct and preparing to hold a sham trial by rejecting Democrats' demands for witnesses and documents.""What Chairman Nadler said and how he conducted himself was outrageous and an insult to the Senate,"" said Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas. ""We don't need to continue the clown circus that started over in the House.""The tenor of the House Democrats' presentation on Tuesday also bothered some Democratic senators, who took issue with what they characterized as an overly accusatory tone by the impeachment managers. Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, told reporters that Mr. Nadler ""could have chosen better words.""Even as the House managers began laying out their case, newly released emails revealed additional evidence of friction between the Defense Department and the White House over a freeze sought by the president on military assistance to Ukraine. The emails, released just before midnight on Tuesday as a result of a Freedom of Information lawsuit, underscored the confusion and surprise among lawmakers, including some prominent Republicans, who learned that the military assistance to Ukraine had been held up.Arguing for the prosecution, Mr. Schiff delved deeply into the details of the Ukraine pressure campaign, citing specific dates and meetings. But he also sought to pull back the lens, telling senators that they must act to remove Mr. Trump or ""we will write the history of our decline with our own hand.""Mr. Nadler described the smear campaign against Marie L. Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine. Representative Jason Crow of Colorado discussed the national security implications of withholding security aid from Ukraine. And Representative Val B. Demings of Florida told senators about the effort to withhold a White House meeting that Ukraine wanted until the country announced investigations into the Bidens.At the end of the session, Chief Justice Roberts announced that senators would be given access to a one-page classified document shared by the House that contains supplemental testimony from Jennifer Williams, a national security aide to Vice President Mike Pence.Mr. Schiff has repeatedly asked for the supplement -- which is said to pertain to a September phone call between Mr. Pence and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine -- to be declassified, without success. A Democratic official working on the case said Wednesday night that the document would provide senators ""further corroborative evidence"" related to the charges against Mr. Trump.The president had at one point embraced the idea of pushing for a quick dismissal of the case against him, but his lawyers chose not to take that opportunity on Wednesday. Republican leaders discouraged the defense team from seeking a vote this week that would almost certainly have failed, dividing Republicans and dealing Mr. Trump an early symbolic defeat.A motion to dismiss the case could still be offered later in the trial.Reporting was contributed by Nicholas Fandos, Emily Cochrane, Catie Edmondson and Peter Baker from Washington, and Katie Glueck from Osage, Iowa.PhotographRepresentative Adam B.

| Jump to first hitThe House impeachment managers sought to undercut the central elements of President Trump's defense, wading into a detailed defense of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.WASHINGTON -- House Democrats sought on Thursday to pre-emptively dismantle President Trump's core defenses in his impeachment trial, invoking his own words to argue that his pressure campaign on Ukraine was an abuse of power that warranted his removal.On the second day of arguments in the third presidential impeachment trial in American history, Democrats sought to make the case that Mr. Trump's actions were an affront to the Constitution. And they worked to disprove his lawyers' claims that he was acting only in the nation's interests when he sought to enlist Ukraine to investigate political rivals.In doing so, they took a calculated risk in talking at length about Mr. Trump's targets -- former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden -- and underscored the political backdrop of a trial that is unfolding only 10 months before the election and is likely to reverberate long after the verdict.""You know you can't trust this president to do what's right for this country -- you can trust he will do what's right for Donald Trump,"" said Representative Adam B. Schiff, the lead impeachment manager, said in an impassioned appeal as the clock ticked past 10 p.m. ""This is why if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Right matters and the truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.""The team of seven Democratic impeachment managers repeatedly attacked the idea that when the president withheld military aid from Ukraine and sought to secure a promise to investigate Joseph Biden, he was merely making a foreign policy decision to root out corruption in Ukraine.Mr. Trump has consistently suggested, without any evidence, that Mr. Biden pushed to remove a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company with a long history of corruption that employed Hunter Biden on its board. Representative Sylvia R. Garcia, Democrat of Texas, spent nearly an hour debunking the claim, and said that, in fact, the opposite was true.The prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, was ""widely perceived as corrupt,"" she said, and Mr. Biden was acting in accordance with official American policy, as well as the policy of the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and other international organizations in calling for his removal.Moreover, Mr. Shokin had already let the Burisma investigation ""go dormant,"" Ms. Garcia said, so his ouster ""would only increase the chance that Burisma would be investigated for possible corruption."" She asserted that neither the elder Mr. Biden nor his son had done anything wrong, and that American officials -- and Mr. Trump -- knew it.""Every single witness who was asked about the allegations again said that Biden had nothing to do with it and it was false; they testified that he acted properly,"" Ms. Garcia said, adding, ""There is simply no evidence, nothing, nada in the record to support this baseless allegation.""It was, in effect, a defense of one of the Democrats' leading 2020 presidential candidates and a potential challenger to the president. Mr. Schiff later volunteered that neither he nor his colleagues had a position on the Democratic presidential primary.Mr. Schiff also brought Mr. Trump into the chamber -- at least on video -- to use the president's own words against him, with a clip in which the president called both Bidens ""corrupt"" and called for Ukraine to start a ""major investigation"" into them.""The president has confirmed what he wanted in his own words,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""He has made it clear he didn't care about corruption, he cared only about himself. Now it is up to us to do something about it, to make sure that a president, that this president, cannot pursue an objective that places himself above our country.""But in focusing on the Bidens, Democrats took a strategic risk. Some Republicans have already threatened to call the Bidens as witnesses, even suggesting that they would insist on hearing from them as a condition of agreeing to subpoena John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser.Democrats have refused to consider the idea, and Mr. Biden has said he would not take part in any such swap. And on Thursday, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said he would not ""give in to that pressure"" from some of his colleagues to do so.But Mr. Trump's legal team said the Bidens were now fair game in the trial.""They have opened the door,"" said Jay Sekulow. ""It's now relevant.""Senator Josh Hawley, Republican of Missouri, said the Democrats' arguments had made testimony from the Bidens vital.""If we're going to call witnesses,"" he said, ""it's now clear we absolutely must call Hunter Biden, and we probably need to call Joe Biden.""Mr. Trump seemed to be paying attention. At a Republican National Committee event on Thursday evening at the president's club in Doral, Fla., he told 400 people that the proceedings were ""impeachment lite"" compared with the trial of President Bill Clinton in 1999 and the case against President Richard M. Nixon in the 1970s.In laying out their case against Mr. Trump, the Democrats focused tightly on the first of two charges against him: that he abused his power by trying to compel a foreign power to help him win re-election in 2020 and withheld two official acts -- the provision of $391 million in military aid and a White House meeting with Ukraine's president -- in an effort to advance his illicit scheme.""President Trump exploited our ally, Ukraine, for his own political benefit to the detriment of American national security,"" said Representative Hakeem Jeffries, Democrat of New York. ""Is that conduct impeachable? The answer is categorically yes. The Senate must hold this president accountable for his abuse of power crimes against our Constitution.""Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee said: ""Impeachment is not punishment for a crime. Impeachment exists to address threats to the political system.""""Impeachment is the Constitution's final answer to a president who mistakes himself for a king,"" he added.Democrats expect to wrap up their case on Friday with presentations aimed at proving the second charge: that Mr. Trump obstructed Congress by withholding documents and witnesses and otherwise working to conceal his behavior. On Saturday, Mr. Trump's defense team is expected to lay out its case.On Thursday, Mr. Nadler drew on quotes from Alexander Hamilton; from George Washington's farewell address; and from a 1792 letter to Thomas Jefferson from John Adams that warned of ""foreign intrigue and influence"" in arguing that Mr. Trump warranted impeachment and removal from office -- regardless of whether he committed a crime.""No president has ever used his office to compel a foreign nation to help him cheat in our elections,"" Mr. Nadler said, adding, ""It puts even President Nixon to shame.""Mr. Nadler also turned to Trump allies -- including Alan M. Dershowitz, the Harvard Law professor who is assisting in the president's defense, and Mr. Graham -- to make his case, using video clips of their comments from the Clinton impeachment trial to undercut Mr. Trump's defense.In one clip, Mr. Graham, an impeachment manager during the Clinton trial, explained why a ""high crime"" -- one of the criteria the Constitution sets forth for the impeachment and removal of a president -- does not necessarily require breaking a law.""When you start using your office and you're acting in a way that hurts people, you've committed a high crime,"" Mr. Graham said.Even before Thursday's session got underway, it was clear that Mr. Schiff, Mr. Nadler and the other managers had not changed the minds of many Republicans. Senate Democrats were privately expressing concern that they may not get the four Republican votes they would need to bring witnesses and documents into the trial.If they do not, the case could be over by the end of next week. Publicly, though, Democrats were putting on a good face.""I am more hopeful than ever that four conscientious, brave Republicans will come forward and tell Mitch McConnell you can't shut this down without witnesses, you can't shut this down without documents,"" said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, referring to his Republican counterpart.The rules of the trial require senators to ""keep silent, on pain of imprisonment,"" and after two lengthy days of first voting on motions on Tuesday and hearing oral arguments on Wednesday, Republicans were growing weary.Some complained that Democrats were simply reciting the same facts time and time again, more for the television viewing audience than for the audience in the chamber. Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina, handed out fidget spinner toys to his colleagues, ostensibly to ease the boredom -- and to deliver a not-too-subtle dig at Democrats.""They spent a lot of time, they're well prepared -- I just don't think they have much to work with,"" said Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri. ""They've got about a one-hour presentation that they gave six hours on Tuesday and eight hours yesterday.""But Senator Tim Kaine, Democrat of Virginia, said the Democrats had good reason to be repetitive: Many senators -- not to mention the public -- did not pay close attention to the House inquiry. One Republican, Senator John Kennedy of Louisiana, told reporters as much on Wednesday.""Senators didn't know the case,"" he said. ""They really didn't. We didn't stay glued to the television. We haven't read the transcripts.""Reporting was contributed by Michael D.

| Jump to first hitThe Trump campaign's digital ads herald the death of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a top Iranian commander. They then direct voters to the ""Official Trump Military Survey.""On Thursday, President Trump ordered a drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, the powerful Iranian military commander. By Monday, the Trump campaign was running ads on Facebook touting the general's death.""Thanks to the swift actions of our commander in chief, Iranian General Qassem Soleimani is no longer a threat to the United States, or to the world,"" several of the Trump ads read, using an alternate spelling of the Iranian general's name. Some featured pictures of a beaming Mr. Trump from one of his campaign rallies; others showed a stoic, finger-waving president, also in front of supporters.The ads asked voters to take the ""Official Trump Military Survey,"" directing users to Mr. Trump's re-election campaign website.All told, the Trump campaign has run nearly 800 distinct Facebook ads about the killing of General Suleimani, according to Acronym, a progressive digital strategy group. Political campaigns often run many digital ads with similar versions of a message, and Mr. Trump's campaign is among the most prolific advertisers on Facebook, often running hundreds of ads with subtle differences.It is not yet known how much the campaign has spent on the ads because Facebook's public ad database does not immediately report such figures. But Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm, said the Trump campaign had spent at least $8,000 on the ads so far.The advertising campaign is running as tensions between the United States and Iran ramp up. Iran's supreme leader is vowing retribution against the United States, the Pentagon is at odds with Mr. Trump over threatening Iranian cultural sites, and some Democrats have suggested that the president may have ordered the strike to take attention away from the looming Senate impeachment trial.The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.These types of ads, known as acquisition ads, are intended to help campaigns gather more information about internet users with the goal of turning them into online donors.Most of the Trump campaign's Suleimani ads work the same way. First, potential voters are shown the ad. Clicking on it brings them to a brief survey on the Trump campaign's website, which asks questions like, ""Do you believe America has the greatest military in the world?"" The survey also asks for a name, email address and phone number, which the campaign can then add to its database of potential donors.Users who submit the survey are also prompted to donate right away, with a message that says, ""President Trump is keeping AMERICA SAFE! Now it's time to step up and stand behind him."" Donation buttons ranging from $42 to $2,800 appear below the text.Though online surveys are an exceptionally common form of political advertising and fund-raising, the use of General Suleimani's death in the advertisements is likely to draw criticism from Democrats.Other presidents have run advertisements during re-election campaigns that have tried to capitalize on major military events -- and have also been accused of trying to politicize them.During President Barack Obama's re-election campaign in 2012, his team produced a digital video about the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. The video praised Mr. Obama's decision making and asked, ""Which path would Mitt Romney have taken?""Joseph R. Biden Jr., who was vice president at the time, said that Mr. Obama's re-election slogan should be, ""Osama bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive.""And last year, Mr. Trump ran hundreds of Facebook ads about the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State. Those ads began running a day after the news of his killing was made public.""President Trump has brought the #1 terrorist leader to justice. He is KEEPING AMERICA SAFE,"" one ad said. Others cited ""the fierce leadership of our commander in chief.""They also directed users to surveys on the campaign website.PhotographPresident Trump rallied supporters in Miami on Friday, one day after ordering the strike that killed an Iranian commander.

| Jump to first hitIn a six-page filing formally responding to the impeachment charges, President Trump's lawyers rejected the case against him as illegitimate and described the effort to remove him as dangerous.WASHINGTON -- President Trump's legal defense team strenuously denied on Saturday that he had committed impeachable acts, denouncing the charges against him as a ""brazen and unlawful"" attempt to cost him re-election as House Democrats laid out in meticulous detail their case that he should be removed from office.In the first legal filings for the Senate impeachment trial that opens in earnest on Tuesday, the dueling arguments from the White House and the House impeachment managers previewed a politically charged fight over Mr. Trump's fate, unfolding against the backdrop of the presidential election campaign.They presented the legal strategies both sides are likely to employ during the third presidential impeachment trial in American history. They also vividly illustrated how the proceeding is almost certain to rekindle feuding over the 2016 election that has barely subsided during Mr. Trump's tenure, and reverberate -- whether he is convicted or acquitted -- in an even more brutal electoral fight in November.In a 46-page trial memorandum, and additional 60-page statement of facts, the House impeachment managers asserted that beginning in the spring, Mr. Trump undertook a corrupt campaign to enlist a foreign government to help him win the 2020 election. He did so, the Democrats argued, by pressuring Ukraine to publicly announce investigations of his political rivals, withholding as leverage vital military aid and a White House meeting for the country's president.The president then sought to conceal those actions from Congress, they said, posing ""a serious danger to our constitutional checks and balances"" by ordering administration officials not to testify or turn over documents requested by a House impeachment inquiry.""President Trump's conduct is the framers' worst nightmare,"" wrote the seven Democratic managers, led by Representative Adam B. Schiff of California.In a six-page filing formally responding to the House impeachment charges submitted shortly after and filled with partisan barbs against House Democrats, Mr. Trump's lawyers denounced the case as constitutionally and legally invalid, and driven purely by a desire to hurt Mr. Trump in the 2020 election.""The articles of impeachment submitted by House Democrats are a dangerous attack on the right of the American people to freely choose their president,"" they said in the response, which was Mr. Trump's first legal submission in the impeachment proceeding, ahead of a fuller brief that is due on Monday. ""This is a brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election and interfere with the 2020 election, now just months away.""The president's lawyers did not deny any of the core facts underlying Democrats' charges, conceding what considerable evidence and testimony in the House has shown: that he withheld $391 million in aid and a White House meeting from Ukraine and asked the country's president to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter Biden.But they said Mr. Trump broke no laws and was acting entirely appropriately and within his powers when he did so, echoing his repeated protestations of his own innocence. They argued that he was not seeking political advantage, but working to root out corruption in Ukraine.""President Trump categorically and unequivocally denies each and every allegation in both articles of impeachment,"" wrote Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, and Jay Sekulow, Mr. Trump's personal lawyer.The managers' filing repeated many of the same arguments they laid out last fall in a report on the findings of their two-month impeachment inquiry. But it also indicated that they intended to make use of information that has come to light since the House's impeachment vote in December.They cited new documentary records handed over by Lev Parnas, an associate of the president's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani, about the pressure campaign on Ukraine, and a Government Accountability Office report released this week that found that Mr. Trump violated the law when he withheld the military aid.And though the House ultimately declined to bring charges based on the special counsel's Russia investigation, Saturday's filing indicates the managers are also poised to reprise its findings as they argue that Mr. Trump's behavior toward Ukraine fits a pattern that poses a continuing threat to American elections. They argued that, just as Mr. Trump welcomed interference on his behalf from Russia in the 2016 election and then sought to thwart a federal investigation into the matter, he solicited Ukrainian assistance in the 2020 contest and then obstructed Congress's ability to investigate.The nation's founders, the House Democrats said in their brief, ""designed impeachment as the remedy for such misconduct because a president who manipulates U.S. elections to his advantage can avoid being held accountable by the voters through those same elections.""They called Mr. Trump's attempt to get Ukraine to discredit his political adversaries ""part of an ongoing pattern of misconduct for which the president is unrepentant.""The president, who spent Saturday at his golf course in West Palm Beach, Fla., has made no secret of his disdain for the House's charges and its inquiry. He has repeatedly professed his total innocence in general terms, and specifically insisted that a July phone call in which he pressed President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden and other Democrats was ""perfect.""But when invited to take part in the proceedings or mount a defense before the House Judiciary Committee, he refused. The closest the president's lawyers had come to weighing in on the case was an eight-page letter to House Democrats in October in which they unequivocally refused to furnish any documents or allow any witnesses to testify.Like that letter, Mr. Trump's answer to the Senate on Saturday was heavy with political messaging even as it asserted broad constitutional principles and general legal arguments to proclaim the president's innocence.In a statement later in the evening, the House managers criticized the claim by the president's legal team that the pressure on Ukraine was just Mr. Trump's way of fighting corruption.""It is not,"" the Democratic lawmakers wrote. ""Rather it is corruption itself, naked, unapologetic and insidious.""The defense filing was far shorter than the House managers' memorandum, but White House lawyers have until noon on Monday to produce a more comprehensive legal brief laying out the case they will make on the floor of the Senate.The House can then submit a written rebuttal by Tuesday. If all goes according to plan, the managers will begin live presentations in the Senate on Wednesday, and under an expedited schedule being contemplated by Senate Republicans, the president's team could begin its presentation on Friday.The defense filing on Saturday argued that Mr. Trump ""has not in any way abused the powers of the presidency,"" and that the July 25 call between Mr. Trump and the president of Ukraine was ""perfectly legal, entirely appropriate, and taken in furtherance of our national interest.""The arguments by Mr. Trump's lawyers tracked closely with those presented throughout the House inquiry by Republicans in that chamber, like Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mark Meadows of North Carolina, who did not dispute what had occurred so much as the idea that the president had been acting on some corrupt scheme.The document appeared intended to appeal to Mr. Trump's sensibilities. It accused Mr. Schiff of ""creating a fraudulent version"" of the July 25 call when he jokingly offered a hypothetical conversation during a congressional hearing, something that Mr. Trump has repeatedly mocked Mr. Schiff for doing.As they have said for weeks, the president's lawyers asserted that the articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump are ""invalid on their face"" because they do not accuse the president of breaking any law.But the Democrats argued in their memorandum that impeachable actions ""need not be indictable offenses,"" a theory that has been espoused by many legal scholars. The framers of the Constitution, they argued, intended the remedy for ""acts committed by public officials that inflict severe harm on the constitutional order.""The president's legal team also rejected the charge that Mr. Trump is guilty of obstruction of Congress. They argued that Mr. Trump's attempts to prevent witnesses from testifying in what the president has called a ""sham"" impeachment inquiry is a legitimate exercise of executive privilege that is essential to guard the authority and prerogatives of the presidency.The House concluded that Mr. Trump's claims of ""absolute immunity"" or other privileges on behalf of 12 officials and his decision to block the delivery of documents amounted to flagrant obstruction. The president's lawyers made clear that they disagreed, saying that ""asserting valid constitutional privileges and immunities cannot be an impeachable offense.""The president's lawyers also accused Congress of denying Mr. Trump due process during the impeachment proceedings, including ""the right to have counsel present, the right to cross-examine witnesses and the right to present evidence.""While the president's lawyers were not allowed to attend closed-door depositions of some witnesses, Republican allies of the president attended every interview and asked questions, according to transcripts of the sessions.The president rejected Democratic offers to present evidence, question witnesses or otherwise mount a defense during hearings before the House Judiciary Committee.Mr. Cipollone and Mr. Sekulow will lead the president's defense at trial. The White House announced Friday that the team would also include Ken Starr, the former independent counsel whose investigation of President Bill Clinton led to his impeachment, Robert W. Ray, who succeeded Mr. Starr, and Alan Dershowitz, a celebrity defense lawyer.Maggie Haberman contributed reporting from New York.PhotographPresident Trump traveled to Florida for the weekend ahead of his Senate trial, which opens Tuesday.

| Jump to first hitA president who has survived one revelation after another the last three years now faces perhaps the most serious disclosure of his political career at the very moment he is on trial in the Senate.WASHINGTON -- In another time, in another Washington, this might be the moment that changed the trajectory of the presidency. A former national security adviser confirms that the president, despite his denials, conditioned security aid to a war-torn ally on its cooperation against his domestic rivals, the issue at the heart of his ongoing impeachment trial.At first glance, John R. Bolton's account of President Trump's private remarks sounded like an echo of the so-called smoking gun tape that proved President Richard M. Nixon really had orchestrated the Watergate cover-up and ultimately forced him from office. By the end of Monday, the revelation appeared to make it more likely that the Senate will agree to hear witnesses at the trial.But this is Mr. Trump's era and Mr. Trump's Washington, and the old rules do not always apply anymore. The reality show star who was elected president even after he was captured on an ""Access Hollywood"" tape boasting about sexual assault has gone on to survive one politically charged furor after another during his three years in the White House, proving more durable than any national politician in modern American history.So will this be a Watergate-style turning point or just one more disclosure that his critics consider validation without changing other minds? Will it be another smoking gun or another ""Access Hollywood""?The news of Mr. Bolton's account in an unpublished book, first reported by The New York Times, could hardly have come at a worse time for Mr. Trump, just as his lawyers opened his defense on the Senate floor and days before the senators will vote on witnesses like Mr. Bolton.Even as stunned and, in some cases, irritated Republican senators scrambled to figure out what to do, the president's lawyers pointedly ignored Mr. Bolton's book when they addressed the Senate on Monday, repeating their claim that Mr. Trump suspended $391 million in security aid to Ukraine to tackle corruption and force more European support for the former Soviet republic, not to leverage foreign help incriminating his Democratic rivals.Directly contradicting Mr. Bolton's account, Michael Purpura, a deputy White House counsel, asserted that ""anyone who spoke with the president said that the president made clear that there was no linkage between security assistance and investigations.""By the end of the day, Alan M. Dershowitz, another lawyer for Mr. Trump, acknowledged the new account but told senators that ""nothing in the Bolton revelations, even if true, would rise to the level of an abuse of power or an impeachable offense.""Privately, though, the president's legal team braced for the possibility that the Senate would vote to call witnesses as they tried to defuse anger among Republican senators who felt blindsided. The White House knew what Mr. Bolton had to say at least as far back as Dec. 30, when he sent the manuscript to the National Security Council for standard pre-publication review, and yet the president's lawyers continued to promote a completely opposite version of events to the senators.In his book, Mr. Bolton writes that Mr. Trump told him in August that he wanted to continue freezing congressionally approved security assistance to Ukraine until its government helped with investigations into Democrats including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden -- exactly what Mr. Trump is on trial for.Mr. Trump and his defenders sought to undercut Mr. Bolton by dismissing him as a disgruntled former employee seeking to take revenge and sell books. Mr. Bolton abruptly left the White House in September after months of tension with the president over his policies toward North Korea, Iran, Afghanistan and Ukraine; the president insisted that he fired him, while Mr. Bolton insisted he resigned.Starting early Monday morning and continuing into the day, Mr. Trump fired off messages on Twitter rebutting his former adviser's account and attacking him as untrustworthy.""I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens,"" the president wrote. ""In fact, he never complained about this at the time of his very public termination. If John Bolton said this, it was only to sell a book.""He also reposted messages from supporters assailing Mr. Bolton and comparing him to others the president viewed as disloyal like James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director he fired in 2017. ""Just like James Comey, John Bolton is trying to get rich off a lie- and leak-fueled campaign to overturn the 2016 election results,"" read one of the messages the president retweeted.But Mr. Bolton is a hard witness for Mr. Trump to simply brush off. He is no liberal Democrat or deep-state bureaucrat, nor is he even a Never Trump Republican, but a conservative hawk with years of credibility among Republicans and a strong following from his days as ambassador to the United Nations and Fox News commentator. And rebutting his account is a president with a history of making thousands of false and misleading statements documented by fact checkers.Mr. Bolton's account on its face seems to eviscerate a central part of the defense that the White House began presenting Saturday on the Senate floor. The president's lawyers hammered House Democrats for relying on secondhand testimony and argued that no witness had come forward to say Mr. Trump had explicitly linked the aid to the investigations.In their trial brief, the president's lawyers wrote: ""Not a single witness with actual knowledge ever testified that the president suggested any connection between announcing investigations and security assistance. Assumptions, presumptions and speculation based on hearsay are all that House Democrats can rely on to spin their tale of a quid pro quo.""The House managers prosecuting Mr. Trump said that underestimated the strength of their evidence, but either way, Mr. Bolton's recollection is clearly a firsthand account, not a presumption -- which at least some in the White House knew at the time the brief was filed and the presentation was made on the Senate floor over the weekend.Mr. Bolton has been one of the most intriguing figures in the Ukraine matter for weeks, ever since other former officials testified that he opposed the pressure campaign, calling it a ""drug deal"" he wanted no part of and warning that Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer organizing the pressure, was a ""hand grenade who's going to blow everybody up."" Mr. Bolton told aides to report the pressure campaign to a White House lawyer.Mr. Bolton has remained publicly silent other than to deny leaking his book and blaming its disclosure on the White House. House Democrats requested his testimony during their hearings last month, but they ultimately did not subpoena him, reasoning that a court fight would only prolong the investigative process for months.Once the House impeached Mr. Trump and the case reached the Senate, Mr. Bolton announced that he would testify if subpoenaed. But Senate Republicans voted against subpoenaing him at the start of the trial, putting off a final decision until after arguments are complete, which could come later this week.Another witness sought by the House managers, Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, has already publicly confirmed to reporters that Mr. Trump suspended the security aid in part to get Ukraine to investigate a conspiracy theory involving Democrats during the 2016 election campaign, although he later issued a statement retracting his comment.His lawyer issued another statement on Monday denying that Mr. Mulvaney ever talked with Mr. Trump or anyone else about a link between aid and investigations, even though the acting chief of staff previously said the exact opposite on camera. ""That's why we held up the aid,"" he said in October.As damaging as Mr. Bolton's account would seem to be, events of the last three years suggest it may not change the outcome. Several Republican senators on Monday dismissed it as nothing new.Mr. Trump has endured so many scandals that would have brought down an ordinary politician. Just weeks before moving into the White House, he agreed to pay $25 million to settle fraud claims against Trump University. Since becoming president, he repaid hush money given to Stormy Daniels, the pornographic film actress, to keep quiet about an alleged affair. Another woman has accused him of rape in a defamation lawsuit, and more than a dozen others have accused him of sexual misconduct.His son, son-in-law and campaign chairman met with Russians offering ""dirt"" on his opponent that they said came from the Russian government. A special counsel investigation identified 10 instances when the president may have obstructed justice. His family foundation was forced to shut down after authorities found ""a shocking pattern of illegality."" His businesses have benefited from foreign patrons with cause to curry favor with the president despite the Constitution's emoluments clause.Investigative reporting found that he engaged in dubious tax schemes during the 1990s, including instances of outright fraud. A wide swath of people around him have been convicted of various crimes, including his campaign chairman, his deputy, first national security adviser, longtime political adviser, longtime personal lawyer and others. And now Mr. Giuliani and a couple of his longtime associates are under federal investigation.To Mr. Trump's most fervent supporters, all of that is proof not that he is corrupt but that he has struck a nerve in Washington's ""swamp"" and that the establishment is coming after him, manufacturing ""hoaxes"" to tear him down. That unwavering support within Republican Party voters, which he telegraphs on Twitter regularly, has hardly gone unnoticed by Republican senators as they sit in judgment of him.But polls also show that two-thirds of the public wanted to hear from new witnesses in the trial now underway on Capitol Hill. Given the latest revelations, Mr. Bolton stands ready to testify with the fate of the president on the line.PhotographJohn R. Bolton spent 17 months as President Trump's national security adviser.

| Jump to first hitRepublicans want to cast President Trump's impeachment as a narrow argument over aid to Ukraine. Democrats want to describe it as part of a broader struggle with Russia.WASHINGTON -- When Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a curse-laden tirade to a reporter on Friday, asked, ""Do you think Americans care about Ukraine?"" he was getting at an essential element of President Trump's defense in the impeachment trial. White House officials are convinced that Americans are indifferent to what happens in the struggling former Soviet republic, and they may well be right.But the impeachment trial is about more than the fate of Ukraine -- and whether Mr. Trump sold it out for a ""domestic political errand,"" as his former adviser, Fiona Hill, put it so bitingly. To Democrats, it's about a president who undercut his own administration's stated goal of pushing back hard against Vladimir V. Putin's Russia -- the geopolitical challenge of a new, very different Cold War.It is one of those cases where the geography of the debate shapes the politics of the argument.As long as the president's lawyers can focus the debate on the narrower question of Ukraine, they can argue that the charges against the president focus on a foreign policy sideshow: how the president uses the spigot of American aid and attention to mold another country's behavior.""They basically said, 'Let's cancel an election over a meeting with the Ukraine,""' Mr. Trump's White House counsel, Pat A. Cipollone, said on Saturday, characterizing the Democrats' arguments as he opened the president's defense. Mr. Cipollone made the case that the Democrats are seeking to undo Mr. Trump's 2016 victory or fear that they cannot beat him in 2020.Yet the defense team's characterizations about Ukraine are also designed to make the impeachment charges appear to be on a fundamentally trivial affair, surrounding the treatment of a faraway country that, as Mr. Pompeo suggests, most people could not find on a map stripped of country names. (He challenged the NPR reporter, Mary Louise Kelly, to identify Ukraine, and she reported that she did.)That is precisely why the man leading the Democrats' prosecution of the case, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, focused so relentlessly on Russia last week.Mr. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, understands that Russia resonates in a way that Ukraine never can. His argument revives questions of whether Mr. Putin has some strange, still unexplained control over the American president -- which is why Mr. Schiff played the cringe-worthy tape of Mr. Trump's news conference with Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, in summer 2018. In his public statements, Mr. Trump appeared to adopt the Russian leader's self-interested theory that someone else was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee's servers in the last presidential election.""It's a breathtaking success of Russian intelligence,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""This is the most incredible propaganda coup,"" he continued, because ""it's not just that the president of the United States standing next to Vladimir Putin is reading the Kremlin talking points. He won't read his own national security staff talking points.""Cast that way, this is no argument over American aid to Kyiv, new details of which emerged on Sunday in an unpublished manuscript by John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser. Instead, the entire matter is part of a battle over Russia's use of Ukraine as a petri dish in disruption -- the place where Mr. Putin has experimented with seizing territory, undermining a hostile government and conducting cyberattacks that literally turned off the lights.And it is an argument over Mr. Putin's efforts to manipulate the 2020 election, at a moment when even Mr. Trump's own Department of Homeland Security says the Russians are already testing new techniques. By demanding that the new president of Ukraine investigate Joseph R. Biden Jr., the former vice president and a political opponent of Mr. Trump, and reviving theories that the Democratic National Committee's server is somewhere in Ukraine, Mr. Trump was essentially joining that manipulation effort, Mr. Schiff was saying.""The threat that he will continue to abuse his power and cause grave harm to the nation,"" Mr. Schiff said of the president, ""is not hypothetical.""In less partisan times -- say, when a presidential election does not loom -- Mr. Schiff's argument might strike a political chord, chiefly because it is the Republicans who, until recently, have been particularly hawkish about Mr. Putin's Russia.It is easy to forget now, but when Mr. Trump tried to water down sanctions on Russia two years ago, his own party pushed back so hard that new penalties for Moscow passed 98 to 2. (In one of the strange twists of history, one of the two opposing votes was cast by Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who is a leading contender to take on Mr. Trump in November.) In the House, the measure passed 419 to 3. Angry, Mr. Trump signed the bill, knowing any veto would be overturned.But the politics of impeachment are different than the politics of sanctions. So it is no surprise that, as the Republicans focus on Ukraine and the Democrats focus on Russia, both are bending the facts to fit their case.Mr. Pompeo, for example, has been known to pause his episodic blasts at State Department correspondents to make the legitimate point that it was the Trump administration that gave powerful anti-tank weapons -- called Javelins -- to Ukrainian forces, a step that President Barack Obama refused.The issue came up this weekend, as Jay Sekulow accused the Democrats of keeping that fact out of their 23 hours of arguments. ""Javelin missiles are serious weapons,"" Mr. Sekulow, the president's personal lawyer, reminded the senators at the trial on Saturday. He quoted the testimony of the two previous top American diplomats in Ukraine, including Marie L. Yovanovitch, who was recalled from her post last year, in one of the events at the center of the impeachment charges.The Javelin decision is the best piece of evidence that the Republicans have at hand that Mr. Trump has been willing to stand up to Mr. Putin. Almost everything else cuts the other way, leaving little doubt that in twisting the arm of the new Ukrainian government, Mr. Trump was not only pursuing his own political interests but also helping Mr. Putin's.Even before he was elected, Mr. Trump wondered aloud why the United States was helping Ukraine fight off the Russians. It made no sense, he argued in a March 2016 interview on foreign policy, his first extended discussion of his worldview as a candidate.""Now I'm all for Ukraine, I have friends that live in Ukraine,"" Mr. Trump said during the interview at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida golf resort. He complained that when the Obama administration moved to impose sanctions on Russia for its annexation of Crimea and ""was getting very confrontational, it didn't seem to me like anyone else cared other than us.""He added: ""Even their neighbors didn't seem to be talking about it. And, you know, you look at Germany, you look at other countries, and they didn't seem to be very much involved.""In fact, they were very involved and continue to provide aid to Ukraine to prop up its democracy and its economy while often complaining about rampant corruption. But in the interview, Mr. Trump made no mention of corruption; instead, he lumped Ukraine in with the many other examples he cited of nations that the United States supports while other countries freeload.The release over the weekend of a recording of Mr. Trump at a dinner in 2018 makes clear that the president understood early in his term that unless aid continued to Ukraine, it could be easily overrun.""How long would they last in a fight with Russia?"" Mr. Trump asked at the dinner.""I don't think very long,"" said Lev Parnas, the Soviet émigré who worked for Rudolph W. Giuliani in pressuring Ukraine. ""Without us, not very long.""What's missing from the record of Mr. Trump's manipulation of the aid to Ukraine last summer is any indication that he sought an assessment from the Pentagon, the intelligence agencies or his own National Security Council over whether suspending American help might, in fact, lead to the downfall of the Ukrainian government.And that, in the end, may be the most telling fact of all.If nothing else, what Americans learned from watching the impeachment trial over the past week is that Mr. Trump seemed to regard the conduct of foreign policy the way he has regarded any other policy: a chess move toward re-election rather than geopolitical advantage for the United States. Otherwise, there would be conversations weighing the benefits of restricting aid against the harm to American interests in countering the power of Russia.There is anecdotal evidence that many around Mr. Trump did in fact push back -- including Mr. Pompeo, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper, and the C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel. Their arguments were ignored until a whistle-blower's complaint made clear that the suspension of aid to Ukraine was about to become public.So far, not one has testified as part of the impeachment process or spoken publicly about what they told Mr. Trump about the potential consequences of his domestic political errand. It is a silence that speaks as loudly as the arguments made in the Senate.PhotographDefending President Trump, Republicans have cited Javelin missile sales to Ukraine.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump said his advisers would meet with lawmakers on Tuesday to discuss a potential payroll tax cut and other relief measures as fears of a recession mounted.WASHINGTON -- President Trump has spent the past several weeks dismissing concerns about any economic effects from the coronavirus and insisting that American companies and consumers are in no danger.On Monday, after stock markets suffered their worst single-day decline in more than a decade, Treasury yields reached new lows and oil prices plummeted, Mr. Trump said he was ready to act.The president said the White House would unveil ""very dramatic"" proposals to help protect the American economy from the coronavirus, including financial help for workers who don't get paid sick leave, tax cuts and targeted relief for industries battered by the virus, including cruise lines, airlines and hotels.The overture sets up tense negotiations with Congress, just weeks after the president was impeached by House Democrats and less than a year from Election Day. Democrats remain deeply critical of Mr. Trump's efforts to contain the virus and have suggested, at least for now, that they will move cautiously to help bail out the president's handling of the crisis.Democrats have expressed openness to certain measures of stimulus -- like paid sick leave and increased spending on safety-net programs like unemployment insurance and food stamps -- that could provide the building blocks for a deal with the president. And Mr. Trump's efforts could be aided by the fact that federal borrowing costs have fallen to rock-bottom rates as skittish investors in recent days have piled into safe U.S. government debt.Mr. Trump's decision to seek fiscal help amounts to concession by a White House that has ignored increasingly ominous predictions of the virus's economic effects, which have ranged from dramatically slowing growth in the United States to plunging the economy into recession.That threat was compounded over the weekend by Saudi Arabia's announcement that it would ramp up oil production, sending prices into a downward spiral and raising the threat of layoffs and shelved investments in the American oil industry.Mr. Trump and his aides had played down the economic threats as recently as Monday morning, when the president celebrated falling gas prices as ""good for the consumer"" while blaming the stock plunge on a combination of Saudi Arabia, Russia and ""fake news."" He also suggested fears about the virus were overblown, saying more people have died from the flu than the new coronavirus. ""Life & the economy go on,"" he tweeted.By Monday evening, after the stock market fell nearly 8 percent -- its steepest losses since the 2008 financial crisis -- the president had changed his tone, conceding that those dire economic warnings could no longer be ignored heading into an election in which he planned to tout the strength of the United States economy.""This was something that we were thrown into, and we're going to handle it,"" Mr. Trump said.He then tried to reassure investors that the economy was resilient.""We have a very strong economy,"" he said. ""This blindsided the world.""White House officials have known for more than a month that the virus posed a threat to public health and economic growth in the United States, but they have consistently said the economy would not need additional support to weather it. When asked about any economic fallout, Mr. Trump has put the onus on the Federal Reserve, saying it should cut interest rates and do more to stimulate growth.But investors have largely shrugged off the Fed's efforts. An emergency rate cut announced last Tuesday did little to mitigate the damage, as investors digested the economic ramifications of a virus that has shuttered factories, canceled travel and quarantined workers.A growing chorus of economists, many of them veterans of President Barack Obama's administration, have called for Mr. Trump and Congress to further support growth by injecting hundreds of billions of dollars into the consumer economy. Mr. Trump's team initially rejected such calls.Any large spending increases or tax cuts will require a deal with the Democrats who control the House and can block most legislation in the Senate. Leading Democrats gave Mr. Trump's new proposals a cool reception on Monday evening.A Democratic official on Capitol Hill said that party leaders did not like the idea of bailing out individual industries, like airlines, with targeted tax cuts. A spokeswoman for House Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee said they had not heard directly from the White House about the proposals before the news conference.""What was glaringly missing from President Trump's news conference was how he is actually going to combat the spread of the coronavirus and keep the American people safe,"" Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said in a statement. ""It seems President Trump is more focused on the stock market than addressing this pandemic.""Mr. Schumer called on Mr. Trump to propose a package that included ""ensuring tests and treatment are both available and affordable to all who need it and paid sick leave for all Americans workers, among other people-focused initiatives.""After Speaker Nancy Pelosi convened a meeting Monday evening with her top committee chairman to discuss the Democrats' response, Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, emerged to throw cold water on Mr. Trump's payroll tax cut, saying it was not ""what we need right now.""""What the economy needs right now is some stability and confidence that we're addressing the issue that is undermining the economy,"" he said. ""The president's answer for almost everything is a tax cut. We think we need to make sure that people, and health facilities and insurance companies and others, have confidence that they're not going to be bankrupted by this.""Vice President Mike Pence said on Monday that the relief measures proposed by the White House would ensure that Americans do not have to worry about losing their jobs or missing paychecks because of the coronavirus.Mr. Trump's comments came after he met with his economic advisers on Monday afternoon. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council, are expected to present the stimulus proposals to Republican lawmakers on Tuesday.Mr. Mnuchin said at the briefing that he had been having daily conversations with Jerome H. Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. He insisted that the administration would use all tools at its disposal to ensure that the United States economy was in good shape a year from now.""This is not like the financial crisis,"" Mr. Mnuchin said. ""This is about providing proper tools and liquidity to get through the next few months.""The Treasury secretary also raised the possibility of directing the Internal Revenue Service to provide tax relief to companies that are affected.""We're looking at alternatives at the I.R.S.,"" Mr. Mnuchin said, noting that tax payments would soon be due.A Senate Finance Committee spokesman, Michael Zona, said on Monday morning that its Republican chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, was ""exploring the possibility of targeted tax relief measures that could provide a timely and effective response to the coronavirus.""He added, ""Several options within the committee's jurisdiction are being considered as we learn more about the effects on specific industries and the overall economy.""Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Nicholas Fandos and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.PhotographVice President Mike Pence at a coronavirus briefing on Monday.

| Jump to first hitEmboldened by his victory and determined to strike back, the president removed Mr. Sondland as ambassador to the European Union after the White House earlier on Friday dismissed Colonel Vindman.WASHINGTON -- President Trump wasted little time on Friday opening a campaign of retribution against those he blames for his impeachment, firing two of the most prominent witnesses in the House inquiry against him barely 48 hours after being acquitted by the Senate.Emboldened by his victory and determined to strike back, Mr. Trump ordered Gordon D. Sondland, the founder of a hotel chain who donated $1 million to the president's inaugural committee, recalled from his post as the ambassador to the European Union on the same day that Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman, a decorated Iraq war veteran on the National Security Council staff, was marched out of the White House by security guards.The ousters of Mr. Sondland and Colonel Vindman -- along with Mr. Vindman's brother, Lt. Col. Yevgeny Vindman, an Army officer who also worked on the National Security Council staff -- may only presage a broader effort to even accounts with the president's perceived enemies. In the two days since his acquittal in the Senate, Mr. Trump has railed about those who stood against him, calling them ""evil,"" ""corrupt"" and ""crooked,"" while his press secretary declared that those who hurt the president ""should pay for"" it.Even as he began purging administration officials who testified in the House impeachment inquiry, Mr. Trump assailed a Democratic senator who he had hoped would side with him during the trial but did not and called on the House to ""expunge"" his impeachment because he deems it illegitimate.The flurry of actions and outbursts drew quick condemnation from Democrats, who said the president was demonstrating that he feels unleashed, and complicated the politics of impeachment for moderate Republicans who stood by him while arguing that he had learned his lesson and would be more restrained in the future.""There is no question in the mind of any American why this man's job is over, why this country now has one less soldier serving it at the White House,"" David Pressman, Colonel Vindman's lawyer, said in a statement. ""Lt. Col. Vindman was asked to leave for telling the truth. His honor, his commitment to right, frightened the powerful.""Colonel Vindman spoke publicly only once, after being ordered to under subpoena, Mr. Pressman added. ""And for that, the most powerful man in the world -- buoyed by the silent, the pliable and the complicit -- has decided to exact revenge.""Mr. Sondland took a more measured approach, confirming that he had been dismissed without offering any protest.""I was advised today that the president intends to recall me effective immediately as United States ambassador to the European Union,"" he said in a statement hours after Colonel Vindman's dismissal. ""I am grateful to President Trump for having given me the opportunity to serve, to Secretary Pompeo for his consistent support and to the exceptional and dedicated professionals at the U.S. Mission to the European Union.""Mr. Sondland and Colonel Vindman were key witnesses in the House impeachment hearings. Mr. Sondland, who was deeply involved in the effort to pressure Ukraine to announce investigations into Mr. Trump's Democratic rivals, testified that ""we followed the president's orders"" and that ""everyone was in the loop."" Colonel Vindman, who was on Mr. Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukraine's president, testified that it was ""improper for the president"" to coerce a foreign country to investigate a political opponent.It may have been untenable for them to keep working for a president with whom they broke so publicly, but the White House made no effort to portray the ousters as anything other than reprisals. Mr. Trump foreshadowed Colonel Vindman's fate hours ahead of time when asked if he would be pushed out. ""Well, I'm not happy with him,"" the president told reporters. ""You think I'm supposed to be happy with him? I'm not.""The president continued to assail lawmakers who voted for conviction, targeting Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, who bitterly disappointed Mr. Trump by sticking with his party. ""I was told by many that Manchin was just a puppet for Schumer & Pelosi,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. ""That's all he is!""Even as Mr. Trump flew to North Carolina to highlight his economic record, he called on the House to ""expunge"" his impeachment, an idea with no precedent or basis in the Constitution. ""They should because it was a hoax,"" he told reporters. ""It was a total political hoax."" And he accused Ms. Pelosi of committing a crime by ripping up a copy of his State of the Union address. ""She broke the law,"" he asserted.The president's critics had warned that he would feel unbound if acquitted, and some said the dismissals proved their point, quickly calling them ""the Friday night massacre,"" as Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, put it.""These are the actions of a man who believes he is above the law,"" said Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the lead House impeachment manager. Mr. Schumer said the White House was running from the truth. ""This action is not a sign of strength,"" he said. ""It only shows President Trump's weakness."" Ms. Pelosi said, ""This goes too far."" At the Democratic presidential debate in New Hampshire, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. asked the audience to stand in support of Colonel Vindman.The White House would not discuss the Vindman decision. ""We do not comment on personnel matters,"" said John Ullyot, a spokesman for the National Security Council.Donald Trump Jr., the president's eldest son, celebrated the dismissals, offering mock thanks to Mr. Schiff. ""Were it not for his crack investigation skills, @realDonaldTrump might have had a tougher time unearthing who all needed to be fired,"" he tweeted.""The president had every right to make the moves that he did today,"" Representative Lee Zeldin, Republican of New York, said in an interview. ""Moving Lt. Col. Vindman, for example, is a good move based on the fact that there is a lack of trust. He disagrees with the president's policies."" As for Mr. Sondland, ""the president can recall an ambassador at any time with or without cause, and in the case of Gordon Sondland, the guy was a hot mess, anyway.""Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, expressed no regrets over Mr. Sondland's dismissal. ""Somehow I think America will be able to deliver foreign policy without Gordon Sondland,"" he said by text message.Other witnesses have left with less drama recently. Marie L. Yovanovitch, the ambassador to Ukraine who was recalled from her post last spring because she was seen as an obstacle to the president's plans, retired last month from the Foreign Service. William B. Taylor Jr., who replaced her in an acting capacity, was essentially brought back early, as well. And Jennifer Williams, a career official working for Vice President Mike Pence, quietly returned to the Defense Department.Several had already left government, like Fiona Hill, the Europe policy chief at the National Security Council, and Kurt D. Volker, the special envoy for Ukraine, who resigned days before testifying. But others remain, including George P. Kent at the State Department, Laura Cooper at the Defense Department and David Holmes at the embassy in Ukraine.Mr. Sondland began discussions with senior officials about leaving shortly after he testified in November, according to two people briefed on the matter. He believed that remaining would be unrealistic given his role in impeachment and hoped to exit gracefully.A decision on timing was postponed until after impeachment, but on Friday, State Department officials told Mr. Sondland that they wanted him to resign, the people said. Mr. Sondland relayed to them that he would not step down amid what was clearly a purge of impeachment witnesses and that he would have to be fired, they said. In response, State Department officials recalled him.Colonel Vindman's brother seemed to be collateral damage. Yevgeny Vindman, who goes by Eugene, worked as a lawyer for the National Security Council and had no role in the impeachment hearings other than showing up to sit behind his brother when he appeared in November. He was given no explanation for his dismissal ""despite over two decades of loyal service to this country,"" said Mr. Pressman, the lawyer. ""He deeply regrets that he will not be able to continue his service at the White House.""Both Vindmans, whose White House tours were scheduled to last until July, will retain their Army ranks and return to military service. Alexander Vindman, who had been expecting the move and had begun removing personal items, was told he would go to the Pentagon before moving to the National War College in July as originally planned. Yevgeny Vindman was more surprised and was told he would report to the office of the Army general counsel.Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said service members who return to the military would be welcomed back. ""We protect all of our persons, service members, from retribution or anything like that,"" he told reporters.Mr. Trump, on the other hand, has made clear his personal antipathy for both Vindmans. ""Lieutenant Colonel Vindman and his twin brother, right?"" he said on Thursday during a rambling hourlong venting session at the White House, his voice dripping with disdain. ""We had some people that -- really amazing.""On Friday, Mr. Trump retweeted a message from a supporter advocating Alexander Vindman's dismissal: ""Vindman's behavior is a scandal. He should be removed from the @RealDonaldTrump White House ASAP to protect our foreign policy from his machinations.""Senator Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican who voted to acquit the president but expressed hope that he would learn a lesson from the impeachment, said witnesses should not be punished. ""I obviously am not in favor of any kind of retribution against anyone who came forward with evidence,"" she said in Maine, according to The Portland Press Herald.Colonel Vindman has been subjected to virulent attacks on his patriotism on Fox News and social media. The president called him a ""Never Trumper,"" a term the colonel rejected. Fox aired a segment suggesting his service in the White House might amount to ""espionage."" And Senator Marsha Blackburn, Republican of Tennessee, attacked him on Twitter: ""How patriotic is it to badmouth and ridicule our great nation in front of Russia, America's greatest enemy?""With impeachment over, Mr. Trump is debating additional personnel changes. Some advisers are encouraging him to part ways with his acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, who was involved in freezing security aid to Ukraine, which paved the way for impeachment.Other advisers are telling Mr. Trump to delay major changes until after the November election. Some hope that Representative Mark Meadows, Republican of North Carolina, will join the White House as a senior adviser. Mr. Meadows traveled with the president on Friday to North Carolina.Mr. Trump denied that Mr. Mulvaney would be pushed out in favor of Mr. Meadows. ""I have a great relationship with Mick,"" the president told reporters on Friday. ""I have a great relationship with Mark. And it's false.""Peter Baker and Michael S.

| Jump to first hitEven as the Senate prepares for the substantive start of the proceedings against President Trump, there are big unanswered questions. Here are some of them.WASHINGTON -- With President Trump's impeachment trial getting underway, Democrats are intensifying their demands for more testimony and documents that could add to the already voluminous evidence against him and bolster their case by shedding new light on several key questions.Despite the White House strategy of blocking testimony from top officials and rejecting demands for documents, the Senate will have in front of it various accounts of how Mr. Trump eagerly sought to persuade Ukraine's new president to pursue investigations into two matters that could benefit him in his re-election campaign. Those matters are dealings in Ukraine involving former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter Biden, and purported Ukrainian meddling in the American 2016 presidential election.But in part because of the White House's decision not to cooperate, the record of actions by Mr. Trump and his underlings is riddled with gaps -- and new evidence has been surfacing at the 11th hour. Testimony from Mr. Trump's senior advisers could illuminate how overt the president's efforts were, though it is unclear if that would persuade any Republican senators to abandon their defense of the president.On Sunday, Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and the lead House impeachment manager, said he was concerned that the C.I.A. and the National Security Agency were withholding information about Ukraine out of fear of angering the president.""The N.S.A. in particular is withholding what are potentially relevant documents to our oversight responsibilities on Ukraine, but also withholding documents potentially relevant that the senators might want to see during the trial,"" Mr. Schiff, Democrat of California, said on ABC's ""This Week,"" referring to the National Security Agency.Republicans called those complaints proof that the case against Mr. Trump was so weak that Democrats were scrambling to bolster it. ""But this, to me, seems to undermine or indicate that they're getting cold feet or have a lack of confidence in what they've done so far,"" Senator John Cornyn of Texas said Sunday on ""Face the Nation.""Even before new information emerged in recent days -- including material from Lev Parnas, who worked closely with the president's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani to seek damaging information about the Bidens and to impugn the United States' ambassador in Kyiv -- the Senate's 100 jurors faced unanswered questions that go to the heart of the matter.What exactly did John R. Bolton, then the White House's national security adviser, see and hear last year that convinced him a group of diplomats and aides were cooking up a geopolitical ""drug deal"" involving Ukraine?How often and how thoroughly did Mr. Giuliani, the chief engineer of the pressure campaign, brief the president on what he was up to? What has Mr. Trump said behind closed doors about his order to freeze military aid to Ukraine?Democrats in the Senate want to call Mr. Bolton to the stand, compel the testimony of three other top Trump aides, including the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and obtain the records that the administration has withheld. But they would need the support of at least four Republican senators to do so.""A fair trial, everyone understands, involves evidence,"" Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""Evidence would be documents and witnesses. We know the president has refused to provide documentation beyond the July 25 telephone memo. And he's refused to provide basic witnesses who actually heard what happened on that conversation and saw what happened afterwards.""Here are some of the key questions that more witness testimony or additional documents could address:To what extent did Mr. Giuliani act at Mr. Trump's direction and keep him apprised of his efforts?Some Trump allies have tried to suggest that Mr. Giuliani was a rogue actor pursuing his own interests in Ukraine. But Mr. Giuliani said last spring, as he planned a trip to Ukraine to press for investigations into the Bidens, that his efforts had Mr. Trump's full support and that the president ""basically knows what I'm doing.""Mr. Trump has called Mr. Giuliani a ""crime fighter"" who was ""seeking out corruption"" because he was ""very, very incensed at the horrible things that he saw."" He also said Mr. Giuliani had the right to look into whether the Ukrainians helped sow the seeds for the special counsel's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.Mr. Giuliani has insisted that his conversations with Mr. Trump are protected by attorney-client privilege. He has pointed out that Kurt D. Volker, then Mr. Trump's special envoy to Ukraine, put him in touch with a top Ukrainian aide whom he met in August in Madrid.Unquestionably, Mr. Trump sought to vest Mr. Giuliani with at least some informal authority to operate on his behalf. He urged President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, during a phone call on July 25, to consult Mr. Giuliani about the investigations he wanted. And he urged his own diplomats and aides involved with Ukraine to consult with Mr. Giuliani after they returned from Mr. Zelensky's inauguration in May.Among them was Gordon D. Sondland, the American ambassador to the European Union, who testified that Mr. Trump instructed him to ""talk to Rudy"" about Ukraine, and said that Mr. Giuliani had made it clear to him that he spoke for the president.In a letter in May from Mr. Giuliani that Mr. Parnas turned over last week to House investigators, the president's lawyer told Mr. Zelensky that he was acting with Mr. Trump's ""knowledge and consent."" Mr. Parnas, who faces felony charges involving campaign finance violations, said in interviews that Ukrainian officials met with him because Mr. Giuliani assured them that he represented both him and Mr. Trump.But virtually nothing is known about the substance of communications between Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Trump, although they appear to have spoken regularly. Mr. Mulvaney told associates that he would leave the room whenever the men would talk in order to preserve attorney-client privilege.Did Mr. Trump explicitly link the freeze of military assistance to Mr. Zelensky's public announcement of investigations?Whether the president decided to withhold nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine for his own political gain, at the expense of the nation's strategic foreign policy interests, is at the crux of the case against him. His decision thwarted the will of Congress, undercut an American ally enmeshed in a war with Russia and, according to a report last week by the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office, violated American law.During the House inquiry, Mr. Sondland testified that he had informed Ukraine that it would most likely not receive the aid unless it was willing to commit to carrying out the investigations Mr. Trump wanted. But he also testified that Mr. Trump insisted to him there was no ""quid pro quo"" -- although only after the aid freeze had become public and the president had been told about the whistle-blower complaint setting out details of the pressure campaign.Democrats in the Senate are seeking testimony from four other witnesses who played key roles in White House deliberations about the suspension in aid: Mr. Bolton; Mr. Mulvaney; Robert B. Blair, a senior adviser to Mr. Mulvaney, and Michael Duffey, the associate director of the Office of Management and Budget.The New York Times reported last month that many administration officials involved in carrying out the aid freeze were kept in the dark about the president's motivations.Mr. Mulvaney said at a news conference in October that the aid had been withheld in part because Mr. Trump wanted an investigation into a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine, not Russia, had interfered in the 2016 election. Mr. Mulvaney later said that was not true, and that the aid was withheld only because of concerns about Ukraine's willingness to battle corruption and about whether other nations were providing their fair share of aid to Ukraine.In mid-August, Mr. Bolton unsuccessfully tried to persuade Mr. Trump to lift the freeze. In an Oval Office meeting later that month, Mr. Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper asked the president to release the funds but were rebuffed.Mr. Duffey, a political appointee, enforced the hold on the aid after taking control of the funds from a career budget officer, Mark Sandy -- a highly unusual move.On July 25, after days of exchanges about the topic but also just 90 minutes after Mr. Trump and Mr. Zelensky held their fateful telephone conversation, Mr. Duffey reiterated to Defense Department officials in an email that no funds should be disbursed -- instructions he said should be ""closely held"" because of ""the sensitive nature of the request.""How much did other top aides know about the president's demands that Ukraine announce investigations?""Everyone was in the loop.""That was Mr. Sondland's characterization of who knew what about the push to win a commitment from the Ukrainians to announce the investigations. He testified that several top officials, including Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Mulvaney, knew that Mr. Trump would extend an Oval Office invitation to Mr. Zelensky only if Ukraine publicly announced the investigations.Fiona Hill, at the time the top Russia specialist on the National Security Council, testified that at a White House meeting on July 10, Mr. Sondland said that he had a deal with Mr. Mulvaney: an Oval Office invitation for Mr. Zelensky in exchange for a public statement that the inquiries were underway.Although the State Department refused Mr. Sondland's request for documents to support his testimony, he produced several emails to back up his assertions. On July 18, he wrote a group of officials -- including Mr. Mulvaney, Mr. Pompeo, Mr. Bolton and Rick Perry, then the energy secretary -- that Mr. Zelensky was ready to promise the president in their upcoming phone call that his prosecutors would ""turn over every stone.""Mr. Pompeo was among the officials who listened the July 25 phone call, in which Mr. Trump raised with Mr. Zelensky the need to investigate the Bidens and the 2016 election and Mr. Zelensky seemed to agree.In August, Mr. Sondland wrote Mr. Pompeo that Mr. Zelensky would deliver a public statement that ""will hopefully make the boss happy enough to authorize an invitation"" because it would include ""specifics."" That meant, he testified, that Mr. Zelensky would name Burisma, a Ukrainian company that had hired Hunter Biden, as an investigative target, along with the 2016 election.Did Vladimir V. Putin and Viktor Orban sour Mr. Trump on Ukraine?A number of State Department witnesses blamed Mr. Giuliani for Mr. Trump's animus toward Ukraine, saying they struggled mightily to counteract his influence. But there are indications that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary helped solidify Mr. Trump's views.Mr. Volker, the envoy to Ukraine, testified that the president's negative opinion of Ukraine was ""very deeply rooted"" and evident as far back as September 2017, when Mr. Trump met Mr. Zelensky's predecessor Petro O. Poroshenko in the Oval Office.One explanation is that Mr. Trump blamed the Ukrainians for helping to expose the financial misdeeds of Paul Manafort, who was forced to resign as Mr. Trump's campaign chairman in August 2016 and is now in prison for his crimes. In an Oval Office meeting on May 23, Mr. Trump insisted to his aides that Ukrainians were ""terrible people"" who ""tried to take me down.""But George P. Kent, a deputy assistant secretary of state, testified that Mr. Trump's view of Mr. Zelensky and Ukraine had darkened in the interval between that meeting and his first phone call with the Ukraine leader a month earlier, in which he congratulated him on his victory.In the interim, Mr. Putin reportedly disparaged Mr. Zelensky to Mr. Trump in a phone call on May 3. And Mr. Trump held an Oval Office meeting with Mr. Orban, who is antagonistic toward Mr. Zelensky. No transcripts of those conversations have been released. Mr. Kent attributed the shift in Mr. Trump's attitude to the combined influence of those two foreign leaders and Mr. Giuliani.Where were the White House lawyers?A group of government lawyers is charged with monitoring White House and National Security Council decisions for unethical or illegal behavior. The top-ranking lawyers involved in the Ukraine affair were John A. Eisenberg at the National Security Council and Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel.Two security council staff members -- Ms. Hill and Lt. Col. Alexander S. Vindman -- told Mr. Eisenberg they feared that Mr. Sondland was improperly pressuring Ukraine to benefit Mr. Trump politically. Ms. Hill testified that Mr. Bolton had ordered her to tell Mr. Eisenberg that he did not want any part of ""whatever drug deal"" that Mr. Sondland and Mr. Mulvaney were cooking up.According to people familiar with the situation, Mr. Eisenberg shared those concerns with Mr. Cipollone, his superior, but rejected Mr. Cipollone's advice that he bring them up with the president.Colonel Vindman also reported concerns about the president's July 25 phone call. Mr. Eisenberg warned him not to discuss the call with others and ordered that access be restricted to the reconstructed transcript. A person briefed on his actions said officials misinterpreted that directive as an order to put the transcript on the White House's most secure computer.Mr. Eisenberg eventually alerted the Justice Department to the July 25 call, but only weeks later, after the C.I.A.'s top lawyer informed him that a C.I.A. officer had filed an anonymous complaint about it.Ben Protess contributed reporting from New York.

| Jump to first hitThe president described the intelligence finding that Russia was meddling in the 2020 election, delivered last week to House lawmakers, as a partisan ""misinformation campaign.""LAS VEGAS -- President Trump said Friday that the disclosure by American intelligence officials that Russia was again meddling in a presidential election in his favor was merely another partisan attack against him, continuing a pattern in which he has sought to dismiss warnings of foreign interference in American elections.""Another misinformation campaign is being launched by Democrats in Congress saying that Russia prefers me to any of the Do Nothing Democrat candidates who still have been unable to, after two weeks, count their votes in Iowa,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Hoax number 7!""He was responding to reports of a classified briefing in which intelligence officials told members of the House Intelligence Committee that Russia was interfering in the 2020 presidential campaign to aid his re-election. Republicans on the committee challenged the conclusions and Mr. Trump berated Joseph Maguire, the outgoing acting director of national intelligence, for allowing the briefing to happen.Intelligence officials have also concluded that the Russians are seeking to help Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in the Democratic presidential primaries.At an afternoon campaign rally in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump continued with his accusations that Democrats were behind the reports and said they were trying to ""poison our democracy"" and were circulating ""vile"" hoaxes.""I was told a week ago,"" the president said. ""They said, 'You know they're trying to start a rumor.' It's disinformation. That's the only thing they're good at. They're not good at anything else. They get nothing done. Do nothing Democrats.""During the final event of a four-day swing through the West, Mr. Trump suggested that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia would prefer Mr. Sanders. Mr. Trump claimed, inaccurately, that Mr. Sanders ""honeymooned in Moscow."" And while Mr. Sanders did visit Yaroslavl in the Soviet Union in 1988 a day after his wedding, the trip was made to work out a sister-city relationship between Yaroslavl and Burlington, Vt., where Mr. Sanders was mayor at the time. In his 1997 autobiography, Mr. Sanders described the trip as a ""very strange honeymoon,"" but he and his wife went on a more traditional honeymoon a year later in St. Lucia, in the Caribbean.Mr. Trump, who has been cheerful in public and private about his re-election prospects, used the trip to raise millions from high-dollar donors and charm his political base at rallies in three states. And by returning every night to Las Vegas and holding his final rally there, he also tried to divert attention from Saturday's Democratic caucuses in Nevada.The president has visited every state that has held a primary or caucus so far this year, making trolling Democratic candidates a cornerstone of his campaign strategy.At his rally on Friday, the president called up members of the 1980 ""Miracle on Ice"" men's hockey team to take the stage behind him and waxed at length about his reality show ""The Apprentice.""""Speaking also of reality television: This is the greatest show of all time, huh?"" the president said. ""I have to get back to Washington and work. I feel guilty. This is too much fun.""Mr. Trump spoke for nearly two hours and fired the crowd up with a litany of claims about his accomplishments during his first three years in office, many of them exaggerated or misleading.During an extended discussion about the dangers of illegal immigration, Mr. Trump noted that ""illegal crossings are down 75 percent from last spring."" He did not mention that the decrease followed a huge surge in border apprehensions on his watch, leaving the number about where it was when he took office.Aside from appearing unbound and ebullient on the campaign trail, Mr. Trump also used the trip as an opportunity to take on some favorite targets, casting doubt on assorted institutions at every turn.He voiced his suspicions about Saturday's Nevada caucuses, comparing it to the disastrous ones held in Iowa earlier this month.""I hear their computers are all messed up just like they were in Iowa,"" he said.The president described members of the media as ""the most dishonest human beings in the world"" and accused law enforcement of harboring ""dirty cops.""He also repeatedly joked with the crowd that he would stay president longer than two terms, a comment he has made at other events.Mr. Trump has a long history of dismissing the assessments made by intelligence agencies that he has deemed unfair or unflattering.Multiple agencies have determined that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, and, before the 2018 midterms, delivered warnings that Russia was prepared to do it again. Early in his presidency, Mr. Trump grudgingly accepted those assessments before falling back on personal assurances from Mr. Putin.""He said he didn't meddle,"" Mr. Trump said in November 2017. ""I asked him again. You can only ask so many times. Every time he sees me, he says, 'I didn't do that.' And I believe, I really believe, that when he tells me that, he means it.""Since then, Mr. Trump, with the assistance of his Justice Department, has moved to retaliate against the intelligence community rather than Mr. Putin. A federal prosecutor is scrutinizing how intelligence officials assessed Russia's 2016 election interference, targeting the former C.I.A. director John O. Brennan in particular.Mr. Trump's anger at the intelligence assessment delivered on Feb. 13 to lawmakers was magnified by the presence at the briefing of Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, who is the chairman of the Intelligence Committee and played a lead role in the impeachment proceedings against Mr. Trump.The president's decision to remove Mr. Maguire and install Richard Grenell, the ambassador to Germany and a fervent loyalist, was also seen as a direct outcome of the briefing.On Thursday evening, Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One that Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, an ally and a vocal opponent of impeachment, was one of the candidates under consideration as a permanent successor. By Friday morning, Mr. Collins said he was not interested.""This is not a job that interests me; at this time, it's not one that I would accept because I'm running a Senate race down here in Georgia,"" Mr. Collins said in an interview on Fox News. Mr. Trump then wrote on Twitter that he had a list of four candidates to succeed Mr. Grenell, and that he would make his decision in the coming weeks.Michael D. Shear and Linda Qiu contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographPresident Trump brushed off an intelligence finding about Russian election interference as a partisan attack against him.

| Jump to first hitSchool superintendents, sports commissioners, college presidents, governors and business owners have taken it upon themselves to shut down much of American life without clear guidance from the president.WASHINGTON -- As he confronts the most serious crisis of his tenure, President Trump has been assertive in closing borders to many outsiders, one of his favorite policies. But within the United States, as the coronavirus spreads from one community to another, he has been more follower than leader.While he presents himself as the nation's commanding figure, Mr. Trump has essentially become a bystander as school superintendents, sports commissioners, college presidents, governors and business owners across the country take it upon themselves to shut down much of American life without clear guidance from the president.For weeks, he resisted telling Americans to cancel or stay away from large gatherings, reluctant even on Thursday to call off his own campaign rallies even as he grudgingly acknowledged he would probably have to. Instead, it fell to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the government's most famous scientist, to say publicly what the president would not, leading the nation's basketball, hockey, soccer and baseball leagues in just 24 hours to suspend play and call off tournaments.Mayors and county executives, hospital executives and factory owners received no further direction from the president as he talked about the virus in the Oval Office on Thursday than they did during his prime-time address to the nation the night before. Beyond travel limits and wash-your-hands reminders, Mr. Trump has left it to others to set the course in combating the pandemic and has indicated he was in no rush to take further action.""If I need to do something, I'll do it,"" the president told reporters on Thursday. ""I have the right to do a lot of things that people don't even know about."" But he again emphasized that the crisis was not as bad as many imagine. ""Compared to other places, we are in really good shape,"" he said, ""and we want to keep it that way.""By contrast, Leo Varadkar, the visiting prime minister of Ireland sitting next to him, said that as of Friday, his country was closing all schools and banning indoor gatherings of more than 100 people and outdoor gatherings of more than 500 -- the kind of measures that some American states and cities are taking on their own rather than wait for the president.Mr. Trump had no hesitance to kibbitz from the side before he became president, assailing President Barack Obama for not doing enough to stop Ebola, for instance. But his own White House has separated into camps of those who think the administration needs to be doing more and those who share -- and reinforce -- Mr. Trump's own view that the news media is overreacting to and creating a panic around the coronavirus.After feeling besieged by enemies for three years, Mr. Trump and some of his advisers view so many issues through the lens of political warfare -- assuming that criticism is all about point scoring -- that it has become hard to see what is real and what is not, according to people around the president. Even when others with Mr. Trump's best interests at heart disagree, they find it hard to penetrate what they see as the bubble around him.Thomas P. Bossert, a former homeland security adviser to Mr. Trump, has tried repeatedly in recent days to be patched through to the president or Vice President Mike Pence to warn them just how dire the coronavirus pandemic really is, only to be blocked by White House officials, according to two people familiar with the events. It left him to try to get the president's -- and the public's -- attention through newspaper op-ed articles, television appearances and Twitter messages like the one that panned Mr. Trump's Europe travel ban as ""poor use of time & energy.""Mr. Bossert, who has publicly warned that as many as 500,000 Americans may ultimately die of the coronavirus, denied on Thursday that he had tried to see Mr. Trump and been unable to, but would not elaborate on his contacts with the White House. Some officials there also denied that he had made extensive efforts to speak with Mr. Trump or Mr. Pence.Among the advisers who share the president's more jaundiced view is his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who considers the problem more about public psychology than a health reality, according to people who have spoken with him. Mr. Kushner has gotten more involved in the response in recent days, according to three White House advisers. A person close to Mr. Kushner said his views were being misinterpreted, and that he was focused on trying to find answers to the most immediate measures to mitigate the virus's spread.Marc Short, Mr. Pence's chief of staff, approached Mr. Kushner on Monday about integrating the White House teams working on the issue, as the vice president's communications shop is overrun with media requests and the White House is changing the chief of staff. After that, Mr. Kushner seized more of a role, spending Wednesday with Mr. Trump, the officials said.One administration official said on Thursday that Mr. Kushner, his wife, Ivanka Trump, and Hope Hicks, a presidential adviser who has just returned to the White House, favored Mr. Trump giving Wednesday night's prime-time address to calm the waters amid rampaging uncertainty and fear.Ms. Trump, the president's eldest daughter, in particular favored the address, according to three administration officials. But the subject quickly became contentious internally, according to several administration officials. Drafts were written and rewritten, beginning around 5 p.m., with Mr. Kushner seen as in charge as the president's chief speechwriter, Stephen Miller, wrote, and the communications office of the West Wing left out of the discussions.By early evening, only two hours before the camera was to go on, it was still not entirely clear what Mr. Trump was going to say. In a meeting in the Cabinet Room, a number of top officials told the president the speech was a good idea, with a notable exception being the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, who said that Mr. Trump ought to wait at least a day or two so as to provide officials with more information. The president told aides gathered in the room, who disagreed on exactly how far he should go in terms of a travel ban from Europe, to come up with something and bring it to him, according to a person with direct knowledge of the events.The health experts were either supportive of or neutral about a proposed ban on some European travelers, even as Mr. Mnuchin disagreed, and so the plan moved forward, with other items -- like more specific recommendations for schools and crowds -- left unmentioned.When the camera turned on, the president appeared uncomfortable, reading words from the teleprompter in a stiff manner that made no emotional connection to a television audience of millions scared about a virus they cannot see and uncertain about a society rapidly transforming around them.Even with the text on the screen, the president mischaracterized his own policies in a way that required his administration to correct him afterward. Administration officials said there were two errors in the teleprompter text, and one that Mr. Trump garbled as he read it, adding the word ""only"" in a sentence that was intended to say the ban did not apply to trade and cargo, a line that spooked markets.He referred to the pandemic as a ""foreign virus"" that ""will not have a chance against us"" as if it were a hostile nation to be defeated on the battlefield. But while he talked about measures to prop up the economy, he did not discuss the troubles with the availability of testing kits or express understanding of the changes in everyday life affecting so many Americans.Some close aides did not think the errors in the speech were particularly significant. By Thursday morning, it was clear that the speech had not assuaged the financial markets, which plummeted another 10 percent, the worst single day since Black Monday in 1987. Together with the losses of recent weeks, the markets have now erased about 85 percent of the gains of the entire Trump presidency, gains that were the foundation of his argument for re-election.""Real leadership in this crisis is going to have to come from governors, from public health officials and from institutional leaders,"" Rod Dreher wrote on The American Conservative's website. ""We saw tonight that even when Trump is trying to be on his best behavior, he just doesn't have much of a clue about the nature of the crisis, or how it can best be fought.""Others were more willing to give him some benefit of the doubt. Rich Lowry, the editor of National Review, which had just harshly criticized the president's ""failures of leadership"" in handling the outbreak, saw some progress in the speech even as he expressed concern that it would not last.""The speech represents a marked, welcome improvement in the president's rhetoric,"" he wrote, ""but that won't matter if he goes out and undercuts it tomorrow, and the ultimate verdict on his response will be rendered based on the results.""The Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial page likewise called the speech ""a step toward more realism"" but added that Mr. Trump was not forthcoming enough about the scope of the problem.Republicans close to the White House privately laid blame at the feet of Mr. Kushner. A person close to Mr. Kushner described that as unfair, saying that he was merely helping out and that it becomes easier to blame him when things are difficult. And in any case, a partial travel ban on Europe was a bold move that may have been bound to rattle the markets rather than calm them no matter what.The White House insisted that the president's actions have had the support of health officials, and that local communities should make decisions based on their own conditions. Aides said the speech demonstrated to Americans that Mr. Trump understands the situation and is determined to react strongly to guard their well-being.""The reaction has been very favorable across the country,"" Mr. Pence said Thursday on Fox News.Speaking on NBC's ""Today"" show, Mr. Pence agreed it was wrong to dismiss the outbreak as hype. ""Obviously there's been some irresponsible rhetoric, but the American people should know that President Trump has no higher priority than the health and safety and well-being of the people of this country,"" he said, without identifying who was responsible for the irresponsible rhetoric.As for Mr. Trump's call on Washington in his speech to ""stop the partisanship,"" that lasted just nine hours, at least some of which he was presumably asleep. By dawn on Thursday, he had already tweeted or retweeted attacks on Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi.Peter Baker reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York.PhotographThe president failed to express understanding in the changes to everyday life affecting Americans.

| Jump to first hitThe interactions between President Trump and Speaker Nancy Pelosi during the State of the Union address underscored the bitterness the move to remove him from office has caused.WASHINGTON -- President Trump claimed credit for a ""great American comeback"" in a speech to Congress on Tuesday night, boasting of a robust economy, contrasting his successes with the records of his predecessors and projecting optimism in the face of a monthslong Democratic effort to force him from office.Mr. Trump, who lamented what he called ""American carnage"" when he was inaugurated in January 2017, described a different country today, declaring in his third State of the Union address that the nation's future was once again ""blazing bright.""""In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American Decline and we have rejected the downsizing of America's destiny,"" Mr. Trump said in a speech that lasted 78 minutes. ""We have totally rejected the downsizing. We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never, ever going back!""""The state of our union,"" Mr. Trump declared, ""is stronger than ever before.""Welcomed by enthusiastic applause from Republican lawmakers, the president marched confidently into the same historic chamber where he was impeached 49 days earlier. Mr. Trump described the nation as enjoying what he called a ""blue-collar boom,"" fueled by trade agreements and his success in ""restoring our nation's manufacturing might.""On the eve of a Senate vote expected to acquit him, Mr. Trump never mentioned the impeachment inquiry that has threatened his presidency and consumed Washington. But his interactions on Tuesday night with Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who started the investigation by Democrats that has forever stained his legacy, underscored the deep bitterness between them.As he arrived at the rostrum, Mr. Trump turned to hand copies of his speech to Ms. Pelosi and Vice President Mike Pence. But when Ms. Pelosi offered her hand to shake, the president pointedly turned away without taking it.Seated just behind the president, Ms. Pelosi grimaced and shook her head several times during his address. Moments after Mr. Trump finished and was basking in applause from Republicans, the speaker ripped up the pages of his speech, holding them high for the cameras to catch her unmistakable statement of scorn.With the theatrical touches of a showman-turned-president, Mr. Trump surprised the wife of an Army soldier with the soldier's return home from battle, highlighted the story of a 100-year-old Tuskegee airman and his 13-year-old great-grandson, and -- in a remarkable moment -- awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to Rush Limbaugh, the combative conservative talk radio host and for decades a villain to the left.Standing next to Mr. Limbaugh, who recently learned he has advanced lung cancer, Melania Trump, the first lady, draped the medal around his neck as Mr. Trump thanked him for ""decades of tireless devotion to our country.""As the president fights for a second term in an election that will require him to broaden his appeal, he boasted of increasing funding for historically black colleges and singled out several African-Americans in the House chamber for praise, a striking departure for a president who derided African nations as ""shithole countries"" and repeatedly criticized the city of Baltimore, represented at the time by one of the nation's leading black politicians, Representative Elijah E. Cummings, who died last year.At the same time, Mr. Trump used the speech as a clarion call to his most conservative supporters, prompting some Republicans in the chamber to chant, ""Four more years."" The president also boasted that he was building ""a long, tall and very powerful wall"" across the southwestern border and vowed to oppose what he called a ""socialist takeover"" of the health care system by Democrats in Washington and those running to replace him in the White House.""To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American health care!"" Mr. Trump declared.Even as he delivered his remarks, it was Democrats who were in disarray, still unable to declare a final winner in the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses. State officials said they expected to release more results later Tuesday evening in a botched election process that Mr. Trump was quick to mock online.""The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster,"" the president crowed on Twitter earlier in the day. ""Nothing works, just like they ran the Country. Remember the 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare website, that should have cost 2% of that. The only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is 'Trump.""'Mr. Trump was not the first president to face his accusers even as they try to remove him from office. In 1999, President Bill Clinton delivered his State of the Union address to Congress in the middle of his impeachment trial on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice stemming from a sexual harassment lawsuit. Mr. Clinton did not mention the Senate trial, then still underway.Like Mr. Clinton, Mr. Trump did not use the nationally televised address to reprise his daily rants about impeachment, his made on Twitter. Instead, Mr. Trump -- who is infamous for his rambling, invective-filled speeches at his rallies -- largely stuck to an optimistic, if not always bipartisan, script.The president did not unveil any major new initiatives, but called on Congress to pass bills to encourage school choice, lower prescription drug prices, provide a small amount of funding for neonatal research, ban late-term abortions and work toward improving the nation's roads, bridges and tunnels.As he has done each year, Mr. Trump focused a large part of the speech on immigration. He called on Congress to ban ""free government health care for illegal aliens"" and to pass legislation allowing the victims of crimes by undocumented immigrants to sue so-called sanctuary cities.The president described a ""gruesome spree of deadly violence"" by an undocumented immigrant in California and introduced the brother of one of the victims, Rocky Jones, who was shot eight times.""Our hearts weep for your loss,"" Mr. Trump told the victim's brother, Jody Jones, ""and we will not rest until you have justice.""The title of the president's speech was ""The Great American Comeback,"" a more formal slogan that combines the sentiments of ""Make America Great Again,"" the president's viral phrase from the 2016 campaign, and the more recent ""Keep America Great"" mantra that he has used to fire up crowds at rallies.In his speech, he bragged about significant economic successes, even ""though predictions were that this could never be done."" But his boast to have added 12,000 new factories overstated his claim to delivering an economic miracle to white working-class voters in the industrial Midwest.Employment in construction, manufacturing and mining combined grew more slowly last year than at almost any other point in the current expansion. Manufacturing employment growth slowed to less than 50,000 jobs for the year in 2019, the worst rate of his presidency and the second-worst of the long recovery from recession.Turning to trade, he said he had succeed in revising the North American Free Trade Agreement, something supported by many Democrats as well as Republicans.""Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace NAFTA, only to do absolutely nothing,"" Mr. Trump said, asserting the successes without acknowledging the more nuanced reality. ""But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises.""In the official Democratic response to Mr. Trump's speech, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan challenged the president's boasts about the economy.""It doesn't matter what the president says about the stock market,"" Ms. Whitmer said. ""What matters is that millions of people struggle to get by or don't have enough money at the end of the month after paying for transportation, student loans or prescription drugs.""Many of the female Democratic lawmakers attending the speech were dressed in white, symbolizing the suffragist movement and women's rights. Several Democratic lawmakers, including Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ayanna S. Pressley of Massachusetts, were not in attendance after announcing they were boycotting it.""I will not use my presence at a state ceremony to normalize Trump's lawless conduct & subversion of the Constitution,"" Ms. Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.While discussing national security, Mr. Trump celebrated in macabre terms two targeted killings he had ordered in recent months.He hailed the October raid leading to the death of the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, whom Mr. Trump called ""a bloodthirsty killer"" and whose demise he cast as justice for the murder of Kayla Mueller, a young American humanitarian worker kidnapped in Syria in 2013. Mr. Trump said that Ms. Mueller, whose parents he introduced, was ""tortured and enslaved by ISIS"" after ""more than 500 horrifying days of captivity.""The president also recalled with relish the Jan. 3 missile strike that killed the Iranian commander Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, a ""ruthless butcher"" who Mr. Trump said had ""orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women and children.""He cast Mr. Suleimani's death as another act of patriotic vengeance, recalling the Iranian's role in supplying bombs believed to have killed hundreds of American soldiers during the Iraq war, and telling the story of an American soldier, Christopher Hake, ""who made the ultimate sacrifice for his country"" when his Bradley vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb.And in a brief passage noting his desire to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, Mr. Trump assured that he was ""not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people"" in the country, ""many of them innocent.""The president introduced a parade of guests during his speech, including a 13-year-old boy with aspirations to join the Space Force and Charles McGee, his 100-year-old great-grandfather, one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen. Mr. Trump said he promoted Mr. McGee to brigadier general in a ceremony at the White House before the speech.In addition to Mr. McGee, the president highlighted the story of Tony Rankins, an Army veteran who fought back from drug addiction, and Stephanie Davis, to whom he granted an Opportunity Scholarship for her fourth-grade daughter, Janiyah, to go to the school of her choice. All were African-American.Mr. Trump also introduced the wife and son of an Army staff sergeant who died in Iraq by a roadside bomb supplied by General Suleimani.At another point, the president singled out Juan Guaidó, the leader of Venezuela's opposition movement, who received his most visible show of support yet from Mr. Trump: a seat in the president's guest box for the State of the Union.Many White House aides had hoped to have the impeachment trial behind them before Mr. Trump's speech. But as it turned out, his third State of the Union address was part of a remarkable political collision on the calendar: He delivered the speech a day before the final impeachment vote and a day after Iowans participated in the first voting of the 2020 campaign season.There is no question that the president will be acquitted on Wednesday by the Republican-controlled Senate, giving him the chance to claim vindication in what he views as an attempted political assassination by his enemies. But he will forever be the third impeached president in American history and only the first to ask voters for re-election after being charged with committing high crimes and misdemeanors.Set in motion last year by Ms. Pelosi after Democrats took control of the House in 2018, the move to impeachment was directed by House managers during a two-week Senate trial. It was built on damning evidence that the president withheld security aid for Ukraine and a coveted Oval Office meeting as leverage for investigations that could damage the political fortunes of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son, Hunter Biden.Tuesday was the second day that senators announced their judgments on the president's behavior, delivering speeches on the Senate floor. Notable among them were the condemnations of Republicans who accepted the truth of the accusations against Mr. Trump even as they said they planned to vote to acquit him.""The president's behavior was shameful and wrong,"" Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said Monday night on the Senate floor even as she denounced an unfair, fiercely partisan process and announced, ""I cannot vote to convict.""Reporting was contributed by Peter Baker, Jim Tankersley, Lara Jakes, Michael Crowley and Maggie Haberman.Peter Baker and Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.PhotographPresident Trump with Vice President Mike Pence and Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday night during the State of the Union address.

| Jump to first hitIn an extraordinary back-and-forth between a president and a congressman, President Trump warned that Representative Adam Schiff, the lead House impeachment manager, ""has not paid the price, yet.""WASHINGTON -- Representative Adam B. Schiff, the House's lead impeachment manager, accused President Trump on Sunday of trying to threaten him on Twitter and urged Republican senators to find the ""moral courage to stand up"" to a ""wrathful and vindictive president.""Mr. Trump, writing on Twitter Sunday morning, attacked Mr. Schiff as ""a CORRUPT POLITICIAN, and probably a very sick man,"" warning, ""He has not paid the price, yet, for what he has done to our Country!""It was an extraordinary back-and-forth between a member of Congress and a sitting president, coming at a turning point in Mr. Trump's impeachment trial on charges of high crimes and misdemeanors -- the third presidential impeachment trial in American history. Mr. Schiff's comments, on the NBC program ""Meet the Press,"" came as Mr. Trump's legal team planned to resume its defense of the president when the Senate reconvenes Monday at 1 p.m.""Look at the president's tweets about me today saying that I should pay a price,"" Mr. Schiff said on ""Meet the Press.""""Do you take that as a threat?"" asked Chuck Todd, the show's host.""I think it's intended to be,"" the congressman replied.Mr. Schiff has been under fire from Republicans for mentioning a news report during the trial that alleges that the White House had threatened to put their heads ""on a pike"" if they voted to convict. He doubled down on that claim Sunday, saying that he merely meant it would require fearlessness on the part of the senators.Once Mr. Trump's defense team wraps up its case, senators will have an opportunity to ask questions and then vote on whether to call witnesses or subpoena new documents. Unless at least four Republicans join Democrats to vote to expand the scope of the proceedings, the trial could wrap up as early as this week with Mr. Trump's expected acquittal.At least two Republican senators -- Susan Collins of Maine, who is running for re-election this year, and Mitt Romney of Utah, elected in 2018 -- appear to be leaning toward calling witnesses. But Mr. Trump, in an interview that aired on Fox News's ""Sunday Morning Futures,"" said doing so could be ""very bad"" for Republican senators who are up for re-election.""I think it would be very bad for the Republican Party if we lost that great unity that we have right now,"" Mr. Trump said in the interview, which was taped at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. ""Some of them are running, and I think it would be very bad for them.""Democrats have been pushing for four witnesses -- including John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, who wrote in an unpublished manuscript that the president conditioned security aid to Ukraine on investigations into Democrats -- over the strong objections of Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. Some Republicans are floating the idea of a witness swap in which they would call either former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. or his son Hunter Biden, both of whom Mr. Trump wanted Ukraine to investigate, even though neither has direct knowledge of Mr. Trump's behavior.Democrats have opposed such a move, and Mr. Schiff suggested on Sunday that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is presiding over the trial, should rule on that question.""We have a very capable justice sitting right behind me who can make decisions about the materiality of witnesses,"" Mr. Schiff said, adding, ""We trust the Supreme Court justice.""If history is any guide, Chief Justice Roberts will be reluctant to do so. When President Bill Clinton was tried in the Senate in 1999, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist used his authority sparingly, leaving most questions to the Senate to decide.Lawmakers on both sides -- along with Alan Dershowitz, a consultant to Mr. Trump's legal team -- took to the Sunday morning talk show circuit to make the case for or against Mr. Trump. The president was impeached by the House in December on charges that he abused his oath of office and obstructed Congress by pressuring the leader of Ukraine to investigate his political rivals and then covering it up by concealing evidence from lawmakers.Mr. Schiff and his team of prosecutors maintain that the president was trying to influence the 2020 election for his personal gain. During an abbreviated session of the Senate on Saturday, the president's team pushed back hard on that assertion, arguing that it was the Democrats who were trying to undo the results of the 2016 election -- and to interfere with the one in 2020.""They're asking you to tear up all of the ballots all across the country on your own initiative, take that decision away from the American people,"" Pat A. Cipollone, the White House counsel, said of the House managers, adding: ""They're here to perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in American history, and we can't allow that to happen.""Mr. Dershowitz, speaking on ""Fox News Sunday,"" backed away from an assertion he made in 1998, when Mr. Clinton was facing possible impeachment in the House, that a crime is not needed to remove a president from office. Mr. Trump's team has argued that he cannot be convicted or removed because he is not accused of violating a law -- an argument Mr. Dershowitz said he now agreed with because he had done more research.""I've been immersing myself in dusty old books, and I've concluded that no, it has to be a crime,"" Mr. Dershowitz said. ""That's what scholars do, that's what academics do. We do more research.""Mr. Schiff has emerged as a polarizing figure in the trial. His speech on Thursday telling lawmakers they could ""not trust this president to do what is right for this country"" went viral -- and earned even grudging respect from some Republicans. But on Friday, he invoked a CBS report that cited an anonymous source saying Republican senators had been warned their heads would be ""on a pike"" if they voted against Mr. Trump.In so doing, Mr. Schiff angered several centrist or swing-state Republicans -- including Senators Collins and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska -- who are potential votes in favor of having witnesses. The congressman said Sunday that he was not intending to offend.""It is going to be very difficult for some of these senators to stand up to this president. It really is. There's no question about it,"" he said. ""I don't want to acknowledge it in a way that is offensive to them, but I do want to speak candidly about it -- and if this weren't an issue, there wouldn't be an issue about calling witnesses.""Democrats on Sunday came to Mr. Schiff's defense. During a conference call with reporters, Representative Sylvia Garcia, Democrat of Texas and a House impeachment manager, said Republicans should be disturbed by Mr. Trump's behavior, not Mr. Schiff's.""If you look at this president and his behavior, he has done some very outlandish things, so it kind of surprised me that Mr. Schiff referencing a news report would be so offensive to them,"" she said. ""The president's behavior should outrage them to the highest degree.""Chris Cameron contributed reporting.PhotographRepresentative Adam B. Schiff, the lead House impeachment manager, said a tweet by President Trump was ""intended to be"" a threat against him.

| Jump to first hitA day after a deceptively edited video of him spread on social media, Joseph R. Biden Jr. cautioned that the Democratic nominee would be vulnerable to false information in the general election.ANAMOSA, Iowa -- As the Democratic presidential candidates fanned out across Iowa and New Hampshire on Thursday to address voters still scarred by President Trump's victory in the 2016 election, Joseph R. Biden Jr. argued that any Democratic nominee would be vulnerable to baseless criticism and disinformation in the general election.Mr. Biden's remarks in Iowa, at his first political event of the 2020 election year, came a day after a deceptive video of him circulated online, highlighting how campaigns are still struggling to combat false information on the internet.""You're going to see a lot more of not only my statements being taken out of context and lied about or altered, you're going to see whomever the Democratic nominee is, because that's how this guy operates,"" Mr. Biden said, adding that Democratic candidates would face unfair attacks from Mr. Trump ""if I were to drop out of the race tomorrow"" or ""if I were to drop dead tomorrow."" (There was no evidence that the video was connected to the president.)Mr. Biden's comment came in response to an event attendee who asked him about his ability to beat Mr. Trump, and also to clarify his remarks in the video, which had been misleadingly edited to wrongly suggest that Mr. Biden was making racist remarks. In fact he was emphasizing the need to change ""our culture"" around violence toward women.Still, the video spread rapidly on social media, amplified by many right-wing verified users on Twitter, including reporters at conservative news outlets, the former speaker of the Missouri House and Republican strategists, according to data compiled by Vinesight, a company that detects disinformation on social media. It is an online environment that alarms many Democratic voters who are gripped by anxiety over how best to defeat Mr. Trump.The president, who was impeached in the House of Representatives in connection with asking Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden, is comfortable only in a ""mosh pit,"" said Mr. Biden, who has faced months of false or exaggerated attacks from Mr. Trump and other Republicans.Still, he argued that the Democratic Party was in a far stronger position today to confront Mr. Trump than in 2016, noting support for the president's impeachment among some voters -- ""Hillary didn't have that advantage"" -- and saying that in the previous campaign, not everyone took Mr. Trump seriously.In response to the questioner, who also asked whether he was running a better campaign than Hillary Clinton had, Mr. Biden offered a wide-ranging answer and relitigated how Mrs. Clinton handled a debate after Mr. Trump was caught on tape bragging about making unsolicited sexual advances.He suggested that Mrs. Clinton could have changed the subject, pivoting to how she hoped to change voters' lives. Instead, Mr. Biden said, ""she did what every other candidate probably would have done"" by lacing into his character, yielding an ugly debate, and ""it all went down the drain."" Yet before that debate even started, Mr. Trump had invited several women who had made allegations against former President Bill Clinton to join him for a photo opportunity.Mr. Biden also noted sexism as he discussed the last campaign, which he called ""unfair,"" but added, ""That's not going to happen with me.""It was not just Mr. Biden who was ruminating on the 2016 election on Thursday; Mrs. Clinton's loss in the Electoral College was on the minds of other candidates as well as voters.At a campaign office opening in Plymouth, N.H., the entrepreneur Andrew Yang told voters: ""Donald Trump is our president today because he had a very simple message -- he said he was going to 'make America great again.' What did Hillary Clinton say in response? 'America is already great.""'""That did not quite work,"" Mr. Yang said. ""The problems are real. The struggles are real. Many Americans are being left behind. But Donald Trump's solutions were not what we need.""And Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, campaigning at a town-hall-style event in Concord, N.H., was asked by a voter whether she would work to unite the party around the Democratic nominee if it was not her. The voter noted how some supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont did not rally behind Mrs. Clinton in the general election against Mr. Trump.Ms. Warren began a lengthy answer by first committing to party unity: ""Every single person who is in the race for the Democratic nomination for president would make a far better president than Donald Trump,"" she said to applause.""I'm in all the way,"" she added, and started making the case for differences between the 2020 race and the 2016 campaign -- chiefly, in her telling, the palpably greater determination and intensity among Democrats to beat Mr. Trump.""What we have to remind ourselves is, 2020 is not 2016. The world has changed,"" she said, recalling the protest marches after Mr. Trump's inauguration and the Democratic victories in 2018 in the House of Representatives and key governorships, and in 2019 in Kentucky, Louisiana and Virginia.""We are getting stronger and we are in this fight,"" she said. ""2020 gives us this remarkable moment that is very different from '16 or '12 or '08 or however far you want to go back. This moment where Americans are off the sidelines.""Saying that ""the door is open a crack"" to an era of major reforms and the end of ""business as usual,"" she added: ""Think about it -- a nation that elects someone like Donald Trump is a nation that has got serious problems. Going back is not where we want to be. Our chance in 2020 is to look at that crack, drop our shoulder, run hard at it and build the America we want to be.""Asked for comment, a Republican National Committee spokesman, Steve Guest, said, ""Insulting half the country didn't work for Hillary Clinton in 2016, and it won't work for the Democrats in 2020, either.""Mr. Sanders, another leading progressive in the race, also waded into the debate over how to defeat Mr. Trump as he uncorked some of his fiercest criticism of Mr. Biden to date in an interview with The Washington Post.""It's just a lot of baggage that Joe takes into a campaign, which isn't going to create energy and excitement,"" Mr. Sanders said. ""He brings into this campaign a record which is so weak that it just cannot create the kind of excitement and energy that is going to be needed to defeat Donald Trump.""Mr. Sanders on Thursday reported an eye-popping fund-raising haul of more than $34.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, according to his campaign, ahead of Mr. Biden at $22.7 million -- Mr. Biden's strongest quarter to date -- as well as former Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind., whose campaign reported more than $24.7 million.Even as Mr. Sanders sharpened his attacks on Mr. Biden in the interview, he largely stuck to his familiar message on the trail in Iowa on Thursday, denouncing income inequality and championing his signature policy proposal, ""Medicare for all."" At a canvass kickoff in Grinnell, he jokingly named a young girl as his running mate.As he boarded his new campaign bus after that event, he briefly answered a question about his fourth-quarter fund-raising, calling attention specifically to the more than five million contributions his campaign had received since he entered the race. ""That tells me the kind of grass-roots support that we have and tells me why we're going to win the nomination and why we're going to defeat Donald Trump,"" he said.Reporting was contributed by Patrick Healy and Matt Stevens from Concord, N.H.; Sydney Ember from Muscatine, Iowa; and Nick Corasaniti from New York.PhotographJoseph R. Biden Jr. said at a campaign event in Anamosa, Iowa, on Thursday that voters were likely to see more of his statements ""being taken out of context and lied about or altered.""

| Jump to first hitThe president's speech was jammed with engineered moments and sweeps stunts -- and then came a cable-drama rip.It's no secret that Donald Trump, just months before he ran for the job of most powerful man in the world, was hosting Season 7 of ""The Celebrity Apprentice."" But not all his TV appearances as president have been as reality-fied as one might have expected, especially his sedate, from-the-TelePrompTer State of the Union speeches.The TV president made up for that Tuesday night with a dumbfounding, stunt-laden spectacle, less a presidential address than an ""Apprentice"" finale wrapped in an Oprah episode stuffed inside a viral YouTube video and dropped into the middle of a WrestleMania match.The speech was jammed with more twists and giveaways than a two-hour ""Survivor"" finale. President Trump awarded a young girl in the audience a scholarship. He had his wife, Melania, drape a Presidential Medal of Freedom around the paleoconservative shock jock Rush Limbaugh. He arranged a reunion between a deployed soldier and his wife, just like the surprise-military-return videos that TV morning shows love.And all these planned moments may have been overshadowed by a drama-filled, two-part installment of ""The Real Politicians of D.C.,"" co-starring his antagonist Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House. Before he began his speech, he appeared to refuse her offer of a handshake; after he finished, she ripped up her copy of it on camera.Neither of them, it seems, came there to make friends.For the president, the address had obvious political goals, coming amid the impeachment trial and at the beginning of an election year. But it also seemed built to make noise and get lasting attention amid a crazy-busy political news week.A State of the Union address, even in calmer times, is an evanescent thing. A president strikes a temporary tone, rattles off some aspirational proposals that will probably never materialize and the press polishes it off by noon the next day.This time, unusually, President Trump found himself sandwiched, like a network public-service announcement, into the space between two bigger political stories.Since Monday night, network news crews had been searching the haunted cornfield into which the results of the Iowa Democratic caucus had vanished. Hours before the speech, when cable analysts would normally be predigesting State of the Union nuggets, CNN's John King and MSNBC's Steve Kornacki were speed-swiping through a belated dump of caucus data.And the day after his address, the president had an appointment with predestination, as the Senate was scheduled for a Wednesday vote that would, barring shocking news or mass hypnosis, acquit him on impeachment charges.Indeed, if you've been following the impeachment saga, the State of the Union was like Washington's most ambitious crossover event, with not only the senator-jurors present but also Chief Justice John Roberts (whom Mr. Trump chatted up on his way down the aisle) and figures mentioned in the testimony, like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.The president, however tempted, never mentioned impeachment. Instead, he began with a long string of economic statistics and boasts. Congressional Republicans rose and clapped, sat, rose and clapped again, sentence after sentence, a P90X workout of election-year fealty. (They set a raucous tone early, chanting ""Four more years!"" in case you weren't clear on the subtext.)For well over an hour, Mr. Trump offered a preview of his re-election argument, a long list of superlatives followed by an effort to soften his image for swing voters, followed by rehardening it for his base.Several times, he spotlighted Americans of color as his guests -- the scholarship winner, an elderly former Tuskegee Airman whom he had promoted to brigadier general -- continuing an effort to broaden his appeal to minorities, or at least reassure white voters turned off by the demonizing of Mexicans, the insults of Haiti and Africa and the caging of Latin American children at the border.All this followed a Super Bowl campaign ad featuring an African-American woman that focused on criminal justice reform instead of appealing to his base -- which not long ago he stoked with attacks on black football players who knelt in protest during the national anthem.The speech also took sharp turns from sentimental to ominous, like the negative part of a campaign ad where the music turns scary and the screen shades to black and white. The president continued a long-running theme of connecting immigrants and violent crime, deploring sanctuary city policies for releasing ""dangerous criminal aliens."" (Studies in fact show that immigrants commit crime at a lower rate than native-born Americans.)Over all, this was oddly both the most and the least traditional State of the Union President Trump has given, a comfortable, familiar list of campaign arguments that then veered into sweeps-month theatrics. It took the decades-long tradition of presidential guest stars, which began when Ronald Reagan invited the hero of a plane crash in 1982, and amped it up for the age of reality TV.The production seemed designed in part to remind Americans of the munificent Donald Trump persona molded by Mark Burnett on ""The Apprentice"" for a decade. On that show, he was not just the tough-talking ""you're fired"" guy, but a dispenser of treats, rewards and mercy, who presided over celebrity challenges for charity and swept contestants off for trips to Mar-a-Lago and rides in his personal helicopter, like a pinstriped Santa.We can wonder what Mr. Trump's presidency would have been like if he had leaned into that side of his TV character from the beginning, rather than the shark from the ""Apprentice"" boardroom who fomented conflict, browbeat losers and relished fights. He certainly seemed more comfortable Tuesday in the mode of expansive, backslapping master of ceremonies than he ever has reciting his staffers' text from the prompter.But now, every stage-managed segment arrives in a context. His overtures to minority Americans come with his presidential history on race. Mr. Trump knows how this works; once upon a time, ""The Apprentice"" had a higher Q Score popularity rating with Hispanic and African-American than white audiences -- until he embraced the birther conspiracy against Barack Obama, whose legacy his address also worked hard to undermine.In a way, the structure of this State of the Union was a battle against context. It didn't construct a sweeping arc so much as try to generate clips to use online, in ads, on Fox News. Like much of President Trump's rhetoric, it was more movie trailer than movie, a series of blowups each of which sought to Etch-a-Sketch the memory of the last.But it may have itself been Etch-a-Sketched. It's possible that nothing in the speech will get more attention than the Great Pelosi Rip, custom-made to be transmuted into memes and draw cheers and jeers from partisans and inspire arguments among the agonizing-over-civility class.This is America's political style now, a product of the Trump administration as visible as a segment of border wall. Donald Trump argued that he has delivered America a lot of things -- and one of them, as the speech ratified, was the transformation of the presidency and public life into a 24-hour reality show.Tuesday night, he asked the country whether it wanted to renew this production for four more seasons.PhotographPresident Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday night, heavy on spectacle, came during a tumultuous week in politics.

| Jump to first hitWhen he secured President Trump's acquittal in the impeachment trial, the Senate majority leader completed a journey from staid establishment figure to conservative icon.GEORGETOWN, Ky. -- How has Mitch McConnell blessed the Republican Party? Let these Kentucky women count the ways.He refused to hold hearings on Merrick Garland, for one. And he stood by Brett M. Kavanaugh to the end.But for these seven Republican women, gathered for coffee on a recent Friday, the Senate impeachment trial revealed Mr. McConnell's leadership as the handiwork of the divine. ""I think it was a plan designed only by God that Senator McConnell was put in the position that he is,"" said Kathy Stocks, the chairwoman of the Scott County Republican Party.When Mr. McConnell, the majority leader and Kentucky's senior senator, secured President Trump's acquittal on Wednesday, he took to the Senate floor to extol the end of ""this precedent-breaking impeachment."" It was a final bow of sorts, the capstone of a yearslong metamorphosis from establishment bore to conservative icon.Even voters like Ms. Stocks weren't so sure about Mr. McConnell once upon a time, when Tea Party firebrands tempted them with visions of a new kind of Republican. But that was before the fate of Mr. Trump was at stake, before the fight for acquittal demanded a leader precisely in Mr. McConnell's mold.From beginning to end, impeachment has crystallized the symbiosis between the president's success and Mr. McConnell's clout. It's easy to see how the Senate leader has been critical to Mr. Trump's political survival. Perhaps less obvious, though, is the extent to which Mr. McConnell owes much of his new viability to Mr. Trump -- how his brand of staid ruthlessness has thrived as a counterweight to the brash, whim-driven style of the president.All of the things that once repelled many conservatives about Mr. McConnell have now become the foundations of his appeal. According to the Kentucky women, no longer is the 77-year-old lawmaker past his prime -- he is ""battle tested."" His likeness -- white, wrinkled, expressionless with a dash of smirk -- is not the aesthetic of a has-been; it is the portrait of ""stability."" And three-plus decades in office? Don't call him a career politician, just the ideal shepherd for the man who has never done this before.""He knows that he's not only representing the country as our Senate majority leader, but he is representing the president of the United States,"" Ms. Stocks said. ""And he is doing his best to make sure the president is taken care of the way that he should be.""Kentucky Republicans often discuss the president as if he were a child prodigy -- a virtuoso who, for all his ""genius"" and ""creativity,"" as one woman here put it, still needs a parent to drive him to the show.Enter Mitch McConnell. Constituents like Ms. Stocks may grimace at Mr. Trump's vagaries, the flurry of tweets that, before she turned the notifications off, would often wake her and her husband at 3 a.m. But they find comfort in knowing that when it comes to the president's actual agenda, Mr. McConnell is behind the wheel.Basha Roberts, 65, recalled an event in Kentucky after Mr. Trump was elected where she heard Mr. McConnell say, for the first time, ""We're working to make America great again.""""I knew then that he had bought in,"" she said, ""and could see all that he could do working with President Trump.""'We need someone like Harry Reid'The way Mr. McConnell complements the president cannot alone explain his now-widespread support in his party -- how it is that in the past five years, his approval rating among Republicans nationally has climbed to 68 percent from as low as 26 percent, according to surveys from Gallup and Quinnipiac University.At no point has Mr. McConnell fundamentally changed. For many Republicans, the difference today is that he is despised by all the right people.Ms. Roberts recalled watching one of the first Democratic presidential debates and realizing that the candidates had spent more time name-checking Mr. McConnell than they had the president. ""I called my husband in and said: 'Guess what? Senator McConnell is doing everything we want him to do,""' she said. ""'He's become what they're attacking!""'It is difficult to overstate the political currency of being labeled a ""fighter."" As Liam Donovan, a Republican strategist, put it, the only thing more universal than a party's desire for fighters is the belief that only the other side has them. This was particularly true for Republicans in President Barack Obama's first term, even after they installed John Boehner as speaker.""At that time, you started to hear grousing about how weak Republicans were, particularly Boehner,"" Mr. Donovan said. The prevailing line of thinking, he explained, was that ""G.O.P. leadership is always weak, and we need someone like Harry Reid who's willing to be strong.""Perhaps no leader in recent memory has haunted the Republican Party quite like Mr. Reid, the Senate majority leader from 2007 to 2015. Here was a man who appeared to heed Mr. Obama's call during the 2008 election, when he reminded supporters of ""the Chicago way,"" as immortalized by Jimmy Malone in ""The Untouchables"": ""If they bring a knife to the fight, we bring a gun.""For Republicans, the assumption of a knife may have seemed generous. Lawmakers like Mr. Boehner rose on the promise of legislative victories, only to have Mr. Reid ensure that most House spending bills never saw the Senate floor. While Republicans did manage to secure the occasional half-loaf, be it an extension of Bush-era tax cuts or the imposition of automatic budget cuts, it was never enough to dispel an underlying sense of futility. As conservatives saw it, government-funding negotiations inevitability ended in spending packages that largely took care of Democratic priorities, coupled with the image of a Republican Party that had yet again capitulated.All of which may have fueled the party's deep ""resentment"" for Mr. Reid and the left writ large, Mr. Donovan has written. But those feelings, he noted, were ""often tinged with envy, if not begrudging admiration.""Indeed, Mr. Reid helped entrench the perception that Democrats were willing to play hardball -- and, more important, that they were all willing to play hardball. There were no stragglers, it seemed, in Mr. Reid's party, no Susan Collinses or Lisa Murkowskis to fret over.The irony, of course, is that Mr. Reid's image as a craven conductor was in many ways the product of Mr. McConnell himself, whose relentless use of the filibuster often meant that Mr. Reid had to rely on party-line governance. But it was as if Republicans, in fixating on their opponents, had failed to acknowledge that the ruthlessness they craved in their leaders was already well at work.Some conservatives still invoke Mr. Reid's memory in this way. ""That's the problem with the Republican Party, there's not enough loyalty -- Democrats at least have that,"" Angela Carr, a 44-year-old Republican from Colorado, said at a recent breakfast hosted by the Denver G.O.P.""You don't hear a Democrat is a D.I.N.O.,"" or a Democrat in Name Only, she continued. ""You hear a Republican is a R.I.N.O.""A Supreme Court barricadeIt was hardly an hour after Justice Antonin Scalia's death had been confirmed that on Feb. 13, 2016, Mr. McConnell issued his career's most radioactive pledge yet: The Senate would not confirm a replacement Supreme Court justice until after the 2016 election.Senate Republicans fell in line. And they stayed there -- even after Mr. Obama nominated Mr. Garland, an appellate judge largely viewed as a centrist, and even as polls showed that Democrats were likely to keep the White House. In a speech in Kentucky that August, Mr. McConnell said that ""one of my proudest moments was when I looked Barack Obama in the eye and I said, 'Mr. President, you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy.""'Of the nearly two dozen Kentucky Republicans interviewed for this article, each one cited this moment -- culminating in Neil M. Gorsuch's confirmation to the Supreme Court -- as foundational to Mr. McConnell's now-hallowed place in the party. Yet for all the lionizing of Mr. McConnell as a ""statesman,"" as a ""man of principle,"" not one of them seemed bothered by his vow to ignore the so-called Garland rule should a Supreme Court vacancy arise in 2020. In May, when asked how he would proceed in that scenario, Mr. McConnell grinned. ""Oh,"" he said, ""we'd fill it.""Nick Nash, a 24-year-old ""hard-line conservative"" who lives in Louisville, was among the unbothered. In his view, Mr. McConnell was simply acting as the ""fighter"" that the Republican Party had long needed. ""The way D.C. is set up now, when you're in charge, you make the rules,"" Mr. Nash said. He shrugged. ""I think Harry Reid would have said the exact same thing.""For Republicans, the Garland example meant that Mr. McConnell's resolve to confirm Mr. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court in October 2018 was not so much exceptional as it was expected. ""He was not going to be bullied,"" said Dawn Alvarado, 52, a occupational therapist. ""And there are so many bullies.""Many also pointed to Mr. McConnell's role in confirming federal judges. ""Who has ever been able to appoint 187 judges to the federal courts in a president's one term?"" boasted April Hunt of Danville, Ky. Her husband, Howard Hunt, the judge executive of Boyle County, chimed in approvingly: ""Nobody.""Republicans young and old spoke of these judges as the ""safeguard for our future."" But young voters also praised their installment as the premise of Mr. McConnell's growing cultural infamy.Reclaiming 'Cocaine Mitch'On a recent Wednesday evening, Mr. Nash joined three other young Republicans for dinner at an Irish pub in Louisville. They laughed about how Mr. McConnell's opponents had tried in vain to demonize him. ""People"" -- as in ""the left"" and ""the media"" -- ""put these tags on him and think it's hurting him, but it's really only glorifying him,"" said Taton Thompson, 30, who is leading the recharter of the Kentucky Young Republicans.They reveled in their favorite nicknames for Mr. McConnell. There was ""Cocaine Mitch,"" given to him by a Republican, no less. ""Honestly, so many high school and college students thought that was like the coolest thing ever,"" said Addison Combs, 20, the chairwoman of the Bellarmine University College Republicans.And then there was ""Moscow Mitch,"" popularized by Speaker Nancy Pelosi after the Senate leader blocked election-security legislation, which Mr. McConnell's team appropriated as a beverage.""He's a bro,"" Ms. Combs concluded. ""He's a total bro.""Max Atherton, a 27-year-old finance director at a car dealership, who described himself as a ""Brooks Brothers Republican,"" echoed as much. ""It's ironic in a way that someone who is over 70 years old has almost kind of injected a bit of youth and jest into the Republican Party,"" he said.This is perhaps the unlikeliest manifestation of Mr. McConnell's leadership. Sure, the judges appointed during this time will figure prominently for decades to come. But in considering the less quantifiable ways in which the Senate leader has recast his party, one might return to that speech from May, when he said, without pause, that he would fill a Supreme Court vacancy this election year.Mr. McConnell's every move then seemed calibrated to enrage his opponents, to inspire some new macabre moniker. The sly grin, the casual sips of water. Yet it is precisely this aura -- call it ruthlessness, or shamelessness -- that has found purchase among conservatives, particularly young ones. Indeed, when a party's watchwords are increasingly to ""own the libs,"" grounded in a cold tally of victories over any discernible ideological framework, it is no wonder Republicans have found their fighter in Mr. McConnell.""He's somebody we can look up to,"" Mr. Thompson said.Democrats, of course, believe Mr. McConnell is the exact inverse of a political guidepost. But when the dust of the Trump era settles, and the Senate leader's legacy becomes clearer, if only on the scoreboard, their voters may decide that his is the model worth following.In July 2018, Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, was scheduled to have an event in Brooklyn. Travel issues stopped him from showing. His constituents, heat-frazzled and anxious about Mr. Trump's impending Supreme Court pick, criticized Mr. Schumer when he finally phoned into the venue.""We are in a gunfight and we have a butter knife,"" one person said.Then another constituent offered a complaint that, as recently as five years ago, Republicans probably never imagined they would hear: ""You've not played to win like Mitch McConnell has.""PhotographSenator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, on Wednesday after the Senate voted to acquit President Trump of two counts. (PHOTOGRAPH BY T.J. KIRKPATRICK FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES); Mr. Trump and Mr. McConnell at a rally.

| Jump to first hitAsk Republicans in the state what they think of Mr. Sessions, who is running again for the Senate there, and many will use the same belittling adjectives the president has hurled at him.HUNTSVILLE, Ala. -- It was another era, in another Republican Party. Jeff Sessions was a backbench senator from Alabama who defied the Republican president and doomed a bipartisan immigration bill with claims it would let terrorists and child molesters pour across the border.Donald J. Trump was working on the seventh season of his reality TV show ""The Apprentice"" and was still registered in New York State as a Democrat.Thirteen years later, after serving a brief and tormented tenure as President Trump's attorney general, Mr. Sessions wants his old job in the Senate back.But he is vexed by a bitter irony as he competes against several other Republicans in a March 3 primary. The Jeff Sessions of the past, who became a beloved figure on the right and helped fuel a populist brush fire that challenged Republicans over the very issues that are now at the heart of Mr. Trump's nationalist agenda, is a distant memory for many Alabama voters.Ask Republicans today what they think of Mr. Sessions, who represented Alabama in the Senate for 20 years, and many of the same belittling adjectives that Mr. Trump has hurled at his former attorney general come spilling out.""He was weak,"" said Stasia Madej, the owner of a women's clothing boutique in Huntsville. She was in between bites of her barbecue dinner on a recent weeknight at a Republican candidates' forum where four of Mr. Sessions's opponents were speaking.""I was hoping he'd be here tonight so we could hear answers to all of the questions we want to ask. I have doubts since he recused himself,"" added Ms. Madej, who declared, ""I love Trump,"" as she started in on Mr. Sessions.The episode to which Ms. Madej was referring may be the one act in Mr. Sessions's long career that tips his Senate run in Alabama: his recusal from the Justice Department's investigation into the Trump campaign's dealings with Russia in 2016. That prompted the appointment of Robert S. Mueller as special counsel and enraged Mr. Trump, who continued his public taunts and insults of the former attorney general -- ""VERY weak"" and his ""biggest mistake"" as president -- long after he forced him out in November 2018.Mr. Sessions's predicament says a lot about a Republican Party that Mr. Trump has turned into a vessel for his own political security, held together not by shared beliefs but instead by fealty to him. No one was more of an evangelist for the ideas Mr. Trump ran on than Mr. Sessions. Yet his political fate is now threatened because the president has declared him disloyal.""We live in a time now when if you don't fall on your sword for the president, you're done,"" said John Castorani, a candidate for Congress from the Mobile area and a self-described moderate Republican, who said Mr. Sessions did the right thing by recusing himself. ""I was proud to be from Alabama -- for a moment,"" added Mr. Castorani, a 27-year-old veteran and former intelligence officer.""When we criticize Trump, we are no longer patriots, we are country-hating liberal hacks,"" he said. ""I'm not going to fall on my sword for him. And if that keeps me from getting elected, I'm O.K.,"" he said.The negative effect of Mr. Trump's barrage against Mr. Sessions became clear in interviews with 20 Alabama voters. Most brought up the recusal with no prompting. Many said they held it against their former senator, though some admired him for sticking to his principles. And even those who couldn't recall what exactly Mr. Sessions did had heard enough to understand that whatever happened was bad for the president.""I know he did something that made the president mad,"" said Susan Woodman, a retired speech therapist who came away from the Huntsville event undecided but impressed with one of Mr. Sessions's rivals, Tommy Tuberville, a former Auburn University football coach.Mr. Tuberville introduced himself to the audience by saying his biggest reason for wanting to serve in Washington was ""to help Donald Trump"" -- be it on trade or foreign policy or fighting political correctness in schools that he complained teach ""climate change, diversity and all that crap.""All of the candidates have pledged in no uncertain terms to help Mr. Trump and his agenda if elected. Mr. Sessions's bet is that he can claim something more convincing: He was on board with that agenda first.""I have a certain authenticity on this that I will acknowledge I don't think others have,"" Mr. Sessions said in an interview at a ""Pork & Politics"" mixer in Mobile recently. Referring to his opponents, he said there was a difference ""between demagoguery and honest advocacy for the American people's interests.""""They're good people,"" he added of his rivals. ""I just don't think any of those candidates understand the significance historically of the issues that we are talking about.""The last time Mr. Sessions ran for Senate, in 2014, he was considered so unbeatable that no one ran against him on either ticket, Republican or Democratic. He was famous for railing against Wall Street bankers and Silicon Valley executives as villains from a Tom Wolfe novel, calling them ""masters of the universe"" who were putting ""the parochial demands of a few powerful C.E.O.s ahead of an entire nation's hopes.""During the Obama administration he opposed fellow Republicans who wanted to negotiate new agreements to lower barriers to trade, saying in 2015, ""I think we are at a point in history where we cannot afford to lose a single job in this country to unfair trading practices.""He also broke with his party on Social Security and Medicare spending, favoring an approach that would avoid the steep cuts that party leaders like Paul D. Ryan had supported as a matter of fiscal responsibility.Working in Mr. Sessions's office at the time as his communications director was Stephen Miller, now the White House adviser most associated with Mr. Trump's hard-line approach to immigration.In February 2016, when most of Mr. Sessions's colleagues still considered Mr. Trump a joke, he became the first senator to endorse him for president.There is a depth to Mr. Sessions's early bond with Mr. Trump that none of his rivals can challenge. Mr. Tuberville has never held political office. Representative Bradley Byrne, who represents a district in southern Alabama, won his seat in 2013 after beating a Tea Party insurgent, thanks in large part to a flood of money from major corporations like Pfizer, Caterpillar and AT&T. After the ""Access Hollywood"" tape came out a month before the 2016 election, Mr. Byrne called on Mr. Trump to step aside for Mike Pence.Lately, Mr. Byrne has wrapped himself in the president's agenda. At the Huntsville forum, his campaign literature fanned out on the tables declared, ""We can trust Bradley to stand with President Trump."" He managed to insert Mr. Trump's name into almost every answer he gave that night, starting with his introduction to the crowd: ""I'm a Christian. I'm a conservative,"" he said. ""And I vote with President Trump 97 percent of the time.""So far, polls show Mr. Sessions leading Mr. Byrne, Mr. Tuberville and a third opponent, Roy S. Moore, the former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court whose campaign for Senate in 2017 unraveled amid accusations that he had forced himself on teenage girls, costing Republicans the seat.Mr. Trump has been uncharacteristically quiet about this year's race. Should Mr. Sessions prevail in the primary next month but not win an outright majority, a runoff election would not happen for several weeks. And that prospect makes Mr. Sessions's allies nervous because of the ample time it would allow the president to call off his cease-fire.Though Mr. Trump is famous for disregarding advice, he has heeded warnings so far from numerous advisers about attacking the former attorney general. According to several people familiar with the conversations, his aides have pointed out that any attempt to interfere could backfire, as it did in 2017 when Mr. Trump backed two candidates in Alabama who lost: Luther Strange, who lost in the primary to Mr. Moore, and then Mr. Moore.With the exception of a few influential conservatives -- including Fox News's Tucker Carlson, who in an interview last year with the Huntsville radio host Jeff Poor said that ""Sessions was Trump long before Trump,"" and Laura Ingraham, who in 2014 said Mr. Sessions should be president -- most Republicans seem to have conveniently forgotten Mr. Sessions's contributions to Trumpism. Mr. Carlson and Ms. Ingraham remain fans. And since Mr. Sessions announced his campaign in November on Mr. Carlson's show, he has been on their prime-time Fox programs a total of nine times.When the Sessions campaign released a list of 11 former Senate colleagues who were endorsing him, they were all people who were safe from the reprisals and attacks from the president that most Republicans fear. None are running for re-election this year; two are retiring; two others are in their mid-80s; and one, Johnny Isakson of Georgia, already left the Senate at the end of last year because of health issues.Though Mr. Sessions said he had not spoken to the president since he left the Justice Department over a year ago, preserving the themes of the 2016 Trump campaign inside a party that was often hostile to them is a major reason he wants to be in the Senate.Asked whether he believed there were a lot of Republicans who would revert to the party orthodoxy on trade and immigration once Mr. Trump is out of office, he said: ""That's my concern. I think there are a number of them that are kind of looking for that wave to go away. And they'll go back to business as usual.""PhotographA supporter of Jeff Sessions in Mobile, Ala., last month.

| Jump to first hitDavid Richter had been the front-runner in his House primary in New Jersey. That changed when the Democratic incumbent announced he was becoming a Republican, with the president's support.AVALON, N.J. -- President Trump has few reservations about undermining members of his own party, and David Richter was no exception.Mr. Richter, a millionaire former chief executive of one of the nation's largest construction companies, for months had been considered the front-runner in the 2020 Republican primary for New Jersey's Second Congressional District.But that all changed on Dec. 19, when the district's incumbent, Representative Jeff Van Drew, one of three Democrats to vote against impeachment, appeared in the Oval Office with Mr. Trump. Mr. Van Drew announced he was leaving the Democratic Party to become a Republican -- and he had won the president's endorsement in the process.""I assumed I was going to win, and win handily. And that all gets upended,"" Mr. Richter said in an interview at his home in Avalon. ""Donald Trump did what was in the best interest of Donald Trump.""The endorsement was hardly a day old before Mr. Richter's institutional support began to crumble. His top advisers phoned in their apologies and said they were headed to work for Mr. Van Drew. The National Republican Congressional Committee scrubbed Mr. Richter, 52, from its 2020 Young Guns program, which is meant to highlight rising stars in the party.Mr. Richter has remained in the race, but he now finds himself campaigning ostensibly in support of both the man and the institution that rejected him. As even longtime Republican lawmakers can attest, the merest dissent against this president can wreak havoc on one's career, often in the form of 280 characters.Mr. Richter, whose political life has conversely just begun, is already running as Donald Trump's roadkill.There had been no classes on this when Mr. Richter attended Harvard's Kennedy School -- what to do when your presumed general election opponent, once denounced by Republicans for his ""socialist policies,"" is suddenly your party's hero, beaming alongside the president in an Oval Office chair typically reserved for visiting heads of state.It didn't matter that in his one term in Congress, Mr. Van Drew had stuck with Democrats on issues like Mr. Trump's border wall, or that he'd endorsed Senator Cory Booker for president. What mattered was that Mr. Trump had spoken.""He's not only running against Jeff Van Drew now,"" Kellyanne Conway, a counselor to the president, said of Mr. Richter. ""He's running against President Trump, too.""Mr. Richter said he wasn't bothered by the N.R.C.C. snub. (""The benefit I saw from Young Guns, other than a news release, was close to zero,"" he said.) But even a rookie like him could understand that his apparent new distance from the president was less than ideal, especially in a district where Mr. Trump is incredibly popular among Republican voters.To exist in the Republican Party today is to be defined, more than anything else, by one's relationship with the president -- and to accept that political survival often means maintaining it. Which is probably why, even as Mr. Richter dutifully proclaimed his commitment to seeing the race through, he quietly signaled his openness to an exit route.In mid-December, as rumors circulated that Mr. Van Drew was planning to switch parties, Mr. Richter reached out to contacts in Mr. Trump's orbit including Bill Stepien, a Trump campaign official and New Jersey native. Mr. Stepien, as well as two others who spoke with Mr. Richter and requested anonymity to share private conversations, said Mr. Richter had stated his intention to stay in the race but would consider dropping out and running in the Third Congressional District instead if he were promised financial support, the president's endorsement and a public request to jump into the other race. One of the people who spoke to Mr. Richter said he was still waiting to hear the White House's response to his offer.Mr. Richter recalls those exchanges differently. ""I have had several conversations with people close to the White House, and that topic did come up, but I did not initiate it,"" he said. ""I also stated clearly that I did not have an interest in changing districts and I intended to continue pursuing the Republican nomination in the Second District. But I did say that if the White House or the Trump campaign wanted to have a dialogue with me about anything, I was willing to engage in a dialogue.""Ms. Conway said the White House hopes Mr. Richter will consider other ways to help the party. ""We want Mr. Richter to remain engaged and be included,"" she said. ""There are many ways to contribute short of running for Congress.""In some ways, Mr. Richter and the Trump world have been at odds from the beginning. It was Chris Christie, the former governor of New Jersey, and Mr. Stepien who helped orchestrate Mr. Van Drew's party switch. They began laying the groundwork in late October after Mr. Van Drew voted against formalizing the impeachment inquiry, one of just two Democrats to do so.The nudge Mr. Van Drew needed came from his own polling, which showed support among Democratic voters in his district cratering if he ultimately voted against impeaching the president. Ms. Conway, who is also from South Jersey, was one of his first calls. On the night of Dec. 12, he told Ms. Conway, who was standing next to Mr. Christie at the time, that he was ready to pull the trigger. The plan was finalized in the White House residence the next morning: Mr. Van Drew would break with the Democrats on impeachment and join the president shortly after to announce his new affiliation.Mr. Richter, for his part, remains careful to temper his criticism of the White House, and to clarify that he understands why Mr. Trump made the decision he did, and to say that he doesn't fault him for it. He credits the ordeal as yet another byproduct of ""the swamp,"" a tale of what happens when leaders like Mr. Van Drew are no longer ""loyal to their principles.""Asked if he believes Mr. Trump has stayed loyal to his principles, Mr. Richter paused. ""No comment,"" he said, then backtracked. ""And I don't want 'no comment' to be my answer. No answer.""On the topic of Mr. Van Drew, Mr. Richter is much more forthright. ""I've talked to a lot of voters in the last month ... and I can tell you, overwhelmingly and not by a close margin, they're not ready to back Jeff Van Drew,"" he said.Of course there will be those who simply follow the president's lead, he noted. ""But I think most people probably have a wait-and-see attitude, which is, 'Well, he's got to prove to me that he's really Republican now, and this just wasn't done opportunistically,' which I don't think he's going to be able to prove, because that's exactly what this is,"" Mr. Richter said.Ron Filan, Mr. Van Drew's campaign manager, said in a statement, ""If David has any question as to Congressman Van Drew's relationship with the voters of South Jersey, I'd invite David to sign up for a ticket and see the response Jeff Van Drew gets when President Trump comes to support him in Wildwood later this month.""Mr. Richter is doing what any textbook would probably advise at a moment like this: Drum up one's lifelong Republican bona fides. Remind voters of all the times the other guy stood with Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Stay optimistic that Republicans in this district ""care about the issues"" and ""the principles they believe in.""But this is not a textbook time.At a gathering of local Republicans at a Margate City restaurant this week, Mr. Richter introduced James Toto, a Somers Point councilman who was among the first officials to endorse him.Mr. Toto should say he's still all in for Mr. Richter. That Mr. Van Drew's switch meant nothing, that of course he'd love to oblige the president, but that he already pledged his support elsewhere.But after Mr. Richter walked away, Mr. Toto, leaning against the bar, admitted he was no longer so sure.""I support our president. And this is what the president wishes,"" he said of voting for Mr. Van Drew.Mr. Toto then clutched his chest. ""How,"" he asked, ""do I go against what the president stands for?""PhotographDavid Richter was leading until President Trump endorsed Jeff Van Drew, a former Democrat.

| Jump to first hitNew revelations from the former White House national security adviser could complicate President Trump's impeachment trial.WASHINGTON -- President Trump directly tied the withholding of almost $400 million in American security aid to investigations that he sought from Ukrainian officials, according to an unpublished manuscript of a book that John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, wrote about his time in the White House.The firsthand account of the link between the aid and investigations, which is based on meetings and conversations Mr. Bolton had with Mr. Trump, undercuts a key component of the president's impeachment defense: that the decision to freeze the aid was independent from his requests that Ukraine announce politically motivated investigations into former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and his son Hunter.In their opening arguments on Saturday in Mr. Trump's trial, the president's lawyers asserted that Mr. Trump had legitimate concerns about corruption in Ukraine and whether other countries were offering enough help for its war against Russian-backed separatists, which his lawyers said explained his reluctance to release the aid. They also said that Democrats had no direct evidence of the quid pro quo they allege at the heart of their impeachment case.Multiple people described Mr. Bolton's account. A draft of the manuscript, which offers a glimpse into how Mr. Bolton might testify in the trial if he were called to, was sent to the White House in recent weeks for a standard review process.Here are five takeaways.Mr. Trump tied his willingness to release aid to Ukraine on investigations he sought.During a conversation in August with Mr. Trump, Mr. Bolton mentioned his concern over the delay of the $391 million in congressionally appropriated assistance to Ukraine as a deadline neared to send the money.Mr. Trump replied that he preferred sending no assistance to Ukraine until officials had turned over all materials they had about the Russia investigation related to Mr. Biden and supporters of Hillary Clinton in Ukraine, referencing unfounded theories and other assertions that Rudolph W. Giuliani, his personal lawyer, had promoted about any Ukrainian efforts to damage Mr. Trump politically.The president often hits at multiple opponents in his harangues, and he frequently lumps together the law enforcement officials who investigated his campaign's ties to Russia with Democrats and other perceived enemies, as he appeared to do with Mr. Bolton.Mr. Trump was at odds with his senior national security officials.According to Mr. Bolton, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper joined him in pressing Mr. Trump to release the aid in the weeks leading up to the August meeting.Mr. Trump repeatedly set aside their overtures by mentioning assorted grievances he had about Ukraine, some related to efforts by some Ukrainians who backed Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election and others related to conspiracies and unsupported accusations about, among other things, a hacked server at the Democratic National Committee.Mr. Bolton says he talked to Barr and Pompeo about Giuliani.Mr. Bolton wrote that Mr. Pompeo privately acknowledged to him last spring that Mr. Giuliani's claims about Marie L. Yovanovitch, then the American ambassador to Ukraine, had no basis, including allegations that she was bad-mouthing Mr. Trump. Mr. Pompeo suggested to Mr. Bolton that Mr. Giuliani may have wanted Ms. Yovanovitch out because she might have been targeting his business clients in her anti-corruption efforts. Yet Mr. Pompeo still went through with Mr. Trump's order to recall Ms. Yovanovitch last May.Mr. Pompeo lashed out at a National Public Radio host on Friday and Saturday after she asked him in an interview about Ms. Yovanovitch's removal.Mr. Bolton also wrote that he had concerns about Mr. Giuliani. He said he warned White House lawyers last year that Mr. Giuliani might have been using his work representing the president as leverage to help his private clients.Among other names Mr. Bolton referenced in the manuscript: Attorney General William P. Barr. Mr. Bolton wrote that he raised concerns with Mr. Barr about Mr. Giuliani's influence on the president after Mr. Trump's July 25 call with Ukraine's president. That call was a critical piece of the whistle-blower complaint that prompted the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Barr on Sunday denied Mr. Bolton's account through a spokeswoman.Mr. Bolton is willing to testify. The White House doesn't want him to.Mr. Bolton, who released a statement this month saying he would appear at Mr. Trump's trial if he is subpoenaed, is prepared to testify before the Senate, according to his associates. He believes that he has relevant insight to present before senators vote on whether to remove Mr. Trump. He is also concerned, his associates said, that if his account of Mr. Trump's Ukraine dealings comes out after the trial, he will be accused of withholding potentially incriminating material in order to increase his book sales.Mr. Trump and the White House, however, do not want Mr. Bolton to appear.The White House had already ordered Mr. Bolton and other key officials not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry. The manuscript has intensified concern among advisers that they need to use a restraining order to block Mr. Bolton from testifying, according to two people familiar with their concerns. It was unclear whether they would be successful in doing so.The manuscript introduced a significant twist to the impeachment trial.The revelations from the draft of Mr. Bolton's book could complicate the impeachment trial. A handful of moderate Republican senators who have signaled an openness to calling witnesses did not appear persuaded by the case that the Democratic House managers made last week at the trial, which The Times reported on Friday was heading as early as this week toward a vote on Mr. Trump's acquittal.Mr. Bolton's revelations could unearth support among that group and a handful of other senators who have indicated they might be open to hearing from him. Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee said Friday he planned to wait until after Mr. Trump's lawyers presented and after senators asked the lawyers questions to decide on whether to support new testimony and evidence.At least one senator who will vote on impeachment was mentioned by name in the draft of the book: Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin. Mr. Bolton said Mr. Johnson was at a meeting last May with Mr. Trump in which the president railed about Ukraine trying to damage him politically.If the Senate does vote to hear from Mr. Bolton, the trial could stretch deep into February.PhotographRudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, pursued a shadow foreign policy in Ukraine.

| Jump to first hitWILDWOOD, N.J. -- The president asked for nothing less than everything they had.""If you want your children to inherit the blessings that generations of Americans have fought and died for to secure,"" President Trump told a crowd of supporters in Wildwood at one of a string of campaign rallies he has held this winter, ""we must devote everything that we have toward victory in 2020.""Sitting a few yards to the president's right, a 53-year-old retired police officer, Jacqueline D'Angelo, was taking Mr. Trump's words to heart. Sitting with her 14-year-old son, Lorenzo, she pumped her fists as Mr. Trump's voice rose and fell. She waved her made-for-TV sign -- ""Women for Trump"" -- and jeered along with the crowd when the president ran down the list of his villains: Democrats, Nancy Pelosi, the news media, Nancy Pelosi again. Mostly, she was having fun.The rally last month was just like any of over 500 that Mr. Trump has hosted since announcing his candidacy in 2015, but this one was special to Ms. D'Angelo because it was her first. When she emerged from the rally, her cheeks were flushed.""That,"" she said, ""was a release.""For the campaign, it was a capture.Ms. D'Angelo's experience represents the ideal outcome for a campaign that leads the way in using digital platforms to bring followers into the flock and hoovering up crucial voter information once they get there. Rallies like this one -- and an upcoming one Friday night in North Charleston, S.C. -- turn out to be the crown jewels of data collection for Mr. Trump's campaign.Step one: The data/ticket exchangeCampaign officials are open about viewing the rallies as data-mining expeditions that can help create a red-hatted army of volunteers.Ms. D'Angelo and her son, according to the campaign, were two of nearly 100,000 people who registered to attend the New Jersey rally, Mr. Trump's first in the state as president. To register for the rally, she visited the campaign site, clicked a button, then turned over her name, email address and phone number. She received two tickets in return.Ms. D'Angelo heard about the president's appearance through a friend who helps her operate a pro-Trump Facebook page she created before the 2018 midterm elections. Like most Facebook groups that support Mr. Trump, hers is a cascade of links to conservative websites, Trump White House social media posts and doctored photos of the president's enemies, including Ms. Pelosi.For Ms. D'Angelo, hearing the president talk was validation of her decision to vote for Mr. Trump in 2016. Watching his performance over the past three years -- particularly, she said, in securing America from ""illegal immigrants"" -- she has gone from someone who was raised politically independent to someone who now says she believes that the truth is to be trusted only if it comes from Mr. Trump.""I was on the fence like anybody else,"" she said. But now, ""it's like a leap of faith for me knowing he's trying to do the right thing.""Her digital ticket request was just a drop in the campaign data collection bucket. According to a tweet by Brad Parscale, the Trump campaign manager who publicly shares data after each rally, the Wildwood event had 158,632 requested tickets. Of the 73,482 voters identified by the campaign as seeking tickets, 10 percent did not vote in 2016 and more than a quarter had at one point been registered as Democrats. That last figure has campaign officials convinced that Mr. Trump is attracting people who are disillusioned with the current slate of presidential candidates, so the campaign cross-references the data it collects from rallies with voter information collected by the Republican National Committee.""When someone signs up to go to a rally, we can match them up to our big voter file,"" said Tim Murtaugh, the campaign's communications director. ""From that we can tell if they've voted recently, if they're a Republican or Democrat, did they move from a different state. When we can identify someone as a supporter, that improves all of our modeling and voter scoring.""Republican strategists say those numbers reveal that the Trump campaign is focusing not just on drawing in believers, but also on making sure they turn out to vote in November.""People can be vocal Republicans online and in person but never vote,"" Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist, said in an interview. ""Voters are not necessarily rational actors, and that's why it's critical for the campaign to build a one-to-one relationship with them.""Step two: Share views (and personal data)During the 90 minutes or so that Mr. Trump is onstage at every rally, he delivers what his campaign sees as its best product: a president who reinforces a feeling that the news media and the Democratic Party refuse to see anything positive about his administration or his supporters.As she waited in line in Wildwood, Ms. D'Angelo was approached by a Bikers for Trump member who was volunteering to collect names, addresses and phone numbers from people in the crowd on behalf of the New Jersey Republican Party. (Ms. D'Angelo told him she had already signed up.) She groused with an acquaintance, James Toto, a local councilman who is running for Atlantic County freeholder, over L.G.B.T.-friendly bathroom policies in public schools.Ms. D'Angelo also took time to check in on her pro-Trump Facebook page, sometimes broadcasting live video for others back home. Many of its members once worked in law enforcement, as did Ms. D'Angelo, an Army veteran who is retired from the police force in Paterson, N.J. She now collects a pension that she supplements with an auto body business she runs with her husband in Brigantine, N.J.At Mr. Trump's rallies and campaign events, his words are fine-tuned to appeal to white, Christian, blue-collar voters. Ms. D'Angelo, who is white, said his overtures to the military and law enforcement communities helped win her over. She cannot understand why anyone would dislike Mr. Trump, a leader who, as she puts it, ""has cojones.""""The last time I experienced such a patriotic push was 9/11,"" Ms. D'Angelo said. ""Apple pie. Baseball. Christmas. He really embodies the traditions we hold so dear.""Christmas, as Ms. D'Angelo mentioned, is something Mr. Trump often mentions at his rallies. He claims that he alone made it safe to say ""Merry Christmas"" again. A ""Make America Great Again"" collectible ornament costs $60.Ms. D'Angelo likens staying updated on pro-Trump news on Facebook to another full-time job. She and other supporters who look at such pages are nearly certain to encounter the countless ads the Trump campaign has used to flood the platform. Facebook's fact-checking rules do not apply to political ads, letting candidates spread false or misleading claims.""It usually stays with current events,"" Ms. D'Angelo said of her own page, ""and it's giving people a voice who can speak without retaliation.""Finding friendly faces nearly everywhere in the crowd, Ms. D'Angelo complained with a stranger about the rough deal Mr. Trump got by inheriting the Obama-era national deficit. When a reporter pointed out that the president had actually helped widen the national debt -- despite a campaign-trail pledge to erase it within eight years -- she said that Mr. Trump had come into the job with a lot on his plate.""The thing is he's also straightened things out,"" Ms. D'Angelo said in the president's defense.As she spoke, a message came on the Jumbotron asking Trump supporters to text their phone number to the campaign to stay in touch.The campaign has aggressively pushed text sign-ups across its digital platforms in order to create a direct relationship with individual supporters to ask them for small donations. The tactic has long been used by political campaigns -- 12 years ago, the Obama campaign was praised for its leveraging of SMS texting, by offering special merchandise and targeting voters in specific areas with news about rallies and events.But Teddy Goff, the Obama campaign's former digital director, said the Trump campaign had taken traditional digital tactics in a new direction by spreading misinformation and news of the president's latest political skirmish -- basically, keeping supporters angry enough to vote.The campaign's messaging approach often warns of what might happen should a Democrat win the 2020 election. ""If Radical Democratic candidates take back the Nation, they'll ruin everything President Trump has accomplished,"" one recent email sent to supporters read, before asking them to contribute money.""I think the Trump campaign probably makes its people feel like they're being well served in that he validates all of their grievances,"" Mr. Goff said.Ms. D'Angelo said her news diet included Twitter, Facebook and news sites like the BBC and CNN -- though later she added that ""I can't turn it on"" -- and Fox News. Occasionally, she checks in on QAnon, the conspiracy website that has a noticeable presence at Trump rallies, to see what people are saying, but she views it more as entertainment.Ultimately, Ms. D'Angelo said, she takes bits and pieces from a variety of websites, crafting her own view of the news, but only believes it if it is confirmed by the president.""I tune into the president every day, Fox every night,"" Ms. D'Angelo said. ""At night it's me and my husband. Fox comes on and we get up to speed.""Step three: Just add moneyAfter making it inside the Wildwoods Convention Center, Ms. D'Angelo almost immediately encountered a table laden with Trump merchandise. With $100, she bought T-shirts, bumper stickers and hats, before turning around and spending $70 more on gifts for her brother. Along with her American Express card, she also handed over her driver's license, which was scanned and put into a database for campaign contributions.The Trump campaign is adept at rolling out new lines of merchandise, sometimes tailoring it to the latest social media outrage. Most of the merchandise requests are routed through a company called Ace Specialties in Lafayette, La., whose owner, Christl Mahfouz, can often be seen mingling with fans outside Trump rallies.Her team sells hats in exchange for money and the buyer's voting data: Each time supporters buy a T-shirt or a hat at a rally, a digital interface prompts them to turn over their names, addresses and other voter-specific information. This data is then logged as a donation to the Trump Make America Great Again Committee and each person's contribution is saved for future Federal Election Commission reports, according to a campaign official.For Ms. D'Angelo, her purchases would serve another function: Wearing them would give her pro-Trump protective armor after she left the bubble of the rally for the outside world.""There's a whole army behind him,"" Ms. D'Angelo said. ""Even in New Jersey.""Roughly 10 hours after she arrived in Wildwood, the president took the stage and launched into his familiar call-and-responses, reserving special treatment for Democrats, whom he called ""do nothing"" and ""crazy. Eventually, he landed on the news media.""Do you see the fakers back there?"" Mr. Trump said, pointing to reporters and camera people in a roped-off area. ""Fake news.""The president also spent time hammering home a key message: that he and his family have sacrificed a life of luxury for him to be president. Ms. D'Angelo heard that message loud and clear.""Sometimes he looks so tired and I go, 'Ugh, look at him,""' Ms. D'Angelo said. ""He's going through so much abuse to protect us. I know he's strong. I know he can take it. But compliment the man sometimes. I don't see anything he's done wrong.""By the time she left, the hours and money Ms. D'Angelo had spent in Wildwood ended up solidifying her bond with a campaign -- and a president -- who has prioritized his ability to connect with his supporters on an emotional level. And after the rally, she knew her marching orders.""We need to do everything to get him re-elected,"" she said, ""is what we're going to do.""PhotographSettling in at Wildwoods Convention Center in Wildwood, N.J., last month for one of President Trump's campaign-style rallies.

| Jump to first hitThe former attorney general is seeking to win back the Senate seat he held for two decades in a primary contest that has turned into a contest of loyalty to President Trump, who fired him.MOBILE, Ala. -- Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general who emerged from political exile and defied President Trump to run for the United States Senate in Alabama, suffered a setback on Tuesday in his fight to win back the seat he held for 20 years, falling well short of a majority and landing in a runoff election where he will compete with a Republican rival from a weakened position.Precincts across the state were still counting votes after midnight. But Mr. Sessions was barely fending off a strong challenge from a political upstart, Tommy Tuberville, the former Auburn University football coach who clung closely to Mr. Trump in a relentlessly negative and personal campaign that turned the race into a contest of who was more loyal to the president. He will now face Mr. Sessions in a March 31 runoff.A third Republican, Bradley Byrne, a congressman from the Mobile area who tried to overcome his long association with the Republican Party establishment by also tethering himself to Mr. Trump, conceded defeat on Tuesday night.Voters in Alabama, Texas and North Carolina, where Democrats on Tuesday picked a candidate to challenge a vulnerable Republican, Senator Thom Tillis, were setting up the bigger battle for control of the Senate in 2020. Cal Cunningham, an Army veteran and former state legislator, won the Democratic nod to run against Mr. Tillis in what is expected to be one of the country's most fiercely contested Senate races.The winner on the Republican side in Alabama will face Senator Doug Jones, who is widely viewed as the most endangered Democrat up for re-election in the Senate this year. Whoever wins the Republican nomination is expected to have a significant advantage over Mr. Jones in deeply red Alabama, which Mr. Trump carried with 61 percent of the vote.Speaking to a sparsely attended gathering of supporters on Tuesday night in a hotel banquet room in Mobile, Mr. Sessions emphasized his pro-Trump credentials -- reminding them he was the first senator to endorse the president in 2016 -- and vowed to be the strongest advocate for the president's policies in Washington.""Anyone can say they are for the Trump agenda, but talk is cheap,"" he said. ""I have fought on the great issues of our day, and I have won.""If Republicans do win the seat, it will provide them some breathing room in what is expected to be an otherwise difficult year to defend their 53-47 majority, with a polarizing president on the ticket and concern that Republican senators from Maine to Colorado are in jeopardy. With the vice president empowered to cast tiebreaking votes in the Senate, Democrats need a net gain of three seats to take the majority if the party captures the White House; four if not.The primary in Alabama was a humbling experience for Mr. Sessions, who was treated as a castoff by the Republican Party he helped transform by championing a more nationalistic, anti-immigration, anti-free trade agenda years before Mr. Trump ran for office sounding those themes. Mr. Sessions's predicament became a cautionary tale about the grudges and grievances that are at the heart of Mr. Trump's politics. And it left little doubt about how successful Mr. Trump has been at turning his party into a vessel for his own political advancement, where the fundamental organizing principle is not conservative ideology or policy, but personal loyalty to him.Mr. Sessions's failure to make a stronger showing on Tuesday was a striking reversal of fortune for a politician whose standing in Alabama was once so formidable that the last time he ran for re-election in Alabama, the Democratic Party did not even bother to nominate a candidate to oppose him.His problem this time was that not enough Republican voters appeared to recall the pre-Trump Jeff Sessions, a beloved figure on the right who helped fuel a populist backlash that antagonized Republican leaders over the very issues that are now at the heart of Mr. Trump's nationalist agenda.Instead, many of them saw the diminished attorney general who had been harangued, humiliated and belittled by Mr. Trump, who attacked Mr. Sessions as ""scared stiff"" and ""Missing in Action"" and told NBC News that appointing him was his ""biggest mistake"" he had made as president.Mr. Trump's low opinion of Mr. Sessions aside, the race was shaped by other factors that did not work in his favor. Mr. Tuberville, who emphasized his lack of experience in politics, called for Alabama to turn the page and elect fresh leadership. Mr. Sessions, who is 73, can no longer claim to be the renegade outsider he once was.And that appears to have left an impression on voters who are wary of anyone they associate with Washington.""Jeff will have to emphasize that he can go to work and help the president on Day 1, and that the Senate isn't a place for on-the-job training,"" said Jim Zeigler, the Alabama state auditor and a Republican. Mr. Tuberville, by contrast, will have the outsider's advantage. ""In a runoff, if Coach Tuberville can sell the idea, 'I am not a politician, I am an outsider,' he'll be very strong,"" Mr. Zeigler added.Probably helping Mr. Sessions hang on was the fact that Mr. Trump largely stayed silent once Mr. Sessions announced his campaign -- an uncharacteristic show of restraint for a president who can rarely resist the urge to dive into races across the country, and can change their outcome with a single caustic tweet. His advisers and Republican leaders pleaded with him not to interfere in the Alabama race even though his hostility toward his former attorney general still burns hot.But that restraint may not hold between now and the runoff. Given Mr. Sessions's lackluster showing on Tuesday, Mr. Tuberville's allies are expected to push the White House to endorse him over Mr. Sessions. That could further damage Mr. Sessions given how much influence the president's word can have in Republican primaries.More often when voters turn away from a politician with a long record and a reservoir of good will, legal or ethical wrongdoing or a personal scandal has left them sour. In Mr. Sessions's case, the opposite was true. Legal scholars and Justice Department lawyers agreed that he properly recused himself from overseeing the investigation into possible ties between Russia and the 2016 Trump campaign because he had been a close adviser to Mr. Trump during the election. Mr. Trump fired him in November 2018 and Mr. Sessions stayed largely quiet, until announcing his Senate campaign almost exactly one year later.In the eyes of Mr. Trump and his supporters -- and the campaign message of Mr. Sessions's primary opponents -- the former attorney general's offense was that he had not done enough to protect the president. The ethics of the recusal, as far as they were concerned, were either irrelevant or misrepresented by enemies of the president.Even before Mr. Sessions announced that he would run, the primary was dominated by effusive demonstrations of support for Mr. Trump. The candidates rarely saw an issue they did not try to use as a way to prove their fealty to the president. As the House of Representatives prepared to impeach the president in October, Mr. Byrne was one of several Republicans who barged into a closed Intelligence Committee meeting and started shouting at Representative Adam B. Schiff, the chairman and a leader of the Democratic impeachment effort.Mr. Tuberville campaigned across the state saying that his biggest reason for wanting to serve in Washington was ""to help Donald Trump."" In his first television ad, he declared that the president was a gift from the divine. ""God sent us Donald Trump because God knew we were in trouble,"" he says, promising to go to Washington to help build the Trump border wall and drain the proverbial swamp.A fourth Republican candidate, Roy S. Moore, was on track to finish a distant fourth place. The nomination of Mr. Moore, a former judge who was accused of forcing himself on teenage girls, set into motion the series of events that led to Mr. Jones's improbable victory. No Democrat had been elected to the Senate from Alabama in a generation.Mr. Sessions's assumption going into the race was that his decades of service in Alabama -- he was first elected to the Senate in 1996 and served as state attorney general for two years before that -- would help him overcome any stain on his reputation from his falling out with the president. On the campaign trail, he played the role of the seasoned pragmatist who would defend the Trump agenda because he understood and valued it better than anyone.He also tried to remind Alabamians that despite his troubled relationship with the president, he had been an early supporter of Mr. Trump's when ""only one senator had the guts to support him,"" as one of Mr. Sessions's recent ads put it.In North Carolina, Mr. Cunningham, a moderate favored by party leaders in Washington, was on track to handily beat Erica D. Smith, a Democratic state senator running to his left in the primary. But the victory did not come cheaply: His campaign and outside Democratic groups spent more than $10 million boosting his candidacy. And in a sign of how concerned Republicans are about losing the seat, they quietly funneled close to $3 million into the race on Ms. Smith's behalf to make Mr. Cunningham's path more difficult.In Texas, M.J. Hegar, a former Air Force helicopter pilot, advanced to a Democratic primary runoff for the chance to challenge Republican Senator John Cornyn.Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting from Washington.Nicholas Fandos contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographHis Republican rivals portrayed Jeff Sessions, left, as insufficiently loyal to President Trump.

| Jump to first hitMichael R. Bloomberg's presidential campaign has secured 60 seconds' worth of advertising during the game on Feb. 2. President Trump's re-election campaign announced it had done the same.Michael R. Bloomberg's presidential campaign has secured a 60-second advertising spot to air nationally during next month's Super Bowl telecast, an ad buy that will most likely cost at least $10 million.Hours after The New York Times reported Mr. Bloomberg's plans, President Trump's re-election campaign said that it, too, had reserved 60 seconds' worth of advertising during the game for roughly $10 million.The dueling ads on the year's biggest night of television are evidence that the two New York billionaires are preparing for a schoolyard brawl on the national airwaves over the coming months, with each increasingly willing to dip into his vast resources -- Mr. Bloomberg is spending his own fortune, and Mr. Trump has a nine-figure campaign war chest -- to broadcast their messages.""The biggest point is getting under Trump's skin,"" said Michael Frazier, a spokesman for the Bloomberg campaign. By ""taking the fight to Trump,"" Mr. Frazier said, ""the ad is part of Mike's strategy of running a national campaign that focuses on states where the general election will be decided, parts of the country that are often overlooked.""Aides to Mr. Bloomberg, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, said his Super Bowl ad would be a new spot that has not yet aired. They would not specify the cost of the ad, but executives at Fox, which is broadcasting the game on Feb. 2, have said they were seeking ""north of $5 million"" per 30-second spot.The Trump campaign's decision to advertise during the Super Bowl, which was first reported by Politico, continues a strategy of advertising during major sporting events.""President Trump made the unprecedented decision to keep the campaign open following his first election, which allows us to do things like buying a Super Bowl ad,"" said Tim Murtaugh, a spokesman for the Trump campaign. ""We got in early, which gave us prime ad position early in the game.""It was not clear when during the game Mr. Bloomberg's ad would air. The Super Bowl is regularly the most watched single television program in any given year; last year's game drew 98.2 million viewers on CBS.Mr. Bloomberg's campaign has continued to set records for political advertising by a presidential candidate, having already spent nearly $170 million on television and digital advertising, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm. Mr. Bloomberg, a billionaire media owner and former mayor of New York, is funding his campaign with his own money and is not soliciting donations.""We have the means to raise a national campaign unlike any other candidate,"" Mr. Frazier said.Mr. Bloomberg has made targeting Mr. Trump a core element of his ad strategy. Before he announced his candidacy, he pledged to spend $100 million on ads criticizing the president. And since he began his bid, his campaign has unloaded a barrage of Facebook attack ads in general-election swing states, seeking to erode support for Mr. Trump by highlighting what Mr. Bloomberg calls his broken promises on infrastructure, health care and solving dysfunction in Washington.Super Bowl ads are rarely seen in presidential politics. Though some campaigns have made local advertising buys during past Super Bowls, a national buy has often been out of reach, given the expense. It is also usually viewed as wasteful to pay to reach a 50-state audience rather than buying ads in key states where campaigns would prefer to target their message.But Mr. Bloomberg is running an unconventional primary campaign with a heavy national emphasis, choosing to avoid the four states that hold the first caucuses and primaries in February and instead focusing his efforts on Super Tuesday on March 3, when 14 states will vote.""It's actually smart for Bloomberg,"" said Ken Goldstein, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco. ""Bloomberg is running a national campaign, and the most efficient way to reach a lot of people in a national campaign is buying an ad in a top-rated show. And as expensive as it is, it's cheaper than buying the ads market by market.""Mr. Trump's campaign also has deep pockets. It said last week that it had raised $46 million in the last three months of 2019 and was entering 2020 with $102.7 million in cash on hand.The Super Bowl ads will air at a politically potent time: The Iowa caucuses are the day after the game (though Mr. Bloomberg has said he is not competing in them), and Mr. Trump is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address the night after that.The Super Bowl broadcast has often avoided the rancor of national politics. Perhaps the most recent national advertisement that waded into political territory was a 30-second ad featuring Tim Tebow, then a recent college football star, talking about his anti-abortion views, which aired during the 2010 matchup between the New Orleans Saints and Indianapolis Colts.Presidential campaigns have advertised during major sporting events before, however. In October, the Trump campaign made a seven-figure ad buy during Game 7 of the World Series, pushing back on the impeachment inquiry in Washington. And in 2016, with just over a week to go before Election Day, Mr. Trump's and Hillary Clinton's campaigns each purchased multiple ads during Game 7 of that year's World Series.PhotographMichael R.

| Jump to first hitThe president is brazenly grabbing his only clear option to bolster his re-election hopes, portraying himself as a take-charge leader the country can't afford to lose.WASHINGTON -- With the economy faltering and the political landscape unsettled as the coronavirus death toll climbs, a stark and unavoidable question now confronts President Trump and his advisers: Can he save his campaign for re-election when so much is suddenly going so wrong?After three years of Republicans' championing signs of financial prosperity that were to be Mr. Trump's chief re-election argument, the president has never needed a new message to voters as he does now, not to mention luck. At this point, the president has one clear option for how to proceed politically, and is hoping that an array of factors will break his way.The option, which he has brazenly pushed in recent days, is to cast himself as a ""wartime president"" who looks in charge of a nation under siege while his likely Democratic opponent, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., is largely out of sight hunkered down in Delaware. This gambit, however, requires a rewriting of history -- Mr. Trump's muted approach to the virus early on -- and it's far from clear if many voters will accept the idea of him as a wartime leader.Then there are other variables that he and his allies hope will fall in their favor: that the outbreak of the virus will slow and, in the warmer months, dissipate; that the states will get it under control; that the federal government's steps taken so far will flatten the curve; that Mr. Biden and the Democrats will look impotent and inconsequential by comparison; and that enough voters will move past his initial efforts to play down the virus's dangers.The great unknown, of course -- and the tremendous risk to Mr. Trump's political fate, no matter what he says or does -- is that the human cost, the economic toll, and the longevity and course of the pandemic are all X factors that will most likely play out for months and could be strongly salient if not severe by the time of the November general election.In perhaps the best-case scenario for Mr. Trump, the patina of a ""wartime president"" could prove to be influential with casual voters who don't dig into the details of his belated response to the coronavirus, which included dismissing the criticism of his handling of the threat as a Democratic ""hoax"" and contributing to a slow start in testing for the virus.""He is counting on people being so traumatized on a day-to-day basis that they will forget his inaction,"" said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University. ""It's better for him to be a wartime commander in chief than someone who, when the big crisis hit, misread it completely.""Politically, Mr. Brinkley said, the new posture made sense. ""He can claim credit for the curve flattening at some point,"" he said, ""and hope people will be afraid to push a leader out of office if the crisis pushes into the fall.""The president's course correction showed some quick results that were seized on by his political advisers. An ABC News poll released last week showed that 55 percent of Americans approved of Mr. Trump's response to the pandemic, up from 43 percent the week before.Rarely have incumbent presidents seen their arguments for re-election evaporate so quickly. Mr. Trump and his advisers had planned to argue that the strong economy warranted a second term and that supporters and detractors alike wanted their 401(k)'s in the Trump-era stock market; that has now become an impossible sell. And as the administration negotiates an enormous bailout package with Congress for multiple industries, his strategy of caricaturing Democrats as ""socialists"" is not tenable either.So Mr. Trump is trying to mount a new version of his old argument: that ""I alone can fix it,"" as he said at the 2016 Republican convention about the nation's problems. He is counting on enough voters believing they have to stick by a leader in the midst of an immense global crisis.Addressing fearful Americans, Mr. Trump said on Sunday evening: ""You have a leader that will always fight for you and I will not stop until we win. This is going to be a victory."" He added at another point, ""No American is alone as long as we're united.""But shortly after reading his new script on Sunday night, Mr. Trump mocked Senator Mitt Romney of Utah for self-quarantining. ""Romney's in isolation? Gee, that's too bad,"" he said sarcastically at the briefing room podium.Mr. Trump is on uncertain political ground. His poll numbers in critical swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan have been wavering, with most surveys showing him behind Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont.Republican officials are banking on voters seeing him as take-charge in contrast to Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders, who have been following the government's guidance about staying indoors but have not yet found memorable ways to show how they would lead in this crisis.Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders have held news conferences from remote locations, and Mr. Biden has participated in ""virtual"" fund-raisers. While Mr. Biden has an all but insurmountable lead in the race for the Democratic nomination, he has no real ability to steer events because he is not officially the presumptive nominee, and therefore is not the head of the party either.As a result, Mr. Biden finds himself with far fewer options than Mr. Trump or Democratic governors like Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, who have real authority and are holding news conferences often broadcast live.In turn, Republican officials and Sanders allies are pushing out attacks on Mr. Biden's low profile, asking ""Where's Joe?"" in emails to supporters and the news media. (A spokesman, T.J. Ducklo, said Sunday that Mr. Biden had not been tested for the virus because he had shown no symptoms.)But the ""wartime"" strategy also presents risks to Mr. Trump. In his new posture, he is trying to rewrite recent history, erasing his comments from as recently as a week ago when he told Americans that they needed to ""just relax"" because ""it all will pass."" It is also undercut by his resistance to calls for additional federal action from governors in hard-hit states.Mr. Trump's temperament is also dissimilar to ""wartime presidents"" with whom he is seeking to compare himself. Over the course of his presidency, Mr. Trump has struggled to stick to any bipartisan message, or speak emotionally to the pain and fear of Americans during crisis points like natural disasters or mass shootings.""That's why it's so hard to be a wartime president,"" said Michael Beschloss, the historian and author of ""Presidents of War."" ""Not only are you coming up with a strategy and tactics, but at the same time you have to let Americans know that you know how hard this is for them.""Mr. Trump, so far, has struggled to feel anyone's pain, unlike past presidents, while continuing to play out the fights with the news media that enliven his base. Last week, he lashed out at a journalist who had prompted him to explain what his message was to the millions of Americans watching him from home, who felt scared.The president has also continued to credit his own administration's response. But Mr. Beschloss added that ""part of being a wartime president is being willing to give people bad news,"" a job Mr. Trump has mostly left to others.At the same time, he has been timid of using wartime powers to fight what he has called an ""invisible enemy."" Last week, for instance, he resisted invoking the Defense Production Act, a federal law that grants presidents extraordinary powers to force American industries to ensure the availability of critical equipment.Mr. Trump's allies are aware that his re-election now hangs almost entirely on how he handles the crisis. And the question is whether he will be seen as President George W. Bush was in the immediate aftermath of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, when he was widely viewed as bringing the nation together, or if he will be compared to Mr. Bush amid the fallout from Hurricane Katrina, when he tried to minimize a crisis that eventually became too big for him to ignore, and during which Mr. Bush praised cabinet officials even as the federal government bungled the response.Aides said that how Mr. Trump ends up being perceived would also depend on Mr. Trump's own disposition during the crisis. It is not clear to them whether he will be able to maintain his focus on the crisis for months, especially as the economic situation worsens. Over the weekend, some Trump advisers weren't ready to accept the likelihood of jobless claims climbing into the millions by next month.The White House press secretary, Stephanie Grisham, defended Mr. Trump's response as apolitical. ""While it seems many in the media continue to use every opportunity to destroy this president, the fact remains that he has risen to fight this crisis by taking aggressive historic action to protect the health, wealth and well-being of the American people,"" Ms. Grisham said in an email.Some Democrats, meanwhile, said the mistakes made at the beginning of the response had already colored how Mr. Trump would be remembered both in the history books and at the ballot box in November. ""At the end of the day, this will be Katrina with the waters at a much higher level, and lasting a longer time,"" said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster.But there is an emerging split in Democratic circles about whether to attack Mr. Trump's response to the virus in real time, or whether the gravity of the moment calls for a pause in negative political advertising and attacks.Some of Mr. Trump's highest-profile political adversaries leading states that have become epicenters of the virus have been striking conciliatory notes as they seek federal assistance. Mr. Cuomo said the president was ""fully engaged"" on the crisis. Gov. Gavin Newsom, Democrat of California, described a recent phone conversation with Mr. Trump as ""a privilege.""Other antagonists have continued to criticize him. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York tapped into one of Mr. Trump's greatest fears when he referred to him on CNN as the ""Herbert Hoover of his generation,"" comparing him to a president who failed to recognize or take bold actions to stave off the stock market crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression.The debate about whether to embrace or attack Mr. Trump in a national emergency played out most succinctly on Twitter between David Axelrod and David Plouffe, the two men who led Barack Obama's presidential campaigns.Mr. Axelrod said that voters would have plenty of time to judge Mr. Trump's handling of the coronavirus crisis, ""but now doesn't seem the moment for negative ads."" Mr. Plouffe responded that time was of the essence, and that Democrats couldn't afford to ""disarm"" and let Mr. Trump create his own reality.Veterans of John Kerry's 2004 campaign said Mr. Biden was in a stronger position against Mr. Trump than they were when they faced an election against Mr. Bush. Back then, Mr. Bush still basked in good will from his performance in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.Some Democratic Party officials said a comparison between Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump at a moment of crisis only helped Mr. Biden.""You can see the contrast between the steady, assured, informed and strong leadership that Vice President Biden has shown and the bungling, chaotic and dishonest start-stop approach that Mr. Trump has shown us since the beginning of this crisis,"" said Gilberto Hinojosa, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.PhotographPresident Trump spoke on Saturday during a coronavirus task force briefing at the White House.

| Jump to first hit'Nothing Less Than a Civil War': These White Voters on the Far Right See Doom Without TrumpGOLDEN VALLEY, Ariz. -- Great American Pizza & Subs, on a highway about 100 miles southeast of Las Vegas, was busier and Trumpier than usual. On any given day it serves ""M.A.G.A. Subs"" and ""Liberty Bell Lasagna."" The ""Second Amendment"" pizza comes ""loaded"" with pepperoni and sausage. The dining room is covered in regalia praising President Trump.But this October morning was ""Trumpstock,"" a small festival celebrating the president. The speakers included the local Republican congressman, Paul Gosar, and lesser-known conservative personalities. There was a fringe 2020 Senate candidate in Arizona who ran a website that published sexually explicit photos of women without their consent; a pro-Trump rapper whose lyrics include a racist slur aimed at Barack Obama; and a North Carolina activist who once said of Muslims, ""I will kill every one of them before they get to me.""All were welcome, except liberals.""They label us white nationalists, or white supremacists,"" volunteered Guy Taiho Decker, who drove from California to attend the event. A right-wing protester, he has previously been arrested on charges of making terrorist threats.""There's no such thing as a white supremacist, just like there's no such thing as a unicorn,"" Mr. Decker said. ""We're patriots.""As Mr. Trump's bid for re-election shifts into higher gear, his campaign hopes to recapture voters who drifted away from the party in 2018 and 2019: independents who embraced moderate Democratic candidates, suburban women tired of Mr. Trump's personal conduct and working-class voters who haven't benefited from his economic policies.But if any group remains singularly loyal to Mr. Trump, it is the small but impassioned number of white voters on the far right, often in rural communities like Golden Valley, who extol him as a cultural champion reclaiming the country from undeserving outsiders.These voters don't passively tolerate Mr. Trump's ""build a wall"" message or his ban on travel from predominantly Muslim countries -- they're what motivates them. They see themselves in his fear-based identity politics, bolstered by conspiratorial rhetoric about caravans of immigrants and Democratic ""coups.""The president draws support from a broader political and ideological cross-section of Republicans than the Trumpstock crowd reflected, and he attracts some independents and Democrats as well. The festival itself was relatively small, drawing about 100 people, though significant enough to attract the likes of Mr. Gosar.But events like it, as well as speaking engagements featuring far-right supporters of the president, have become part of the political landscape during the Trump era. Islamophobic taunts can be heard at his rallies. Hate speech and conspiracy theories are staples of some far-right websites. If Trumpstock was modest in size, it stood out as a sign of extremist public support for a sitting president.And these supporters have electoral muscle in key areas: Mr. Trump outperformed Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee, in rural parts of Arizona like Mohave County, where Golden Valley is located. Mr. Trump won 58,282 votes in the county, compared to 47,901 for Mr. Romney, though Mr. Romney carried the state by a much bigger vote margin.Arizona will be a key battleground state in 2020: Democrats already flipped a Senate seat and a Tucson-based congressional district from red to blue in 2018. For Mr. Trump, big turnout from white voters in areas like Mohave County -- and in rural parts of other battlegrounds like Florida, Michigan, Minnesota and Georgia -- could be a lifeline in a tight election.""We like to call this the 'Red Wall of Arizona,""' said Laurence Schiff, a psychiatrist and Republican campaign official in Mohave County who organizes in support of Mr. Trump's campaign. ""Winning the state starts here, with us.""Grass-roots gatherings play a critical role in the modern culture of political organizing, firing up ardent supporters and cementing new ones. Small circles of Trump-supporting conservatives, often organized online and outside the traditional Republican Party apparatus, engage in more decentralized -- and explicit -- versions of the chest-beating that happens at Mr. Trump's closely watched political rallies.In interviews, people in the crowd described a white America under threat as racial minorities typified by Mr. Obama, the country's first black president, gain political power. They described Mr. Trump as an inspirational figure who is undoing Mr. Obama's legacy and beating back the perceived threat of Muslim and Latino immigrants, whom they denounced in prejudiced terms.""I don't have a problem with Muslims,"" said Angus Smith, an Arizona resident who attended the festival, ""but can they take the rag off their head out of respect for our country?""At Mr. Trump's official rallies, including a recent one in Florida, the president has referred to Mr. Obama by stressing his middle name, Hussein, and said Democrats were ""trying to stop me because I'm fighting for you.""The Trumpstock speakers pushed even further, tying Mr. Obama's middle name to a false belief that he is a foreign-born Muslim.And Democrats were portrayed as not just political opponents, but avatars of doom for Mr. Trump's predominantly white voter base and for the country.""There is no difference between the democratic socialists and the National Socialists,"" said Evan Sayet, a conservative writer who spoke at the event, referencing Nazi Germany. Democrats, he said, ""are the heirs to Adolf Hitler.""A Republican Party shaped in Trump's imageSpeakers at Trumpstock said their cultural fears had been exacerbated by their state's own changing nature: Arizona is on the front lines of undocumented border crossings from Mexico and racial minorities are expected to outnumber white people in the state in the next decade.Arizona Democrats made political gains in 2018, and the national party is riding high after it won governor's races this year in Kentucky and Louisiana. But Republicans remain bullish. They argue that a slice of their electoral base will only vote when the president is on the ballot, and point to regions like Northern Arizona as places to find, as Mr. Trump wrote in a recent tweet, ""the Angry Majority.""""We have the greatest base in the history of politics,"" he said at a recent rally in Florida.In Arizona, the most prominent pro-Trump, anti-immigrant groups are AZ Patriots and Patriot Movement AZ, which have held tight to the themes of white nationalism that some Republicans have denounced. In September, after repeated clashes, some members of the groups agreed to a court order to stop harassing migrants and church volunteers who help them.Earlier this year, the groups and their allies organized a ""Patriotism over Socialism"" event in Gilbert, Ariz., near Phoenix, that included speeches from Representative Andy Biggs, the area's congressman, and Kelli Ward, the state's Republican Party chair. They appeared alongside more fringe figures: Sharon Slater of Family Watch International, which has promoted figures associated with anti-L.G.B.T. conversion therapy, and Laura Loomer, the far-right activist and Arizona native who was banned by Twitter and some other platforms after making anti-Muslim comments.This blend of insider and outsider, of mainstream and conspiracy, is a feature of how Mr. Trump has reshaped the Republican Party in his image, and the core of his presidential origin story. Before Mr. Trump announced any firm plans to seek office, he was the national face of the ""birther"" conspiracy, which thrived in the Tea Party movement and had a significant amount of support from the Republican base, polls showed.Stacey Goodman, a former police officer from New York who retired to Arizona and attended Trumpstock, said her distrust of Mr. Obama's birth certificate had led her to Mr. Trump.""If you're Muslim, just tell us you're Muslim,"" she said of Mr. Obama. ""It's not that I didn't believe him, I'm just not qualified to answer that question. I've seen information on both sides that's compelling.""Mona Fishman, a singer from the Las Vegas area who performed at the event, has written Trump-themed songs with titles like ""Fake News"" and ""Smells like Soros,"" which accuses liberal megadonor George Soros of running a shadow government, a trope widely condemned as anti-Semitic.In the White House, Mr. Trump has relied on similar unfounded conspiracy theories and promoted people who have perpetuated them. He pardoned Joseph M. Arpaio, the former sheriff of Maricopa County, a hero of Arizona's right wing and a leader of the ""birther"" movement, who was convicted of criminal contempt related to his aggressive efforts to detain undocumented immigrants.On Mr. Trump's Twitter account, likely the most watched in the world, he has promoted white nationalists, anti-Muslim bigots, and believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory, which claims that top Democrats are worshiping the Devil and engaging in child sex trafficking.Even mainstream conservative media figures have embraced QAnon as a way to dismiss Mr. Trump's political enemies. The Fox News host Jesse Watters, during a recent segment dedicated to the conspiracy, linked it to Mr. Trump's Washington enemies. ""Isn't it also about the Trump fight with the deep state in terms of the illegal surveillance of the campaign, the inside hit jobs that he's sustained?"" he asked.The embrace of conspiracy theories has frustrated some establishment Republicans and moderate Republican voters, who urge Mr. Trump to embrace a more traditional communication style.His base disagrees.""Please never stop tweeting,"" Ms. Fishman sings in one of her songs, titled ""Thank You President Trump."" ""I can hardly wait to see what I'll be reading.""'I don't believe in violence, but...'Events like Trumpstock are not limited to Arizona. Its organizer, Laurie Bezick, recruited speakers from around the country through social media, tapping into a network of pro-Trump voices only a click away.Long-shot congressional candidates touting an ""America First"" agenda came from places like Iowa and Maryland. Leaders of fledgling political groups with names like JEXIT: Jews Exit The Democratic Party, Latinos for Trump and Deplorable Pride, a right-wing L.G.B.T. organization, told the overwhelmingly white audience they were not anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, homophobic or racist. In fact, the speakers insisted, people who used those terms were more guilty of bigotry than the people they accused.To applause, the co-founder of Latinos for Trump, Marco Gutierrez, read the pledge he took when he became a naturalized citizen and renounced his Mexican homeland. Nitemare, a pro-Trump rapper who refused to give his legal name, invoked QAnon and called Mr. Obama a racist slur in his set.Brian Talbert, the founder of Deplorable Pride, was contacted by the White House after he was barred from the L.G.B.T. pride parade in Charlotte, N.C. At Trumpstock, Mr. Talbert, who has a history of expressing anti-Muslim beliefs on social media, gave voice to hatred of Mr. Obama and Hillary Clinton, the former secretary of state and Mr. Trump's 2016 opponent.""I think she should be hanging at the end of a rope for treason,"" he said of Mrs. Clinton.Members of groups like these at once make up a critical portion of Arizona's conservative base, and espouse derogatory rhetoric that must repeatedly be repudiated, creating political difficulties for the state's Republican lawmakers. After a photograph emerged last April of members of Patriot Movement AZ posing with Gov. Doug Ducey, he said he had never heard of the group. ""I absolutely denounce their behavior,"" he added.Trumpstock attendees say they are used to being denounced, another quality they feel they share with the president. It's part of why they are protective of him, to the point that they refuse to acknowledge the possibility of a Trump loss in 2020.Mark Villalta said he had been stockpiling firearms, in case Mr. Trump's re-election is not successful.""Nothing less than a civil war would happen,"" Mr. Villalta said, his right hand reaching for a holstered handgun. ""I don't believe in violence, but I'll do what I got to do.""PhotographAttendees at an Arizona Trump festival viewed the president as their champion in a cultural fight.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump's imprint on the nation's appeals courts has been swift and historic. He has named judges with records on a range of issues important to Republicans -- and to his re-election.As a Republican candidate for the Texas Supreme Court, Don R. Willett flaunted his uncompromising conservatism, boasting of endorsements from groups with ""pro-life, pro-faith, pro-family"" credentials.""I intend to build such a fiercely conservative record on the court that I will be unconfirmable for any future federal judicial post -- and proudly so,"" a Republican rival quoted him telling party leaders.Judge Willett served a dozen years on the Texas bench. But rather than disqualifying him, his record there propelled him to the very job he had deemed beyond reach. President Trump nominated him to a federal appeals court, and Republicans in the Senate narrowly confirmed him on a party-line vote.As Mr. Trump seeks re-election, his rightward overhaul of the federal judiciary -- in particular, the highly influential appeals courts -- has been invoked as one of his most enduring accomplishments. While individual nominees have drawn scrutiny, The New York Times conducted a deep examination of all 51 new appellate judges to obtain a collective portrait of the Trump-populated bench.The review shows that the Trump class of appellate judges, much like the president himself, breaks significantly with the norms set by his Democratic and Republican predecessors, Barack Obama and George W. Bush.The lifetime appointees -- who make up more than a quarter of the entire appellate bench -- were more openly engaged in causes important to Republicans, such as opposition to gay marriage and to government funding for abortion.They more typically held a political post in the federal government and donated money to political candidates and causes. Just four had no discernible political activity in their past, and several were confirmed in spite of an unfavorable rating from the American Bar Association -- the first time that had happened at the appellate level in decades.Two-thirds are white men, and as a group, they are much younger than the Obama and Bush appointees.Once on the bench, the Trump appointees have stood out from their fellow judges, according to an analysis by The Times of more than 10,000 published decisions and dissents through December.When ruling on cases, they have been notably more likely than other Republican appointees to disagree with peers selected by Democratic presidents, and more likely to agree with those Republican appointees, suggesting they are more consistently conservative. Among the dozen or so judges that most fit the pattern, The Times found, are three Mr. Trump has signaled were on his Supreme Court shortlist.While the appellate courts favor consensus and disagreement remains relatively rare -- there were 125 instances when a Trump appointee wrote the majority opinion or dissent in a split decision -- the new judges have ruled on disputed cases across a range of contentious issues, including abortion, immigration, L.G.B.T. rights and lobbying requirements, the examination shows.One new judge, who had held a political job in the Trump administration, dissented on an issue of particular importance to the president: disclosure of his financial records. The judge, Neomi Rao, opposed a decision requiring the release of the documents to a congressional committee, a mandate the president continues to resist and is now before the Supreme Court.""They have long records of standing up, and they're not afraid of being unpopular,"" said Carrie Severino, president of the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative advocacy group that has pushed for the mold-breaking appointments. Ms. Severino once served as a law clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, one of the Supreme Court's most reliably conservative members.Stephen B. Burbank, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said Mr. Trump's appointments reflected attempts by recent presidents to draw the federal judiciary -- a constitutionally independent branch of government -- into policy debates more appropriate in Congress and the White House.""The problem as I see it is not that judges differ ideologically -- of course they do -- nor is it that a Republican president would look for someone with congenial ideological preferences,"" Mr. Burbank said. ""It's that in recent decades the search has been for hard-wired ideologues because they're reliable policy agents.""Mr. Trump has appointed more judges to the appeals courts, where eight of the nine current Supreme Court Justices served, than any other president during the first three years in office. Also known as circuits, the 13 courts are the last stop for federal cases before the Supreme Court, and nearly all federal litigation ends there.The Times examination was based on interviews with dozens of people close to the nomination process, including some of Mr. Trump's appointees; the analysis of thousands of published decisions and dissents since Mr. Trump became president; a review of detailed biographical and financial questionnaires submitted by all 168 appellate judges named by Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush, as well as their records, public statements and campaign contributions since 1989.Judicial appointments, a standard measure of a president's legacy, almost always draw partisan scrutiny, as Republicans tend to appoint conservative lawyers who interpret the Constitution according to what they say was its original meaning, and Democrats lean toward liberal appointees with a more expansive view. But Mr. Trump's record is particularly striking because of the divisive atmosphere, the examination shows, and the president's disruptive approach to governing. The White House did not respond to requests for comment, and none of the judges contacted by The Times would agree to be quoted.When Mr. Trump took office there were 103 unfilled federal court openings, in addition to a Supreme Court seat, in part because Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader of the Senate, and allies had refused to proceed with confirming many of Mr. Obama's nominees. The last time so many vacancies had been left to a successor of the opposing party was when the federal bench was expanded by dozens of judges under President George H.W. Bush.Mr. Trump wasted no time in seizing the opportunity. During his first three years in office, with Mr. McConnell's assistance, he was able to name nearly as many appellate judges as Mr. Obama had appointed over two terms.And he did so with great political flourish. More than one-third of the Trump appointees have filled seats previously occupied by judges appointed by Democrats, tipping the balance toward conservatives in some circuits that include largely Democratic states like New York and Connecticut. Even in the San Francisco-based Ninth Circuit, a reliably liberal appeals court, Mr. Trump has significantly narrowed the gap between judges appointed by Democratic and Republican presidents.With Republicans and Democrats in Congress retreating to their corners, many of the Trump appointees have benefited from Republicans' decision to extend a contentious and partisan confirmation path that upended bipartisan Senate practices.Two-thirds of the new appellate judges failed to win the support of 60 senators, historically a requirement of consensus that was first jettisoned by the Democratic-controlled Senate midway through the Obama administration because Republicans were blocking nominees to the D.C. Circuit. After he became majority leader, Mr. McConnell followed suit when Democrats initially blocked Mr. Trump's first Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch.About a third did not receive the signoff of both home-state senators, a courtesy for a nomination to move forward that was tossed aside in late 2017 by Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, then the Judiciary Committee's Republican chairman. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mr. Grassley's successor in that role, carried the decision forward. Crucially, that meant Mr. Trump did not have to compromise on his appellate picks in states with a Democratic senator.Just two found unanimous support across the aisle, a sharp drop from both the Obama and Bush nominees.According to a tally by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative policy group, Mr. Trump's appointees across the judiciary have drawn three times more ""no"" votes in the Senate than all confirmed judges in the 20th century combined. So far, Mr. Trump has appointed more than 185 federal judges.On the appellate bench, Mr. Trump's appointees have drawn nearly twice as many ""no"" votes as did those of Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama, The Times's analysis shows.In a history-making intervention, one of Mr. Trump's appellate picks was confirmed only when Vice President Mike Pence broke a 50-50 deadlock. It was Mr. Pence's 12th tiebreaking vote in the Senate, the most of anyone in his office since the 1870s, and the only time a vice president installed a nominee to the bench.The judge, Jonathan A. Kobes, had been working on Capitol Hill as an aide to a Republican senator. He was rated unqualified by the American Bar Association, which questioned his ability to reflect ""complex legal analysis"" and ""knowledge of the law"" in his writing.He got the job anyway, with Mr. Grassley proclaiming on Twitter in December 2018 that the confirmation had ""made HISTORY."" Judge Kobes became Mr. Trump's 30th confirmed appointee to the appellate bench.Democrats, powerless to block the nominees, have been sidelined as angry bystanders.Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, called Mr. Trump's appellate appointees ""far outside the judicial mainstream,"" adding that she believed Republicans were using them to advance ""a particular agenda."" She voted against all but 14 of the appellate nominees.""Americans are certainly aware of Supreme Court nominations,"" Ms. Feinstein said in a statement to The Times, ""but most don't pay close attention to the lower courts, which can have an even more direct effect on their lives.""From Fringe to MainstreamMr. Trump has staked his presidency on upending conventions, and his approach to the judiciary breaks sharply with that of past presidents.He unapologetically views judges as agents of the presidents who appointed them -- calling out an ""Obama judge,"" for instance, for ruling against the Trump administration in an immigration case. He frequently attributes his popularity among Republicans to his judicial appointments. And he has not been shy about politicizing the process.""95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party,"" he wrote on Twitter in January. ""Thank you! 191 Federal Judges (a record), and two Supreme Court Justices, approved. Best Economy & Employment Numbers EVER. Thank you to our great New, Smart and Nimble REPUBLICAN PARTY. Join now, it's where people want to be!""In his State of the Union address in February, he bragged about his judicial appointments, promising, ""We have many in the pipeline."" A week later, the Senate approved his 51st nominee to the appeals bench; 41 others now await votes for the lower courts.While federal judges of all stripes take an oath of impartiality and reject the notion that they do a president's bidding -- Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. recently described an independent judiciary as ""a key source of national unity and stability"" -- the examination by The Times shows that the Trump administration has filled the appellate courts with formidable allies who fought for a range of issues important to Republicans.Democratic presidents have also sought out reliable political allies when filling some judicial posts, but Mr. Trump's approach has left little to chance.His appointees include former litigators who argued against legalizing same-sex marriage; advocated blocking Medicaid reimbursements to health care providers performing abortions; argued that corporations with religious owners could not be required to pay for insurance coverage of certain forms of birth control; and supported the Trump administration's choice to include a question about citizenship on the census.In the past, many conservatives have been left disappointed when judges appointed by Republican presidents were seen to have lost their resolve on the bench. Now what matters most with Mr. Trump's appointees, said Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law Houston, is that they come with rock-solid conservative résumés.""You have to demand a paper trail -- no more skeleton nominees,"" said Mr. Blackman, who advised the presidential campaign of Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a Republican, and is a strong supporter of the Trump approach.One standout appointee, Kyle Duncan, now an appellate judge in New Orleans, fought to uphold Louisiana's gay-marriage ban before the Supreme Court, defended a North Carolina law restricting transgender people from using their preferred bathrooms and represented Hobby Lobby when it sued the federal government over the requirement that it provide employees with insurance coverage for some birth control.He had worked as general counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a legal advocacy group that has been a strong defender of the religious right.Responding to questions from senators about the North Carolina law, he said he had been ""advancing not my own personal beliefs but legal arguments on behalf of my client's interests, just as I have done in every case to the best of my ability.""Judge Stephanos Bibas, a Trump appointee to the federal appeals court in Philadelphia, last September emphasized the independence of judges once they took the bench, saying, ""We certainly are not viewing ourselves as members of teams or camps or parties.""Many of the appointees have elite credentials, with nearly half having trained as lawyers at Harvard, Stanford, the University of Chicago or Yale, and more than a third having clerked for a Supreme Court justice, surpassing the appointees of both Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush.But Mr. Trump's appellate picks often have less judicial experience, The Times found. About 40 percent previously served as a judge, compared with more than half of the Bush and Obama appointees.Mr. Trump named some of his judges before they received a rating from the American Bar Association, which Republicans have long viewed as biased against their nominees. Three deemed unqualified were confirmed -- a step not taken at the appellate level since at least 1975, when a former governor of Connecticut nominated by former Presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford joined the bench, according to Sheldon Goldman, a political scientist focusing on the judiciary.Mr. Trump is betting that the judges will back Republican priorities for a long time: The median age of the appointees is five-and-a-half years younger than it was under Mr. Obama, and three-and-a-half years younger than under Mr. Bush. Thirty-three percent were under 45 when appointed, compared with just five percent under Mr. Obama and 19 percent under Mr. Bush. And countering a trend of increasing diversity on the appellate bench under Mr. Obama, two-thirds of Mr. Trump's appointees are white men.They are also well off: Their median net worth is nearly $2 million -- adjusted for inflation, that is on a par with the worth of Obama appointees, and about a half-million dollars more than that of Bush appointees.Perhaps most telling, all but eight of the new judges have had ties to the Federalist Society, a legal group that has been central to the White House's appointment process and ascendant in Republican circles in recent years for its advocacy of strictly interpreting the Constitution.Nearly twice as many appointees have had ties to the group as did those of Mr. Trump's most recent Republican predecessor, Mr. Bush. Early this year, a proposal was circulated among federal judges by the court system's ethical advisory arm that would ban membership in the group.The Trump appointees turned out in big numbers at its national convention in Washington in November. Many participated in panel discussions and attended a black-tie dinner, where Donald F. McGahn II, a former White House counsel for Mr. Trump, extolled the group's extraordinary trajectory.""We have seen our views go from the fringe, views that in years past would inhibit someone's chances to be considered for the federal bench,"" he said, ""to being the center of the conversation.""Battle-Tested ConservativesJudge Willett, the former Texas Supreme Court justice, had a paper trail replete with political connections and ties to prominent Texas Republicans when he was nominated to the federal bench in 2017.He had raised over $4 million for two campaigns for the state bench, more than half of it from lawyers, lobbyists and oil interests, according to the National Institute on Money in Politics. He also had more than 25,000 posts on Twitter that often focused on current affairs and Republican politics, even some jabbing Mr. Trump as a candidate.During the last Republican administration, under Mr. Bush, he had advised judicial nominees ""to bob and weave, be the teeniest tiniest target you can be,"" Judge Willett said during a speech in 2010, adding, ""You want to be as bland, forgettable and unremarkable as possible.""No more. The Trump approach has translated into a new breed of appellate appointees with open experience in ideological and political warfare.John Malcolm, a conservative legal scholar at the Heritage Foundation, said he was looking for ""people who have the strength of their convictions."" He drew up a list in 2016 of recommended Supreme Court nominees that was embraced by Mr. Trump.About three-quarters of Mr. Trump's appellate appointees donated to political candidates and causes, a significantly higher proportion than Mr. Obama's and slightly ahead of Mr. Bush's, according to an analysis of data from the National Institute on Money in Politics and the Center for Responsive Politics.They were also more likely than the Obama and Bush nominees to have been affiliated with an election campaign in the decade before their appointment.Judge Duncan, previously a renowned conservative litigator, had volunteered for the 2016 presidential campaign of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and was a donor and poll watcher for Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential bid.At least seven of his fellow appointees had ties to the Trump administration itself. Judge Rao had run a regulatory office in the White House. Judges Steven J. Menashi and Gregory G. Katsas had worked in the office of the White House counsel. Judge Patrick J. Bumatay had been a counselor to the attorney general, while Judge Lawrence J.C. VanDyke had been tapped for the Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division. Judges Katsas and Andrew L. Brasher had volunteered for Mr. Trump's transition team. And Judge Chad A. Readler had done legal work for Mr. Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.He later became acting head of the Justice Department's civil division, putting him in charge of defending nearly every high-profile presidential policy that came under attack in the courts.Judge L. Steven Grasz, in the year he was nominated to the appeals court in Nebraska, had sat on the board of the anti-abortion Nebraska Family Alliance and served as assistant secretary of Nebraskans for the Death Penalty.Other appointees had held state jobs that showcased their conservative -- and sometimes partisan -- credentials.Nearly a quarter of them worked in the office of a Republican state attorney general. That was about triple the percentage of Bush nominees, The Times found. Mostly, they served as solicitors general or their deputies, putting them on the front lines in court battles over contentious state laws.At least eight actively fought against legalizing gay marriage, and at least as many argued for immigration positions now embraced by the Trump administration. At least 18 sought to limit access to abortion or contraception.Some nominees amassed their conservative credentials by filing friend-of-the-court briefs, weighing in on cases especially important to Republicans.Judge VanDyke, appointed to the Ninth Circuit in Nevada, had been prolific. As solicitor general of Montana, according to published emails, he encouraged the state's attorney general to support a 20-week abortion ban in Arizona, to defend a professional photographer's refusal to shoot a same-sex commitment ceremony in New Mexico and to challenge a ban on semiautomatic weapons in New York.The fact that Montana was not directly affected by the cases did not matter. In an email to the solicitor general in Alabama -- who would also be named to the appellate bench by Mr. Trump -- he wrote about the New York ban: ""Semiautomatic firearms are fun to hunt elk with, as the attached picture attests :)."" The Great Falls Tribune, which obtained the emails, published a photo of the now-judge in hunting garb.Judge Michael H. Park, another appointee, had come to the support of the Trump administration in its unsuccessful effort to add a citizenship question to the census. As a private lawyer representing the Project on Fair Representation, a conservative group, he argued in 2018 that the question was justified, calling it ""immensely helpful to redistricting and voting rights litigation.""The Supreme Court disagreed. Four months after he weighed in, it was announced that Mr. Trump intended to nominate him to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York.'Judicial Courage'Some of Mr. Trump's choices for the appeals courts had already landed on his short list for Supreme Court nominations. Once on the bench, they quickly confirmed that they could shake things up.Three on that short list -- Judges Joan Larsen, David R. Stras and Amul Thapar -- were among those identified by The Times as having a penchant for disagreeing with Democratic nominees. They voted differently from those judges 23 percent of the time, but from judges appointed by Republican presidents only four percent of the time.Judge Larsen and Judge Stras had been state supreme court justices named by Republican governors in their home states. Judge Thapar was elevated by Mr. Trump from a federal district court in Kentucky, where he had been appointed by Mr. Bush.Unlike lower courts, the appellate courts, which review other courts' decisions, do not have juries. Instead, cases are largely decided by panels of three judges, usually selected randomly from all of the judges in the circuit.There is a culture of consensus in most circuits, and in the cases reviewed by The Times, appellate judges of both parties agreed with one another the vast majority of times. But when they did not, the Trump appointees stood out.On panels that had members appointed by presidents of the same party, dissent occurred just 7 percent of the time. The rate jumped to 12 percent on panels that included a mix of judges appointed by both Democrats and Republicans.But when a Trump appointee wrote an opinion for a panel with a lone Democrat, or served as the only Republican appointee, the dissent rate rose to 17 percent -- meaning the likelihood of dissent was nearly 1.5 times higher if a Trump appointee was involved.Writing a dissent marks a bold break from fellow members of the bench, experts say, and by definition sets the judge apart. The dissenting opinions can also inform future legal arguments and cases.""You're going to get some judges who will bite their tongue and say, 'These are my colleagues -- I'm not going to rock the boat unless I feel strongly about it,""' said Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former deputy director of the Federal Judicial Center, the research and education arm of the federal court system.In other instances, however, judges ""go in slashing and burning"" with no regard for comity -- or with an eye to drawing attention to themselves, he said. ""Some of them obviously are going to be thinking about the next vacancy on the Supreme Court,"" Mr. Wheeler said.In a speech in 2017, Mr. McGahn, the former White House counsel and a main driver of the Trump selection process, said ""judicial courage"" was as important as judicial independence.The Times analysis included 10,025 opinions of three-judge panels from 2017 through 2019 that were tagged as ""published, written and signed"" in the federal center's integrated case database.It covered more than 1,975 cases involving at least one Trump appointee. Because many of Mr. Trump's earliest appointments occurred in appellate courts dominated by judges named by Republicans, more than half of those cases did not involve panels with judges appointed by a Democrat.Of the 125 cases in which a Trump appointee wrote a dissent or an opinion eliciting dissent, about half involved civil rights or criminal matters. The others touched on a wide variety of topics, from transgender rights to pregnancy discrimination to the limits of police powers.In one instance, a Trump appointee joined with a Bush appointee to strike down a key part of the Affordable Care Act. A Democratic-nominated judge dissented.Amy Coney Barrett, another judge on Mr. Trump's Supreme Court shortlist, was among the new appointees who wrote a dissent cited by conservatives.Judge Barrett, a noted originalist, once served as a clerk to former Justice Antonin Scalia. But she stood out among the Trump appointees not by disagreeing with Democratic appointees but by taking on two judges named by former President Ronald Reagan, a Republican.The subject was Second Amendment gun rights, and Ms. Barrett took a broader view than her colleagues.The owner of a therapeutic shoe-insert company had pleaded guilty to mail fraud and, as a felon, was barred from owning a gun. He objected, claiming the penalty was unconstitutional.The two Reagan appointees upheld a lower-court ruling against the man. Their decision was based in part on the notion that governments banned felons from owning firearms because they were considered more likely to abuse them.But in dissenting, Judge Barrett argued that lawmakers could prohibit only violent people from owning firearms, and that the government had not proved that a nonviolent felon would turn violent.""History does not support the proposition that felons lose their Second Amendment rights solely because of their status as felons,"" she wrote.A dissent by another new appointee, Judge Rao, the former Trump administration official, staked out territory important to the president and his allies.Two appellate judges, both appointed by Democrats, ruled that Mr. Trump's accountants had to comply with a congressional subpoena for eight years of his financial records.Judge Rao, who holds the appellate seat vacated by Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, questioned whether Democrats in the House of Representatives had overshot their authority. At a hearing on the case, she suggested the Democrats were, in effect, seeking the ""regulation of the president.""In her 67-page dissent, she wrote that the subpoena went beyond Congress's authority, and that the documents in question could be obtained only in an impeachment inquiry.She also chided her fellow judges for allowing Congress to conduct ""a roving inquisition over a co-equal branch of government,"" suggesting they had chosen to fixate on worst-case scenarios.The case has been appealed to the Supreme Court, where two Trump appointees, Justice Kavanaugh and Justice Gorsuch, will help determine its fate.Tipping the BalanceThe push in the Senate last November to confirm a White House lawyer for a top federal judgeship in New York unnerved Democrats.The lawyer, Steven Menashi had a trail of inflammatory writings about feminism and multiculturalism. He had declined to answer specific questions about his role in the Trump administration on family detentions and education policy.And he had managed to get a confirmation vote only because Republicans did away with a courtesy rule letting home-state senators -- in this case, Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer -- block nominees they found unworthy. Mr. Schumer had described him as ""a textbook example of someone who does not deserve to sit on the federal bench.""Not only did he get his seat on the Second Circuit, but his appointment marked a signature moment in Mr. Trump's bid to tilt the nation's appellate courts to the right: Judge Menashi's confirmation flipped the balance toward Republican appointees in a circuit encompassing three states -- New York, Connecticut and Vermont -- dominated at nearly every level by Democrats.Judges named by Mr. Trump have forged new majorities in two other circuits -- the Third and the 11th. And they have come close in the nation's largest appeals court, the Ninth, based in San Francisco, which has long issued rulings favorable to liberal causes.The unequal split between Democratic and Republican appointees can give the circuits distinct reputations as liberal or conservative.Mr. Trump has called the Ninth Circuit ""out of control"" and a ""complete & total disaster,"" and he has suggested that some of its decisions related to immigration and the border have threatened national security.In one case, the court ruled that the Trump administration could not erase Obama-era protections for so-called Dreamers, children brought into the United States illegally.In another, it blocked the administration's effort to speed up the deportation of asylum seekers. It also rejected Mr. Trump's policy restricting travel from eight countries, six of them largely Muslim.""Every case that gets filed in the Ninth Circuit, we get beaten,"" Mr. Trump complained in 2018. ""It's a disgrace.""At the close of the Obama administration, 18 judges on the circuit had been appointed by Democratic presidents, seven had been named by Republicans and four seats were vacant. Through his appointments, Mr. Trump has whittled the majority held by Democratic appointees to just three making it less likely that a liberal philosophy can dominate so thoroughly.Allies of the president have celebrated. In emails to supporters, the National Organization for Marriage, a group established to fight the legalization of same-sex marriage, lauded the change ""from the most liberal court in the country to one that is much more balanced.""Brian S. Brown, president of the group, heralded that Mr. Trump was remaking the court and others across the country. ""Judges will be with us for a lot longer than any politician who holds office,"" he wrote.Conservatives have also celebrated Trump appointees in circuits where the balance of power has not shifted. Their votes have proved significant in so-called en-banc hearings -- when a decision by a panel of appellate judges is reviewed by a larger group of judges.In 2014, a Louisiana law required doctors performing abortions to be able to admit patients to a hospital within 30 miles of their clinic. Opponents of the law predicted a chilling effect on access to abortions. Those in favor argued that it protected women seeking abortions by making sure doctors were competent.The case, now being decided by the Supreme Court, has been playing out in federal courts for years. A district court judge struck down the law, but was reversed by a divided three-judge panel of the Fifth Circuit. When opponents of the law asked all judges of the circuit to hear an appeal, the request was denied, 9-6, with four judges appointed by Mr. Trump joining the majority.At an en-banc hearing in Missouri, four Trump-appointed judges in the Eighth Circuit joined a 6-5 decision that loosened disclosure requirements for political activists.In the case, a man who ran a nonprofit advocating conservative causes had sued Missouri officials over a lobbying registration law he deemed unconstitutional. He was not a lobbyist, he argued, addressing lawmakers often but not spending or receiving money for it. A lower court and a three-judge appeals panel had sided with the state, requiring him to register out of transparency.Among the four Trump appointees who overturned that ruling were Judge Kobes, the former Senate aide who had been confirmed when Mr. Pence offered up a tiebreaking vote; Judge Stras, who was on Mr. Trump's shortlist for the Supreme Court; and Judge Grasz of Nebraska.As he seeks re-election, Mr. Trump has showcased his role in fulfilling the Republican judicial agenda. One afternoon last November, he gathered an array of Republican leaders and conservative judicial activists to celebrate his success.""I've always heard, actually, that when you become president, the most -- single most -- important thing you can do is federal judges,"" he said.How the Numbers Were CalculatedIn examining the president's judicial appointments, The Times compiled two databases of information about judges who were named to the U.S. Court of Appeals by Mr. Trump and his predecessors.One focused on the professional and political backgrounds of judges appointed by Mr. Trump, Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush. The other analyzed published opinions in the court's 12 regional circuits to gain insights into ruling patterns and rates of dissent.The BiographiesThe Times compared the appellate judges' experiences outside the court. All told, there were 168 appointees -- 51 by Mr. Trump, 55 by Mr. Obama and 62 by Mr. Bush.The database drew primarily on biographical questionnaires the appointees had submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee, obtained from staff members, the Congressional Record and other sources. They listed jobs and internships held since college, judicial clerkships, club memberships, affiliations with political campaigns and other information. Some judges volunteered more detail than others.Separately, campaign finance data was compiled from two sources: the National Institute on Money in Politics, which has access to state donations since 2000 and federal ones since 2010, and the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks federal donations beginning in 1989. In searching the donations, The Times sometimes found matches by using variations of judges' names, including maiden names, as well as other relevant information like employment.Calculations of partisan donations were based on federal contributions to political candidates or causes of the same party as the judge's appointing president. Past political activity was measured more broadly and included work for politicians of any party; volunteer or paid work for political campaigns of any party; memberships affiliated with any party; donations to campaigns of any party; participation as a candidate for any party; references to ""Republican"" or ""Democrat"" in any answer in the questionnaire; and work in a political post in the federal government, including political duties assigned to a federal employee.The age of judges on their appointment date was based on years of birth provided by the Federal Judicial Center, the official clearinghouse for court research.The Rulings and DissentsThe database includes more than 10,000 opinions published from 2017 through last year in the 12 regional circuit courts. The 13th appeals court, the Federal Circuit, hears mostly intellectual property cases and has no Trump appointees.The case list was published by the Federal Judicial Center. Only cases designated ""published, written and signed"" were included in the analysis, because they carry the weight of precedence and represent the most legally impactful work. For consistency, all of the cases involved a standard three-judge panel with a named opinion author.For every case, The Times parsed the text of the opinion to identify the judges, whose names are redacted from the judicial center's data. Additional information about the judges was obtained by joining the case data to a separate biography data set kept by the center.The data was analyzed in two ways: first, to determine how often cases involved a dissent, and second, to determine how often individual judges agreed or disagreed with their two colleagues on a panel.On the case level, the data showed that when a judge named by Mr. Trump served in a pivotal role -- as the author of an opinion on a panel with only one Democratic appointee, or as the only Republican appointee on a panel -- the rate of dissent increased significantly.For individual judges, the analysis split each panel into three pairings. If the case was unanimously decided, all judges were deemed to have agreed. If one judge dissented, that judge was deemed to have disagreed with the other two. While judges appointed by presidents of different parties were more likely to disagree than judges appointed by presidents of the same party, the difference was far more pronounced for many, though not all, of the new Trump appointees, the analysis found.There were caveats to the findings. Some of the circuits have a higher dissent rate overall, for example, and some circuits appear more often in the database because they conduct a higher share of their work in the form of published opinions.Even accounting for those factors, the findings were supported by a separate regression analysis, which accounted for other variables, including the circuit hearing the case, the topic before the court, the type of appeal and whether the ruling affirmed or overturned a decision by a lower court.Hillary Flynn and Jaclyn Peiser contributed reporting.

| Jump to first hitEfforts to bring wavering Republicans into line appeared to be working as President Trump's lawyers argued that anything a president did to win re-election was ""in the public interest.""WASHINGTON -- The White House and Senate Republicans worked aggressively on Wednesday to discount damaging revelations from John R. Bolton and line up the votes to block new witnesses from testifying in President Trump's impeachment trial, in a push to bring the proceeding to a swift close.As the Senate opened a two-day, 16-hour period of questioning from senators, Mr. Trump laced into Mr. Bolton, his former national security adviser, whose unpublished manuscript contains an account that contradicts his impeachment defense. The president described Mr. Bolton on Twitter as a warmonger who had ""begged"" for his job, was fired, and then wrote ""a nasty & untrue book.""On Capitol Hill, Mr. Trump's aides circulated a letter informing Mr. Bolton that the White House was moving to block publication of his forthcoming book, in which he wrote that the president refused to release military aid to Ukraine until its leaders committed to investigating his political rivals. That is a core element of the Democrats' case, which charges Mr. Trump with seeking to enlist a foreign government to help him win re-election this year.Before the trial convened, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, and other Republicans signaled that they were regaining confidence that they would be able to cobble together the 51 votes needed to block new witnesses and documents and bring the trial to an acquittal verdict as soon as Friday, after the revelations from Mr. Bolton, reported Sunday by The New York Times, had threatened to knock their plans off course.Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Senate Republican, declared that he had ""heard enough"" and predicted that the Senate would vote to acquit the president by week's end.""I'm ready to vote on final judgment,"" Mr. Barrasso told reporters. Asked if Republicans planned to move directly to a vote on the two articles of impeachment on Friday, Mr. Barrasso said, ""Yes, that's the plan.""By Wednesday afternoon, Democrats were sounding a note of pessimism about the prospect of witnesses and securing new evidence in the trial, even as they used their questions to make the case that an impeachment trial without additional witnesses and documents amounted to a cover-up.""We've always known it will be an uphill fight on witnesses and documents because the president and Mitch McConnell put huge pressure on these folks,"" Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said during a break in the trial.""Is it more likely than not? Probably no,"" Mr. Schumer said. ""But is it a decent, good chance? Yes.""For Republicans, it appeared as if they were on the verge of giving Mr. Trump what he has wanted all along: an acquittal that he could boast about on the campaign trail -- delivered before he goes to the Capitol next Tuesday for his State of the Union address.Inside the Senate chamber, senators spent eight hours grilling House managers and White House lawyers about the definition of obstruction; the meaning of executive privilege; the history of security aid to Ukraine; the role of Hunter Biden, the son of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., on the board of a Ukrainian energy company; the whistle-blower who first raised concerns about Mr. Trump's call with the president of Ukraine; and whether, as Mr. Trump's legal team asserted, it was perfectly fine for the president to solicit damaging information about the Bidens from Ukraine.In accordance with impeachment protocol, senators wrote their queries on small cards, which were read aloud by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who presided over the trial. In their responses, Mr. Trump's lawyers offered their most expansive defense of the president to date, effectively arguing that a president cannot be removed from office for demanding political favors if he believes his re-election is in the national interest.""Every public official I know believes that his election is in the public interest,"" said Alan M. Dershowitz, the celebrity defense lawyer and constitutional scholar who is part of the Mr. Trump's legal team. ""Mostly, you're right.""""If the president does something which he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment,"" he said.Many of the arguments and much the day was tailored to convincing a few Republicans who remained holdouts on the question of whether to call witnesses. Mr. McConnell gave his party's first question on Wednesday to Senators Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in an effort to allay the concerns of the three lawmakers, Republican moderates who are swing votes on the issue. The trio teamed up to ask Mr. Trump's lawyers how they should judge the president if they conclude he acted in the Ukraine matter with both political and policy motives.The selection of Ms. Collins, who is facing the toughest re-election campaign in her long Senate career, was revealing: It suggested that Mr. McConnell was keenly focused on giving her every opportunity to have her voice heard before moving forward. When she rose to announce herself, she became the first senator other than the two leaders to have a speaking role in the trial.Notably absent from the group was the fourth Republican who had expressed interest in witnesses: Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a close friend of Mr. McConnell's who has said he will not decide whether to support witnesses until after the question period has closed.Later in the evening, Mr. Romney hinted that he was seeking to better understand why Mr. Trump withheld security aid for Ukraine, asking White House lawyers for the specific date that the president first ordered a hold on the assistance. Patrick Philbin, a deputy White House counsel, did not provide a direct answer, saying there was no evidence of a specific date and offering only testimony showing that budget officials were aware of the hold in late June.On Tuesday, Mr. McConnell had privately warned his rank-and-file members that he did not currently have the votes to stop Democrats from summoning witnesses. One after the other on Wednesday, in statements and interviews in the Capitol, they made clear they would side with their leader.Senator Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania, who had previously floated the idea of a witness deal, said Wednesday that he was ""very, very skeptical"" of new witnesses. Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado, facing a tough re-election in a swing state, issued a statement saying that he had heard enough and would vote against hearing from anyone else. Senator Martha McSally of Arizona, who is also facing a difficult election, tweeted later Wednesday: ""I have heard enough. It is time to vote.""Mr. McConnell summoned Ms. Murkowski to his office on Wednesday morning for a private meeting before the trial began, and she emerged refusing to answer questions about whether she would ultimately support the call for witnesses.""We still got some folks who are, like I said, assessing,"" said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the second-ranking Senate Republican. But the leaders were planning as if the defeat of a bid for witnesses was a certainty; Mr. Thune said it was likely that if it did fail, Republicans would move swiftly for an acquittal.Democrats would need the votes of four Republicans to compel the Senate to subpoena witnesses and new documents. But it seems increasingly likely that Mr. Alexander, who is retiring from the Senate and is thus free to do as he chooses without political repercussions, would not break from his party.Mr. Trump is charged with abusing his power and obstructing Congress by pressuring Ukraine to investigate his political rivals, including Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden, and concealing evidence of it from lawmakers who were investigating.In the first hint of a possible crack in Democratic unity, Senator Doug Jones of Alabama suggested Wednesday that he might vote to acquit Mr. Trump on the charge of obstruction of Congress, though he said that the president's own behavior was strengthening the case against him. And Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia said he thought that Hunter Biden might be a relevant witness.""I'm still looking at that very closely; there are some things that trouble me about it,"" Mr. Jones said, without elaborating. ""But I will tell you this about the obstruction charge: The more I see the president of the United States attacking witnesses, the stronger that case gets.""Fielding friendly questions from Democratic senators, House managers reiterated the heart of their case and accused Mr. Trump's lawyers of falsely stating that there was no evidence that Mr. Trump linked security assistance to investigations. Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the lead House impeachment manager, responded to Mr. Dershowitz's argument that a president who believed his re-election was in the national interest could demand a quid pro quo to help himself politically without consequence was ""very odd.""""If you say you can't hold a president accountable in an election year where they're trying to cheat in that election, then you are giving them carte blanche,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""All quid pro quos are not the same. Some are legitimate and some are corrupt.""Democrats have argued that Mr. Trump's pressure campaign on Ukraine was precisely the kind of corrupt scheme that the nation's founders had in mind when they created impeachment, fearing that an out-of-control president would abuse his power for personal gain. But throughout the day, lawyers for Mr. Trump argued that all elected officials make policy decisions to help themselves get re-elected.Answering the question from the three Republican moderates, Mr. Philbin said that a president could not be removed for a ""mixed-motive situation"" in which he is acting out of both personal and policy concerns.""There's always some personal interest in the electoral outcome of policy decisions and there's nothing wrong with that,"" Mr. Philbin told senators. ""That's part of representative democracy.""In one case, White House lawyers struggled to answer a question from Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski, admitting that they had no evidence to counter Democratic arguments that Mr. Trump became interested in investigations of Joseph Biden in 2019 only after Mr. Biden became a candidate for president.Mr. Trump's legal team also argued that the House needed to prove its case ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" -- a standard of proof that legal experts say has no basis in either the Constitution or the rules of the Senate. And the legal team said that the case was merely ""based on a policy difference"" between the president and the career diplomats who sounded the alarm on his pressure campaign in Ukraine.While Chief Justice Roberts spent the day reading senators' words aloud, he did exercise his judgment on one key point, refusing to reveal the identity of the C.I.A. whistle-blower who filed the complaint that spurred the impeachment inquiry. Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, sought unsuccessfully to ask a question about the origins of the investigation that named the whistle-blower, according to a person familiar with the debate. The query was rejected repeatedly.White House lawyers had help making sure their speakers stayed within a five-minute time limit that Chief Justice Roberts strictly enforced, and he occasionally cut off speakers midsentence. Staff for the lawyers held up small white cue cards showing when the clock was about to run out; the Democratic House managers did not appear to have such a system.Reporting was contributed by Catie Edmondson, Nicholas Fandos, Patricia Mazzei and Emily Cochrane.PhotographSenator Mitt Romney of Utah before Wednesday's session.

| Jump to first hitWith impeachment behind the president, his re-election campaign wants to address political weaknesses exacerbated by his policies and behavior.WASHINGTON -- Buoyed by his impeachment acquittal and the muddled Democratic primary race, President Trump and his campaign are turning to address his re-election bid's greatest weaknesses with an aggressive, well-funded but uncertain effort to win back suburban voters turned off by his policies and behavior.His campaign is aiming to regain these voters in battleground states like Pennsylvania and Michigan, after losing many of them to Democrats in the 2018 midterms. Advisers hope to expand the electoral map for November by winning moderate-leaning states like Minnesota and New Hampshire. And the White House is gearing up to help with policy issues directed at swing states, such as the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada and paid family leave for federal workers.Trump campaign officials are also stockpiling cash to help with these efforts, with $200 million in the bank now and fund-raising continuing at a brisk pace. They have put up television ads relatively early in the race, allocating $6 million for the final three months of 2019 to highlight a booming economy and the low unemployment numbers.Among the goals is trying to appeal to black voters and suburban and upper-income white voters with ads such as a spot focusing on criminal justice reform that first aired during the Super Bowl and is continuing on cable channels with large female audiences, like Bravo and Lifetime.Yet Mr. Trump's messaging, like so much else about his approach to politics, is contradictory. For all the focus on appealing to moderates, the campaign is also engaging the president's hard-core supporters with Facebook ads warning of the danger of undocumented ""aliens"" and their ""invasion"" of the U.S., and decrying ""the impeachment hoax,"" while also promoting polarizing policies like curtailing immigration.Those inflammatory, targeted ads are ones that suburban voters may never see, a reflection of the campaign's broad strategy: Keep his conservative base energized and chip away at his problems in the suburbs and communities of color.The challenge facing Mr. Trump's advisers remains the same as it has been since 2017: The president is among the most deeply divisive leaders in the nation's history, whose conduct has helped accelerate a realignment of moderate suburban voters toward Democrats. These voters have been the cornerstone of Democrats' electoral revival since 2016, helping them flip governorships and propelling their capture of the House.Mr. Trump cannot win a second term without winning back suburban voters and independents in a handful of states he carried in 2016. But he is highly averse to staying on script and delivering a consistent message aimed at moderate voters rather than his hard-core admirers, or his own need to get things off his chest.Mr. Trump's advisers argue that the suburban voters who eschewed Republicans in the 2018 midterms will vote differently when the president's name is on the ballot. And they are lacing the strong economy into much of their messaging and policy plans: Mr. Trump himself sees the economy as his calling card and is monitoring fluctuations in stock market closely, and his team thinks the economy is one of their best selling points in the suburbs.""Suburban women is where he has a challenge,"" said Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican from North Dakota.""I think the biggest problem that he has with suburban women is the part that so many in his base like about him,"" Mr. Cramer said. ""His rhetoric, his punching down at his opponents. It's so different than anything they've seen.""Scott Reed, the top political adviser to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, nodded to the fleeting nature of Trump-era politics as he assessed the electoral landscape for the president.""Politics in Trumpville are great right now, but these days, a week feels like three months and we have a long way to go,"" Mr. Reed said.Republican National Committee officials are tracking the suburban problem. In 2016, about 100,000 Michigan residents who voted in state legislative races left the box for president empty. Many of those voters were men in the suburbs, R.N.C. officials said, and were people who didn't believe Mr. Trump was truly a conservative, but who have come back after seeing him deliver on conservative judicial appointments and a tax-cut bill.But suburban women remain difficult to sway, Trump advisers acknowledge. Some messages have moved the dial, if only temporarily: When Mr. Trump talks about Democrats wanting to provide government health care benefits to undocumented immigrants, for instance, Republican officials have seen an uptick of support in their own surveys of the suburbs of Pennsylvania. When Mr. Trump paints the entire Democratic field, falsely, as supporting ending private health insurance, his advisers see room for him to grow. But they admit that it's a difficult line to walk.The G.O.P. strategy ultimately depends on who his Democratic opponent turns out to be. And Mr. Trump faces an unknown in Michael R. Bloomberg, a billionaire former New York City mayor running a general election strategy, who is spending so much money that Mr. Trump's advisers acknowledged that he cannot be ignored even if Mr. Bloomberg loses the Democratic nomination.With the Democrats enmeshed in the start of their primary season, Mr. Trump is beginning his own new phase: He has reasons to feel reassured about his prospects as he turns more fully to his re-election effort, and the apparatus of the White House and the Republican Party are more able to focus on winning him a second term.Mr. Trump's approval ratings have inched up and he's now around where the last three incumbent presidents were at the start of their own, successful, re-elections. And the economy shows no signs of slowing.""The White House and the campaign should focus 100 percent on the economic growth and opportunity society Trump is creating for America,"" Mr. Reed said, somewhat hopefully.But greater confidence and a freer hand can lead Mr. Trump to take risks: His phone call with the Ukrainian president on July 25, 2019, which ultimately helped lead to his impeachment in the House, came after he had seen the end of the two-year investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Just this past week, Mr. Trump fired from the White House two witnesses and an ambassador who testified in the House impeachment inquiry, including Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a decorated war veteran, prompting outrage from Democrats and private concern among some Republican lawmakers. On Saturday, he tweeted that Colonel Vindman had earned his dismissal.As Mr. Trump has repeatedly shown, he can show a measure of discipline in one moment -- like his teleprompter-ready speech at the State of the Union that was sprinkled with appeals to different demographic groups -- and then do or say something that alienates swing voters.His 62-minute stemwinder of retribution in the East Room of the White House the day after the acquittal was the type of ventilating performance Mr. Trump had been craving, but which some advisers acknowledge undermines the carefully-crafted efforts at broadening his appeal.""Many people are evaluating the president based on his conduct and behavior in office rather than the state of the economy,"" said Whit Ayres, a longtime Republican pollster. ""It's his conduct and behavior in office that have kept a foot on his job approval rating. Any other president would be in the upper 50s or even low 60s with this economy.""Most of the president's aides concede that his base of supporters is not enough to re-elect him, and that he must attract the voters who were repelled by his behavior and voted against Republicans in the 2018 midterms -- particularly upscale whites, suburban women and self-described independent voters who polls repeatedly show think the president is racist, or has a troubling temperament, or both.To that end, the president's campaign aired a Super Bowl ad featuring Alice Johnson, a black woman convicted on charges related to drug trafficking whose sentence the president commuted. The president also awarded an ""Opportunity Zone"" scholarship to a young African-American girl during his State of the Union address, and tailored other moments during the speech to appeal to members of the military.Trump advisers are focused not just on the three states that elected Mr. Trump in 2016 -- Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania -- but also the forever battleground of Florida, and battleground states with competitive Senate races that could help the Democratic nominee in Georgia, Arizona and North Carolina.The campaign also sees opportunities for pickups in New Hampshire and especially in Minnesota, states that have voted for Democrats in recent presidential races but where the margins were close in 2016. But while the campaign manager Brad Parscale has insisted New Mexico is within reach, other Trump advisers say there's been little movement, in part because of the president's disinterest in taking the day trips he favors to the western part of the country.In an interview, Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the R.N.C., said they have the resources to appeal to multiple groups of voters. ""That gives us an advantage to focus on the rural vote that we need to turn out, but then also go after places where we've lost voters to bring them back in,"" she said. And Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman, said they had always planned to woo various demographics, ""regardless of what Democrats in Congress were trying to do to him.""The administration is pulling out the policy stops. Vice President Mike Pence has recently made stops and bus tours in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, highlighting Trump administration efforts like the ""school choice"" initiative to help low-income students enter private schools.On Thursday, Mr. Trump tweeted that he was looking to move away from a proposal pushed by his former energy secretary, Rick Perry: storing nuclear waste in Nevada's Yucca Mountain, an effort his two top political advisers, Bill Stepien and Justin Clark, opposed for years. And officials are expected to hold events in the Midwest highlighting provisions aimed at helping domestic automakers that were included in the U.S.M.C.A. trade deal.""We've been chopping wood for a while, and it feels like everyone else is seeing what we've been seeing for a long time,"" said Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law who is overseeing his campaign. ""Everyone else has been distracted, but it's not like we invented these policies for the State of the Union.""What's unclear, and what could prove decisive, is whether the country is exhausted by Mr. Trump and is ready for a so-called return to normalcy, or if voters have grown inured to his eruptions and have effectively priced in his behavior.A key factor will be the candidate the Democrats eventually nominate. Interviews with more than a dozen Republican strategists, lawmakers and state chairs reveal a consensus that Senator Bernie Sanders would be the easiest Democrat for them to beat because they believe his avowed socialism would help them reclaim suburbanites and better frame the election as a choice.""It's easy to call him a socialist because he admits it,"" said Tim Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor. ""At least Warren tries to deny it.""Mr. Sanders's aides, of course, see it very differently and believe that they would tear up Mr. Trump's 2016 electoral map by reclaiming working-class white voters in states like Michigan and Wisconsin, something some Trump advisers agree with. And Trump advisers have been caught by surprise by the success of Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind.""We don't have a Democratic opponent yet,"" said Mr. Cramer.

| Jump to first hitMr. Meadows, a retiring Republican congressman from North Carolina and one of President Trump's most ardent defenders, becomes the latest chief of staff for a mercurial president who dispatched the previous three after they fell out of favor.PALM BEACH, Fla. -- One day last month, Mark Meadows went on Fox News to defend President Trump's decision to begin purging the government of officials perceived to be disloyal to him. ""Part of his administration is trying to defeat the Trump agenda,"" Mr. Meadows declared.Two days later, he was back on Fox defending Mr. Trump's attacks on prosecutors seeking a long prison sentence for his convicted friend Roger J. Stone Jr. ""The president was right to call it out,"" Mr. Meadows said. A week after that, Mr. Meadows was on Fox again, offering commentary on a Democratic debate. ""The clear winner tonight,"" he concluded, ""was Donald Trump.""For three years, Mr. Trump could reliably count on tuning into his favorite television network and finding his favorite congressman carrying his flag in one political battle after another. Now Mr. Meadows, a retiring Republican representative from North Carolina and onetime leader of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, will transform himself from outside ally to inside consigliere as he takes over as Mr. Trump's fourth White House chief of staff in 38 months.Whether he can be any more successful than his predecessors in managing a White House that defies management remains to be seen, but Mr. Meadows takes over at a moment of singular challenges for the president. The country faces a health, economic and societal crisis with the coronavirus even as it heads into a presidential campaign season that if anything promises to be even more brutal than the last one in 2016.Reince Priebus, John F. Kelly and Mick Mulvaney each tried to navigate Mr. Trump's harum-scarum West Wing in his own way, alternately trying to control, channel or enable the advice-resistant president, only to eventually fall out of favor. Mr. Meadows has an advantage none of them did in that he has been a political confidant and ardent champion for much longer before taking the job and many in Mr. Trump's circle were encouraged by his ascension. But he has never been tested like this before.""The president hasn't gone through four chiefs of staff in three and a half years because he's trying to figure out how to govern,"" said Chris Whipple, the author of ""The Gatekeepers,"" a history of those who served in the role. ""He's gone through four chiefs because he's not interested in governing. He lives to campaign -- to divide, demonize and disrupt -- not to get things done.""[Video: Watch on YouTube.]In that sense, then, Mr. Meadows may make sense. A former real estate developer turned conservative bomb-thrower, Mr. Meadows made his name as a disrupter of the system, clashing repeatedly with House Republican leaders over spending, immigration and other issues, and inciting the rebellion that forced Speaker John A. Boehner to step down in 2015.Mr. Meadows has helped blow up bipartisan deals over the budget, health care and immigration that he argued had sold out conservative principles and was an architect of the partial government shutdown of 2018-19 that failed to win Mr. Trump the border wall money he demanded. He famously blew up at Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Boehner's successor, on the floor during a contentious vote.Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan considered Mr. Meadows an irresponsible agitator who cared only about getting attention for himself and nothing at all about governance. Rather than making progress, they believed, Mr. Meadows cared only about making a point. But to his admirers, Mr. Meadows puts principle above pragmatism even at a cost to his own party.""It's a great move by the president,"" Representative Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, said on Saturday of Mr. Meadows's appointment. ""Mark Meadows is the best strategist in Washington, and he's a great wartime consigliere and we're heading into election season. Mark understands the president's electoral coalition and his unique ability to cut through the normal morass of Washington to get things done.""While unpopular among establishment Republicans, Mr. Meadows has a genial manner that has helped him forge unlikely relationships with some Democrats, who say that unlike Mr. Trump, he can vigorously argue issues without making it personal. And he has cultivated good relationships with reporters, becoming a comfortable and regular television presence.Among his most notable friends across the aisle was Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, who died in October and was a top target of Mr. Trump's racially charged attacks on Twitter. Mr. Meadows gave a moving eulogy at Mr. Cummings's memorial service that talked about the value of the ""unexpected friendship.""""I would describe Mark as an unusual empath just in terms of how he can relate to people,"" Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington State, another Democrat with whom he has a good relationship, said on Saturday. ""We do disagree on so many things, yet I do think he's someone who makes things about policy and not people.""Ms. Jayapal, a co-chairwoman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, emphasized that she considered Mr. Meadows's policies destructive but appreciated that he treated others with decency and respect. ""I don't see Mark Meadows being able to change the president on that,"" she said. ""I don't think that's possible. And if he thinks that's possible, he's probably kidding himself. It just makes me sad because he will end up being corroded.""Born on an Army base in Verdun, France, to a soldier and a civilian nurse, Mr. Meadows, 60, grew up mainly in Florida, a self-described ""fat nerd"" and an aspiring weatherman in a family without much money. But he later lost weight and became a businessman in Florida and North Carolina, where he owned a restaurant for 20 years before going into real estate. He ran for the House in 2012 as an outspoken critic of the Republican establishment.Like Mr. Trump, Mr. Meadows encouraged the so-called birther movement that spread the lie that former President Barack Obama was not born in the United States. ""2012 is the time we are going to send Mr. Obama home to Kenya or wherever it is,"" he said that year. He later called it ""probably a poor choice of words on my part,"" and said that he believed Mr. Obama was an American citizen.But he was not initially sold on Mr. Trump. By the 2016 election year, Mr. Meadows had helped found the Freedom Caucus, which made a point of prioritizing fidelity to conservative policy over party-line discipline, much to the chagrin of Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan. Mr. Trump, a former Democrat who once supported abortion rights and gun control, was a suspect figure.Mr. Meadows privately expressed reluctance to go to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland that year because he did not want to be associated with Mr. Trump, and thought it was only a question of how badly the reality television star would lose that year not whether he would, Tim Alberta wrote in ""American Carnage.""Still, he campaigned for Mr. Trump in the fall, even after the ""Access Hollywood"" tape that sent other Republicans fleeing, a loyalty the candidate never forgot. When Mr. Trump proved him wrong on Election Day, Mr. Meadows made a point of aligning himself with the incoming president, so much so that it provoked a shouting match at a Freedom Caucus meeting where other members were concerned, according to Mr. Alberta's book.Over the past three years, Mr. Meadows proved to have considerable influence over Mr. Trump, urging him to reject compromises with Democrats and moderate Republicans. He was seen in the West Wing and spoke with the president probably more than any other congressman -- so much so that some White House aides reportedly sought to block his calls.Other Republicans considered the advice Mr. Meadows was giving Mr. Trump unnecessarily destructive. ""Mr. President, Mark Meadows and the Freedom Caucus are not your friends,"" former Representative Robert Pittenger, a fellow North Carolina Republican who lost in a primary in 2018, wrote last year in the Charlotte Observer. ""They laud you on Fox News then undermine your legislation.""Mr. Meadows was also reproved by the House Ethics Committee in 2018 for mishandling sexual harassment allegations against a top aide. The committee ordered Mr. Meadows to reimburse the government more than $40,000 for salary paid to the aide who did not perform commensurate work.But Mr. Meadows has made himself best known lately as one of Mr. Trump's most stalwart defenders during the various investigations into the president. At one point early last year, during testimony by Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, who described the president as racist, Mr. Meadows sought to counter the allegation by presenting a black political appointee of Mr. Trump's.Representative Rashida Tlaib, Democrat of Michigan, called it racist to ""actually use a prop, a black woman in this chamber, in this committee."" Angry and indignant, Mr. Meadows rejected the idea that he was a racist and demanded an apology. Mr. Cummings, who was African-American, came to his defense, calling Mr. Meadows ""one of my best friends,"" and Ms. Tlaib apologized. But many lawmakers of color remained livid about the exchange.Mr. Meadows rose to the president's defense again when the House debated impeaching him for coercing Ukraine to incriminate his Democratic rivals by withholding security aid. After the House voted to impeach, the president enlisted Mr. Meadows and other Republican allies as adjunct members of his defense team for the Senate trial, deployed to the cameras to denounce the case.Mr. Meadows announced in December that he would not run for a fifth term, but made clear that he would remain in Mr. Trump's camp. ""My work with President Trump and his administration is only beginning,"" he said at the time. Many suspected he would end up in Mr. Mulvaney's corner office so few if any were surprised when Mr. Trump announced it by Twitter on Friday evening.""Mark is always up for the challenge,"" Mr. Gaetz said. ""We all knew when Mark wasn't running for re-election that he didn't lose one ounce of vigor for the fight, and it's no surprise to see the president turn to one of his closest confidants to lead the government.""PhotographRepresentative Mark Meadows mingling with attendees last week at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Md. The Republican of North Carolina announced last week that he would not seek re-election.

| Jump to first hitThe president says his ""big, beautiful"" trade deal is a win for America. His supporters agree.TOLEDO, Ohio -- President Trump's supporters nodded approvingly last week as Mr. Trump extolled the ""big, beautiful monster"" of a trade deal that he will sign with China on Wednesday.The enthusiastic group, gathered at Toledo's Huntington Center, nodded again as Mr. Trump insisted that America's farmers, who have been hurt by the trade war with China, were winners and as he asserted, incorrectly, that American importers were not paying for the tariffs.""And now the deal is done,"" Mr. Trump said.The packed arena roared triumphantly.On Wednesday, Mr. Trump will sign an initial trade agreement with Beijing that will help cool tensions between the world's two largest economies but leaves many of the biggest issues unresolved. Key details of the agreement remain murky, the text remains under wraps and more complicated matters, like China's financial support for companies that compete with American firms, have been pushed until after the 2020 election.But to Mr. Trump's most faithful backers, the president took on China and scored a major win.""Instead of giving all the money to China, now we're going to get some of it back,"" said Kim Lewis, 65, a corn and soybean farmer from Jamestown, Ind., who drove four hours to see Mr. Trump's speech. ""He had the guts to stand up to these other countries.""The optimism surrounding the outcome of the negotiations reflects the deep trust that Mr. Trump's supporters have in a president who promised to stop China from ""ripping off"" the United States and has declared victory in rewriting the terms of trade.Mr. Trump's public selling of the deal, along with his rosy views about the American economy, have transcended any downside of his economic policies. Support for Mr. Trump and his trade deal remain strong in places like Ohio, where economic growth and manufacturing employment shows signs of slowing.National employment data released Friday showed that 12,000 factory jobs were shed in December. Manufacturing employment has been slumping in the industrial Midwest in the last year amid the lingering trade war. Employment in the state's goods-producing industries decreased by 10,100 from November 2018 to November 2019, according to the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.For those devoted enough to Mr. Trump to brave frigid weather and long lines to attend a midweek campaign rally, any responsibility for economic malaise was directed elsewhere.""Tariffs aren't the answer, but Trump's back was put up against the wall,"" said Timothy Pedro, the Republican mayor of Waterville, Ohio, who noted that businesses in his town had been holding back investment as a result of trade uncertainty. ""He had to do something.""At the Toledo rally, Mr. Trump steered clear of specifics about the trade agreement, focusing on the promise that it will be enforced with the threat of more tariffs and the commitment he received from China to increase its purchases of American farm products to $50 billion a year -- nearly double what it bought at the 2012 peak.Critics of the deal have said it is unrealistic that China will ramp up its farm purchases so quickly. And they argue that Mr. Trump chose political expediency by settling for an interim agreement that would calm markets amid his re-election campaign but do little to resolve the administration's biggest concerns about China's unfair economic practices.To Mr. Trump's most ardent backers, however, the piecemeal approach was yet another sign of the president's deal-making prowess.""You can't get everything at one time,"" said Jeff Colwell, 54, a car parts manufacturer who lives near Columbus. ""Anything we can do to equalize trade with China is a good thing.""In agreeing to the deal last month, Mr. Trump reduced tariffs he had placed on $360 billion of Chinese goods and opted against taxing another $160 billion of imports. China agreed to enforce stronger protections for American intellectual property, open its markets to American financial institutions and commit to greater transparency surrounding the management of its currency.The agreement provides Mr. Trump with a policy win to hail, but it also deprives him of a useful foil to rail against. China-bashing is a well-worn tradition for Republicans and Democrats in election years. Former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama both criticized their predecessors for coddling China despite its human rights abuses and unfair trade practices during their campaigns in 1992 and 2008. As the Republican candidate in 2012, Mitt Romney assailed Mr. Obama for allowing China's theft of American intellectual property to flourish under his watch.Mr. Trump has made being tough on China one of his hallmarks and has spent much of his first term assailing it as an enemy and threatening to tax all of its imports. But polling that showed his tariffs were wearing thin on his base and a desire to score a policy victory ahead of the election spurred him to strike an interim deal.Michael Pillsbury, a China scholar at the Hudson Institute who advises Mr. Trump, said that Mr. Trump's campaign advisers have realized that the president's supporters are less concerned about China's record of human rights abuses or fears that it is an existential threat and more interested in having greater access to its market. He said that Mr. Trump appears to be shifting his tone on China away from the caustic rhetoric used by Stephen K. Bannon, his former chief strategist, in favor of an argument that shows how the president succeeded in ""opening up"" China.""The concern of the base about China is not the demonization of China; the concern is the ripped-off jobs and lost trade opportunities, the money part of it,"" said Mr. Pillsbury.Democrats have largely struggled to settle on a forceful critique of Mr. Trump's China strategy, accusing him of settling for a weak deal and warning that China may ultimately ignore the agreement.Still, supporters of the president appear ready to blame China, rather than Mr. Trump, if the deal does not hold.Randy Rothenbuhler, who owns a corn and soybean farm 45 minutes south of Toledo, said that his soybeans had been piling up in bins for the last year because of Chinese retaliation. He is hopeful that the new agreement will mean the reopening of China's market, but he will remain skeptical until he sees it happen.""That's the billion-dollar question, will China live up to its promise?"" Mr. Rothenbuhler, 42, said. ""We'll have to wait and see.""Although Mr. Trump might have to shift away from lashing out at China in the wake of the agreement, he appears likely to make the case that he alone could have struck such a deal and that no one else can hold China to its word.""They're going to do what he wants them to do,"" said Michelle Sellati, a forklift driver from Lima, Ohio. ""If China just works with Trump, they'll benefit, too.""PhotographPresident Trump in Toledo, Ohio, announcing the China trade deal he intends to sign Wednesday.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump appeared eager to bask in the warm reception of a conservative audience, who spent the conference listening to speakers road-testing messages for his re-election campaign.WASHINGTON -- President Trump crouched underneath his microphone on Saturday, mimicking the height of Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City who is running for president.Mr. Trump pointed at the ceiling above him, marveling at all of his own success. ""Maybe it's right there, right?"" he said. ""Thank you. Thank you, God.""Throughout an animated 90-minute speech in front of conservative activists at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference outside Washington, a confident Mr. Trump attacked his rivals in nasty terms while gloating about and inflating his own achievements.He even exited the stage by embracing the American flag in both of his arms, mouthing the words ""I love you"" and planting a kiss on the stars and stripes.Mr. Trump talked up what he said were his administration's successes: the appointment of conservative judges, the killing of terrorists, tax cuts and the passage of trade deals. But he appeared most animated when riffing about the Democratic presidential field, on the same day that voters in South Carolina headed to the polls to vote in the first primary where a majority-black electorate is set to weigh in.Mr. Bloomberg, whose mammoth spending has privately concerned Mr. Trump, ""writes checks like a drunken sailor,"" the president said, ribbing the former mayor for spending more than half a billion dollars on a presidential bid that Mr. Trump predicted would not make it past Super Tuesday on March 3.""That was probably the worst debate performance in the history of presidential debates,"" he said of Mr. Bloomberg's debut this month on the debate stage, which was widely viewed as a bubble-bursting showing for a potential dark horse candidate. ""It just shows you, you can't buy an election. You got to bring the goods a little bit, too.""Handicapping the Democratic primary, Mr. Trump said that he expected to face off against Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, or former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.""Everyone knows he's not a communist,"" he said of Mr. Biden. ""With Bernie, there's a real question about that."" But Mr. Trump said his concern about Mr. Biden was his mental acuity.""The difference is Joe's not going to be running the government,"" he said. ""He's just going to be sitting in a home some place.""Mr. Trump, who arrived late at CPAC after holding a last-minute news conference at the White House to announce expanded travel restrictions related to the spread of the coronavirus, mentioned the outbreak only in passing.Congratulating himself on his administration's response, Mr. Trump said the decision to impose early travel restrictions ""has been now given very good grades, like an A +++."" And he promised a nonpartisan response to the coronavirus, even as he attacked Democrats.""The extreme fringes called us racists,"" he said. ""They wanted to let infected people pour into our country.""On Friday, Mr. Trump's acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, addressed the same audience at CPAC, and accused journalists of hyping the coronavirus because ""they think this will bring down the president -- that's what this is all about.""On Saturday afternoon, however, Mr. Trump appeared less interested in discussing the outbreak that has been the first public health crisis of his presidency. Instead, he was eager to bask in the warm reception of the conservative audience, who spent the past four days listening to a procession of speakers road-testing messages for Mr. Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.He lauded his decision to fire James B. Comey as the F.B.I. director. ""That was a great firing,"" he said.He claimed that even Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, the lone Republican to vote to impeach Mr. Trump on one article, abuse of power, had split the baby. ""Even him, I got half a vote,"" he said. ""He couldn't do it all. He wanted to get nice free publicity for himself.""Mr. Trump also falsely characterized the 2017 tax cut as the ""largest"" in history (several others outrank it), and claimed that he had eliminated the estate tax. In reality, the 2017 law increased the threshold but the tax still exists.Mr. Trump has been a regular speaker at CPAC for years, and has credited the organization for giving him a platform long before he officially declared his run for president. In 2015, however, when he was still a New York businessman, the crowd booed him when he proposed fighting ISIS with troops on the ground in the Middle East.But for the past four years, he has been the main attraction and headliner of the conference, which has been molded in his image. Last year, Mr. Trump delivered the longest speech of his presidency from the CPAC stage, clocking in at two hours five minutes. (That year, he opened, rather than closed, with a flag hug.)In an election year, his address was more in line with the staple speeches he has been giving at campaign rallies, and it set no records for length.But he appeared particularly awed by his own abilities to keep the spotlight on himself.""I can get elected twice over the wall, can you believe this,"" he told the crowd, while claiming, falsely, that Mexico was paying for the construction of a wall along the southern border.""Yes they are, they are paying for it,"" he said, adding, without explaining himself, ""oh, they're going to die when I put in what I'm going to do.""Mr. Trump also claimed he was not bothered that Greta Thunberg, the teenage climate activist whom Time named its person of the year, occupied a magazine cover he has long coveted, even though he chose to bring up an issue that was published over two months ago. ""The whole world revolves around this person,"" he said, referring to himself. ""Every story is Trump or Trump-related.""Linda Qiu contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographThose at CPAC have spent four days listening to speakers road-testing messages for President Trump's re-election campaign.

| Jump to first hitAdministration officials say they are restoring ""deterrence"" against Iran, but the president's reluctance to use force in the Middle East may be creating an opening for Tehran.WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Trump toughened his rhetoric toward Iran on Tuesday, saying the country would ""be held fully responsible"" for the attack by Iraqi demonstrators on the United States Embassy compound in Baghdad, an assault that Mr. Trump said was directed by Tehran.""This is not a Warning, it is a Threat. Happy New Year!"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter on Tuesday evening, in some of his most bellicose language of the year toward Iran.The growing crisis has strained Mr. Trump's aversion to war with Iran as well as his distaste for Middle East entanglements generally, including in Iraq. Mr. Trump faced pressure from hawkish allies in Washington to confront Iran forcefully, while memories of the deadly attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, loomed over the administration.Many analysts said Iran had thrown the Trump administration on its heels and was forcing a president entering his re-election year into unpalatable decisions about escalation and the risk of wider conflict.""The Iranians believe Trump has shown he doesn't want to go to war,"" said Vali Nasr, a former State Department official in the Obama administration and a professor at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies. Mr. Nasr said that Iran's leaders were ""making the president realize there is risk and cost to his policy"" of crippling sanctions on the country's economy.The siege on the embassy created an unwelcome holiday crisis for Mr. Trump, who has spent the past week out of sight, splitting time between his Mar-a-Lago resort estate in Florida and his luxury golf club a few miles away. Mr. Trump has not spoken to reporters since Christmas Eve and was absent from a Sunday evening news briefing at Mar-a-Lago during which three of his top national security officials discussed American airstrikes against an Iranian-backed Iraqi militia.But on Tuesday the White House said Mr. Trump spoke by telephone with Iraq's prime minister, Adel Abdul Mahdi, imploring him to help protect Americans in the country.Although Iraq has seen mass anti-government protests in recent months, Mr. Trump left no doubt that he viewed the embassy assault as Tehran's handiwork. ""Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq,"" he tweeted. ""They will be held fully responsible."" Mr. Trump also ordered a contingent of Marines to protect the American personnel there.No Americans were harmed in the assault on the compound, and the attackers did not enter any embassy buildings. But the Trump administration was treating the threat as a serious new escalation by Iran, two days after Mr. Trump approved the airstrikes against the militia group that American officials said launched a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base that killed an American contractor and wounded four American soldiers.The events of the past several days amount to a violent cat-and-mouse game between Washington and Tehran, as Iran bridles under economic sanctions and seeks to exact a price from the United States. Those sanctions contributed to mass protests that the country's leaders say were instigated by the United States to bring down Iran's regime.Trump administration officials, particularly Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have long spoken about the need to ""restore deterrence"" against Iran to check its military activities in the Middle East. They blame President Barack Obama for emboldening Tehran through the 2015 nuclear deal. But supporters of the agreement say that Mr. Trump's May 2018 withdrawal from it prompted Iran and its proxies to adopt a more aggressive posture toward the United States.Meanwhile, some of Mr. Trump's allies fear that a president who has repeatedly called for winding down ""endless wars"" has effectively condoned Iranian behavior by shying away from military force. In mid-June, Mr. Trump ordered limited airstrikes to punish Iran for shooting down an expensive American drone near its coastline, only to call off the attack at the last minute. Mr. Trump also defied calls from some Republican supporters to strike at Iran after it attacked a major Saudi oil production facility in September.Mr. Trump has also said he would like to negotiate a new nuclear agreement with Iran's leaders. But Iran has refused to discuss its nuclear program until Mr. Trump rolls back economic sanctions, including on oil exports, a step the president has refused to take.Mr. Trump was cheered on by some Republican allies on Tuesday, including Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a longtime advocate of confrontation with Iran who golfed with the president in Florida on Tuesday.Mr. Graham praised Mr. Trump on Twitter for ""acting decisively"" and told Iran that the president ""will hold you accountable for threats against Americans and hit you where it hurts the most."" He also issued a veiled threat of further military action, telling the Iranian government that ""a country that depends on the ability to refine oil for its existence needs to be cautious.""Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, said Iran ""must be held responsible.""Complicating the picture was what a senior Trump administration official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity on Monday, cast as longtime frustration with the Iraqi government, saying it has not sufficiently protected American military and diplomatic personnel from Iranian-backed militia groups. About 5,000 American troops and several thousand more civilians remain in Iraq nearly a decade after the United States officially ended its occupation of the country.Mr. Trump has repeatedly criticized the 2003 American invasion of the country as a colossal mistake and has been eager to withdraw American forces from neighboring Syria.Mr. Trump tweeted on Tuesday that ""we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified!""But much of Iraq's political establishment has bitterly complained about the American airstrikes within its borders. The strikes hit Shiite militia fighters who, while aligned with Iran, helped to defend Iraq from the Islamic State in recent years and have close ties to the country's leadership.""The story in Iraq has shifted,"" Mr. Nasr said, as prior anger at Iranian influence in the country is displaced by outrage at Washington. ""I think the administration has miscalculated.""On Tuesday, Mr. Trump tried to keep the focus on Iranian influence in Baghdad.""To those many millions of people in Iraq who want freedom and who don't want to be dominated and controlled by Iran, this is your time!"" Mr. Trump implored on Twitter as demonstrators set up camp at the gates of the American Embassy in Iraq's capital.Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, John R. Bolton, warned in a tweet against conflating the embassy attack with mass protests that have gripped Iraq in recent months.""The attack on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad is straight from Iran's playbook in 1979,"" Mr. Bolton wrote. ""It's a sign of Iranian control over Shia militia groups, not a sign of Iraqi anti-Americanism.""Some foreign policy analysts said the fast-moving crisis pointed to muddled thinking within the Trump administration about its approach toward Iran.""Trump, who would just as soon withdraw wholesale from Iraq, faces a conundrum in an election year: How to avoid looking weak on the one hand and yet avoid triggering a messy conflict with Iran and deeper involvement in Iraq on the other that will alienate his base and energize his opponents,"" said Aaron David Miller, a former State Department official and Middle East expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.Mr. Trump's public pledges to disentangle the United States from wars in the Middle East are more complicated and problematic than they appear, former officials and analysts said. While the president has talked about withdrawing American troops, he has actually added troops in some areas, most notably about 3,000 to Saudi Arabia in an order issued in October. The key factor there was Saudi Arabia's willingness to pay the costs of maintaining the troops, a persistent issue with Mr. Trump.Mr. Trump has signaled a strong distaste for engagement in foreign conflicts in nearby Syria. He surprised top advisers by withdrawing American troops from the Syria-Turkey border in October and allowing Turkey to invade a Kurdish-held area in Syria. Mr. Trump eventually agreed to keep some troops by oil fields in Syria after senior Defense Department officials stressed to Mr. Trump that the soldiers would be securing oil.The president announced in December 2018 that he planned to withdraw troops from Syria, prompting the resignations of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, a veteran Marine general, and Brett H. McGurk, the special presidential envoy to the international coalition battling the Islamic State.On Tuesday morning, the State Department said Mr. Pompeo had spoken with Mr. Mahdi, and Iraq's president, Barham Salih, in separate calls. A summary of the calls released by the department said that Mr. Pompeo ""made clear the United States will protect and defend its people, who are there to support a sovereign and independent Iraq,"" and that the Iraqi leaders ""assured the secretary that they took seriously their responsibility for and would guarantee the safety and security of U.S. personnel and property.""The safety of embassy employees is fraught for Mr. Pompeo. He delivered blistering criticism of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton when he was a member of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which investigated the decisions she made around the 2012 attack on the diplomatic compound in Libya. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens; another full-time government employee, Sean Smith; and two American C.I.A. contractors died in that attack.Former State Department officials and associates of Mr. Pompeo say because of that history and the ensuing harm to Mrs. Clinton's political career, he is keen to ensure that American diplomats under his watch are not harmed. Republican politicians say that Mr. Pompeo might run for an open Senate seat in Kansas in 2020 and then president in 2024.That history was clearly on the mind of the president himself. By late Tuesday afternoon, with embassy security beefed up and the imminent threat seemingly repelled, Mr. Trump boastfully tweeted: ""The Anti-Benghazi!""In May, during a period of heightened tensions with Iran, Mr. Pompeo ordered most non-Iraqi employees of the Baghdad embassy and the consulate in Erbil, in northern Iraq, to leave the country. Employee numbers at the embassy are now much lower than they were before that order, American officials say. In September 2018, Mr. Pompeo ordered the closing of the Basra consulate, despite the opposition of the top diplomat there.In response to the turmoil in Baghdad on Tuesday, the American military conducted a show of force with helicopter gunships and deployed about 120 Marines to reinforce the compound's grounds, a Defense Department official said. Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper also said that about 750 soldiers would be sent to the region immediately, and that additional troops were prepared to follow in the coming days.Mr. Esper called the deployments ""an appropriate and precautionary action,"" adding, ""The United States will protect our people and interests anywhere they are found around the world.""Michael Crowley reported from West Palm Beach, and Edward Wong from Washington. Thomas Gibbons-Neff contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographIran ""will be held fully responsible"" for demonstrators' attack on the American Embassy in Baghdad, President Trump, top, said on Tuesday.

| Jump to first hitJoe Biden and other Democrats were already talking about health care before the coronavirus, but the outbreak gives new urgency to a central issue for the party.WASHINGTON -- One of the thorniest debates in American politics is over health care. Now add a pandemic.The future of America's health insurance system has already been a huge part of the 2020 presidential race. At campaign events over the past year, voters have shared stories of cancer diagnoses, costly medications and crushing medical debt.That was before more than 68,000 people in the United States tested positive for the coronavirus, grinding the country to a halt, upending lives from coast to coast, and postponing primary elections in many states. The virus has made the stakes, and the differing visions the two parties have for health care in America, that much clearer.""Health care was always going to be a big issue in the general election, and the coronavirus epidemic will put health care even more top of mind for voters,"" said Larry Levitt, the executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan research organization. ""Sometimes these health care debates can get a bit abstract, but when it's an immediate threat to the health of you and your family, it becomes a lot more real.""On Monday, Joseph R. Biden Jr. sent a letter to President Trump and Republican state officials that emphasized the sorts of immediate threats Americans are feeling, and criticized those Republicans for supporting litigation that targets the Affordable Care Act. The letter called it ""unconscionable that you are continuing to pursue a lawsuit designed to strip millions"" of coverage in the midst of a pandemic.Mr. Biden sent his missive on a health care milestone: the 10th anniversary of when President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law -- with Mr. Biden, then the vice president and now the likely Democratic presidential nominee, standing by his side.While the Democrats spent much of their primary fighting about whether to push for ""Medicare for all"" or build on the Affordable Care Act, the coronavirus crisis may streamline the debate to their advantage: At a time when the issue of health care is as pressing as ever, they can present themselves as the party that wants people to have sufficient coverage while arguing that the Republicans do not.""A crisis like the coronavirus epidemic highlights the stake that everyone has in the care of the sick,"" said Paul Starr, a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton who served as a health policy adviser in the Clinton White House. ""It really strengthens the Democratic case for expanded health coverage, and that should work, I should think, to Biden's advantage in a campaign against Trump.""The virus is also having dire economic consequences, depriving Mr. Trump of a potent re-election argument rooted in stock market gains and low unemployment numbers. It is testing Mr. Trump's leadership in the face of a national emergency like nothing he has encountered, and if voters give him poor marks, that could inflict lasting damage on his chances in November's general election.""It's a leadership argument,"" said Representative Donna E. Shalala, Democrat of Florida, who served as secretary of health and human services for President Bill Clinton. ""Who do you want to be president of the United States when there's a big health crisis?""In addition, the virus is a providing an unmistakable reminder that Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden have starkly different views about the future of American health care -- and starkly different records on the issue.Four years ago, Mr. Trump ran for president promising to repeal the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare. But his campaign pledge quickly turned into a debacle in the first year of his presidency when Republicans struggled and ultimately failed to repeal and replace the health law. In the midterm elections the next year, Democrats emphasized health care, highlighting issues like preserving protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and they won control of the House.That line of argument has already surfaced in the 2020 election cycle. ""Too many Montana families go to sleep at night worried about health care -- coverage, costs, now the fear of coronavirus,"" the narrator said in a recent ad targeting Senator Steve Daines, Republican of Montana, who is up for re-election. The ad was run by Protect Our Care, a liberal advocacy group that supports the Affordable Care Act and has set up a coronavirus ""war room"" aimed at holding Mr. Trump accountable over his handling of the crisis.Mr. Trump is particularly vulnerable on the issue of health care. Over the course of his presidency, his administration has repeatedly taken steps to undermine the Affordable Care Act, including by arguing in court that the entire law should be invalidated. The Supreme Court agreed this month to hear an appeal in that case, which is the latest major challenge to the law. The court is not expected to rule until next year, but Democrats point to the Trump administration's legal position as yet another example of the president's desire to shred the Affordable Care Act.All together, those steps by Mr. Trump and his administration amounted to something of a policy piñata for Mr. Biden and other Democrats to swing at in the general election, even before the coronavirus threat emerged.""Trump wants to take health care away,"" said Representative Ami Bera of California, a physician. ""Democrats and Vice President Biden want to extend health care and make it affordable.""In his campaign, Mr. Biden has already put a focus on health care, promising to build on the Affordable Care Act and create a so-called public option, an optional government plan that consumers could purchase. On the campaign trail, he has talked about his own exposure to the health care system, including when his late son, Beau Biden, had brain cancer. He has also regularly heard from people about their own struggles. ""They walk up and grab me and say, 'I just lost my daughter, cancer,' or, 'My son's dying,' or, 'I have Stage 4,""' he recalled this year.Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign, said Mr. Trump had ""spent almost his entire presidency attempting to cost millions of Americans their health coverage,"" adding: ""The coronavirus outbreak, which Trump has egregiously mishandled, would be even more catastrophic if he had his way on health care.""At a Fox News town hall event this month, Mr. Trump said he had not ""been able to sell what a great job we've done"" on health care. While the president and congressional Republicans failed at repealing the Affordable Care Act, they succeeded at undoing a key part of the law when, as part of their 2017 tax overhaul, they eliminated the tax penalty for people who go without insurance.The Trump campaign has already attacked Mr. Biden over health care, including by arguing that he poses a threat to private health insurance with his proposal to create an optional government plan.""As President Trump is leading our country and taking unprecedented action to stop the coronavirus, Joe Biden is campaigning on his Bernie Sanders-inspired, socialist health care agenda, which would take away Americans' access to quality health care,"" said Sarah Matthews, a Trump campaign spokeswoman. ""Make no mistake about it, Biden's government-run 'public option' is just another name for a government takeover of the entire health care system.""And although the Affordable Care Act has gained in popularity during Mr. Trump's presidency, Republicans can still point to rising health care costs as a problem that voters want to see addressed. In that vein, Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana and a physician, cited the substantial premiums and high deductibles that many consumers have.""Democrats have to have a credible plan to control health care costs,"" Mr. Cassidy said. ""If you look at what the No. 1 concern is, it is the cost of health care.""In the Democratic primary race, the health care debate has largely focused on the divide between moderate-leaning Democrats looking to build on the Affordable Care Act and progressives calling for Medicare for all, a government-run health insurance program. Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders represent the two sides of that argument.Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator, faces long odds at catching up to Mr. Biden in the delegate race, but he has remained in the primary and continues to push progressive policy ideas, including on health care. In response to the virus, he has pointed once again to the need for Medicare for all.""It is nearly impossible to believe that anyone can still think it's acceptable to continue with a health care system that leaves tens of millions of people uninsured,"" Mr. Sanders said this month. ""The cruelty and absurdity of that view is more obvious in the midst of this crisis than it has ever been.""In a poll this month by Morning Consult, four in 10 Americans said the coronavirus outbreak had made them more likely to support universal health care proposals in which everyone would receive their health insurance from the government.Under the single-payer system that Mr. Sanders is proposing, private health insurance would be eliminated -- a potential political vulnerability that Republicans would most likely exploit in the general election if the Democratic nominee supported Medicare for all. Mr. Biden, who has repeatedly criticized Mr. Sanders's health care proposal during the primary, does not share that vulnerability.At one of his final campaign stops before the virus shut down in-person campaigning, Mr. Biden visited a community health center in Grand Rapids, Mich., where he spoke of his pride in having worked with Mr. Obama to pass the Affordable Care Act.""I'm running to protect the progress we fought for,"" Mr. Biden said. He cast doubt on Mr. Sanders's plans for a single-payer system and spoke about the urgent need to improve health care -- now more evident than even two weeks ago.Talking about the patients at that clinic, he said, ""They can't afford to wait for a revolution.""PhotographA nurse worked at a drive-up coronavirus testing site in Yuba City, Calif., on Monday. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, below left, has responded to the co- ronavirus by continuing his argument for a single-payer health care system, while Joseph R. Biden Jr. has focused on defending the Affordable Care Act.

| Jump to first hitOn Monday, the president's lawyers asserted he did nothing wrong and urged the Senate to ""swiftly reject"" the charges against him.WASHINGTON -- Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, unveiled ground rules on Monday for President Trump's impeachment trial that would attempt to speed the proceeding along and refuse to admit the evidence against the president unearthed by the House without a separate vote.Mr. McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, showed his hand hours after Mr. Trump's legal team called on the Senate to ""swiftly reject"" the impeachment charges and acquit him, arguing that Democrats would ""permanently weaken the presidency"" if they succeeded in removing him from office over what the team characterized as policy and political differences.In a 110-page brief submitted to the Senate the day before Mr. Trump's trial begins in earnest, the president's lawyers advanced their first sustained legal argument since the House opened its inquiry in the fall, contending that the two charges approved largely along party lines were constitutionally flawed and set a dangerous precedent.Mr. Trump's lawyers dismissed the validity of both articles of impeachment lodged against him -- abuse of power and obstruction of Congress -- because they do not state any specific violation of the law, advancing a constrained and widely rejected interpretation of the power to impeach a president. While the lawyers did not contest the basic facts of the case, they maintained that Democrats' accusations in effect seek to punish Mr. Trump for foreign policy decisions and efforts to preserve executive prerogatives.""They do not remotely approach the constitutional threshold for removing a president from office,"" the brief said. ""The diluted standard asserted here would permanently weaken the presidency and forever alter the balance among the branches of government in a manner that offends the constitutional design established by the founders.""The White House also announced on Monday night that it had assembled a team of eight House Republicans to serve as part of the president's defense team, including some of his fiercest defenders, like Representatives Jim Jordan of Ohio, Mark Meadows of North Carolina and John Ratcliffe of Texas.Mr. McConnell's trial rules, which limited each side's arguments to 24 hours over two days, gave the White House a helping hand at the outset and drew swift anger from Democrats. The rules left open the possibility that the Senate could not only decline to hear new evidence not uncovered in the House impeachment inquiry, but could also sidestep considering the House case against Mr. Trump altogether -- although such a vote is considered unlikely.""Under this resolution, Senator McConnell is saying he doesn't want to hear any of the existing evidence, and he doesn't want to hear any new evidence,"" said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. ""It's a cover-up, and the American people will see it for exactly what it is.""He said he would propose changes during what promises to be a rancorous debate over the rules on Tuesday in the Senate.In their own detailed legal brief submitted on Saturday, the House impeachment managers outlined their case that Mr. Trump corruptly solicited foreign interference in the 2020 election for his own benefit by pressuring Ukraine to announce investigations into his political rivals while withholding nearly $400 million in security aid the country desperately needed as well as a coveted White House meeting for its president.""President Trump did not engage in this corrupt conduct to uphold the presidency or protect the right to vote,"" the seven House Democratic impeachment managers said Monday in a second filing that rebutted many of the president's assertions. ""He did it to cheat in the next election and bury the evidence when he got caught.""""Mr. Trump's answer to the charges offers an unconvincing and implausible defense against the factual allegations in Article I,"" the managers wrote. ""The 'simple facts' that it recites confirm President Trump's guilt, not his innocence.""The legal brief filed by Mr. Trump's lawyers did not deny that the president asked Ukraine to announce the investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., nor that he withheld military aid that Congress had approved for Kyiv. But Mr. Trump's lawyers said that he never tied the investigations to a White House meeting or to the security assistance.They also argued that the president has the right to conduct relations with other countries as he sees fit and that he had valid reasons to raise those issues with Ukraine and withhold the security aid because he wanted to root out corruption there and get other countries to share the burden of providing military assistance.The lawyers dismissed the notion that doing so was an abuse of power, as outlined in the first article of impeachment, calling that a ""novel theory"" and a ""newly invented"" offense that would allow Congress to second-guess presidents for legitimate policy choices.""House Democrats' concocted theory that the president can be impeached for taking permissible actions if he does them for what they believe to be the wrong reasons would also expand the impeachment power beyond constitutional bounds,"" the brief said. ""It is the president who defines foreign policy,"" it added, and said that Mr. Trump had ""legitimate concerns"" in raising the issues involving Democrats with the Ukrainians.The lawyers argued that the second article, accusing Mr. Trump of obstructing Congress by blocking testimony and refusing to turn over documents during the House impeachment inquiry, was ""frivolous and dangerous"" because it would invalidate a president's right to confidential deliberations in violation of the separation of powers.In making their case, the White House lawyers themselves embraced novel interpretations of the history of impeachment. Far from newly invented, the concept of abuse of power was envisioned by the framers from the start. Alexander Hamilton specifically described impeachment as a remedy for the ""abuse or violation of some public trust.""Moreover, the House Judiciary Committee adopted articles of impeachment accusing both Presidents Richard M. Nixon and Bill Clinton of abuse of power for, among other things, defying congressional demands for information.Many constitutional scholars have long said that impeachable offenses do not have to be specific violations of a criminal code, but could be broader violations of a president's oath of office or offenses against the republic. In the case of President Andrew Johnson, one of the articles against him alleged no violation of law but impeached him anyway for speeches bringing Congress into ""disgrace, ridicule, hatred, contempt and reproach.""While the White House brief argued that the articles against Mr. Trump did not allege an actual crime, a report released last week by the Government Accountability Office, an independent, nonpartisan government agency, found that the Trump administration violated the law by withholding the security aid allocated by Congress.The president's legal team took issue with the Government Accountability Office's conclusion and said that, in any case, it was irrelevant because it was not included in the articles of impeachment themselves.The White House brief stressed that Mr. Trump ultimately met with President Volodymyr Zelensky and released the aid even though the Ukrainians never announced the investigations the president had sought. But the money was delivered and the meeting was set only after a whistle-blower had filed a complaint alleging impropriety by the president and lawmakers had opened their own investigation into why the money had been blocked.The dueling filings rolled in as both sides braced for a contentious trial on the Senate floor over whether to remove Mr. Trump, only the third such impeachment proceeding in the country's history. The president visited the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial in Washington on Monday afternoon before he left for Davos, Switzerland, where he planned to meet with other world leaders at an economic conference as the Senate began weighing his fate.In the Capitol, the House managers and the president's defense team took turns privately touring the Senate chamber and surrounding offices, transformed over the weekend into a court of impeachment that will open on Tuesday with the debate on the rules for the trial. According to Mr. McConnell's timetable, oral arguments by the House managers would begin on Wednesday, followed by a presentation by Mr. Trump's team.The White House announcement that it will add House Republicans to its defense team came despite objections from Mr. McConnell. In deference to him, they will not argue the case on the Senate floor, but will provide guidance and appear as surrogates, according to a person working with Mr. Trump's legal team.In addition to Mr. Jordan, Mr. Meadows and Mr. Ratcliffe, those joining the team include Representatives Doug Collins of Georgia, Mike Johnson of Louisiana, Debbie Lesko of Arizona, and Elise Stefanik and Lee Zeldin of New York.In their filing on Monday, House Democrats sought to dismantle the president's case. By arguing that abuse of power is not an impeachable offense, they said, Mr. Trump's lawyers were ignoring the intentions of the founders and in effect asserting that ""the American people are powerless to remove a president for corruptly using his office to cheat in the next election.""The managers also said the president's attempt to justify his obstruction failed to account for the House's broad prerogative to conduct their inquiry. The House investigation was ""properly authorized,"" they insisted, and they pointed out that Mr. Trump never actually invoked executive privilege, but merely raised the threat of doing so to discourage officials from testifying.The nine-page filing was technically a response to a shorter pleading submitted by Mr. Trump's team on Saturday.The president weighed in himself, complaining that he had not been treated fairly and dismissing demands by Mr. Schumer for a trial that would include witnesses and testimony that the president has so far blocked.""Cryin' Chuck Schumer is now asking for 'fairness', when he and the Democrat House members worked together to make sure I got ZERO fairness in the House,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. ""So, what else is new?""Mr. McConnell had said repeatedly that he was modeling his rules on the procedures for Mr. Clinton's 1999 impeachment trial, but he made changes that could tilt the playing field in Mr. Trump's favor. While the Clinton-era rules imposed no limits on the 24 hours of oral arguments allowed on both sides, Mr. McConnell condensed them into two marathon-session days, which would allow the Senate to blaze through them by Saturday.Senators could then pose questions to the two sides next week before debating whether to allow the prosecution and defense to try to call witnesses or seek documents. A senior Republican leadership aide conceded on Monday that Mr. McConnell had deviated from the 1999 rules, which admitted the House impeachment record into evidence at the start of the trial, in requiring a separate Senate vote to do so this time around. The change was necessary, argued the aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail internal strategy, because the House had denied the president proper due process rights.The House invited Mr. Trump to mount a defense before the House Judiciary Committee during its impeachment proceeding, including requesting witnesses and documents, but the president's legal team declined, saying it would not dignify an inquiry it deemed illegitimate with a response.Peter Baker and Nicholas Fandos reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from New York. Emily Cochrane contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographPresident Trump in Texas on Sunday. His lawyers argued that the impeachment case could ""permanently weaken the presidency.""

| Jump to first hitOn the final day of their oral arguments, House impeachment managers called President Trump a danger to the nation.WASHINGTON -- House Democrats concluded their arguments against President Trump on Friday by portraying his pressure campaign on Ukraine as part of a dangerous pattern of Russian appeasement that demanded his removal from office.Ending their three-day presentation in the Senate, the impeachment managers summoned the ghosts of the Cold War and the realities of geopolitical tensions with Russia to argue that Mr. Trump's abuse of power had slowly shredded delicate foreign alliances to suit his own interests.""This is Trump first, not America first, not American ideals first,"" said Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, the lead House manager. ""And the result has been, and will continue to be, grave harm to our nation if this chamber does not stand up and say this is wrong.""Hours later, as his allotted time ticked down, Mr. Schiff also appealed to the consciences of Republican senators weighing whether to hear from witnesses and seek more documents that Mr. Trump suppressed.""I ask you -- I implore you,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""Give America a fair trial. She's worth it.""But those same senators appeared unmoved -- not just on the question of whether to acquit Mr. Trump, which they were expected to do, but also on the crucial question concerning witnesses and documents.""We have heard plenty,"" said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming, the No. 3 Senate Republican.Mr. Schiff's fiery final oration appeared to alienate the very Republicans he was trying to win over. When he referred to an anonymously sourced news report that Republican senators had been warned that their heads would be ""on a pike"" if they voted against Mr. Trump, several of them vigorously shook their heads and broke their sworn silence: ""not true.""""I hope it's not true,"" Mr. Schiff said in response.He and the six other managers prosecuting the president spent much of Friday tying up the facts of the second charge, obstruction of Congress, and arguing that Mr. Trump's attempts to shut down a congressional inquiry into his actions toward Ukraine was unprecedented and undermined the very ability of the government to correct itself.""He is a dictator,"" said Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York. ""This must not stand.""As day turned to evening on the fourth full day of the trial, many senators unaccustomed to long hours in the Capitol appeared to have simply been numbed by the House managers, and were anticipating the president's defense, set to begin at 10 a.m. Saturday.The Senate was presented with three days of often an vivid narrative and painstaking legal arguments that Mr. Trump sought foreign interference in the 2020 election on his own behalf, by using vital military aid and a White House meeting as leverage to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.Yet the pool of moderate Republican senators that had expressed openness to joining Democrats in insisting on witnesses or new documents appeared to be dwindling. Comments by Senators Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska suggested that they may have cooled to the idea, although Senators Susan Collins of Maine and Mitt Romney of Utah gave no indication that they had shifted.Still, Ms. Collins was among those shaking her head when Mr. Schiff referred to the purported threat against Republican defectors.Ms. Murkowski said: ""'Head on a pike,' that's where he lost me. I thought he did fine until he overreached.""Democrats promptly accused the Republicans of being melodramatic, suggesting they were merely looking for any excuse to ignore Mr. Schiff's prodding.Without an agreement to take new testimony or subpoena documents relevant to the case, Mr. Trump may be headed toward a historically speedy acquittal in as little as a week from now, before the Iowa caucuses or his planned State of the Union address. That would make the third impeachment trial of a president in American history the shortest.Throughout Friday, inside and outside the chamber, the House managers and Democratic senators hinted strongly at the political stakes if Republicans failed to press for a more thorough airing of the charges against the president.""We've made the argument forcefully, the American people have made the argument forcefully that they want the truth,"" said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. ""Will four Republican senators -- just four -- rise to the occasion, do their duty to the Constitution, to their country to seek the truth?""They appeared to get an unexpected lift early in the day when a 2018 recording surfaced of Mr. Trump appearing to order the firing of Marie L. Yovanovitch, then the United States ambassador to Ukraine. The recording was first reported by ABC News and later handed over to the House by Lev Parnas, an associate of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer.The recording appeared to confirm earlier claims by Mr. Parnas that he had told Mr. Trump about rumors that Ms. Yovanovitch was not loyal to him. The House's impeachment inquiry concluded that the ambassador was ultimately removed in 2019 as part of Mr. Trump's attempt to strong-arm Ukraine to announce investigations of his political adversaries.""Get rid of her,"" Mr. Trump can be heard to say, according to ABC. ""Get her out tomorrow. I don't care.""Mr. Trump's defense team plans to open its arguments on Saturday, though senators were expected to meet for only an abbreviated, two- to three-hour session before adjourning the trial until Monday afternoon.Mr. Trump was not pleased about the schedule, writing Friday morning on Twitter that his team had been ""forced"" to start on a Saturday, a time ""called Death Valley in T.V."" He also turned around Democrats' accusation, declaring that ""the Impeachment Hoax is interfering with the 2020 Election,"" not him.Jay Sekulow, one of Mr. Trump's lawyers, said his team would treat the weekend session like a ""trailer,"" providing an overview of their case for acquittal while holding back until Monday the president's more television-friendly lawyers, the former independent counsel Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz.Democrats used almost every one of the 24 hours afforded to them by senators to make their case, determined to persuade American voters watching at home who will cast ballots in just 10 months, if not senators.On Wednesday, Mr. Schiff and each of the managers took turns introducing the facts of the case in narrative form, unfolding the tale of Mr. Trump's alleged misconduct chapter by chapter. Beginning with the abrupt removal of Ms. Yovanovitch, they said that Mr. Trump empowered first Mr. Giuliani and then American officials to push Ukraine to announce investigations of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats, before himself asking that country's leader to ""do us a favor.""When the Ukrainians resisted, they added, he withheld a coveted White House meeting and almost $400 million in military aid the fledgling democracy badly needed to fend off a menacing Russia. And when Congress found out, he undertook an across-the-board campaign to block officials from testifying or producing records that would reveal the scheme.On Thursday, Mr. Nadler lectured extensively on the constitutional and historical standards for impeachment, setting the stage for the managers to methodically argue that Mr. Trump's actions toward Ukraine constituted an impeachable abuse of power that warrants his removal from office.Mr. Schiff completed that case on Friday, directly engaging the national security implications of Mr. Trump's actions as he argued that the president was a serial offender in seeking foreign help for his own political benefit, allowing himself to be used as a tool of Moscow's agenda in the process. As a candidate, Mr. Trump welcomed Russia's interference in the 2016 election to help him win the White House, Mr. Schiff noted, and then as president, he repeatedly cast doubt on the conclusions of American intelligence agencies about that interference. Later, Mr. Trump said outright that he would welcome foreign campaign assistance again.The California Democrat played a video of the news conference in Helsinki, Finland, where Mr. Trump stood next to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and accepted his denial that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election.""That's one hell of a Russian intelligence coup,"" Mr. Schiff said. ""They got the president of the United States to provide cover for their own interference with our election.""At another point, Mr. Schiff showed a clip of Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who was an outspoken champion of Ukraine and Russia hawk, promoting the benefits of bipartisan American support for Kyiv to contain Russia and its anti-democratic agenda.The move appeared to be a subtle effort to appeal to Republican senators, many of whom respected Mr. McCain and share his strongly anti-Russia stance, to place those values above their loyalty to the president.As the managers moved on to the obstruction of Congress charge, they contended that Mr. Trump's blockade of evidence was far more pernicious than the kind of partisan squabbles that are typical between Congress and the White House.Even Presidents Bill Clinton and Richard M. Nixon, they said, had produced documents to the investigations that would threaten them with impeachment. Mr. Trump's administration had not handed over a single page, declaring for the first time an across the board objection to House subpoenas.Trying to head off Mr. Trump's defense team, which argues that the president was lawfully protecting the interests of the executive branch from a politically motivated House, the managers pointed out that he never actually invoked executive privilege, the legal mechanism afforded to presidents.""Only one person in the world has the power to issue an order to the entire executive branch,"" said Representatives Val B. Demings, Democrat of Florida. ""And President Trump used that power not to faithfully execute the law, but to order agencies and employees of the executive branch to conceal evidence of his misconduct.""Reporting was contributed by Maggie Haberman, Carl Hulse, Catie Edmondson, Michael D. Shear and Emily Cochrane.Maggie Haberman, Carl Hulse, Catie Edmondson and Michael D. Shear contributed reporting.PhotographThe House impeachment managers, led by Representative Adam B. Schiff, held a news conference ahead of the Senate trial Friday on Capitol Hill.

| Jump to first hitWith another fall on Friday, the Dow Jones average is now lower than it was when President Trump took office.Before he was sworn in as president, Donald J. Trump made clear that he would treat the stock market as a crucial yardstick of his success in office.""The world was gloomy before I won -- there was no hope,"" he wrote on Twitter on Dec. 26, 2016. Since his election, he said, ""the market is up 10%."" (It was up, but not that much.)In the three years since, Mr. Trump has obsessed over the daily gyrations of the stock market like no president before him. He trumpeted its relentless rise as a validation of his leadership, his financial acumen and his policies. Disappointing days were the fault of Democrats, the media or the Federal Reserve. Stocks, he warned, would crash if he was impeached or ""if anyone but me takes over in 2020.""Now his bragging rights and doomsday threats have evaporated -- along with trillions of dollars in wealth.Stocks continued their monthlong meltdown on Friday, with the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling about 4.5 percent to below where it stood when Mr. Trump was sworn in as president on Jan. 20, 2017. The S&P 500 also sank more than 4 percent, though it remains up -- barely -- during the Trump presidency.The implosion -- stocks have collapsed about 35 percent since the coronavirus spread globally last month -- is shaping up to be one of the most destructive periods in American financial history. More than $8 trillion in shareholder value has been destroyed. On four occasions in the past month, automatic circuit breakers halted trading to stall dizzying sell-offs. The plunge is the steepest since at least 1928.The market collapse isn't Mr. Trump's fault, although some of his decisions may not have helped, including his statements minimizing the danger of the virus. The fast-spreading pandemic has forced countries all over the world to essentially shut down their economies, and that probably would have happened in the United States regardless of who was in the White House.But the speed and violence of the fall have stunned just about everyone. Only a month ago, on Feb. 19, Mr. Trump was in chest-thumping mode. ""Highest Stock Market In History, By Far!"" he crowed on Twitter.That day turned out to be the market's peak.From the start of his presidency, some of Mr. Trump's policies have seemed tailor made to catapult the stock market to new heights. His landmark legislative achievement -- the $1.5 trillion tax-cut package that he signed into law at the end of 2017 -- handed out rich rewards to corporate America. The windfall fattened profits and led to a frenzy of companies buying back their own shares, which propelled stocks still higher.Investors loved it. Bankers loved it. Corporate executives loved it. The money showered upon them from tax cuts and the seemingly invincible bull market mollified even those who privately grimaced at the president's pronouncements and social policies.But nobody loved it like Mr. Trump. He has tweeted about the stock market at least 131 times since becoming president. He kept a running tally of stock market records -- 135 by his last count, on Dec. 19. He personalized the rally, referring to ""my stock market gains.""In some ways, Mr. Trump, with his fixation on the markets, has resembled old-school corporate chieftains like Sandy Weill. As chairman and chief executive of Citigroup, Mr. Weill kept moment-to-moment tabs on his company's stock price, viewing it as the best quantifiable measure of his performance. But Mr. Weill got out before the reckoning. Two years after he retired in 2006, Citigroup, deep in debt and burdened with toxic assets after years of financial recklessness, required $45 billion in taxpayer bailouts.By taking credit, over and over, for the stock market's record run, Mr. Trump arguably set himself up to be blamed for its record fall. (Mr. Trump has repeatedly insisted that he be measured by the market's performance starting on Nov. 9, 2016, the day after his election, rather than when he took office. By that measure, stock markets are still up on his watch, though not by much.)So deeply has Mr. Trump interwoven his fortunes with those of the markets that plenty of members of the Trump-loathing left have watched markets plunge with a dose of schadenfreude.""If you politically live by the stock market, you can politically die by the stock market,"" said Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington. She said she hoped that, with Mr. Trump no longer able to bask in the warmth of an epic market rally, the public would have a clearer view of his deficiencies. But, she added, ""I'm not rooting for the market to tank.""Democrats' distrust of Mr. Trump runs deep. Some have kept their money out of the stock markets, according to a team of economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studied anonymized data about the stock portfolios for millions of investors.""People who are more likely to be Republicans, after the 2016 election, were a bit more likely to put money into the stock market, while Democrats do the opposite,"" said Antoinette Schoar, an M.I.T. professor.For a long time, as markets roared, that meant missing out on big profits. Now it's not looking like such a bad decision.""I'd wished I'd went to even more cash,"" said Tom Leohr, a 65-year-old Iowa retiree who said he had significantly reduced his stock holdings after Mr. Trump won the election.""I know buy-and-hold is the way to go,"" said Mr. Leohr, who worked for 30 years at the John Deere tractor works in Waterloo. ""But I just couldn't do it with Trump, just couldn't. Still can't.""Even as markets were cratering this month, Mr. Trump has clung to the good days.As he spoke at a White House news conference on the afternoon of March 13, the stock markets staged a 9 percent rally. It wasn't enough to recover from the drop the day before, but Mr. Trump was so jubilant that he printed out a chart of the day's market activity, autographed it and sent it to a Fox Business anchor.""BIGGEST STOCK MARKET RISE IN HISTORY YESTERDAY!"" Mr. Trump shouted on Twitter the next day. (It was the Dow's biggest gain in total points, but the biggest percentage gain only since 2008.)Those gains were erased within moments of the opening of markets the next Monday -- and Mr. Trump, for the first time in his presidency, adopted a more philosophical tone.The best thing to do for stocks is to contain the coronavirus, he said at a press briefing on Monday. ""The market will take care of itself.""PhotographA month ago, President Trump declared on Twitter, ""Highest Stock Market In History, By Far!"" But stocks have collapsed about 35 percent since then.

| Jump to first hitWith the president on the verge of acquittal in the Senate, Speaker Nancy Pelosi made the case that Democrats had won by losing. ""He has been impeached forever,"" she said in an interview.WASHINGTON -- Speaker Nancy Pelosi always knew impeachment would end this way: with the acquittal of President Trump.Now that it is all but over -- and Mr. Trump is about to march onto her home turf, the Capitol, for his inevitable victory lap at his State of the Union address on Tuesday night -- Ms. Pelosi must reckon with what she has wrought. Her Republican detractors say she put moderate Democrats in political peril and weakened the House inquiry by failing to wage a prolonged legal fight to obtain critical testimony that the president was blocking.And Republicans gloat that the failed attempt at removing Mr. Trump has only made him more politically powerful, energizing voters to rally behind a president who survived the ultimate effort to take him down.But Democrats argue that Ms. Pelosi won by losing, setting the stage for an election that is not only about the kitchen table issues that carried them to the majority in 2018, but also about exposing the president as unfit for office -- and Republicans as complicit in his misbehavior. In an interview Monday, Ms. Pelosi said Democrats had forced Republicans to do what Mr. Trump never has: Admit that he was wrong to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.""I think that we have pulled back a veil of behavior totally unacceptable to our founders, and that the public will see this with a clearer eye, an unblurred eye,"" she said, adding: ""Whatever happens, he has been impeached forever. And now these senators, though they don't have the courage to assign the appropriate penalty, at least are recognizing that he did something wrong.""Impeachment has been a tricky enterprise for both parties on both sides of the Capitol. In the Senate, where Democrats are in the minority, Mr. Trump's impeachment trial -- which is expected to conclude with his acquittal on Wednesday -- forced vulnerable Republicans in swing states to align themselves with a president who brooks no dissent. They bristled at being painted as beholden to Mr. Trump, reacting angrily when the lead House impeachment manager referred to a news report that said Republican senators had been told their heads would be ""on a pike"" if they voted against him.But in the House, impeachment was widely viewed as a gamble for moderates who represent districts where Mr. Trump is popular. While Ms. Pelosi gets generally good marks from her rank and file, some centrist members now grumble privately that she made some tactical missteps.Her refusal to send the articles of impeachment to the Senate for several weeks after the House adopted them, which forced a delay in the Senate trial, generated blowback in swing districts, said Democratic lawmakers who insisted on anonymity to speak candidly. They cringed when Ms. Pelosi made a spectacle out of the eventual signing of the articles in January, when she distributed commemorative pens to colleagues. Critics said it undermined her own oft-stated message that this was a ""somber"" and ""prayerful moment"" for the country.""Her whole thing was this was a solemn moment, and that was undignified to do a pen ceremony,"" said one moderate Democrat in Congress, who insisted on anonymity for fear of retribution from the speaker. ""A lot of us in the front line felt that wasn't helpful.""Other Democrats have questioned the decision to impeach Mr. Trump without exhausting the House's legal remedies to compel the testimony of key White House witnesses. Those fights could have taken months, potentially pushing a vote to charge him up against the presidential election, or even beyond.But most Democrats defend Ms. Pelosi. With the economy booming and unemployment low, Mr. Trump should be coasting to victory in 2020, they say. Instead, Republicans like Senators Marco Rubio and Lamar Alexander now say Mr. Trump violated the bounds of appropriate presidential behavior. Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, on Monday called Mr. Trump's behavior ""shameful and wrong,"" and said he had degraded the office.""It has raised the stakes,"" said Representative Tom Malinowski, a centrist freshman Democrat from New Jersey who faces a tough re-election challenge from the son of a popular former governor. ""I don't think it's a loss. It illuminates that the next election isn't just about whether we continue Trump's crazy policies; it's whether we remain a constitutional democracy. That is a debate I am absolutely confident we are winning.""And at the end of the day, Mr. Trump will still go down as only the third president in American history to be impeached. It is an ""ugly distinction,"" in the words of Brian Fallon, the executive director of Demand Justice, a progressive advocacy group.It is no secret in Washington that Ms. Pelosi was never eager to impeach the president. She resisted it for months -- even after Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 election, outlined 10 possible instances of obstruction of justice by the president. She said it would be too divisive and that it ought to be bipartisan, comments that Republicans throw back at her today.""She's violated her own criteria in this case when she said it had to be bipartisan,"" said Tom Davis, a former Republican congressman from Virginia. ""If anything, it's bipartisan -- she lost two of her members. I think that's the question she's got to answer.""(Mr. Davis was referring to Representatives Jeff Van Drew of New Jersey and Collin Peterson of Minnesota; both voted against impeachment, but Mr. Van Drew has since become a Republican.)Ms. Pelosi has answered the question before. She argues, as she did on Monday, that in trying to use Ukraine to gain an advantage in the 2020 election, ""the president gave us no choice but to protect and defend our Constitution and oath of office we take."" While some say that Mr. Trump's acquittal will only embolden him, both Ms. Pelosi and Representative Adam B. Schiff, the lead House impeachment manager, insisted the inquiry and trial had, at the very least, increased scrutiny of a president who ordinarily feels no constraints.""To those who would say that the president will now feel unbound, he already felt unbound,"" Mr. Schiff said.Ms. Pelosi put it this way: ""I think the spotlight that is on him will be very hot for him to handle.""Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster, said that in impeaching and trying Mr. Trump on charges of high crimes and misdemeanors, Democrats had ""not gained very much except for intensifying the feelings about the president, both pro and con.""But Carlos Curbelo, a former Republican congressman from Florida who lost re-election in 2018, said that in pursuing impeachment, Ms. Pelosi may have created an opportunity for Democratic presidential candidates to follow the playbook of George W. Bush, who campaigned in 2000 on restoring dignity to the White House after the impeachment of President Bill Clinton.""The opportunity for Republicans is to make gains with those voters who think impeachment is just out of step and a zealous enterprise,"" Mr. Curbelo said, ""and for Democrats, it's with those voters who are growing tired of all the scandal and controversy and wanted a more fair and complete process in the Senate.""In the interview, Ms. Pelosi took aim at both Mr. Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader. Mr. McConnell managed to eke out the 51 votes he needed to prevent the Senate from subpoenaing witnesses like John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, whose forthcoming book confirms the allegations against Mr. Trump. (Asked whether the House intends to subpoena Mr. Bolton, Mr. Schiff said Democrats would have ""more to say about that later."")Calling Mr. McConnell a ""wholly owned subsidiary of the White House,"" and Mr. Trump his ""puppeteer,"" Ms. Pelosi said the president had also tarnished the Senate.She lapsed into a tough-guy cadence as she described her view of the president's message to senators, as delivered by the majority leader: ""You don't even have a choice, you ain't gonna hear no witnesses, you ain't gonna see no documentation, 'cause we're not letting you do it -- and by the way, you are going to put your imprimatur on it.""On Tuesday evening, the fraught dynamic between Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Trump will be on display in the Capitol, at the very spot on the House rostrum where she presided over the votes to impeach him. During last year's State of the Union address, Ms. Pelosi was photographed smirking as she clapped sideways at Mr. Trump. The image went viral, interpreted by many as a sarcastic gesture by the speaker, though she has said she did not intend it that way.This time, Ms. Pelosi said Democrats stand ready to work with the president on the issues he is expected to discuss, like infrastructure and lowering the cost of prescription drugs, but she did not sound entirely eager to hear him speak.""It will have a beginning, a middle and an end -- and then it will be over,"" she said. ""So what's the big deal?""Ms. Pelosi said she had not spoken to the president since mid-October, when she went to the White House to participate in a meeting about Syria and abruptly left after a confrontation with Mr. Trump. (A White House photograph of her wagging her finger at the president went viral, too.)When he arrives at the Capitol on Tuesday night, she said, Democrats would treat Mr. Trump ""as a guest in our House -- and we hope he will behave as a guest in our House.""""But,"" she added, ""we never have that expectation.""Trump on Trial is a continuing series of articles offering reporting, analysis and impressions of the Senate impeachment proceedings.Trump on Trial is a continuing series of articles offering reporting, analysis and impressions of the Senate impeachment proceedings.PhotographSpeaker Nancy Pelosi said the president's impeachment ""pulled back a veil of behavior totally unacceptable to our founders.""

| Jump to first hitWeeks ago, his advisers were counting on a strong economy and a Democratic opponent easily portrayed as too far left. But the political landscape has sharply shifted.President Trump faces the biggest challenge yet to his prospects of being re-elected, with his advisers' two major assumptions for the campaign -- a booming economy and an opponent easily vilified as too far left -- quickly evaporating.After a year in which Mr. Trump has told voters that they must support his re-election or risk watching the economy decline, the stock market is reeling and economists are warning that a recession could be on the horizon because of the worsening spread of the coronavirus.And instead of elevating Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, as Mr. Trump made clear was his hope, Democrats have suddenly and decisively swung from a flirtation with socialism to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has run a primary campaign centered on a return to political normalcy.""Biden's success in the suburbs makes him an acceptable alternative to Trump,"" said Scott Reed, the top political adviser for the United States Chamber of Commerce. ""His turnout in the suburbs threatens the Republican Senate.""That presents Mr. Trump with a confounding new political landscape, one that close advisers concede he had seemed unwilling or unable to accept until Wednesday, when he addressed the nation about the pandemic.""If it was Warren or Bernie and you don't have coronavirus, I think Trump might sneak by,"" said Kevin DeWine, the former chairman of the Ohio Republican Party. ""But if it's Biden, 'My I.R.A. has tanked,' and we're going to have complete disruption because of coronavirus, I think it's a totally different story.""Ohio, a traditional presidential battleground that has been trending Republican, would be in play again, Mr. DeWine said. Such Midwestern states were central to Mr. Trump's election in 2016, and are likely to be similarly crucial this year.Of course, what happens in March may ultimately have little bearing in November. Mr. Trump maintains the bully pulpit of the presidency, and Mr. Biden largely avoided intense scrutiny from rivals in a crowded, up-and-down primary campaign.And if there's any constant in the Trump era, it is that what's in the news at a given moment will change in a matter of hours, days or at most weeks. The virus may be mitigated, the economy could rebound, and Mr. Biden's decades of life in Washington and propensity for gaffes may render him as weak a candidate as some of his rivals in the primary had long predicted.Yet if Mr. Trump does lose re-election, the seeds of demise may prove to have been planted in early spring.One challenge for the president is that the type of management response required of chief executives during crises like a pandemic has never been his strength. Empathy and public displays of emotion do not come easily to him. On Twitter, his favorite medium, he has been consumed by how people are perceiving his handling of the crisis and has focused on criticizing Democrats.And so far, he has resisted entreaties from advisers to cancel events, or to send a strong signal that he's willing to put the political season on hold as the full effects of the coronavirus are assessed.""A leader needs to be transparent, clear, empathetic, serious, and all-in,"" said Jeb Bush, a former governor of Florida who ran against Mr. Trump in the 2016 Republican primary and received bipartisan praise for how he handled hurricanes during his tenure. ""A leader needs to communicate consistently and regularly. A leader needs to show his or her heart, which has to be done outside the governor's mansion or the White House.""Mr. Bush added that a leader needs ""to shut down partisan politics and campaigning"" and ""to trust the experts and allow the strategy to be developed with them,"" as well as think about how to deal with the recovery.Mr. Biden, by contrast, has had his entire political life defined by his personal tragedies -- including the death of his wife and daughter decades ago, and then his eldest son, Beau, more recently -- and his efforts to rise from them and encourage others to do the same.On Wednesday afternoon, shortly before he was scheduled to speak to reporters, Mr. Trump rebuked congressional Democrats, who have indicated they aren't waiting for the president's guidance on an economic package to help the economy. ""Someone needs to tell the Democrats in Congress that CoronaVirus doesn't care what party you are in. We need to protect ALL Americans!"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter.In interviews, a half-dozen Republicans close to the president's campaign said that his re-election effort had become a political battleship, slow and creaky to turn, unlike the nimble race Mr. Trump ran in 2016. Several advisers worked on Tuesday to persuade Mr. Trump not to let the campaign announce a rally tentatively scheduled for the end of the month in Florida; those advisers ultimately won.Aides have sent mixed signals about how they plan to approach Mr. Biden, with some wanting to portray him as a 2020 version of Hillary Clinton, and others wanting to try to define him as interchangeable with Mr. Sanders because of some of the progressive stances Mr. Biden has adopted.Primary results cannot easily be projected onto general elections, but the surge in Democratic turnout so far has not only helped Mr. Biden, it has also illustrated what may be Mr. Trump's most glaring vulnerability. The former vice president has established a commanding delegate lead in part because of a surge of suburban voters including many from affluent jurisdictions.In Virginia, North Carolina and Michigan -- each a general election battleground -- Mr. Biden benefited from a large increase in turnout among moderate voters in the Washington, Charlotte and Detroit suburbs.In Michigan, for example, over a million and a half voters participated in the Democratic primary Tuesday -- up from just over 1.2 million in 2016 there. But it was where the turnout jumped so much that was revealing and, for Mr. Trump, ominous. In affluent Oakland County, Mitt Romney's boyhood home and an epicenter of the Democrats' 2018 midterm election gains, turnout went from approximately 180,000 in 2016 to about 260,000 on Tuesday.Mr. Trump's team of actual political strategists is small, despite the large staff employed by his campaign, and his campaign manager only recently relocated to Washington, where the headquarters is based. After data leaked early on, information is closely guarded and formal polling is ordered only every few months. On Tuesday, as Mr. Trump sat with advisers in the late morning going over the results of the latest campaign surveys, some of the data was already out of date.Representative Francis Rooney, a Florida Republican who is not seeking re-election, said the likelihood that Mr. Biden would be the nominee alone ""makes this a race.""Mr. Rooney said Mr. Biden was ""moderate, well-reasoned and genuinely likable -- none of those things are what Sanders are.""And echoing a number of leading officials in both parties, Mr. Rooney said that if Mr. Biden wins the nomination, it would illustrate the degree to which 2016 was a referendum on the Democratic nominee rather than on Mr. Trump.""The question is how many people voted for him because they didn't want Hillary Clinton,"" he said, arguing that Mr. Biden's center-left politics effectively made him ""Hillary without the other negatives.""Mr. Trump's advisers argue otherwise -- and indeed it was their enthusiasm for digging into the record of Mr. Biden's son Hunter that led to the president's impeachment.But what alarms many Republicans about the political impact of the virus is that it will so overwhelm the news that it will be difficult to highlight their opposition research about Mr. Biden or draw attention to his gaffes.One prominent party strategist working on a number of congressional races this year said a series of polls taken in the last two weeks showed the president's approval ratings receding to where they were before the 2018 midterms, giving back the gains he made in the aftermath of his impeachment acquittal.This strategist, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about Mr. Trump, said he worried the virus and its effects on the economy would make this campaign entirely about the president, much like the 2018 midterms.And no modern president may perform better with a foil or worse when measured in his own right than Mr. Trump.Nonetheless, there have been some constants in terms of how Mr. Trump is perceived by voters.""The president's job approval has bounced around between 42 percent and 46 percent ever since the spring of 2018, so variation within that range should not be interpreted as anything particularly significant,"" said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster. ""If he should break above 46 percent or below 42 percent in the polling averages, then I'll start to take that seriously.""Representative Chip Roy, a Texas Republican facing a potentially competitive re-election, said it was premature to make sweeping assessments about an election so far off. ""That's a lifetime in politics, especially today,"" he said.But he did offer Mr. Trump a dose of tough-love advice and, in doing so, he suggested that the president's prospects might hinge in part on how he handles the current health crisis.""Don't talk about politics, just march forward and do your job,"" Mr. Roy said, adding that voters would ask, ""'Did we react properly?' That's how the judgment will fall.""Mr. Rooney was even more pointed, urging Mr. Trump to show leadership and take drastic steps to curb the spread of the virus. ""He ought to be doing what other countries are doing,"" he said, such as urging people to stay home, closing schools and demanding public events be rescheduled. ""It's a serious health risk here and you've got to ask: Where is the United States?""But former Representative Kevin Yoder, a Kansas Republican swept out in the 2018 suburban backlash to Mr. Trump, said that Mr. Biden's ascent had greatly complicated Mr. Trump's prospects.""Joe Biden will be very palatable to some of the same moderates who voted against Republicans in the midterms,"" said Mr. Yoder, predicting that Republicans would need embittered Sanders supporters to stay home because ""we're not going to see a flip back of suburban independents.""Mr. DeWine put it more bluntly: ""If it's Biden, you'll have disaffected Republicans run to the polls to vote for Biden because they're just looking for normal and sane,"" he said.PhotographPresident Trump, who was counting on a racing economy and a strong showing by Senator Bernie Sanders, now faces the prospect of a moderate opponent in former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., left, and a possible recession.

| Jump to first hitWhen President Trump comes to visit, world leaders face the challenge of finding ways to entertain and impress a leader who relishes spectacle.NEW DELHI -- One of the most nerve-racking moments for any world leader these days comes with these six words: President Trump is coming to town.Hosting any American leader is demanding enough with the usual requirements of diplomacy, protocol and geopolitics, but with Mr. Trump comes an additional challenge: how to entertain and impress a president who relishes spectacle and cherishes anything that is the first, the most or the biggest.The British have a queen, so they made a grand show of a state dinner at Buckingham Palace. The French have Bastille Day, so they invited the president to view their elaborate military parade down the Champs-Élysées. The Japanese have an emperor, so they invited Mr. Trump to be the first foreign leader to visit their newly installed monarch -- and threw in a sumo match with a special presidential trophy for good measure.Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India opted to appeal to Mr. Trump's first love -- crowd size -- as he stages a rally of more than 100,000 people in Ahmedabad on Monday after a drive in from the airport along roads where perhaps 100,000 more will line the motorcade route. The president will almost certainly not be greeted by the 10 million people he expects, but it will look like an enormous crowd nonetheless and, the Indians hope, satisfy his need for affirmation.""World leaders are vying with each other to appeal to President Trump's vanity,"" said R. Nicholas Burns, a former under secretary of state under President George W. Bush who helped pave the way for agreements with India during that administration. ""They understand his foreign trips are more about the image he wants to strike rather than substantive breakthroughs between governments.""White House aides deny that the president's trips are all about show. The United States and India have important issues involving trade and security for Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi to discuss, although administration officials briefing reporters before the president's departure from Washington on Sunday made clear that the comprehensive trade agreement he seeks with India remains far-off.What has seemed to animate Mr. Trump the most, though, are Mr. Modi's promises of cheering crowds. ""He told me we'll have seven million people between the airport and the event,"" Mr. Trump told reporters last Tuesday.Two days later, Mr. Trump ratcheted up the estimate to eight digits. ""I hear they're going to have 10 million people,"" he said at a campaign rally. ""They say anywhere from six to 10 million people are going to be showing up along the route to one of the largest stadiums in the world.""By Sunday as he was leaving the White House to begin his long trip, it had become ""millions and millions"" of people. ""Some people say the biggest event they've ever had in India,"" Mr. Trump told reporters. ""That's what the prime minister told me.""A crowd of 10 million would exceed the entire population of Ahmedabad, estimated at eight million. Local officials estimate that it will be more like 100,000, making Mr. Trump off by only 99 percent. But Motera Stadium, which is not really fully built yet, is supposed to become the largest cricket arena in the world.Other countries could not muster that show of force and so have taken advantage of whatever local assets they might have when Mr. Trump has come to visit. For Britain, of course, that would be Queen Elizabeth II, the world's longest-reigning monarch, who welcomed him to Buckingham Palace last year with an 82-gun salute and a lavish white-tie state banquet.""Crowd size is important to this president, so he was clearly thrilled to be told there would be seven million people on the streets"" in India, said Peter Westmacott, a former British ambassador to the United States. ""We couldn't manage that in the U.K., but twice in the space of a year he seemed bowled over by the warmth of the welcome he received from the royal family.""Mr. Trump was so blown away by the Bastille Day military parade in Paris when President Emmanuel Macron of France invited him in 2017 that the president insisted on organizing his own American equivalent along the streets of Washington as part of last year's Independence Day celebration.Perhaps with that in mind, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia is trying to entice Mr. Trump to come to Moscow in May by inviting him to the Red Square parade marking the 75th anniversary of the victory over Nazi Germany. Mr. Trump, however, appears wary of the awkward politics of such a visit given the election year and Russia's continued interference in American campaigns.Japan eschews militarism and therefore military parades, but it sought to make Mr. Trump feel special by making him the first foreign head of state invited to meet Emperor Naruhito after his ascension to the throne. The Japanese also asked Mr. Trump to present his own trophy at a sumo champion match -- a four-foot-tall object duly labeled the President's Cup for the event.""World leaders have learned to shorten or scrap the historical tours, remove local delicacies from the menu and focus on one thing only: feeding his ego,"" said Julianne Smith, the director of the Asia program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. ""That's taken different forms in recent years, but the goal is always the same -- make Trump feel like he's getting something unique: a parade in Paris, a grand state dinner at Buckingham Palace or a sumo match with a President's Cup in Japan.""Not every country can compete. When Mr. Trump was due to travel to South Korea last year, the government in Seoul fretted over what it could come up with that would seem special. The South Koreans have no queen or emperor. But what they do have is a Demilitarized Zone, where Mr. Trump could visit and even, in a surprise first of its kind, step across into North Korean territory and stage a theatrical last-minute meeting with Kim Jong-un.Critics said that meeting, like a parade or a banquet, was just for the pictures, with no lasting result, and that the president should focus more on policy initiatives when he arrives in India. ""Trump would be far wiser to frame the visit on substance -- our strong military collaboration with India, Japan and Australia in limiting China, for example, rather than on seeking applause from crowds in a stadium,"" Mr. Burns said.But symbolism has its value as well, and if a major trade agreement is not in the offing, then the Indians are determined that Mr. Trump go home with warm feelings about their country, throwing in a sunset tour of the Taj Mahal and a state dinner as well.""I think the optics, he will get more of them than other presidents do, because I think the Indians recognize that that is something that he will want and will appreciate and will perhaps keep them in good stead over the next few months,"" said Tanvi Madan, the director of the India Project at the Brookings Institution.And in addition to the crowds, India may have something to offer that other countries do not. ""I would not be surprised if the Indians named something after President Trump,"" Ms. Madan said. Like a village, something they did for President Jimmy Carter when he visited. ""I think you will see them take extra efforts on the optics front for this president.""PhotographCommuters passing by cutouts of President Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Ahmedabad, India.; Workers preparing a new entry gate at Motera Stadium in Ahmedabad, which President Trump is expected to visit.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump has convinced his supporters that the economy's ability to grow rests solely with his continued leadership.WASHINGTON -- One of President Trump's greatest strengths in his presidential campaign is his economic salesmanship: He has convinced a devoted share of Americans that his leadership has made the U.S. economy bulletproof and that markets would crash if he were defeated in November.The president's ability to set the economic narrative is buoyed by an 11-year economic expansion, with rising wages and unemployment at a 50-year low. That strength presents a challenge for the Democrats hoping to unseat him in November -- even though Mr. Trump's cheerleading is often overstated and parts of the economy are slowing, including manufacturing.That helps explain why Mr. Trump has played down economic damage from the coronavirus and dismissed the stock market plunge: They threaten to undermine the most effective story he tells about his presidency.""The country is in great shape, the market is in great shape,"" Mr. Trump told reporters outside the White House on Tuesday, as stocks tumbled after the Federal Reserve's rate cut. The S&P 500 ended the day down about 2.8 percent.Mr. Trump has blamed any growth hiccups on external events, like the Democrats running for president, troubles at the aerospace giant Boeing and the Federal Reserve. He has praised consumers and the economy's strength, even as forecasters warn that the virus could dampen growth at least temporarily this year.On Monday, Mr. Trump suggested on Twitter that House Democrats pass a one-year cut in payroll taxes, a form of fiscal stimulus often aimed at boosting consumer spending at times of economic weakness. Yet the president did not concede any economic trouble.""This is an incredible time for our nation,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, confidence is surging.""That kind of rhetoric has served Mr. Trump well during his first three years in office, helping him win credit -- at least among supporters -- for what remains a strong economy. But experts warn that it has also helped widen a partisan divide on the economy, which may make it more difficult for Mr. Trump to reassure the public in the event of a crisis, like the spread of coronavirus.""The aura of the office, where people might have deferred to the message about the state of the economy, I think today that's gone,"" said Shanto Iyengar, a political scientist at Stanford University. ""It's gone because of the hyper-partisanship.""Americans who tune into Mr. Trump's messages are far more likely to echo his language on the economy and are more optimistic about it, according to a new nationwide poll conducted last month for The New York Times by the online research firm SurveyMonkey.Respondents were asked to choose from a list of terms that could describe the state of the economy. Those who said they regularly watched or followed news coverage of Mr. Trump's speeches were about twice as likely to describe the economy as ""booming"" or the ""best economy ever,"" and they were far more likely to express confidence in the economy and give Mr. Trump credit for its condition.The split persisted among Democrats, independents and even among Republicans. More than eight in 10 Republican voters who regularly follow Mr. Trump's speeches say Mr. Trump deserves ""a lot"" of credit for the economy. Only about one in three Republicans who do not regularly follow the speeches said the same.Will Hicks, a 32-year-old survey respondent in the oil field town of Roosevelt, Utah, said Mr. Trump's election provided an immediate jolt to people in his area. He credits Mr. Trump and his boosterism for much of that, even though he said the president's claims were often overstated.""His viewpoint is all positive, that we're going to get greater, we're going to improve our economy,"" Mr. Hicks said. ""I think that push forward, even though it might be a little bit of an exaggeration, has helped the economy.""Some economists agree. Robert Shiller, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at Yale, has described Mr. Trump's cheerleading as the driving force behind the continuation of the now-record economic expansion over the last three years.In a presentation earlier this year -- in which he compared Mr. Trump's economic messaging to the spread of a pandemic virus -- Mr. Shiller reported than 62 percent of newspaper articles that mentioned a ""strong economy"" from 2017 to 2019 also mentioned Mr. Trump. That's more than twice the rate of association that President Bill Clinton enjoyed during a stronger economy in the late 1990s.Mr. Trump ""is our first motivational-speaker president,"" Mr. Shiller said.Mr. Trump made grand economic promises a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign, and he reveled in the stock-market surge that followed his victory. Even before he took office, consumer and small-business confidence levels soared, driven largely by Mr. Trump's Republican supporters. Both measures have remained elevated throughout his term, with sentiment among Republican consumers hitting a record high in February in a long-running survey from the University of Michigan.But on several measures, the economy has fallen short of the president's promises. It grew 2.3 percent last year, well below the forecasts of Mr. Trump's economic team, as the president's trade war chilled business investment. Economic growth in the first three years of President Barack Obama's second term was nearly identical to that of Mr. Trump's first three years. Median wage growth is no higher today than it was in October 2016, and it remains well below the levels of the late 1990s.Small business owners' expectations for capital investment now are essentially unchanged from before the 2016 election. Among consumers, the postelection rise in confidence has failed to translate into a sustained improvement in spending, shattering a longstanding relationship. After Mr. Trump's election, said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, ""a gap opened up between the spending and confidence numbers, and that gap has persisted.""The confidence gap is driven entirely by asymmetric partisanship, powered by a surge in Republican sentiment. When Mr. Obama was in office, surveys consistently showed that Democrats felt better about the economy than Republicans. When Mr. Trump was elected, the pattern reversed almost overnight, though the surge in Republican optimism was larger than the drop-off among Democrats.Masha Krupenkin, a Boston College political scientist, said Republicans show bigger swings in economic confidence, and exhibit a similar pattern in surveys that ask about trust in government, depending on which party controls the White House, compared with Democrats.The Times survey showed Democrats were less optimistic about the economy and less willing to credit Mr. Trump for it than Republicans were. Confidence among independent voters has fallen to a level between that of Democrats and Republicans, but closer to Democrats', during Mr. Trump's term. (Optimism among independents surged in January, but came back to earth in February, according to the Times survey.)Douglas Prasher, a Democratic voter in Prescott Valley, Ariz., said he didn't buy claims that the economy was doing well -- and he didn't think Mr. Trump deserved credit if it was. Mr. Prasher, 68, recently retired to Arizona from San Diego, which he said had become unaffordable because of sky-high housing costs. His new home state is cheaper, but he has still had to take on a part-time job to make ends meet. He carries hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loan debt from helping his daughters go to college.""As far as I'm concerned, people are suffering,"" Mr. Prasher said. The supposedly strong economy, he said, ""seems to only help the wealthy, which we're not in that category.""That rhetoric echoes the message of Democratic candidates running for the White House, who frequently claim that the economy is ""rigged"" or only works for the very rich. Democrats in the Times survey were much more likely to use that phrasing to describe the economy than Mr. Trump's preferred terms. So were independents, who were six times as likely to call the economy ""rigged"" or badly broken"" as to say it was the ""best economy ever.""Mr. Trump's aggressive claims -- that it is not just strong but ""the best ever"" -- may make him less credible to people not already inclined to support him, said Michele Claibourn, a political scientist at the University of Virginia. ""It's easier to resist as information if it feels exaggerated,"" she said.Ms. Claibourn said presidents have historically tried to distinguish between when they were speaking as party leaders and when they were addressing the public in their official, less partisan, capacity. Those lines have blurred over the decades. Under Mr. Trump, the distinction has disappeared almost entirely, she said.Jim Tankersley reported from Washington, and Ben Casselman from New York.PhotographPresident Trump at a rally in Charlotte, N.C.

| Jump to first hitHis acquittal in the Senate assured, the emboldened president will take his victory and grievance to the campaign trail, no longer worried about congressional constraint.WASHINGTON -- Ralph Waldo Emerson seemed to foresee the lesson of the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump. ""When you strike at a king,"" Emerson famously said, ""you must kill him.""Mr. Trump's foes struck at him but did not take him down.With the end of the impeachment trial now in sight and acquittal assured, a triumphant Mr. Trump emerges from the biggest test of his presidency emboldened, ready to claim exoneration and take his case of grievance, persecution and resentment to the campaign trail.The president's Democratic adversaries rolled out the biggest constitutional weapon they had and failed to defeat him, or even to force a full trial with witnesses testifying to the allegations against him. Now Mr. Trump, who has said that the Constitution ""allows me to do whatever I want"" and pushed so many boundaries that curtailed past presidents, has little reason to fear the legislative branch nor any inclination to reach out in conciliation.""I don't think in any way Trump is willing to move on,"" said Mickey Edwards, a former Republican congressman who teaches at Princeton University. ""I think he will just have been given a green light and he will claim not just acquittal but vindication and he can do those things and they can't impeach him again. I think this is going to empower him to be much bolder. I would expect to see him even more let loose.""Impeachment will always be a stain on Mr. Trump's historical record, a reality that has stung him in private, according to some close to him. But he will be the first president in American history to face voters after an impeachment trial and that will give him the chance to argue for the next nine months that his enemies have spent his entire presidency plotting against him to undo the 2016 election.""This was clearly a political coup d'état carried out by a group of people who were amazingly, openly dishonest and I think it's going to be repudiated,"" said former Speaker Newt Gingrich, a strong ally of the president's. ""He's been beaten up for three solid years and he's still standing. That's an amazing achievement if you think about it.""Even before a final vote on the impeachment charges on Wednesday, Mr. Trump has several high-profile opportunities in the next few days to begin framing the new post-trial environment to his advantage.On Sunday, he will be interviewed by Sean Hannity of Fox News during the pregame of the Super Bowl, one of the most watched television events of the year. Then on Tuesday, he will deliver his State of the Union address from the dais in the House chamber where he was impeached in December.A senior administration official briefing reporters on Friday said the president will use his State of the Union address to celebrate ""the great American comeback"" and present ""a vision of relentless optimism"" encouraging Congress to work with him. Mr. Trump plans to pursue an agenda of cutting taxes again, bringing down prescription drug prices, completing his trade negotiations with China and further restricting immigration.From there, Mr. Trump will head back to the campaign trail, starting with a rally in New Hampshire on Feb. 10, the night before the state's first-in-the-nation primary race, an effort to upstage the Democrats as they try to pick a nominee to face him in the fall.Democrats insist that Mr. Trump has been damaged by the evidence presented to the public that he sought to use the power of his office to illicitly benefit his own re-election chances. Even as they line up to acquit him, some Senate Republicans have acknowledged that the House managers prosecuting the case proved that Mr. Trump withheld $391 million in security aid to Ukraine as part of an effort to pressure it to announce political investigations into his domestic rivals.But the public comes out of the impeachment trial pretty close to where it was when it started, divided starkly down the middle with somewhat more Americans against Mr. Trump than for him.When the House impeached him in December, 47.4 percent supported the move and 46.5 percent opposed it, according to an analysis of multiple surveys by the polling analysis site FiveThirtyEight. Now as the trial wraps up, 49.5 percent favor impeachment versus 46.4 percent who do not.Those numbers are strikingly close to the popular vote results from 2016, when Mr. Trump trailed Hillary Clinton 46 percent to 48 percent even as he prevailed in the Electoral College. That means that the public today is roughly where it was three years ago; few seem to have changed their minds. And the president has done nothing to expand his base and by traditional measures is a weak candidate for a second term, forcing him to try to pull the same Electoral College inside straight he did last time.Mr. Trump is the only president in the history of Gallup polling who has never had the support of a majority of Americans for even a single day, a troubling indicator for re-election. Nine months is an eternity in American politics these days and, given his history, Mr. Trump could easily create another furor that will change the campaign dynamics, the economy could become an issue, and with all the accumulated allegations some analysts anticipate a certain scandal fatigue could weigh him down.But Mr. Trump is gambling that he can rally his most fervent supporters by making the case that he was the victim and not the villain of impeachment while keeping disenchanted supporters on board with steady economic growth, rising military spending and conservative judicial appointments. He has made clear he will paint former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as corrupt if he faces him in the fall and will assail other possible Democratic challengers as socialists.If Mr. Trump does win a second term, it would be the first time an impeached president had the opportunity to serve five years after his trial and Mr. Trump's critics worry that he would feel unbound. He has already used his power in ways that presidents since Richard M. Nixon considered out of line, like firing an F.B.I. director who was investigating him and browbeating the Justice Department to investigate his political foes.While in theory nothing in the Constitution would prevent the House from impeaching him again, as a political matter that seems implausible given that he has demonstrated his complete command over congressional Republicans led by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, leaving the president less to fear from a Democratic House. Some House managers warned that acquittal would lower the bar for presidential misconduct, meaning that Mr. Trump would feel even freer to use his power for his own benefit because he got away with it.""He is going to ratchet it up to another level now,"" said Anthony Scaramucci, the onetime White House communications director who has broken with Mr. Trump. ""He's going to be Trump to the third power now. He's not going to be exponential Trump because that's not enough Trump. It's going to be Trump to the third power.""But in that, Mr. Scaramucci said, are the seeds of Mr. Trump's own downfall because he could go so far that he finally alienates enough of the public to lose. ""The one person who absolutely can beat Trump is Trump,"" he said.No other impeached president had the opportunity or challenge that Mr. Trump does. President Andrew Johnson, who was acquitted in 1868, was a man without a party, a Democrat who had joined the Republican Abraham Lincoln's ticket, and was so disliked that both parties nominated other candidates shortly after his Senate trial, leaving him to finish his last 10 months in office a lame duck.Indeed, while Johnson was not removed from office, impeachment reduced him to a shadow president, said Brenda Wineapple, author of ""The Impeachers,"" an account of his trial.""The Republicans still had a majority in Congress so they could reject some of his appointments, which they did, and override his vetoes of their legislation -- and they could allow the states that conformed to the Reconstruction Acts to re-enter the Union,"" she said. ""So in that sense, Johnson was hamstrung, if not powerless.""President Bill Clinton was in his second term when he was impeached and acquitted, never to be on a ballot again. With nearly two years left in office, he tried to move on from his impeachment, all but pretending it had not happened. On the day of his acquittal in 1999, he appeared in the Rose Garden alone and expressed regret rather than vindication.""I want to say again to the American people how profoundly sorry I am for what I said and did to trigger these events and the great burden they have imposed on the Congress and on the American people,"" Mr. Clinton said, calling for ""a time of reconciliation and renewal.""As he turned to leave, a reporter called after him. ""In your heart, sir, can you forgive and forget?""Mr. Clinton paused as if deciding whether to take the bait, then turned and answered, ""I believe any person who asks for forgiveness has to be prepared to give it.""Mr. Clinton, who unlike Mr. Trump admitted wrongdoing without agreeing that he committed felonies, never truly forgave his opponents, or reconciled with them, but for the most part he avoided expressing those feelings publicly.""Clinton saw the acquittal as a humbling end to that chapter and I think Trump sees it as a way to start his re-elect,"" said Jennifer Palmieri, who was a top aide to Mr. Clinton. ""He just wanted to shut the door on that and move on and have a fresh start. And Trump sees it as a jump start -- 'this is what I'm going to run on.""'Mr. Clinton had some help in that Republicans themselves emerged from his trial feeling bruised by their failure to remove him and the clear public repudiation of the impeachment in polls and the midterm elections. Unlike Mr. Trump, whose approval ratings remain mired in the mid-40s, Mr. Clinton's popularity reached its highest level during impeachment, with 73 percent of the public backing him just days after the House charged him with high crimes.""I don't think Clinton was emboldened. I think he was embarrassed about the mess he caused and he wanted to somehow move on and fix his own reputation,"" said John Feehery, a Republican strategist who was a top adviser to Speaker J. Dennis Hastert at the time.And so did the Republicans. ""I think both the president and the speaker had a vested interest in moving past impeachment to getting things done,"" he said. ""We were very conscious about how polarizing impeachment was and we were dedicated to healing the country and repairing the G.O.P. brand.""That does not seem like the likeliest path forward for Mr. Trump, more of a pugilist than a peacemaker. ""He's obviously legitimately pretty angry,"" said Mr. Gingrich, who was forced out as speaker after Republicans lost the midterm elections during the drive to impeach Mr. Clinton. ""Given that he's a natural counterpuncher, he may decide to go after them.""""That's not his best strategy,"" Mr. Gingrich said. ""His best strategy is to assume that the Democrats are totally out of control, that they will not be able to keep fighting. If he appears conciliatory, they're going to very badly damage themselves with average voters who are going to say these guys are pathological.""""He has that option,"" he added. ""I'm not saying he's going to take it.""PhotographPresident Trump has emerged from impeachment with little reason to fear the legislative branch.

| Jump to first hitPresident Trump made his first appearance on the international stage since the House sent impeachment articles to the Senate, on the day his trial is set to begin in earnest.DAVOS, Switzerland -- President Trump swept into this moneyed Alpine village on Tuesday, full of brio and flattery, schmoozing with global business leaders as if there were no talk of removing him from office and no impeachment trial unfolding 4,000 miles away in Washington.Mr. Trump appeared to relish the escape offered by the World Economic Forum and the friendly -- to his face, at least -- crowd of elites in the snow-covered Alps. He was in a jovial mood, according to people who spoke with him, engaging in animated conversations with chief executives like Brian Moynihan of Bank of America, Sundar Pichai of Alphabet and Marc Benioff of Salesforce.He congratulated them on their companies' stock performances and joked that he should have bought shares but that he had been forced to sell his holdings when he took office. As Mr. Trump and his family members darted among meetings in makeshift pavilions, they studiously avoided questions about the drama back home, where the Senate engaged in a fierce clash over the rules for putting the president on trial.It was a day of two presidents. There was the stick-to-the-script Donald J. Trump riding high on a strong economy and representing the country on the international stage. And there was the Donald J. Trump under siege back home, depicted as an autocrat abusing the power of his office to take down domestic opponents and win re-election.The images of a calm and confident president in the wintry globalist getaway were supplanted in Washington by the images shown on television screens on the Senate floor by House managers playing video clips of his claims of unconstrained authority and his professed support for witnesses he has in fact blocked from testifying.The president took the advice of aides and friends and tried to remain above it all, or at least appear like it, more like Bill Clinton in 1999. When reporters asked him about the impeachment trial, he swatted it away as ""just a hoax.""Leaving it at that, he proceeded to stick to his prepared remarks, making inflated claims about his role in a global economic recovery and promoting a message of the United States' supremacy. ""America's economy was in a rather dismal state,"" Mr. Trump said during a 30-minute speech to the world leaders and corporate titans gathered here. ""Before my presidency began, the outlook for many economies was bleak.""Although the economy's recovery after its plummet was central to President Barack Obama's legacy, Mr. Trump said that his administration had created a ""roaring geyser of opportunity"" and proclaimed that ""the American dream is back bigger, better and stronger than ever before.""Addressing a global audience, Mr. Trump delivered what amounted to a version of his campaign speech, speaking little of international alliances while playing up America's dominance in the world.At a conference that dedicated itself this year to climate change, Mr. Trump took a swipe at those demanding action. He announced that the United States would join an initiative to plant a trillion trees that was introduced at the event, but he also declared that ""we must reject the perennial prophets of doom"" and that it was ""not a time for pessimism.""Former Vice President Al Gore, himself a leading climate change prophet, was seen leaving Mr. Trump's speech but declined to comment on the president's remarks.Mr. Trump's visit to Davos is his first foreign trip since Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent two articles of impeachment to the Senate and the first since he authorized the drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran's most powerful security commander. Many diplomats and analysts wondered if he would seem weakened abroad while his fate was being debated at home and how he would treat European leaders who have called his Iran strategy too provocative.Even if he did not show it, Mr. Trump surely kept an eye on developments back home. He did shoot out one Twitter message shortly before the Senate trial opened for the day: ""READ THE TRANSCRIPTS!"" he wrote, referring to records of two phone calls he had with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine -- transcripts that his critics have, in fact, read and consider evidence of misconduct even though he considers them ""perfect.""But he gave little impression of being absorbed by either issue, at least not publicly. Arriving in Switzerland on Tuesday morning, he flew on Marine One over the Alps, from Zurich to Davos. The altitude increased the sense that the bitter partisan fight that would take place in the Capitol was a world away.As his motorcade made its way through twisty, snow-covered streets to the Davos Congress Center, nine Swiss tenors entertained the crowd with a version of ""Ranz des vaches,"" a mellifluous song for calling home cows -- and a more peaceful serenade than the songs that typically precede Mr. Trump's entrance at his rallies back home, like ""Macho Man"" by the Village People and ""Sympathy for the Devil"" by the Rolling Stones.Mr. Trump was also a more mellow version of himself.He highlighted the first phase of his trade deal with China and another with Mexico and Canada. And the audience appeared receptive, having warmed to him since he took office three years ago this week as they have benefited from his policies.""Lev Parnas is not a topic of conversation at Davos,"" said Ian Bremmer, the president and founder of Eurasia Group, a political research and consulting firm, referring to a possible Senate trial witness.Still, television screens in Davos were filled with the face of a different Trump antagonist: the teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg, who was the other star speaker of the day. In her speech, she warned that ""our house is still on fire"" and that ""inaction is fueling the flames by the hour.""Mr. Trump, who dismissed Ms. Thunberg when she was named Time magazine's person of the year, an honor he perennially covets, did not mention her by name in his own speech. But when he talked about the importance of clean water and clean air, he added that ""fear and doubt is not a good thought process.""His speech also included false or exaggerated claims that seemed, at times, disconnected from the concerns of an international audience.""I saved H.B.C.U.s. We saved them,"" Mr. Trump claimed, referring to historically black colleges and universities. ""They were going out and we saved them."" Although the administration has increased investment in the schools by 14.3 percent, and although a number of them have struggled financially, there is no evidence that they were on the verge of extinction. In the past six years, one has closed and about 100 remain.Hanging over the conference was the question of whether the president would try to stage a surprise meeting with Mr. Zelensky, even though officials said the optics would be unhelpful to Mr. Trump. The president's trial centers on his efforts to coerce Mr. Zelensky to find incriminating information about former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats.In Davos, however, Mr. Trump may have found the right audience for support to counter the trial dominating the news at home. There was less anxiety about him rippling through the 1 percent set on Tuesday than when he originally attended the annual forum two years ago, fresh off an ""America First"" campaign filled with promises to rip up international agreements and alliances.This time, there was more concern about some of the progressive Democrats running to replace him. Through regulatory rollbacks, tax cuts and the success of the global economy, the president who ran as a populist has benefited many of the chief executives gathered at the event, even those who have taken public positions against some of his policies.""There are lot of masters of the universe who think he may not be their cup of tea, but he's been a godsend,"" said Mr. Bremmer of the Eurasia Group. ""It's interesting to hear Mike Bloomberg saying he would fund Bernie Sanders's campaign if he won the nomination. Very few people here would say that.""During Mr. Trump's career in New York real estate, entertainment and business, he never cracked the Davos set, whose Fortune 500 chief executives dismissed him as something of a gaudy sideshow.But the balance of power has shifted. And with progressives like Mr. Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts emerging as top-tier possibilities for the Democratic presidential nomination, a crowd that once rejected Mr. Trump is now more willing to consider him one of its own.On Tuesday, Mr. Trump happily embraced them back. After his speech, he met with the International Business Council, and personally greeted every chief executive, according to attendees.The meeting was less about substance than socializing, one attendee said, as Mr. Trump grilled corporate leaders about whether they liked his speech. His daughter Ivanka Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, also worked the room.Mr. Trump planned to meet separately with leaders of Iraq, Pakistan and the Kurdish regional government, as well as sit down with corporate chieftains.Shortly afterward, Mr. Trump headed to dinner with the corporate executives. Given a soccer ball by the head of FIFA -- ""a very beautiful, good-looking ball,"" Mr. Trump gushed -- the president then lavished praise on his guests, ""the greatest businessmen in the world.""He drank in their praise in return, at the same moment that senators back home began debating how to try him for high crimes and misdemeanors.""Africa loves you,"" Patrice Motsepe, a billionaire South African mining titan, told him.The president's staff was on message as well. When he introduced Larry Kudlow, his national economic adviser, Mr. Trump asked, ""How's the economy going?""""Pretty darn good, sir,"" Mr. Kudlow replied.""He gave us the right answer,"" Mr. Trump said approvingly.Annie Karni and David Gelles reported from Davos Switzerland, and Peter Baker from Washington. Keith Bradsher contributed reporting from Davos.PhotographPresident Trump, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, boasted of creating a ""roaring geyser of opportunity.""

| Jump to first hitIvanka Trump's husband will now supervise her father's re-election campaign, but he continues to weigh in with advice to the president on a range of other matters.WASHINGTON -- When senior administration officials gathered in the Situation Room on Tuesday for a meeting to discuss the repercussions of the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Vice President Mike Pence had a seat at the table. So did Robert O'Brien, the national security adviser, and Mark T. Esper, the defense secretary.But the White House aide whose portfolio is the Middle East was notably absent from the meeting.Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, was sitting for a photo shoot for a planned Time magazine cover story. He was also absent from the Situation Room later in the day when it was clear Iran was launching an attack on American forces and the same officials rush backed, joined by Mr. Trump and West Wing aides like Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, and Stephanie Grisham, the press secretary.Over the past two weeks, Mr. Kushner has had little visible part in what has been Mr. Trump's most high-stakes moment as commander in chief, the starkest example of how much his role in the White House is changing as the Trump presidency enters its fourth year.Mr. Kushner has also served as the peacemaker in trade negotiations with Mexico and China, smoothing over disputes and serving as a mediator between foreign officials and Mr. Trump. But with the North American trade deal expected to become law within weeks, and the president poised to sign a first-phase China trade deal on Wednesday, that role will be less of a focus.Instead, Mr. Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, the president's older daughter, is positioning himself to be the overseer of something of even greater personal interest to his father-in-law: Mr. Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.Unlike the behind-the-scenes role he played in the 2016 campaign -- where he was seen as a key figure but, campaign aides said, never took a title and avoided blame -- Mr. Kushner is positioning himself now as the person officially overseeing the entire campaign from his office in the West Wing, organizing campaign meetings and making decisions about staffing and spending. His more prominent role comes after much of 2019 was spent bogged down by the Russia-related investigations that had dogged the president since he took office.The portfolio marks a sharp departure from Mr. Kushner's focus in the early days of the administration, when he sought to be a central driver of administration Middle East policy, acting at times as a shadow secretary of state who circumvented official channels of power within the State Department.Back then, Mr. Kushner's influence in the region extended far beyond his stated portfolio of negotiating peace between the Israelis and Palestinians, setting an early tone by bypassing cabinet members to persuade Mr. Trump to make Saudi Arabia his first stop abroad as president.""Since Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has come in, you've seen Jared's role narrow to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,"" said Ilan Goldenberg, the director of the Middle East Security Program at the Center for a New American Security, who worked under former Secretary of State John Kerry on Middle East issues. ""It's been a gradual move, and it's very striking right now.""Mr. Kushner declined to comment on his change in focus, but his allies in the White House say he sees no reason to involve himself as extensively in international issues now that the State Department is run by Mr. Pompeo, whom he sees as far more competent than his predecessor, Rex W. Tillerson. They also pointed to the fact that Mr. Trump's national security team now includes many Kushner allies, like Mr. O'Brien and Brian H. Hook, the special representative for Iran who has also worked with Mr. Kushner on the peace process.Mr. Kushner's status as a member of the president's family has also made it possible for him to choose the moments and issues where his role is highly visible.He played a critical role in persuading Mr. Trump to support a criminal justice overhaul, which he has also promoted as a way to help Mr. Trump win over African-American voters. But he has never unveiled a peace plan whose delivery date has been delayed indefinitely. And with Israel in its own political limbo, the expectations that Mr. Kushner's plan would form the basis of a deal are low.In recent months, Mr. Kushner has been directing the construction of the president's wall along the southern border, telling associates he has a timetable for getting a portion completed by the election and holding regular meetings with status updates on how much mileage has been built. Mr. Kushner's wresting of control over the issue has generated criticism from some administration officials, who said he dives into other people's policy areas with abandon and little foresight.Last week, he was involved in the Trump campaign's decision to spend $10 million on a 60-second ad that will run during the Super Bowl, an announcement that came out after the campaign of former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York signaled it would make the same buy, a person familiar with his role said.But ever since Mr. Trump entered office with his son-in-law at his side, Mr. Kushner has been trailed by questions about what it is that he really does or has accomplished. His portfolios -- streamlining the government's information technology systems, brokering peace in the Middle East -- have at times seemed so large that they are meaningless. His floating ""senior adviser"" status that functions outside of any formal chain of command has given him a role that seems simultaneously all-powerful and make-believe.His expectations for winning an election, however, are higher.During Mr. Trump's vacation at Mar-a-Lago, his private Florida club, Mr. Kushner arranged meetings with campaign officials to discuss messaging. He made a rare appearance at a campaign briefing in December with members of the news media, where the former Democrat declared that he was now a card-carrying Republican.Mr. Kushner spent the holidays with Mr. Trump, and it is unclear what private conversations he had with his father-in-law there about the situation in Iran. Mr. Trump, who personally granted his son-in-law a security clearance by overruling concerns flagged by intelligence officials and the White House counsel, often seeks Mr. Kushner's counsel on issues he is not directly involved with, and they spent many hours together during the week.Aides, however, would not say what Mr. Kushner's view of the strikes was.""Jared's Middle East portfolio is primarily focused on developing a peace plan between the Israelis and the Palestinians,"" said Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman. ""He gets involved in other matters where appropriate to further President Trump's objectives.""While he was not in any Situation Room meetings, Mr. Kushner pushed his father-in-law to deliver some kind of statement about the Suleimani strike from the White House rather than at a political rally later, despite concerns from other senior officials about the president speaking about a crisis that did not appear to be over.And there are issues in the Middle East and on the international stage where Mr. Kushner still asserts himself: He was present for a meeting on Monday in the Oval Office with Khalid bin Salman, a member of the Saudi royal family. The meeting was not on Mr. Trump's schedule, and officials have declined to give a summary of what was discussed; its existence was acknowledged by the White House only after the Saudis posted photos on Twitter.After Mr. Trump met with the prime minister of Greece on Wednesday, it was Mr. Kushner he turned to in the Oval Office, an aide said, asking him to walk him out.Among Trump critics, Mr. Kushner's many roles have not instilled confidence. ""It seems like he just bounces around based on whatever issue intrigues him at any given moment, without regard for his past track record, or inexperience on any given issue,"" said Brian Fallon, Hillary Clinton's spokesman during her 2016 campaign against Mr. Trump.PhotographThe portfolio of Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, is shifting from matters like the Middle East to Mr. Trump's re-election.

| Jump to first hitA growing number of Republicans have acknowledged that President Trump's phone call with Ukraine wasn't perfect. But they argue that it doesn't merit his removal.WASHINGTON -- Even as they are set to acquit President Trump in his impeachment trial this week, Senate Republicans appear to be increasingly breaking with his defense that he did nothing wrong.On Sunday, Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who was a key vote against calling witnesses in the Senate trial, expanded upon his criticism that Mr. Trump was ""crossing the line"" in his pressure campaign against Ukraine. And Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa, who has remained a reliable defender of the president during his trial, called his actions ""not what I would have done.""A day before the first contest of the 2020 election, two days before Mr. Trump's State of the Union address and three days before his expected acquittal, they and other Republicans appeared to be coalescing around a more nuanced argument: Mr. Trump's efforts to push Ukraine into investigating a political rival while withholding critical military aid might not have been appropriate. But that did not warrant the president's removal from office for the first time in American history.""I think he shouldn't have done it -- I think it was wrong,"" Mr. Alexander said Sunday on ""Meet the Press"" on NBC. ""Inappropriate, was the way I'd say it. Improper, crossing the line. And then the only question left is: Who decides what to do about that?""""The people,"" he added. ""The people, is my conclusion.""Mr. Alexander first took that position last week, when he announced that he would vote against the consideration of new witnesses and documents in Mr. Trump's trial. He acknowledged the merits of the House case for removing the president on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress: that the president had withheld nearly $400 million in military aid to pressure Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and other Democrats.But Mr. Alexander's decision was in part influenced by the proximity of the election. (When pressed about how he would have voted outside an election year, he said he most likely would have arrived at the same conclusion.)""I don't think it's the kind of inappropriate action that the framers would expect the Senate to substitute its judgment for the people in picking a president,"" he said on Sunday.That argument has come under fire from Democrats, who say the nature of Mr. Trump's offense -- trying to persuade a foreign nation to interfere in the 2020 race -- could compromise the election.""They need to remove him from office because he is threatening to still cheat in the next election by soliciting foreign interference,"" Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the lead House impeachment manager, said Sunday on ""Face the Nation"" on CBS. ""And so the normal remedy for a president's misconduct isn't available here because the elections, he is already trying to prejudice and compromise with further foreign interference.""The Republicans' argument also stands starkly at odds with what Mr. Trump -- who has deemed a phone call he had with Ukraine's president ""perfect"" and has resisted any suggestion that he acted improperly -- has demanded from his defenders.But Mr. Alexander's reasoning was echoed by multiple Republicans who voted against allowing new witnesses and documents in the impeachment trial. ""Lamar speaks for lots and lots of us,"" said Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska.Among them is Ms. Ernst, who has repeatedly said the scrutiny over Hunter Biden's work for an energy company in Ukraine -- the basis for the investigation Mr. Trump had demanded -- could affect the presidential campaign of the elder Mr. Biden.""I think, generally speaking, going after corruption would be the right thing to do; he did it maybe in the wrong manner,"" Ms. Ernst said Sunday on ""State of the Union"" on CNN. ""I think that he could have done it through different channels.""But she added that ""whether you like what the president did or not,"" the charges did not clear the bar for removing him. ""Does it come to the point of removing a president from office?"" she said. ""I don't believe this does.""Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said in a statement late last week that while some of Mr. Trump's actions were ""wrong and inappropriate,"" they did not ""rise to the level of removing a duly-elected president from office and taking him off the ballot in the middle of an election.""""Just because actions meet a standard of impeachment does not mean it is in the best interest of the country to remove a president from office,"" said Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida. (He later added on Twitter that he did not find either of the two articles of impeachment brought against Mr. Trump to be proved beyond a doubt.)Even one member of the president's defense team seemed to adopt a similar argument. As he continued to walk back remarks he made during the trial that suggested a president's actions in pursuit of re-election were inherently in the country's interest, Alan M. Dershowitz, the constitutional law scholar, said that actions that might be wrong might not be impeachable.""On Election Day, as a citizen I will allow that to enter into my decision who to vote for. But it's not an impeachable offense,"" Mr. Dershowitz said on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""I was there to argue a constitutional issue, not to tell people who to vote for, for president.""With nine months left in the campaign, Mr. Alexander said he hoped that the consequences of Mr. Trump's phone call with Ukraine -- becoming the third American president to stand trial for high crimes and misdemeanors -- would resonate with the commander in chief.""Enduring an impeachment is something no one should like,"" Mr. Alexander said. ""If a call like this gets you an impeachment, I would think he would think twice before he did it again.""Chris Cameron contributed reporting.PhotographSenator Lamar Alexander, center right, said that voters should decide President Trump's fate.

| Jump to first hitThe inside story of President Trump's demand to halt military assistance to an ally shows the price he was willing to pay to carry out his agenda.WASHINGTON -- Deep into a long flight to Japan aboard Air Force One with President Trump, Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, dashed off an email to an aide back in Washington.""I'm just trying to tie up some loose ends,"" Mr. Mulvaney wrote. ""Did we ever find out about the money for Ukraine and whether we can hold it back?""It was June 27, more than a week after Mr. Trump had first asked about putting a hold on security aid to Ukraine, an embattled American ally, and Mr. Mulvaney needed an answer.The aide, Robert B. Blair, replied that it would be possible, but not pretty. ""Expect Congress to become unhinged"" if the White House tried to countermand spending passed by the House and Senate, he wrote in a previously undisclosed email. And, he wrote, it might further fuel the narrative that Mr. Trump was pro-Russia.Mr. Blair was right, even if his prediction of a messy outcome was wildly understated. Mr. Trump's order to hold $391 million worth of sniper rifles, rocket-propelled grenades, night vision goggles, medical aid and other equipment the Ukrainian military needed to fight a grinding war against Russian-backed separatists would help pave a path to the president's impeachment.The Democratic-led inquiry into Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine this spring and summer established that the president was actively involved in parallel efforts -- both secretive and highly unusual -- to bring pressure on a country he viewed with suspicion, if not disdain.One campaign, spearheaded by Rudolph W. Giuliani, the president's personal lawyer, aimed to force Ukraine to conduct investigations that could help Mr. Trump politically, including one focused on a potential Democratic 2020 rival, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.The other, which unfolded nearly simultaneously but has gotten less attention, was the president's demand to withhold the security assistance. By late summer, the two efforts merged as American diplomats used the withheld aid as leverage in the effort to win a public commitment from the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to carry out the investigations Mr. Trump sought into Mr. Biden and unfounded or overblown theories about Ukraine interfering in the 2016 election.Interviews with dozens of current and former administration officials, congressional aides and others, previously undisclosed emails and documents, and a close reading of thousands of pages of impeachment testimony provide the most complete account yet of the 84 days from when Mr. Trump first inquired about the money to his decision in September to relent.What emerges is the story of how Mr. Trump's demands sent shock waves through the White House and the Pentagon, created deep rifts within the senior ranks of his administration, left key aides like Mr. Mulvaney under intensifying scrutiny -- and ended only after Mr. Trump learned of a damning whistle-blower report and came under pressure from influential Republican lawmakers.In many ways, the havoc Mr. Giuliani and other Trump loyalists set off in the State Department by pursuing the investigations was matched by conflicts and confusion in the White House and Pentagon stemming from Mr. Trump's order to withhold the aid.Opposition to the order from his top national security advisers was more intense than previously known. In late August, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper joined Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser at the time, for a previously undisclosed Oval Office meeting with the president where they tried but failed to convince him that releasing the aid was in interests of the United States.By late summer, top lawyers at the Office of Management and Budget who had spoken to lawyers at the White House and the Justice Department in the weeks beforehand, were developing an argument -- not previously divulged publicly -- that Mr. Trump's role as commander in chief would simply allow him to override Congress on the issue.And Mr. Mulvaney is shown to have been deeply involved as a key conduit for transmitting Mr. Trump's demands for the freeze across the administration.The interviews and documents show how Mr. Trump used the bureaucracy to advance his agenda in the face of questions about its propriety and even legality from officials in the White House budget office and the Pentagon, many of whom say they were kept in the dark about the president's motivations and had grown used to convention-flouting requests from the West Wing. One veteran budget official who raised questions about the legal justification was pushed aside.Those carrying out Mr. Trump's orders on the aid were for the most part operating in different lanes from those seeking the investigations, including Mr. Giuliani and a number of senior diplomats, including Gordon D. Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, and Kurt D. Volker, the State Department's special envoy for Ukraine and Russia.The New York Times found that some key players are now offering a defense that they did not know the diplomatic push for the investigations was playing out at the same time they were implementing the aid freeze -- or if they were aware of both channels, they did not connect the two.Mr. Mulvaney is said by associates to have stepped out of the room whenever Mr. Trump would talk with Mr. Giuliani to preserve Mr. Trump's attorney-client privilege, leaving him with limited knowledge about their efforts regarding Ukraine. Mr. Mulvaney has told associates he learned of the substance of Mr. Trump's July 25 call weeks after the fact.Yet testimony before the House suggests a different picture. Fiona Hill, a top deputy to Mr. Bolton at the time, told the impeachment inquiry about a July 10 White House meeting at which Mr. Sondland said Mr. Mulvaney had guaranteed that Mr. Zelensky would be invited to the White House if the Ukrainians agreed to the investigations -- an arrangement that Mr. Bolton described as a ""drug deal,"" according to Ms. Hill.Along with Mr. Bolton and others, Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Blair have declined to cooperate with impeachment investigators and provide information to Congress under oath, an intensifying point of friction between the two parties as the Senate prepares for Mr. Trump's impeachment trial.At the center of the maelstrom was the Office of Management and Budget, a seldom-scrutinized arm of the White House that during the Trump administration has often had to find creative legal reasoning to justify the president's unorthodox policy proposals, like his demand to divert Pentagon funding to his proposed wall along the border with Mexico.In the Ukraine case, however, shock about the president's decision spread across America's national security apparatus -- from the National Security Council to the State Department and the Pentagon. By September, after the freeze had become public and scrutiny was increasing, the blame game inside the administration was in full swing.On Sept. 10, the day before Mr. Trump changed his mind, a political appointee at the budget office, Michael P. Duffey, wrote a lengthy email to the Pentagon's top budget official, with whom he had been at odds throughout the summer about how long the agency could withhold the aid.He asserted that the Defense Department had the authority to do more to ensure that the aid could be released to Ukraine by the congressionally mandated deadline of the end of that month, suggesting that responsibility for any failure should not rest with the White House.Forty-three minutes later, the Pentagon official, Elaine McCusker, hit send on a brief but stinging reply.""You can't be serious,"" she wrote. ""I am speechless.""'We Need to Hold It Up'For top officials inside the budget office, the first warning came on June 19.Informed that the president had a problem with the aid, Mr. Blair called Russell T. Vought, the acting head of the Office of Management and Budget. ""We need to hold it up,"" he said, according to officials briefed about the conversation.Typical of the Trump White House, the inquiry was not born of a rigorous policy process. Aides speculated that someone had shown Mr. Trump a news article about the Ukraine assistance and he demanded to know more.Mr. Vought and his team took to Google, and came upon a piece in the conservative Washington Examiner saying that the Pentagon would pay for weapons and other military equipment for Ukraine, bringing American security aid to the country to $1.5 billion since 2014.The money, the article noted, was coming at a critical moment: Mr. Zelensky, a onetime comedian, had called ending the armed conflict with Russia in eastern Ukraine his top priority -- a move that would likely only happen if he could negotiate from a position of strength.The budget office officials had little idea of why Mr. Trump was interested in the topic, but many of the president's more senior aides were well aware of his feelings about Ukraine. Weeks earlier, in an Oval Office meeting on May 23, with Mr. Sondland, Mr. Mulvaney and Mr. Blair in attendance, Mr. Trump batted away assurances that Mr. Zelensky was committed to confronting corruption.""They are all corrupt, they are all terrible people,"" Mr. Trump said, according to testimony in the impeachment inquiry.The United States had been planning to provide $391 million in military assistance to Ukraine in two chunks: $250 million allocated by the Pentagon for war-fighting equipment -- from sniper rifles to rocket-propelled grenade launchers -- and $141 million controlled by the State Department to buy night-vision devices, radar systems and yet more rocket-grenade launchers.With the money having been appropriated by Congress, it would be hard for the administration to keep it from being spent by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.The task of dealing with the president's demands fell primarily to a group of political appointees in the West Wing and the budget office, most with personal and professional ties to Mr. Mulvaney. There was no public announcement that Mr. Trump wanted the assistance withheld. Neither Congress nor the Ukrainian government was formally notified.Mr. Mulvaney had first served in the administration as the budget director, after three terms in the House, where he earned a reputation as a firebrand conservative.The four top political appointees helping Mr. Mulvaney execute the hold -- Mr. Vought, Mr. Blair, Mr. Duffey and Mark Paoletta, the budget office's top lawyer -- all had extensive experience in either congressional budget politics or Republican and conservative causes.Their efforts would cause tension and at times conflict between officials at the budget office and the Pentagon, some of whom watched with growing alarm.A Question of LegalityThe single largest chunk of the federal government's annual discretionary budget, some $800 billion a year, goes to the Pentagon, spy agencies and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The career official in charge of managing the flow of all that money for the budget office is an Afghanistan war veteran named Mark Sandy.After learning about the president's June 19 request, Mr. Sandy contacted the Pentagon to learn more about the aid package. He also repeatedly pressed Mr. Duffey about why Mr. Trump had imposed the hold in the first place.""He didn't provide an explicit response on the reason,"" Mr. Sandy testified in the impeachment inquiry. ""He simply said we need to let the hold take place -- and I'm paraphrasing here -- and then revisit this issue with the president.""From the start, budget office officials took the position that the money did not have to go out the door until the end of September, giving them time to address the president's questions.It was easy enough for the White House to hold up the State Department portion of the funding. Since the State Department had not yet notified Congress of its plans to release the money, all it took was making sure that the notification did not happen.Freezing the Pentagon's $250 million portion was more difficult, since the Pentagon had already certified that Ukraine had met requirements set by Congress to show that it was addressing its endemic corruption and notified lawmakers of its intent to spend the money.So on July 19, Mr. Duffey proposed an unusual solution: Mr. Sandy should attach a footnote to a routine budget document saying the money was being temporarily withheld.Approving such requests is routine; Mr. Sandy processed hundreds each year. But attaching a footnote to block spending that the administration had already notified Congress was ready to go was not. Mr. Sandy said in testimony that he had never done it before in his 12 years at the agency.And there was a problem with this maneuver: Mr. Sandy was concerned it might violate a law called the Impoundment Control Act that protects Congress's spending power and prohibits the administration from blocking disbursement of the aid unless it notifies Congress.""I asked about the duration of the hold and was told there was not clear guidance on that,"" Mr. Sandy testified. ""So that is what prompted my concern.""Mr. Sandy sought advice from the top lawyers at the budget office.A Pivotal DayFor a full month, the fact that Mr. Trump wanted to halt the aid remained confined primarily to a small group of officials.That ended on July 18, when a group of top administration officials meeting on Ukraine policy -- including some calling in from Kyiv -- learned from a midlevel budget office official that the president had ordered the aid frozen.""I and the others on the call sat in astonishment,"" William B. Taylor Jr., the top United States diplomat in Ukraine, testified to House investigators. ""In an instant, I realized that one of the key pillars of our strong support for Ukraine was threatened.""That same day, aides on the House Foreign Affairs Committee received four calls from administration sources warning them about the hold and urging them to look into it.A week later came Mr. Trump's fateful July 25 call with Mr. Zelensky. Mr. Bolton, the national security adviser, had recommended the call take place in an effort to end the ""incessant lobbying"" from officials like Mr. Sondland that the two leaders connect.Some of Mr. Trump's aides had thought the call might lead Mr. Trump to lift the freeze. But Mr. Trump did not specifically mention the hold, and instead asked Mr. Zelensky to look into Mr. Biden and his son and into supposed Ukrainian involvement in the 2016 election. Among those listening on the call was Mr. Blair.Mr. Blair has told associates he did not make much of Mr. Trump's requests during the call for the investigations. He saw the aid freeze not as a political tool, but as an extension of Mr. Trump's general aversion to foreign aid and his belief that Ukraine is rife with corruption.Just 90 minutes after the call ended, and following days of email traffic on the topic, Mr. Duffey, Mr. Sandy's boss, sent out a new email to the Pentagon, where officials were impatient about getting the money out the door. His message was clear: Do not spend it.""Given the sensitive nature of the request, I appreciate your keeping that information closely held to those who need to know to execute the direction,"" Mr. Duffey wrote in his note, which was released this month to the Center for Public Integrity.This caused immediate discomfort at the Pentagon, with a top official there noting that this hold on military assistance was coming on the same day Ukraine announced it had seized a Russian tanker -- a potential escalation in the conflict between the two nations.On that same day, Mr. Sandy, having received the go-ahead from the budget office's lawyers, took the first official step to legally impose what they called a ""brief pause,"" inserting a footnote into the budget document that prohibited the Pentagon from spending any of the aid until Aug. 5.By that point, officials in Ukraine were getting word that something was up. At the same time, the effort to win a commitment from the Ukrainians for the investigations sought by Mr. Trump was intensifying, with Mr. Giuliani and a Zelensky aide, Andriy Yermak, meeting in Madrid on Aug. 2 and the diplomats Mr. Sondland and Mr. Volker also working the issue.And inside the intelligence community, a C.I.A. officer was hearing talk about the two strands of pressure on Ukraine, including the aid freeze. Seeing how they fit together, he was alarmed enough that by Aug. 12 he would take the extraordinary step of laying them out in detail in a confidential whistle-blower complaint.A 'POTUS-level Decision'Keeping a hold on the assistance was now a top priority, so officials moved to tighten control over the money.In a very unusual step, the White House removed Mr. Sandy's authority to oversee the aid freeze. The job was handed in late July to Mr. Sandy's boss, Mr. Duffey, the political appointee, the official ultimately responsible for apportionments but one who had little experience in the nuts and bolts of the budget office process.As the debate over the aid continued, disagreements flared. Two budget office staff members left the agency after the summer. Mr. Sandy testified that their departures were related to the aid freeze, a statement disputed by budget office officials.Pentagon officials, in the dark about the reason for the holdup, grew increasingly frustrated. Ms. McCusker, the powerful Pentagon budget official, notified the budget office that either $61 million of the money would have to be spent by Monday, Aug. 12 or it would be lost. The budget office saw her threat as a ploy to force release of the aid.At the White House, which had been looped into the dispute by the budget office, there was a growing consensus that officials could find a legal rationale for continuing the hold, but with the Monday deadline looming, it was a ""POTUS-level decision,"" one official said.Complicating matters, another budget battle was escalating. Mr. Vought was attempting to impose cuts of as much as $4 billion on the nation's overall foreign aid budget. It was an entirely separate initiative from the Ukraine freeze, and was quickly abandoned, but helped the White House establish that its concern about aid was not limited to Ukraine.By the second week of August, Mr. Duffey had taken to issuing footnotes every few days to block the Pentagon spending. Office of Management and Budget lawyers approved each one.Mr. Trump spent the weekend before the Pentagon's Aug. 12 deadline at Bedminster, his New Jersey golf resort.In a previously unreported sequence of events, Mr. Mulvaney worked to schedule a call for that day with Mr. Trump and top aides involved in the freeze, including Mr. Vought, Mr. Bolton and Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel. But they waited to set a final time because Mr. Trump had a golf game planned for Monday morning with John Daly, the flamboyant professional golfer, and they did not know how long it would take.Late that morning, Ms. McCusker checked in with the budget office. ""Hey, any update for us?"" she asked in an email obtained by Center for Public Integrity.Mr. Duffey was still waiting for an answer as of late that afternoon. ""Elaine -- I don't have an update,"" he wrote back. ""I am attempting to get one.""The planned-for conference call with the president never happened. Budget office lawyers decided that Ms. McCusker had inaccurately raised alarms about the Aug. 12 date to try to force their hand.In Bedminster with Mr. Trump, Mr. Mulvaney finally reached the president and the answer was clear: Mr. Trump wanted the freeze kept in place. In Washington, the whistle-blower submitted his report that same day.The National Security Team IntervenesInside the administration, pressure was mounting on Mr. Trump to reverse himself.Backed by a memo saying the National Security Council, the Pentagon and the State Department all wanted the aid released, Mr. Bolton made a personal appeal to Mr. Trump on Aug. 16, but was rebuffed.On Aug. 28, Politico published a story reporting that the assistance to Ukraine had been frozen. After more than two months, the issue, the topic of fiery internal debate, was finally public.Mr. Bolton's relationship with the president had been deteriorating for months, and he would leave the White House weeks later, but on this front he had powerful internal allies.On a sunny, late-August day, Mr. Bolton, Mr. Esper and Mr. Pompeo arrayed themselves around the Resolute desk in the Oval Office to present a united front, the leaders of the president's national security team seeking to convince him face to face that freeing up the money for Ukraine was the right thing to do. One by one they made their case.""This is in America's interest,"" Mr. Bolton argued, according to one official briefed on the gathering.""This defense relationship, we have gotten some really good benefits from it,"" Mr. Esper added, noting that most of the money was being spent on military equipment made in the United States.Mr. Trump responded that he did not believe Mr. Zelensky's promises of reform. He emphasized his view that corruption remained endemic and repeated his position that European nations needed to do more for European defense.""Ukraine is a corrupt country,"" the president said. ""We are pissing away our money.""The aid remained blocked. On Aug. 31, Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, arranged a call with Mr. Trump. Mr. Johnson had been told days earlier by Mr. Sondland that the aid would be unblocked only if the Ukrainians gave Mr. Trump the investigations he wanted.When Mr. Johnson asked Mr. Trump directly if the aid was contingent on getting a commitment to pursue the investigations, Mr. Johnson later said, Mr. Trump replied, amid a string of expletives, that there was no such demand and he would never do such a thing.Around the same time, White House lawyers informed Mr. Trump about the whistle-blower's complaint regarding his pressure campaign. It is not clear how much detail the lawyers provided the president about the details of the complaint, which noted the aid freeze.Mr. Trump was scheduled to travel to Poland on Sept. 1 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the outbreak of World War II, and had planned to get together with Mr. Zelensky. Some administration officials hoped meeting the new Ukrainian president in person would change Mr. Trump's mind.But a hurricane was bearing down on the United States, and Mr. Trump sent Vice President Mike Pence in his place. When Mr. Zelensky raised the issue with the vice president, Mr. Pence said he should speak with Mr. Trump.Behind the scenes in Warsaw, Mr. Sondland, the American envoy who was Mr. Trump's point person on getting the Ukrainians to agree to the investigations, had a blunter message. Until the Ukrainians publicly announced the investigations, he told Mr. Yermak, the Zelensky adviser, they should not expect to get the military aid. (Mr. Yermak has questioned Mr. Sondland's account.)An Abrupt ReversalBy late summer, top lawyers at the budget office were developing a proposed legal justification for the hold, based in part on conversations with White House lawyers as well as the Justice Department.Their argument was that lifting the hold would undermine Mr. Trump's negotiating position in his efforts to fight corruption in Ukraine.The president, the lawyers believed, could ignore the requirements of the Impoundment Control Act and continue to hold the aid by asserting constitutional commander in chief powers that give him authority over diplomacy. He could do so, they believed, if he determined that, based on existing circumstances, releasing the money would undermine military or diplomatic efforts.But divisions within the administration continued to widen; Mr. Bolton was opposed to using an argument proffered by administration lawyers to block the funding. And pressure from Congress was intensifying. Mr. Johnson and another influential Republican, Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, were both pushing for the aid to be released.On a call with Mr. Portman on Sept. 11, Mr. Trump repeated his familiar refrain about other nations not doing enough to support Ukraine.""Sure, I agree with you,"" Mr. Portman responded, according to an aide who described the exchange. ""But we should not hold that against Ukraine. We need to release these funds.""Democrats in the House were gearing up to limit Mr. Trump's power to hold up the money to Ukraine, and the chairmen of three House committees had also announced on Sept. 9 that they were opening an investigation.Still, White House officials did not expect anything to change, especially since Mr. Trump had repeatedly rejected the advice of his national security team.But then, just as suddenly as the hold was imposed, it was lifted. Mr. Trump, apparently unwilling to wage a public battle, told Mr. Portman he would let the money go.White House aides rushed to notify their counterparts at the Pentagon and elsewhere. The freeze had been lifted. The money could be spent. Get it out the door, they were told.The debate would now begin as to why the hold was lifted, with Democrats confident they knew the answer.""I have no doubt about why the president allowed the assistance to go forward,"" said Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. ""He got caught.""Adam Goldman, Edward Wong and Peter Baker contributed reporting.PhotographMick Mulvaney (PHOTOGRAPH BY DOUG MILLS/THE NEW YORK TIMES) (A1); Among the players in the campaign to withhold funds from Ukraine were, clockwise from top left: Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff; Volodymyr Zelensky, the newly elected Ukrainian president; Russell Vought, the acting head of Office of Management and Budget; and President Trump.

| Jump to first hitThe West Virginia Democrat, who dashed President Trump's hopes for a bipartisan acquittal, said his vote to convict was not about politics.WASHINGTON -- Senator Joe Manchin III votes with President Trump more than any other Democrat in the Senate. But his vote last week to convict Mr. Trump of impeachable offenses has eclipsed all of that, earning him the rage of a president who coveted a bipartisan acquittal.In the days since Mr. Manchin, a West Virginian who was one of the few swing votes on impeachment, supported Mr. Trump's removal, the president has laced into the senator with a zeal that is startling even by his standards.He called Mr. Manchin a ""puppet Democrat Senator"" who was ""weak & pathetic."" He gave the senator a new nickname: ""Joe Munchkin."" He suggested that Mr. Manchin was too stupid to understand a transcript of his telephone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, the central piece of evidence in the case. And to add insult to injury, he took credit for the senator's signature legislative achievement: a bipartisan bill to secure miners' pensions.On Monday, Mr. Manchin made clear that he had had enough.""The people of America and the people of West Virginia want some adults in the room,"" he said in an interview, but he said that Mr. Trump was not behaving like one. Then, the senator -- who at 6-foot-3 is roughly the same height as Mr. Trump, though considerably thinner -- took his own shot.""Munchkin means that you're small, right?"" he said. ""I'm bigger than him -- of course he has me by weight, now, he has more volume than I have by about 30 or 40 pounds. I'm far from being weak and pathetic, and I'm far from being a munchkin, and I still want him to succeed as president of the United States.""Mr. Trump's litany of insults reflects his dashed hopes of counting a Democratic defector among his supporters on impeachment, a crucial piece of the president's claims that impeachment was a partisan ""hoax"" so extreme that it had no legitimacy. And it underscores his disappointment that Mr. Manchin, who has at times broken with his party to support parts of the president's agenda, refused to back him during this particular fight. Given the politics of West Virginia, a state Mr. Trump won with 68 percent of the vote in 2016, Mr. Manchin was among a very small group of Democrats who were seen as possible votes to acquit.But Mr. Manchin said he did not base his choice on electoral politics.""I knew the politics of my state,"" the senator said. ""If I was going to make a political decision, I'd have voted to acquit.""Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, the only Republican to vote to convict Mr. Trump, said much the same thing, and has been relegated to Mr. Trump's enemies list as a result.""The president is entitled to say whatever he thinks,"" Mr. Romney said on Monday in a brief hallway interview in the Capitol. ""I'm not going to try to direct what he says.""Democrats accused Mr. Trump of abusing his oath of office and obstructing Congress by trying to get Ukraine to help him win re-election and then covering up his actions. Central to the case was the phone call in which he asked Mr. Zelensky to ""do us a favor though"" and investigate his political rivals, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a contender for the Democratic presidential nomination.Days before the final verdict in the impeachment trial, Mr. Manchin stood up in a closed-door lunch with his Democratic colleagues and delivered an impassioned speech about the dilemma he faced.He was struggling, Mr. Manchin told his colleagues, and quoted from a statement made by Robert C. Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat who spent more than half a century in the Senate until his death in 2010. During President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial, Mr. Byrd warned that the Senate might sink ""further into the mire because of this partisanship.""There was some applause and very little pushback, according to two people with knowledge of the exchange. Mr. Manchin, who has long prided himself on working across party lines, later repeated Mr. Byrd's words on the Senate floor, warning that ""there will be no winners on this vote.""In that sense, he was right; the vote has certainly not been a winner for him.""It has been incredibly hot,"" said Hoppy Kercheval, a conservative West Virginia talk show host, describing the reaction to Mr. Manchin's vote. ""I got more texts about Manchin's vote than anything I've talked about in a year -- most of them angry and some of them unrepeatable.""Mr. Manchin, a former governor, has long had a reputation for bipartisanship on Capitol Hill. According to the website FiveThirtyEight, Mr. Manchin has voted with Mr. Trump 53 percent of the time. His votes, though, are hard to predict.At the outset of the administration, Mr. Trump courted Mr. Manchin and tried to persuade him to become a Republican. But Mr. Manchin stuck with Democrats in voting against the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and against Mr. Trump's tax bill. Then he crossed party lines to become the lone Democratic vote in favor of confirming Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.Some Democrats said Mr. Manchin's guilty vote on impeachment surprised them. He had floated the possibility of a censure in the days before the final vote. In the interview, he said he thought it might be a way to get some bipartisan consensus that Mr. Trump's call with Mr. Zelensky was hardly ""perfect,"" as the president had repeatedly said.""I don't think there was a person among those 100 senators who believed the president had a perfect phone call and didn't do anything wrong. I believe they all know something was wrong,"" he said. ""I thought censure would be the way we could get a majority of the vote, and I couldn't even get one Republican to sign on.""Mike Plante, a Democratic strategist in West Virginia, said he took the talk of censure as an indication that Mr. Manchin was thinking of voting to acquit.""People were pleasantly surprised and happy that he took this step,"" Mr. Plante said, referring to Democrats. ""He clearly recognized that this was more than politics as usual. This was history, and he did not miss that moment.""But Nick Casey, the former chairman of the West Virginia Democratic Party and a close Manchin ally, said he was not surprised. ""Joe has never been shy about going into the belly of the beast if he does something that he is very comfortable with. And if people disagree with him, that's their right. He got elected to make decisions, and he made one.""His vote caused a bit of a dust-up between Mr. Manchin and the state's other senator, Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican. In an interview on Fox News last week, she said the vote was ""not being received well here at home"" and said that Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the minority leader, had probably ""just pulled the noose a little tight and said, 'Come on, everybody, we're going to jump off this cliff together.""'The suggestion rankled Mr. Manchin, who made his own appearance on Fox News the next day to push back. ""Shelley knows me well enough that no one can pull my chain, tie a noose around me or any of that.""In the Capitol on Monday, Ms. Capito -- and many other Republicans -- said they had no interest in getting in the middle of a dispute between Mr. Trump and Mr. Manchin.""That's between him and the president,"" she said. ""I don't agree with Joe's vote -- he knows that -- but everybody's entitled to their opinion and I just think we need to move on.""At 72, Mr. Manchin, who won re-election narrowly in 2018, has not said whether he will run again in 2024. Mr. Plante said his vote to convict the president could make it harder for him to do so. But Mr. Manchin says he is comfortable with his decision.""I've only taken two oaths since I've been a senator,"" he said. ""One was to protect and defend the Constitution and the other was to do impartial justice, and I think I did. I can sleep on that.""Nicholas Fandos and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.PhotographSenator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a swing vote on impeachment, drew President Trump's fury after the trial ended.

| Jump to first hitMost presidents avoid talking about a rising market because they know how fragile it is.There's a reason most presidents are cautious when talking about the stock market. President Trump is learning it the hard way this week.He is, in effect, experiencing the downside of having spent the last three years personalizing much of what happens in the markets and the economy, saying that the soaring stock values under his watch are a reflection of his special ability, and a central part of his case for re-election in November.Most presidents avoid boasting about a rising stock market because they know how fragile it is, and how little control over stock prices they really have, and how stock prices can move sharply for reasons outside their control, or sometimes for no clear reason at all.The cost of claiming personal credit for stock market gains comes when you get stock market losses. And that is particularly relevant after an 8 percent drop in the S&P 500 since its peak last Wednesday, seemingly caused by a recognition on Wall Street that the spread of coronavirus could disrupt the world economy.""I think the stock market is something I know a lot about,"" President Trump said in a news conference Wednesday evening. ""I think the stock market will recover. The economy is very strong."" He also said the stock market decline was partly a result of the Democratic presidential candidates' rhetoric on the debate stage on Tuesday.The outbreak of the new type of coronavirus in China and its spread to other nations was not something Mr. Trump could have prevented. But even as public health officials start to warn that many Americans may become infected, the Trump administration has devoted lots of effort to talking up the stock market.""Stock Market starting to look very good to me!"" the president tweeted shortly after the market closed Monday afternoon after a 3.5 percent drop.It went on to drop an additional 3 percent on Tuesday and 0.4 percent Wednesday.Wednesday morning, President Trump seemingly blamed the stock market sell-off on alarmist coverage by cable news networks and said the country was in great shape.If the sell-off continues, it could undermine a key pillar of the president's re-election pitch. That might be less of an issue if Mr. Trump had not so frequently spoken of the stock market as a real-time barometer of his presidency's success.But there's more at stake than public relations. There's also the risk that the administration's focus on the optics of the market distracts them from the bigger task at hand -- trying to protect against the potential spread of disease and loss of life that would accompany a global pandemic.Ideally, even economic officials who don't have expertise in disease transmission would spend their time trying to understand what industries are likely to be heavily affected and whether government can do anything to help them work through the supply chain disruptions and other bad effects of the virus.Tuesday afternoon, the chief White House economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, was interviewed on CNBC in the midst of the sell-off, and focused on talking up the markets.""The virus story is not going to last forever,"" he said on ""The Exchange."" ""To me, if you are an investor out there and you have a long-term point of view, I would suggest very seriously taking a look at the market; the stock market, that is a lot cheaper than it was a week or two ago.""He then proceeded to suggest that fears that the virus would spread and cause major damage to the U.S. economy were misplaced.""We have contained this,"" Mr. Kudlow said. ""I won't say airtight, but it's pretty close to airtight.""That's not what public health officials said, in a briefing that same afternoon.""It's not so much of a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen,"" said Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.""We are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this could be bad,"" she added.The effort to set an optimistic tone on the markets was clearly at cross-purposes with what public health officials see as necessary to minimize the damage from a potential pandemic.""It's understandable that the administration, in an election year, is focused on keeping the stock market and the economy strong,"" said Michael Steel, a partner at Hamilton Place Strategies and former spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner. ""But they risk creating the impression that they're more focused on the economic impact of the virus than effective public health measures.""Then there is the broader question of credibility. During the global financial crisis in 2008, White House and Treasury officials were acutely aware that if they seemed too boosterish in public comments on the crisis, it would undermine their credibility and the sense in markets that they were taking the threat seriously enough.When the government announces some important good news toward resolving a crisis -- whether it's that banks have adequate capital or that a pandemic has been contained -- you want people to believe it, which they will do only if the same government has been upfront about the realities of that crisis to begin with. Neither the president's tweets nor Mr. Kudlow's interviews suggest this administration is overly worried about this idea.Imagine a company facing a major crisis, like a safety recall of its products, which in turn causes a plunging stock price.If the executive team devoted all its energy to going on TV to complain about the falling stock price, it probably wouldn't do much good. If the team instead ignored the stock price for a while and tried to fix the safety problem and show consumers that the company was reliable, it still might take a while for the stock to recover, but eventually it probably would.The risk for the United States is that the Trump administration, given election-year politics and the president's penchant for personalizing the markets, follows something more like the first strategy.PhotographPresident Trump attributes market gains to his policies. When the virus caused losses, he blamed Democrats and news outlets.

| Jump to first hitFour Democratic presidential candidates hoping for success in the state remained in Washington for President Trump's Senate trial.DES MOINES -- Four Democratic presidential candidates hoping for breakout performances in the Iowa caucuses next week spent Thursday in Washington listening to questioning in the Senate impeachment trial of President Trump.But the man on trial appeared in Des Moines for a rally to fire up his supporters before the caucuses on Monday. It was his second rally in three nights.In a state where the Democratic field faces a competitive and critical contest on Monday night, the president told his supporters that they had a ""front-row seat to the lunacy and the madness of a totally sick left."" He called the Democrats the party of ""socialism and blatant corruption,"" even as he sits accused of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.Unlike the Democrats, Mr. Trump does not face a competitive contest in Iowa, where his two Republican challengers -- Joe Walsh, a former Illinois congressman, and Bill Weld, a former governor of Massachusetts -- have failed to make any dent in Mr. Trump's support.But the Trump campaign views a show of force before the caucuses as an opportunity to try to slow any momentum the winning Democrat hopes to gain from the close race. And Mr. Trump's team is seeking to build excitement ahead of the first chance voters have had to show their support for the president since the 2016 election.Mr. Trump tried to belittle his Democratic opponents on Thursday with his signature nicknames, referring to former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as ""Sleepy Joe,"" Senator Bernie Sanders as ""Crazy Bernie"" and Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York mayor, as ""Mini Mike."" He poked fun multiple times at the pronunciation of the name of Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and accused the field at large of ""glorifying illegal immigration.""Four years after voters first saw Mr. Trump's name on a ballot, he leaned into some of the original, fear-mongering themes that defined his entry into politics, calling undocumented immigrants ""stone cold rapists."" The line was a callback to his kickoff speech in 2015, when he said of undocumented immigrants: ""They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.""Mr. Trump seemed aware that he was rocketing into a state where Democrats have been camped out for months, noting that ""we're going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats that are right down the street.""But his focus on the Democratic field in front of him appeared to be divided by his political enemies of the past and his foils in Congress.The president reminisced about the 2016 election, expressing a longing for the former Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton, and rehashing a four-year-old campaign gaffe where she described some of his supporters as ""deplorables.""""Maybe we take another crack at Crazy Hillary,"" Mr. Trump said. ""She was so easy.""And he broke up his re-election pitch with invective aimed at Representative Adam B. Schiff, the lead House impeachment manager, whom the president referred to as a ""sick puppy,"" and a diatribe against Speaker Nancy Pelosi, whom he accused of letting her district in San Francisco fall into decay.""We're having probably the best years we've ever had, and I just got impeached. Can you believe these people?"" Mr. Trump said. But he claimed it was still a ""happy period because we call it 'impeachment light.""'""This is not easy,"" he said, ""you got maniacs doing a number on you for three years.""Mr. Trump spoke as the Senate waited on Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and a close friend of the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to announce his decision on whether to support hearing from witnesses during the impeachment trial. A couple of hours after Mr. Trump left the stage, Mr. Alexander said he was a ""no"" on hearing from more witnesses. His is a critical vote, and his decision will help determine whether Mr. Trump receives a swift acquittal as soon as Friday.Trump officials said the caucus on Monday, even if it was not competitive, would be an important milestone for a campaign that has essentially been going on since Mr. Trump's famous escalator ride in Trump Tower in 2015. ""This will be the first time his supporters are able to take part in the process that begins his re-election,"" said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman.Before the rally on Thursday night at Drake University, Mr. Trump made a brief stop in Warren, Mich., where he spoke to manufacturing workers the day after he signed the revised North American Free Trade Agreement into law.Mr. Trump's trade deals are a key part of his re-election message. But it was clear that the impeachment trial -- which Republican senators are hoping to wrap up quickly without hearing from additional witnesses like John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser -- was on his mind.""I've kept my promise, not only my promise of loving the people of Michigan, but my promise of taking care of it so other countries aren't ripping us off,"" Mr. Trump told the crowd gathered at Dana Inc., a major auto parts manufacturer of axles, transmissions and other key components in Warren, an industrial city north of Detroit. ""You remember the tax cut? It was the biggest tax cut in the history of our country, and what do they do? They impeach you. It's frankly a disgrace to our country.""The Trump campaign plans to follow up on the Des Moines rally with a blitz of appearances at caucus sites on Monday by roughly 80 cabinet secretaries, administration officials and members of Congress to generate enthusiasm among Iowa Republicans.Mr. Biden on Thursday spent significant time during campaign stops in Iowa marveling at the band of Trump surrogates and supporters planning to flood the state, suggesting it was proof Mr. Trump's campaign was running scared. ""I never saw another party have so much interest in, in a Democratic caucus,"" he said. ""I wonder why they're all coming. I wonder why they're here.""Mr. Trump already has deep support in Iowa, a state he won in 2016 by more than nine points. Jeff Kaufmann, the chairman of the Iowa Republican Party, has been a strong Trump supporter who has echoed the president's description of a Democratic Party defined by ""left-wing nuts."" Campaign officials have tried to reward Mr. Kaufmann's loyalty with presidential visits intended to motivate other state chairmen to follow suit.The president last held a campaign rally in Iowa in Council Bluffs in October 2018 as part of his push before the midterm elections. In June, he traveled to the state to speak at the Iowa Republican dinner on the same day that Mr. Biden was crisscrossing the state, giving voters a preview of what a general election matchup between the two would look like.Since then, however, Mr. Biden has slipped from his front-runner status in the state, where Mr. Sanders has emerged on top in a handful of polls. But Mr. Sanders as well Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Michael Bennet of Colorado spent the day in the Senate chamber.Steve Friess contributed reporting from Warren, Mich., and Katie Glueck from Des Moines.PhotographPresident Trump on Thursday at a rally in Des Moines.

| Jump to first hitThe Georgia Republican was sworn in as the Senate's newest member just in time to sit for the impeachment trial against President Trump.WASHINGTON -- As her colleagues fretted privately on Monday over revelations from John R. Bolton, the former national security adviser whose forthcoming book pokes holes in President Trump's impeachment defense, the newest Republican member of the United States Senate rushed to publicly side with Mr. Trump.Senator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, who is all of a month into her job, lashed out at one of her fellow Republicans, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, for pressing to subpoena Mr. Bolton, accusing her colleague of wanting to ""appease the left by calling witnesses who will slander the @realDonaldTrump during their 15 minutes of fame.""""The circus is over,"" she added in a post on the president's favorite platform, Twitter. ""It's time to move on.""The attack on Mr. Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee whom Mr. Trump has berated as a ""pompous 'ass""' and a ""fool,"" reflected how Ms. Loeffler, who arrived on Capitol Hill just in time for the third Senate presidential impeachment trial in history, is managing her new role as she faces intense political headwinds of her own.In the courtly Senate, novice members typically take their time before jumping into the spotlight, keeping to themselves as they set up their offices and learn the archaic rules of the institution. But Ms. Loeffler, who had never held public office when she was appointed last year to serve out the term of Senator Johnny Isakson, is breaking convention as she works to use the extraordinary circumstances of the impeachment battle to solidify her place in a party where loyalty to Mr. Trump is the key to survival.Hours after she tweeted on Monday, associates close to Representative Doug Collins of Georgia, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee and a close ally of Mr. Trump's, told reporters he would challenge her for her seat in November. His candidacy, which had long been rumored, helped to explain why Ms. Loeffler, who was appointed over Mr. Trump's explicit objections -- he preferred Mr. Collins for the job -- raced to broadcast her support for the president in the impeachment fight.""Republican primaries these days have become contests about who loves President Trump more,"" said Whit Ayres, a veteran Republican political consultant. ""Mr. Collins has been one of the president's most vociferous defenders. That puts Senator Loeffler in a position of vocally demonstrating that she has the president's back in the impeachment debate.""Sworn in days after Mr. Trump authorized the drone strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, Iran's top security commander, Ms. Loeffler began work as the country found itself on the edge of war and the brink of the historic impeachment trial.""It's going to be a total immersion,"" said Senator David Perdue, Republican of Georgia. ""She's not only got to become a full-fledged voting senator here with an office here and an office in the state, she's got to put a campaign together.""Her orientation to the Senate has mostly consisted of long afternoons at her desk in the chamber listening to House Democrats spar with Mr. Trump's legal team over whether to remove him from office. But Ms. Loeffler, a wealthy Atlanta-based financial executive and Republican donor, has made a point of letting her constituents know that is not her primary focus.""I wanted to let you know I am keeping farmer's hours,"" Ms. Loeffler told her constituents in a video posted to her Twitter account last week. ""So even though we've had late nights here with the impeachment trial, I'm making sure I'm working hard for Georgia and not getting distracted by this impeachment."" (A spokeswoman for Ms. Loeffler declined to make her available for an interview.)Ms. Loeffler, a former collegiate basketball player with a curtain of blond hair that falls to the middle of her back, cuts an unusual figure in the Senate, particularly in the overwhelmingly male Republican conference. During her second week on the job in the Capitol, a police officer stopped Ms. Loeffler on her way to a weekly Republican lunch and asked for identification, prompting a sharp correction from an aide.To Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, that was precisely the point of selecting her to serve out the term of Mr. Isakson, who retired in December because of an illness. Mr. Kemp was betting that Ms. Loeffler could appeal to a critical bloc of suburban, moderate voters -- especially women -- whose support the party has struggled to maintain in the Trump era.""She speaks their language,"" Susan Meyers, a Republican strategist in Georgia, said in an interview. ""Obviously she's a woman, she's a business owner, and like the president, she's an outsider. She's not another politician.""But the president himself was not a fan and reportedly told Ms. Loeffler and Mr. Kemp as much in a contentious Oval Office meeting late last year.Taking their cue from Mr. Trump, some of his allies attacked Ms. Loeffler's credentials as insufficiently conservative and fumed when Mr. Kemp appointed her.His allies also criticized her for donating, along with her husband, Jeff, over $1 million to Mr. Romney's 2012 presidential campaign. (Mr. Romney alluded to that support on Monday when asked to respond to her Twitter broadside against him, saying: ""I think a good deal of Senator Loeffler. She and Jeff have supported me time and time again."")In her inaugural speech after Mr. Kemp announced her appointment, Ms. Loeffler sought to place herself firmly in the right wing of her party.""I'm a lifelong conservative. Pro-Second Amendment. Pro-military. Pro-wall. And pro-Trump,"" she said. ""I make no apologies for my conservative values, and will proudly support President Trump's conservative judges.""Supporters say she has taken pains to reach out to grass-roots groups. At a recent political event in Atlanta hosted by the state's Agriculture Department, the Wild Hog Supper, Ms. Loeffler made the rounds and was one of the last people to leave. She posted a photo on Twitter smiling with Penny Nance, the president of Concerned Women of America and a Trump ally, in January and pledged to work with her ""on issues important to Georgia women and families!""Also buoying Ms. Loeffler's election hopes in November is her own pledge to personally furnish $20 million to her campaign, a staggering number that is sure to make potential challengers think twice before throwing their hat in the ring.But the danger posed by Mr. Collins, who has become one of the president's most strident and public-facing defenders among House Republicans, looms large. He will probably pick up the backing of some of Mr. Trump's most ardent supporters who previously cast aspersions on Ms. Loeffler's nomination, like the Fox News host Sean Hannity.Still, Ms. Loeffler has influential allies, including her fellow senator from Georgia, Mr. Perdue, who has emerged as a vocal supporter.""I think she's going to be fantastic,"" he said. ""She's a student. She looks at these issues very carefully.""Some of her legislative and campaign homework, however, will most likely be on pause until after the impeachment trial.Cloistered in the Senate chamber for hours a day and commanded to stay silent, she is unable to familiarize herself with the labyrinthine layout of the Capitol or schedule one-on-one meetings to get to know her colleagues or discuss legislation. And under the punishing impeachment schedule, instead of flying home on Friday to meet with voters in Georgia, she will be in her seat on the Senate floor, listening to oral arguments.Supporters say she can handle the challenge.""Politics is loud and the pressure is on,"" said Ryan Mahoney, a senior strategist close to both Mr. Kemp and Ms. Loeffler. ""But Kelly is tough.""Nicholas Fandos and Sheryl Gay Stolberg contributed reporting.PhotographSenator Kelly Loeffler of Georgia has been outspoken in calling herself ""pro-Trump,"" but the president was reportedly not a fan.

| Jump to first hitOil prices surged and the stock market fell after President Trump ordered the killing of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani in Baghdad.WASHINGTON -- The United States and Iran exchanged escalating military threats on Friday as President Trump warned that he was ""prepared to take whatever action is necessary"" if Iran threatened Americans and Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, vowed to exact vengeance for the killing on Mr. Trump's order of Iran's most valued general.Although the president insisted that he took the action to avoid a war with Iran, the continuing threats further rattled foreign capitals, global markets and Capitol Hill, where Democrats demanded more information about the strike and Mr. Trump's grounds for taking such a provocative move without consulting Congress.Democrats also pressed questions about the attack's timing and whether it was meant to deflect attention from the president's expected impeachment trial this month in the Senate. They said he risked suspicion that he was taking action overseas to distract from his political troubles at home, as in the political movie ""Wag the Dog.""But Mr. Trump, speaking to reporters in a hastily arranged appearance at Mar-a-Lago, his Florida resort, asserted that Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, who directed Iranian paramilitary forces throughout the Middle East, ""was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him.""Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo echoed Mr. Trump's remarks, as did Robert C. O'Brien, the national security adviser. But General Milley, Mr. Pompeo, Mr. O'Brien and other senior administration officials did not describe any threats that were different from what American officials say General Suleimani had been orchestrating for years.Democrats questioned the lack of specifics about any new threat that would justify Mr. Trump's order to kill General Suleimani, which both Presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush had rejected as too risky.""What always kept both Democratic and Republican presidents from targeting Suleimani himself was the simple question: Was the strike worth the likely retaliation and the potential to pull us into protracted conflict?"" Representative Elissa Slotkin, Democrat of Michigan and a former C.I.A. analyst and Pentagon official, said in a statement. ""The two administrations I worked for both determined that the ultimate ends didn't justify the means.""In Baghdad, the State Department urged American citizens to leave Iraq immediately, citing ""heightened tensions."" The American Embassy, which had been under siege by pro-Iranian protesters chanting ""Death to America"" in recent days, suspended consular operations.""U.S. citizens should not approach the Embassy,"" the State Department warned on Twitter. Iraq's Parliament is set to meet on Saturday and could consider a measure to expel all United States forces from the country for the first time since 2003.At Fort Bragg, N.C., some 3,500 members of the 82nd Airborne, ordered to the Middle East this week, prepared to deploy to Kuwait.On Wall Street, the stock market fell as oil prices jumped after the news of the general's death: The price of Brent oil, the international benchmark, surged in the early hours of Hong Kong trading to nearly $70 a barrel -- an increase of $3.The immediate increase in the price of oil was among the largest since an attack on a critical Saudi oil installation in September that temporarily knocked out 5 percent of the world's supply.Mr. Trump said that the killing early Friday of General Suleimani, the commander of Iran's powerful Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, was long overdue, though he insisted he did not want a larger fight with Iran.""We took action last night to stop a war,"" the president said. ""We did not take action to start a war."" But moments later, he warned Iran that the American military had ""already fully identified"" potential targets for further attacks ""if Americans anywhere are threatened.""By early evening, as he came under growing criticism for what his critics called a reckless national security gamble, Mr. Trump said he wanted to contain the conflict.""We do not seek war, we do not seek nation-building, we do not seek regime change,"" Mr. Trump told a gathering of his evangelical supporters in Miami, seeming to draw a contrast with the 2003 American-led invasion of Iraq.Hours earlier, Ayatollah Khamenei had warned Mr. Trump that there would be consequences for General Suleimani's death, who died after an American MQ-9 Reaper drone fired missiles at his convoy as it was leaving Baghdad International Airport.""His departure to God does not end his path or his mission,"" Ayatollah Khamenei said in a statement, ""but a forceful revenge awaits the criminals who have his blood and the blood of the other martyrs last night on their hands.""Writing on Twitter earlier in the day, Mr. Trump suggested that General Suleimani ""got caught"" preparing to hit American targets.""General Qassem Soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time, and was plotting to kill many more...but got caught!"" Mr. Trump tweeted, using a different spelling of the general's name. ""He was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people, including the recent large number of PROTESTERS killed in Iran itself.""An American official said diplomats in Baghdad were nervous about the embassy being the target of retaliation, but noted that Iran had many options, and an embassy attack by pro-Iran militias was only one of them. The embassy is among the most fortified American outposts in the world, and there are other less-guarded targets that Iran could choose.The White House approved the strike on General Suleimani after a rocket attack last Friday on an Iraqi military base outside Kirkuk killed an American civilian contractor and injured other American and Iraqi personnel, according to an American official who insisted on anonymity to discuss internal decision making. The Joint Special Operations Command spent the next several days looking for an opportunity.The option that was eventually approved depended on General Suleimani's arrival on Thursday at the Baghdad airport. If he was met by Iraqi officials, the American official said, the strike would be called off. But the official said it turned out to be a ""clean party,"" and the strike was approved.Briefing reporters on Friday, Mr. O'Brien cited Mr. Trump's ""constitutional authorities as commander in chief to defend our nation"" from attacks like those he said General Suleimani had been plotting. He also cited Congress's 2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force. That measure was approved by Congress to grant the administration of President George W. Bush the legal authority to wage war on Saddam Hussein and the government of Iraq.The strike touched off an immediate debate in Washington, with Republicans hailing the action as a decisive blow against a longtime enemy with American blood on his hands and Democrats expressing concern that the president was risking a new war in the Middle East.As a private citizen, Mr. Trump repeatedly accused Mr. Obama of preparing to go to war with Iran to bolster his re-election chances in 2012. As president, Mr. Trump has questioned his own intelligence agencies and peddled repeated falsehoods, a record that could undermine the administration's credibility on the highly delicate subject.Democratic leaders complained that Mr. Trump acted without consulting or even telling Congress first. The president responded by retweeting a post comparing Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, to the Iranians.A post by Dinesh D'Souza, a conservative commentator who was pardoned by Mr. Trump for a campaign finance violation, scoffed at Mr. Schumer's complaint that he was not told in advance. ""Neither were the Iranians, and for pretty much the same reason,"" Mr. D'Souza wrote in the tweet reposted by Mr. Trump.John R. Bolton, the hawkish former national security adviser who left his job in September after clashes with Mr. Trump on Iran and other issues, offered ""congratulations"" on the killing of General Suleimani and said it was a ""decisive blow"" against the Quds Force. Posting on Twitter, he added that he hoped that this was the ""first step to regime change in Tehran.""Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said that a classified briefing was being arranged for all senators next week and that everyone should welcome the demise of General Suleimani. ""For too long, this evil man operated without constraint, and countless innocents have suffered for it,"" Mr. McConnell said Friday on the Senate floor. ""Now his terrorist leadership has been ended.""Democrats said Mr. Trump's move could further involve the United States in Middle East conflict rather than pull out as he has promised. ""President Trump came into office saying he wanted to end America's wars in the Middle East, but today we are closer to war with Iran than ever before and the Administration's reckless policy over the last 3 years has brought us to the brink,"" Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland tweeted.General Suleimani, the driving force behind Iranian-sponsored attacks and operations over two decades around the region, including in Iraq, Syria, Yemen and Lebanon, was considered perhaps the second-most powerful figure in Iran, after Ayatollah Khamenei.Mr. Pompeo dismissed concerns raised by American allies, who expressed fear of a wider war in the Middle East. A French minister suggested that ""we are waking up in a more dangerous world"" after the strike.""Yeah, well, the French are just wrong about that,"" Mr. Pompeo said. ""The world is a much safer place today. And I can assure you Americans in the region are much safer today after the demise of Qassim Suleimani.""A top Chinese Communist Party official, Yang Jiechi, told Mr. Pompeo in a telephone call that China, Iran's most powerful partner, was ""highly concerned"" about the situation in the Middle East and that ""differences should be resolved through dialogue,"" Zhao Lijian, a Foreign Ministry official, tweeted.Presidents Emmanuel Macron of France and Vladimir V. Putin of Russia spoke by telephone and agreed to try to ""prevent a new and dangerous escalation of tensions,"" according to a summary issued by Mr. Macron's office. The French president also stressed the fight against the Islamic State should be a priority, as well as efforts to get Iran to return to compliance on the 2015 nuclear agreement, from which Mr. Trump withdrew but that Russia, China and three European nations still support.The decision to hit General Suleimani complicates relations with Iraq's government, which has tried to balance itself between the United States and Iran.A senior Iraqi official said Friday that there was a good chance the Iraqi Parliament would vote to force American troops to leave the country. Top Iraqi leaders earlier had wanted to accommodate the troop presence because of the persistent threat from the Islamic State and other regional security matters.On Friday afternoon, the State Department announced it was designating a prominent Iraqi militia supported by Iran as a foreign terrorist organization, in what appeared to be a policy extension of the strike on Mr. Suleimani. The move paved the way for harder American actions against the militia, Aas'ib Ahl al-Haq.The State Department also designated the leaders of the militia, the brothers Qais al-Khazali and Laith al-Khazali, as global terrorists. The group received training and financing from the Quds Force, the elite unit led by Mr. Suleimani, the department said.Dalia Dassa Kaye, an Iran expert at the RAND Corporation, a research organization, said the killing of General Suleimani was a ""major escalation beyond proxy conflict to a direct conflict with Iran that is likely to be viewed in existential terms on Iran's side,"" especially in the wider context of Mr. Trump's continuing sanctions campaign to isolate Iran.She added that likely costs included a rupture with the Iraqi government, which would weaken the fight against the Islamic State; a further alienation of American allies who have been seeking de-escalation this year between Western nations and Iran; and growing challenges to containing Iran's nuclear ambitions.""Just because the U.S. can take punitive actions doesn't mean it should,"" she said.Michael Crowley, Peter Baker and Edward Wong reported from Washington, and Maggie Haberman from Palm Beach, Fla. Reporting was contributed by Catie Edmondson, Thomas Gibbons-Neff and Lara Jakes from Washington, and Farnaz Fassihi from New York.PhotographProtesters in Tehran demonstrating over the American airstrike in Iraq on Friday that killed Maj.

| Jump to first hitWith the Iowa caucuses set to kick off the primary season on Monday night, a Democratic race that began as a contest of ideas and ideologies has given way to a fixation on electability.SIOUX CITY, Iowa -- After a long campaign of ideological clashes, policy debates and talk of a grand reckoning on the direction of the Democratic Party, the presidential primaries starting on Monday will be shaped by a less lofty but increasingly urgent matter: determining the best candidate to defeat an incumbent who has already proved to be a political survivor.With Republicans ready to acquit President Trump of two impeachment charges next week, the nation's political table has been set for 2020: Congress will not remove him from office, despite the wishes of many liberals, leaving the fate of Mr. Trump to the November general election and the candidate nominated by Democrats in the coming months.From the liberal left to the moderate middle, the major presidential contenders are now honing or recalibrating their final appeals before Iowa's caucuses to make the case that they represent the party's best chance to overcome Mr. Trump's well-funded re-election operation and win back the White House this fall.If impeachment rarely comes up on the Democratic campaign trail, the imperative of beating Mr. Trump has come to outweigh all other considerations for many voters -- an extraordinary turn of events for a party that spent the last year sparring over plans to implement ""Medicare for all"" and how far to go in overhauling immigration laws, the financial sector and the criminal justice system.A 2020 primary season that was initially seen as a contest of ideas, with liberal activists largely setting the agenda, has given way to jockeying over notions about electability and who can assemble the strongest coalition of voters in the fall.""I think that's increasingly what's on voters' minds,"" Pete Buttigieg, one of the leading candidates in Iowa, said in an interview, referring to electability. ""If they're making up their minds now and still thinking through us, it means they appreciate that we've got common values and they want the person most likely to beat Donald Trump.""The five leading Democratic candidates in Iowa descended on the state on Saturday ahead of the caucuses Monday night, with polls showing no clear front-runner and voters still torn about whom to support. Three of these contenders -- Senators Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar -- returned after being away for most of the last two weeks at the Senate impeachment trial; no one can say with certainty if their absences will affect their chances in the caucuses.In last-minute rallies, pamphlets and television advertising and even in electric signs placed atop cars that resemble pizza delivery advertisements, the candidates are running more explicitly on their purported viability than in any modern presidential primary.Mr. Sanders, the leading progressive in the field, is increasingly linking his populist platform to an argument that he can peel away disaffected voters from Mr. Trump while a more moderate candidate like former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. could imperil that effort. Mr. Biden is closing his Iowa campaign with a commercial highlighting his advantage over Mr. Trump in some national and swing-state polls while his leading supporters in Iowa are introducing him to voters by arguing that he could win over their Republican friends.And Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Warren, who are struggling to match the appeal of their rivals on the party's ideological poles, are infusing their 11th-hour messaging with barely veiled claims that they are safer choices because they won't alienate one flank of the party like Mr. Sanders and Mr. Biden.Returning to the Iowa campaign trail on Saturday, Ms. Warren presented herself as the candidate best prepared to rally Democrats for the general election. She addressed a group of volunteers in Urbandale, before a wall of signs reading ""Unite the Party."" In a Cedar Rapids gymnasium, Representative Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts praised Ms. Warren as ""both empathetic and electable.""""We will, we must, come together as a party and beat Donald Trump,"" Ms. Warren said. ""And I've got a plan for that.""This turn toward I-can-win pragmatism reflects a simple fact of political life in a contest in which at least a third of likely caucusgoers remain undecided just days before the vote. The candidates are responding to the marketplace: Their voters, while deeply split across ideological and generational lines in ways that could still force a showdown at this summer's convention, are united by an all-consuming hunger to unseat Mr. Trump.""What I'm focused on most is getting that fool out of the White House,"" said Debbie McAllister, who attended a Sioux City rally Friday for Mr. Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and is leaning toward him over Ms. Klobuchar.John Norris, who has caucused here every four years since 1976 and is a leading supporter of Ms. Warren, said his fellow Iowa Democrats feel a burden heavier than any he can recall.""It's Trump,"" said Mr. Norris. ""We saw it a little bit in '04 -- it was we got to stop George W., Iraq war -- but this is that on steroids.""Even the most bluntly negative campaign tactics have been framed in terms of general-election odds. An outside-spending group, Democratic Majority for Israel, that has dedicated $700,000 to advertising against Mr. Sanders in the last week of the caucus race, has put that whole sum behind a commercial warning that his far-left platform could throw the election to Mr. Trump.""Democrats believe there is nothing more important than replacing Donald Trump,"" said Mark Mellman, the president of Democratic Majority for Israel and a longtime Democratic pollster. Regarding Mr. Sanders, he added, ""A lot of Democrats don't disagree with him on a lot of positions he has, but we and others are concerned about electability.""Perhaps most remarkable are the closing appeals of Mr. Sanders of Vermont, whose calls for ""a political revolution"" vaulted him to contention in the 2016 race but who scarcely mentioned his prospects back then against Mr. Trump or Senator Ted Cruz, the two leading Republicans. Mr. Sanders has not diluted his progressive message, but as he stakes out a lead in some Iowa polls the self-proclaimed democratic socialist is turning to hardheaded pragmatism.His campaign ads warn against nominating a candidate without his own unblemished record of opposing cuts to Social Security -- an unmistakable reference to Mr. Biden and his past support for overhauling the program. And at Mr. Sanders's Sioux City field office, his campaign was distributing a pamphlet that read, ""An effective leader with the toughness to defeat Donald Trump.""Addressing supporters on Saturday in Indianola, Iowa, some of whom wore ""Bernie Beats Trump"" buttons, Mr. Sanders argued that his mammoth volunteer effort in Iowa presaged the sort of organization he could build this fall.""We are going to knock on 500,000 doors in the month of January and the first two days of February,"" he said, adding: ""That is what we need to do in order to win against Trump.""Vowing to ""bring millions of people into the political process who normally do not vote,"" Mr. Sanders warned that Democrats will lose ""in a low turnout election.""Mr. Biden's single-minded focus on electability also stands out, as he goes further than his rivals in attempting to replace political inspiration with cold calculus about cobbling together the 270 Electoral College votes needed to defeat Mr. Trump.""He beats Trump by the most nationally, and in the states we have to win,"" a narrator says in one of his concluding Iowa television ads.The appeals are no more subtle at his events in Iowa, which often feature former Gov. Tom Vilsack of Iowa and his wife, Christie. At a rally in suburban Des Moines, Ms. Vilsack talked up Mr. Biden's potential appeal among her Republican friends, and Mr. Vilsack rattled off the former vice president's head-to-head advantage in general-election surveys in the traditional swing states.And in an only-in-2020 moment that underscored how the horse race has overtaken policy as a focus right now, Mr. Vilsack drew some of the loudest applause at the entire event by making this observation about polling: ""He's within the margin of error in Texas!""Two other candidates, Ms. Warren and Mr. Buttigieg, have used the voter fixation on electability to cast themselves as candidates with the broadest appeal within the party.Mr. Buttigieg organized his campaign schedule in the final weeks of the caucuses around visiting counties that voted for former President Barack Obama before flipping to support Mr. Trump. His aides have circulated statistics about past elections to reporters in each locale, and Mr. Buttigieg has sought to liken himself -- in kind if not by name -- to past general-election winners, like Bill Clinton and Mr. Obama.""In the last half-century in this country,"" Mr. Buttigieg said at a rally in Marshalltown, Iowa, ""every single time my party has won the White House, without exception, we've done it with a nominee who is looking to the future, moving past the arguments of the past, not a creature of Washington, and opening the door to a new generation.""In Ankeny, Mr. Buttigieg invoked the impeachment trial -- and Mr. Trump's likely acquittal -- to emphasize the stakes of the election. ""This is our only chance, unless the Senate really surprises us,"" he said, to laughter from the crowd.Ms. Warren has also sought to portray herself as a consensus candidate, airing a commercial that features Iowa supporters of Mr. Sanders, Hillary Clinton and Mr. Trump from 2016 who all say they are now supporting the Massachusetts senator.And in a plain acknowledgment of voters' concerns about sexism in the general election, Ms. Warren released another spot showing a former supporter of Mr. Trump -- an older man from rural Iowa -- directly addressing worries among some voters about nominating a woman. ""For people that say that a woman can't win, I say: nonsense,"" he says, holding up a photograph showing a Trump sign and declaring: ""This is the man to beat, and Elizabeth can do it.""At a kickoff event for Warren canvassers on Friday morning in Clive, a suburb of Des Moines, Michelle Wu, a Boston city councilor, urged them to reassure anxious voters with a version of that argument, stressing Ms. Warren's victory in 2012 over a popular Republican senator -- the ""barn jacket-wearing, pickup truck-driving Scott Brown"" -- and promising that her economic message would appeal to independents and disaffected Republicans.Not to be outdone on electability is Ms. Klobuchar, who for months has been blunt about why Iowans should turn to her: because she's won every race she's run in an increasingly competitive Midwestern state, Minnesota.While that pitch has made her competitive in Iowa, she has been outspent and has polled below the four leading Democrats.In the campaign's closing days, Ms. Klobuchar, too, is becoming even less subtle: She has printed T-shirts in her signature green reading, ""Amy Klobuchar Will Beat Donald Trump.""PhotographFor Democratic candidates and voters alike, the overarching factor appears to be boiling down to who is best positioned to defeat President Trump. While former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. goes the furthest in emphasizing electoral calculus over political inspiration, Pete Buttigieg and Elizabeth Warren are both casting themselves as having the broadest appeal within the party.

| Jump to first hitThe president's advisers have urged him not to pay attention to the low-polling Democratic presidential candidate. But as Michael Bloomberg poured cash into attack ads, he became harder to ignore.For weeks, President Trump's advisers have urged him to ignore Michael R. Bloomberg's nationally televised needling, warning him that it would only help the low-polling late entrant to the Democratic presidential primary by elevating his standing.Mr. Trump heeded the counsel for a while, according to several of his allies, even as he repeatedly expressed anxiety about Mr. Bloomberg's spending. But as he has tuned into coverage of his Senate impeachment trial, Mr. Trump has been pricked by a deluge of television ads funded by the former New York City mayor -- a far wealthier billionaire who has made clear in his public remarks that he doesn't fear the president.The ads have been everywhere, appearing when Mr. Trump catches up on television viewing in Washington and following him to Florida when he visits his new home state. But on Thursday morning, when the spending migrated to Mr. Trump's favorite morning show on Fox News, Mr. Bloomberg's aides all but spoke to the president through the television screen.The show, ""Fox and Friends,"" aired without commentary a new ad from Mr. Bloomberg's team that is based on reporting from a new book, ""A Very Stable Genius,"" describing the language Mr. Trump used to excoriate military generals during a Pentagon meeting in 2017. The ad described him as ""erratic"" and pointed to the ""chaos"" in his administration.Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager, Kevin Sheekey, appeared on the show to unveil the ad, saying the military is an ""institution that everyone respects. I think people want our commander in chief to respect the institution, and I think he weakens the country by attacking it.""The ad struck Mr. Trump, with its focus on a topic he has often been concerned about -- maintaining support among members of the military. So the president, who is notorious for reacting to what he sees on Fox News, did just that.""Mini Mike Bloomberg is playing poker with his foolhardy and unsuspecting Democrat rivals,"" Mr. Trump tweeted. ""He says that if he loses (he really means when!) in the primaries, he will spend money helping whoever the Democrat nominee is.""He added: ""By doing this, he figures, they won't hit him as hard during his hopeless 'presidential' campaign. They will remain silent! The fact is, when Mini losses, he will be spending very little of his money on these 'clowns' because he will consider himself to be the biggest clown of them all - and he will be right!""The president's focus on Mr. Bloomberg is not commensurate with the former mayor's standing in the polls so far. Mr. Bloomberg is still below double digits in nearly every survey after spending more than $256 million on ads in less than two months.Mr. Bloomberg has benefited, however, from being mostly ignored by his primary rivals, some of whom don't want to elevate him in the race, but also don't want to alienate him and his ability to support the Democratic nominee in the general election. And most Democratic strategists remain skeptical that a candidate who once supported aggressive policing policies, who has switched parties three times and who endorsed President George W. Bush in 2004 will be able to win the nomination.From Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, to Brad Parscale, his campaign manager, to his polling team and other advisers, the president has been told repeatedly that Mr. Bloomberg isn't worth his attention.Meanwhile, even for some Democratic observers who are uncomfortable with how much money Mr. Bloomberg is flooding into the system, there is a relief in watching the candidate get into Mr. Trump's head in a way that few have.""Trump fears Bloomberg because Bloomberg is actually the guy who Trump played on TV -- a fantastically wealthy, self-made success with unlimited resources and a willingness to spend it,"" said David Axelrod, a former senior adviser to President Barack Obama.The Trump campaign played down any worries about Mr. Bloomberg.""It's a free country and he can set his money on fire if he wants to,"" said Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman. ""He's still in a statistical tie with the back of the pack in the Democrat field.""The Trump campaign is dismissive of the idea that Mr. Bloomberg could be an ongoing threat as anything other than the nominee, despite his pledge to spend to support the Democratic standard-bearer through Election Day. And officials have taken note that Mr. Bloomberg's team is trying to mirror the Trump campaign's playbook with online spending.But Mr. Bloomberg's advisers see a void that the candidate is filling, in a primary race during which the candidates have sometimes struggled with whether to depict Mr. Trump as an existential threat or to ignore him altogether. The president, meanwhile, continues to try to set the terms of engagement in the election, threatening to attack them in demeaning, and deeply personal, ways.Howard Wolfson, an adviser to Mr. Bloomberg, said that Mr. Trump had been ""essentially running unopposed until Mike entered the race.""""While the other Democrats are fighting and sniping with one another in Iowa, we are running a nationwide campaign that is taking the fight directly to President Trump on issues where he is extremely vulnerable,"" he said.As for Mr. Trump's nickname for Mr. Bloomberg -- ""Mini"" -- Mr. Wolfson called it ""irrelevant"" and said, ""If you want to think about small, Trump could fit in Mike's pocket. The stature gap, the wealth gap, the success gap, the experience gap, the achievement gap between these two men is vast.""The Bloomberg campaign has been ratcheting up its attacks as Mr. Trump has reacted to the spending.Guided by extensive internal polling, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign first began directly attacking Mr. Trump with an ad on health care, accusing the president of ruining insurance for millions of Americans and undermining coverage of pre-existing conditions. The ad about pre-existing conditions immediately drew a Twitter rebuke from the president.From health care to the environment to impeachment, the Bloomberg campaign has been running ads attacking Mr. Trump's record nationally, particularly in key swing states. The ad about pre-existing conditions, for example, was backed by more than $1.2 million in the Orlando, Fla., market alone.But, in a further tweak to Mr. Trump, the campaign is also running ads in his strongholds, such as $14 million worth of ads attacking the president in Texas. The state is also a Super Tuesday state, where Mr. Bloomberg hopes to amass delegates.And the Bloomberg campaign confirmed that the ad about the Pentagon that set off Mr. Trump on Thursday morning would continue airing on Fox News.Every television ad attacking Mr. Trump concludes with a contrast to Mr. Bloomberg, whose mayoral record and subsequent activism are portrayed glowingly; none of the ads are simply a takedown of the president.PhotographMichael R. Bloomberg has continued his television ad campaign against President Trump, recently targeting the president's support among members of the military.

| Jump to first hitThe president stressed the strength of his relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in meetings long on symbolism and short on concrete agreements.NEW DELHI -- In the lush garden of Hyderabad House, President Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi celebrated their friendship and talked of a modern, diverse and unified India. Across town, an explosion of anger over Mr. Modi's sectarian policies set a neighborhood on edge, leaving a trail of dead bodies and a widening religious rift.The two sides of New Delhi on display on Tuesday underscored the disparity between the hopes of Mr. Trump's trip and the tensions outside the fortified environs of world leaders. Just miles from the pomp of a presidential visit, a mob of hot-tempered Hindu men wielding iron bars hunted their Muslim neighbors on streets littered with scraps of bricks.As he completed his two-day stay, Mr. Trump focused only on the positive, offering validation of Mr. Modi as a champion of religious liberty even as the Indian government has adopted Hindu-first policies targeting Muslims. The president publicly accepted Mr. Modi's word that he treats the 1.3 billion people in his diverse country fairly without regard to faith and made no mention of the months of protests by those who think otherwise.""We did talk about religious freedom, and I will say that the prime minister was incredible on what he told me,"" Mr. Trump told reporters. ""He wants people to have religious freedom, and very strongly.""""They have really worked hard on religious freedom,"" Mr. Trump added. ""We talked about it for a long time and I really believe that's what he wants.""His reluctance to criticize Mr. Modi sharply contrasted with his willingness to assail his domestic critics even while abroad.During his concluding news conference, Mr. Trump attacked Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the former first lady Michelle Obama, Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California, and the unnamed whistle-blower whose disclosures led to the president's impeachment.He also confirmed that his White House had embarked on a hunt for disloyal officials to purge in the aftermath of his acquittal in a Senate trial but said it would not be ""very many people,"" without estimating how many. ""We want to have people that are good for the country, are loyal to our country,"" he said. ""Because that was a disgraceful situation.""The president's embrace of Mr. Modi came at a time when the government has revoked the statehood of Kashmir, the disputed majority Muslim territory; rounded up Muslim leaders there; and enacted a law giving preference to non-Muslim migrants naturalizing as citizens. Protests over the citizenship law culminated in street violence that cost at least 11 lives since Sunday.Mr. Trump made no public mention of those actions until asked and even then professed no view of them. Instead, he framed his first visit to India as president on terms he preferred.Just as religious disputes drew no outward concern, the president insisted that the two leaders had made ""tremendous progress"" toward the landmark trade agreement he has sought even though there was no evident sign of breakthrough on the major issues that have divided negotiators for months.""We think we're at a point where our relationship is so special with India, it has never been as good as it is now,"" Mr. Trump said. ""We feel very strongly about each other, and we have done something that is very unique.""The president often personalizes his relations with foreign leaders. His willingness to accept Mr. Modi's version of events recalled Mr. Trump's deference to President Vladimir V. Putin's denials that Russia had intervened in the 2016 presidential election and his professed belief in Kim Jong-un's vague promises to give up North Korea's nuclear weapons.Even Mr. Trump's boasts about the scale of his reception in India were extravagant.He claimed before his arrival that Mr. Modi had promised him crowds of up to 10 million people. The actual number lining the streets of Ahmedabad on Monday was well under one-tenth that amount. Despite saying he had been told his greeting was the greatest ""ever given to any head of state from any country,"" Mr. Trump was not even the top-drawing American president to visit India looking back to Dwight D. Eisenhower's crowds.Only after he was no longer in Mr. Modi's presence did Mr. Trump return to some of his longstanding complaints about India's trade policies, complaining to reporters that New Delhi maintained unfairly high tariffs on American goods, including Harley Davidson motorcycles.But while the two leaders were together, it was all sunshine, long on florid language about the strength of their relationship and short on concrete results. Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi celebrated a series of modest agreements that were set before the visit, including a $3 billion arms purchase and a letter of cooperation between Exxon Mobil and India's energy sector. They agreed to create a joint counternarcotics working group to reduce opioid abuse.During his news conference, Mr. Trump also addressed growing alarm over the coronavirus and the return of 14 Americans infected with coronavirus to the country last week. He defended that action, even though he was privately furious about it.""I felt that we should bring them back,"" he said. ""They're Americans -- we should bring them back.""During the 2014 Ebola epidemic in Africa, Mr. Trump tweeted in outrage that Americans infected with that virus should not be allowed into the country. Asked whether his current view clashed with his prior one, he rejected the comparison.""There's a vast difference"" between the two epidemics, Mr. Trump said, noting that Ebola was nearly always fatal while the death rate among those infected with the new coronavirus has been relatively low. ""At that time, nobody had ever even heard of Ebola or ever conceived of something where you basically -- the people would disintegrate."" (Ebola was widely known by 2014.)Mr. Trump also vowed not to accept foreign assistance during his re-election campaign and rejected American intelligence assessments that Russia was already working to help him as it did in 2016.""I want no help from any country, and I haven't been given help from any country,"" Mr. Trump said.Mr. Modi welcomed Mr. Trump to the presidential palace on Tuesday with the roar of guns and an honor guard of red-uniformed soldiers on horseback and later hosted him at a lavish state banquet. ""President Trump's contribution in raising our relations to this level have been invaluable,"" Mr. Modi said.Mr. Trump basked in the visit. ""Nobody else that came here got the kind of reception we got,"" Mr. Trump said.The two leaders declined to answer questions at their joint appearance before the news media. Although Mr. Modi has taken questions from reporters while overseas next to other world leaders, he is the first prime minister in recent memory to not have held any news conferences in India. And so Mr. Trump waited until later to meet reporters on his own.He did gently urge Mr. Modi's government to respect freedom on the internet, which the Indian government has shut down repeatedly. Talking about the need for secure 5G wireless, the president added that it should be ""a tool for freedom, progress, prosperity -- not to do anything where it could be even conceived as a conduit for suppression and censorship.""A trade deal with India has been a priority for two years for Mr. Trump, who would like another economic agreement to show while campaigning before the November election. But the two sides have been divided over farm products, medical devices, digital trade and new tariffs. Mr. Trump has complained that India treats the United States unfairly and called Mr. Modi a ""tough negotiator.""""Our teams have made tremendous progress on a comprehensive trade agreement, and I'm optimistic we can reach a deal that will be of great importance to both countries,"" Mr. Trump told reporters, without elaborating.For Mr. Trump, it was a day to emphasize the optimism. It was, he said, ""a very special visit -- unforgettable, extraordinary.""PhotographPresident Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, at Raj Ghat, a Gandhi memorial, in New Delhi on Tuesday. The president claimed to have made progress on a trade agreement during his visit.

| Jump to first hitThe Israeli-Palestinian peace plan unveiled by President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sounds more like a road map for their own futures than for the Middle East.WASHINGTON -- A president trying to prevail in an impeachment trial stood with an Israeli prime minister under indictment on Tuesday to announce a long-delayed plan for resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the result sounded more like a road map for their own futures than for the Middle East.For President Trump, it is a plan that builds on his decision to move the United States Embassy to Jerusalem -- a huge political success among his conservative Jewish donors and evangelicals that, contrary to predictions, did not touch off a violent reaction in the region.Mr. Trump now enters the heart of his election campaign declaring that he has delivered a plan that makes Jerusalem the undivided capital of Israel and relegates the Palestinian capital to a suburb, and one that Mr. Trump, in a triumph of real-estate branding, is suddenly calling ""East Jerusalem.""And the timing is no accident: At a moment when cable television is focused on impeachment and the prospect that the former national security adviser John R. Bolton might testify, Mr. Trump had a chance to stand in the East Room and cast himself as a peacemaker. With rare self-discipline, he never mentioned the word impeachment.For his part, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel marches toward his March elections wielding the potent argument that Israelis should ignore his indictment on corruption charges and focus on the fact that he, by force of his relationship with Mr. Trump, moved Washington to give permanent legitimacy to the Jewish settlements in disputed territory.By Sunday, the prime minister said as he was leaving Washington, Israel will essentially annex the strategically vital part of the Jordan Valley that its military already controls. As the Israeli election nears, those moves allow him to sell himself as the Trump whisperer, the indispensable man who bent the White House to his will.""Strip away the domestic and Israeli political considerations that determined the timing of the plan's release,"" said Robert Malley, the president of the International Crisis Group and a former Obama administration official, ""and the message to the Palestinians, boiled down to its essence, is: You've lost, get over it.""That message, implicitly or explicitly, rewrites the art of the Middle East deal. By tilting the map of a future Palestinian state so precipitously in Israel's direction, Mr. Trump has embraced a plan that essentially dismantles 60 years of bipartisan support for a negotiated process between Israelis and Palestinians, in which both make concessions and land swaps that would define the lines of a new map.As Mr. Trump acknowledged, Washington would no longer play the role of neutral arbiter -- even while vowing to be Israel's source of protection. Instead, the United States has drawn the lines in a series of maps that sketch out a future Palestinian state that is so gerrymandered that it requires the construction of a giant tunnel across Israel to connect two areas of Palestinian control.To Mr. Trump, this is the merger of deal making, Middle East urban planning and election-year politics -- or rather, potential deal making.A few days ago Mr. Trump said, ""I think we're relatively close but we have to get other people to agree to it."" In other words the ""deal of the century"" was no deal at all. And the other people were the Palestinians, who dismissed the proposal and the accompanying map on Tuesday hours after its publication.For election purposes, Mr. Trump does not need a deal, he simply needs the impression that progress is being made.And at the White House on Tuesday, the ambassadors from the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Oman -- but not Saudi Arabia, the country Mr. Trump and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has worked hardest to woo -- were in the room for the announcement, a seeming endorsement of his approach, if not the specifics.Their presence would have been unimaginable in the past, especially for any announcement that fell well short of creating a real Palestinian state.And this one certainly falls short of that goal. Mr. Trump's 180-page plan would require the Palestinians to accept only partial sovereignty over a future Palestinian state, at least for a considerable time, and give up any claim to territory where the Israelis have already accepted settlements. And it asked them to take the bet that, as Mr. Trump promised, they would ultimately get rich because of a $50 billion investment fund, paid for by Arab neighbors.It has a brilliant twist: The Palestinians do not have to say yes or no for four years. That means their bottom-line response would not come until the very end of Mr. Trump's next term, if he is re-elected. In the meantime, Israel would freeze settlements in the territory that Mr. Trump has set aside for the Palestinians, much of it areas the Israelis have little interest in.That proviso defers all the hard questions for several years of negotiations -- with their inevitable breakdowns and crises. But it gives Mr. Trump the campaign-trail talking point that he has fulfilled a 2016 promise and proposed an actual solution, rather than just a process.The proposal, of course, helps Mr. Netanyahu by moving the goal posts. The status of Jerusalem is set out in the Trump document, rather than being a subject of negotiation. And while past presidents lectured Mr. Netanyahu about his creation of Jewish settlements in territories that are subject to negotiation, Mr. Trump's plan makes them a permanent feature.To critics, that is the fatal flaw.Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, who was among the lawmakers briefed by Mr. Kushner at the White House, called it ""a total abandonment of decades of U.S. Middle East policy.""He was referring to the longtime American support for a deal that would include only modest adjustments to the Israeli borders drawn in 1967, the year of the Arab-Israeli War, and by a process created in the Oslo Accords, which began in 1993 and largely ended with the failed summit in 2000 at Camp David. The premise of those talks was that the Israelis and Palestinians would set up a complex process and inch their way toward agreements on borders, settlements, political rights and the withdrawal of the Israeli military from Palestinian lands.There were years of talks, stalemates, ""road maps to peace,"" collapsed negotiations and intifadas.Mr. Trump, the disrupter, has made it clear he does not believe that approach would work. On Tuesday, he noted that every president since Lyndon B. Johnson had tried and failed to negotiate a peace deal. Always the real-estate mogul, Mr. Trump has declared that he is more interested in working with existing facts on the ground than on creating processes.So his plan, three years in the making, is less about future negotiations and more about cementing what exists today and making deals around the edges. If the Palestinians take it, he suggested, riches would follow. There would be a million new jobs, he said, and poverty would be cut in half. Mr. Trump has offered a similar incentive to the leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un.It was pretty familiar Trump language, born of a certainty that economic incentives will overcome ethnic, tribal and religious differences, despite considerable evidence to the contrary. And for the Israeli prime minister, it was a plan tailor-made for an election four weeks away. So tailor-made that a dozen Democratic senators wrote in a letter to Mr. Trump on Tuesday that ""the timing of this proposal to coincide with Prime Minister Netanyahu's indictment on bribery charges also raises disturbing questions about your intention to intervene in the Israeli election process.""Not surprisingly, Mr. Netanyahu disagreed. ""It's a great plan for Israel,"" he said, with an enthusiasm he rarely showed during visits to the White House in the Obama years. ""It's a great plan for peace.""PhotographPresident Trump with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel at the White House on Tuesday.

| Jump to first hitThe recording from a dinner in 2018 showed that the president spent an hour with two key players in the Ukraine pressure campaign. He has repeatedly said he does not know them.WASHINGTON -- For more than an hour one evening in 2018, President Trump sat around a dinner table in a private suite in his Washington hotel with a group of donors, including two men at the center of the impeachment inquiry, talking about golf, trade, politics -- and removing the United States ambassador to Ukraine.The conversation, captured on a recording made public Saturday, contradicted Mr. Trump's repeated statements that he does not know the two men, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who went on to work with the president's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani to carry out a pressure campaign on Ukraine.The recording -- a video shot on Mr. Fruman's phone during the dinner in April 2018 -- largely confirmed Mr. Parnas's account of having raised with Mr. Trump criticisms of the ambassador to Kyiv at the time, Marie L. Yovanovitch, and the president's immediate order that Ms. Yovanovitch should be removed from the post.""Get rid of her,"" Mr. Trump can be heard responding.The recording was made public by Mr. Parnas's lawyer, Joseph A. Bondy, hours after the president's lawyers began presenting their defense in the impeachment trial and as Democrats looked for leverage to persuade Republicans to support their calls to expand the inquiry by introducing additional evidence and calling new witnesses.Mr. Bondy said it was being released in ""an effort to provide clarity to the American people and the Senate as to the need to conduct a fair trial, with witnesses and evidence.""In the recording, Mr. Parnas, who is the more talkative of the two, broached an energy deal the two were pursuing in Ukraine, and then went on to discuss several themes that later became central to the pressure campaign. He claimed that Ms. Yovanovitch, whose name he did not cite, had been disparaging Mr. Trump. He said that the Ukrainians ""were supporting the Clintons all these years."" He even mentioned in passing the family of the former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.The recording does not appear to introduce substantive new information about the effort to oust Ms. Yovanovitch.But it does seem to shed light on the origins of Mr. Trump's interest in the issue, and to foreshadow his administration's withholding of military assistance from the country as part of the pressure campaign. It hints at the motivations of Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman, who had come to believe that Ms. Yovanovitch was opposed to their business plans in Ukraine, where they had tried to break into the natural gas market, according to associates of the two men, both of whom are Soviet-born American citizens.And it provides a glimpse of something rarely seen: top-tier political donors getting a chance in an intimate setting to share their views with the president and press their agendas with him.During the dinner, Mr. Trump lashed out at the European Union for trying to ""screw"" the United States, assailed the World Trade Organization as a ""weapon"" intended to harm America and lamented the ""globalists"" around him who do not care if manufacturing plants shutter.Democrats are seeking Mr. Trump's removal from office on the grounds that he abused his power by pressing Ukraine to investigate targets of the president, including Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter Biden. Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman worked closely with Mr. Giuliani in seeking information and making contacts in Ukraine in support of the effort, starting months after the April 2018 dinner.For most of the recording, the camera is pointed at the ceiling but the audio is clear. Early in the recording, Mr. Trump can be seen as he enters the private room at the Trump International Hotel in Washington on April 30, 2018.The existence and some of the conversation in the recording were first reported by ABC News on Friday.The effort to oust Ms. Yovanovitch would later become directly linked to the broader pressure campaign on Ukraine waged by Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman. Evidence provided to House investigators showed that Mr. Parnas was in regular contact last year with Ukraine's chief prosecutor, who also wanted Ms. Yovanovitch replaced, and seemed to be willing to trade investigations of Mr. Biden for her removal and other signs of support from the Trump administration.By the time of the dinner with Mr. Trump, Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman already saw Ms. Yovanovitch as an impediment to their efforts to get into the energy business in Ukraine.In the full recording released on Saturday, Mr. Parnas can be heard telling Mr. Trump that he and Mr. Fruman ""are in the process of purchasing an energy company in Ukraine right now.""Mr. Trump responds, ""How's Ukraine doing?"" then quickly adds, ""Don't answer,"" prompting laughter in the room.After some conversation about Ukraine's war with its hostile neighbor, Russia, and its efforts to establish energy security, Mr. Trump asked, ""How long would they last in a fight with Russia?""""I don't think very long,"" Mr. Parnas responded. ""Without us, not very long,"" adding ""they feel they're going to be O.K. if you support them.""Mr. Parnas continued by saying that ""the biggest problem is corruption there,"" and later added Ms. Yovanovitch, though not by name, to a list of issues Mr. Trump should address in Ukraine.""The biggest problem there, I think, where we, where you, need to start is we got to get rid of the ambassador,"" he said. ""She's basically walking around telling everybody, 'Wait, he's going to get impeached, just wait.""'The remark prompted laughter in the room.Mr. Trump asked for the ambassador's name. Mr. Fruman said, ""I don't remember."" Mr. Trump, sounding stern, then said: ""Get rid of her. Get her out tomorrow. I don't care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. O.K.? Do it.""Those comments were directed at one of Mr. Trump's aides who was in the room at the time, Mr. Parnas has previously said. There was some additional laughter in the room at Mr. Trump's remarks.Ms. Yovanovitch remained in her job for another year after Mr. Trump's remarks until she was recalled on the White House's orders. It is not clear whether the president changed his mind, forgot about his order or was talked out of dismissing her. Mr. Parnas has recently acknowledged that he was wrong about Ms. Yovanovitch, who has denied ever disparaging Mr. Trump.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Trump has previously acknowledged that he had problems with Ms. Yovanovitch but has defended his actions as appropriate, given that presidents have the right to name and replace ambassadors as they see fit.Mr. Parnas and Mr. Fruman gained access to the dinner, which was organized by a pro-Trump super PAC, America First Action, by pledging to donate $1 million to the group.The month after the event, they donated $325,000 to the group through a company they had recently formed to pursue energy deals called Global Energy Producers.At the beginning of the video, the person holding the phone walks around the private suite filming chatter among the guests, who included Donald Trump Jr., Jack Nicklaus III, the grandson and namesake of the legendary golfer, and Barry Zekelman, a Canadian billionaire whose steel business is mostly in the United States.Later, Mr. Trump said to attendees, ""This is all sort of, like, off the record, right?""During the dinner, attendees fawned over Mr. Trump and seemed to revel in their ability to ask him for direct help with business issues.In the meandering conversation, Mr. Trump defended the aggressive actions he was taking against China and explained that he overruled advisers who urged him to take a softer approach because the United States was already so deeply on the losing end of the relationship.""They're tough, but I always say when you're $500 billion down, you can't lose the trade war,"" Mr. Trump said, referring to the bilateral trade deficit the United States runs with China.Mr. Trump, who has since reached a trade truce with China, foreshadowed his next big trade fight, taking aim at the European Union.""The European Union is a group of countries that got together to screw the United States, it's as simple as that,"" Mr. Trump said, adding that such a notion is surprising because ""we're all sort of from there, right?""The conversation came just one month after Mr. Trump had slapped tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, including metals imported from Europe.At the dinner, Mr. Trump repeatedly praised the tariffs, though he occasionally expressed concern that they could reduce the amount of available metals. ""I don't want to be at a point where we don't have enough steel in this country,"" he said. A few minutes later, he added, ""You're going to see prices go up. Hopefully not too much.""It has been a decade since legal changes paved the way for unlimited donations to super PACs, making such gatherings an even more explicit demonstration of how a large political payment can turn into access to push a special interest.The donors competed for time to walk through their sometimes conflicting issues, one by one, pitching the president to take up their causes almost as if they were on ""Shark Tank,"" the reality television show, looking for investors in their ideas.Mr. Zekelman, a Canadian citizen who owns a steel tube manufacturing company that donated $1.75 million to the political action committee supporting Mr. Trump, pushed the president on what he saw as the top two challenges facing his company: cheap steel tube imports from Asia and new federal rules that make it harder to find truck drivers.He first urged Mr. Trump to go even further in his effort to limit steel imports to the United States, and he then questioned the rules intended to prevent fatal truck accidents by using electronic monitoring systems to limit how many hours drivers can be on the road.Since that dinner, legislation has been introduced in the House with the co-sponsorship of 12 Republicans, including the brother of Vice President Mike Pence, to allow smaller trucking companies to get exemptions from the rule.Mr. Zekelman is not legally allowed under federal law to make a contribution to the political action committee. So his company donated the money through one of its subsidiaries based in the United States, a maneuver that has generated a complaint with the Federal Election Commission that he might have violated federal election law, after The New York Times wrote about the donations last year.One attendee told Mr. Trump that he operates a company that supplies trucks powered by compressed natural gas and urged Mr. Trump to take steps to make the business more competitive with electric powered trucks or cars.Another, who said he runs a company that does business with the United States Postal Service, pushed Mr. Trump to consider backing the construction of a 500-mile section of highway in the United States that would be used exclusively by self-driving trucks. Paying truck drivers, he said, is one of his company's biggest costs.""All the technology is there, right now,"" he said. ""It is absolutely safe.""Mr. Parnas did not limit his efforts to influence Mr. Trump to Ukraine. He can be heard trying to engage Mr. Trump about issues related to another business venture he would go on to pursue -- a plan to win marijuana retail licenses in Nevada and elsewhere.He appeared to ask Mr. Trump to consider changing regulations that banks have said made it difficult for them to process transactions related to the cannabis business.""Have you thought about allowing banking in some of these states that allow cannabis?"" Mr. Parnas asked.""What?"" Mr. Trump responded. ""You can't do banking there?""Mr. Parnas said banking regulations were ""the biggest problem"" for the industry, and argued that the issue could help Mr. Trump politically. If the president created a bipartisan committee to study it, Mr. Parnas argued ""you can know what's going on, and make the right decision. By just putting the committee together, it will give you such a boost in the midterm with a lot of the millennials.""Mr. Trump expressed some skepticism, saying marijuana use has led to ""more accidents"" and asserting ""it does cause an I.Q. problem.""But Donald Trump Jr. seemed more agreeable, arguing ""between that and alcohol, as far as I'm concerned alcohol does much more damage,"" and asserting ""you don't see people beating their wives on marijuana. It's just different.""A spokesman for the younger Mr. Trump did not respond to a request for comment.In the months after the dinner, Mr. Parnas, Mr. Fruman and two associates tried to enlist political support for an effort to win marijuana retail licenses in Nevada and elsewhere by planning to spend $1 million to $2 million for potential political donations, some of which prosecutors say was funded by a Russian investor, according to an indictment against the men.They have pleaded not guilty.Kenneth P. Vogel reported from Washington, and Ben Protess from New York. Alan Rappeport, Jim Tankersley and Eric Lipton contributed reporting from Washington.PhotographPresident Trump called for the removal of Marie L.
