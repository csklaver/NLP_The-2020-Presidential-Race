A Democrat in Michigan scrolled through a surge of nasty Facebook memes about Sen. Elizabeth Warren last week before fixing on one that captured his growing dislike of the candidate. It depicted her smiling face as a mask. Behind it was Hillary Clinton.
Matt Walters, 64, a retired factory worker and supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), shared the image onward to eight Facebook groups and tens of thousands of potential eyeballs with a few taps on his smartphone "" using a popular new mass-posting technique that allows ordinary Americans to operate with rapid-fire speed reminiscent of Russian bots and trolls in 2016.
In that small way, Walters contributed to a massive wave of hostile memes about Sanders's Democratic rivals that both reflects the rising divisiveness in the party's nominating contest and, in the view of social media experts, exacerbates it.
'I'd call it a force multiplier,' Walters, a onetime union activist, said of Facebook.
The volume and viciousness of the memes "" portraying Warren (D-Mass.) as a snake, a backstabber and a liar "" reflect how Facebook identifies and rewards emotionally charged content to generate reactions from its billions of users. That serves the company's ad-driven business model, which equates engagement with profit. But it also, in the view of experts who study Facebook's effect on political speech, distorts democratic debate by confirming biases, sharpening divisions and elevating the glib visual logic of memes over reasoned discussion.
Facebook's 'algorithm not only aggregates people, it activates people in a way that accentuates extremism,' said George Washington University professor Steven Livingston, director of the university's Institute for Data, Democracy and Politics. 'It inflames passions. It inflames the nature of the discourse.'
Facebook spokesman Andy Stone declined to comment for this story.
Since the beginning of 2019, nearly 3,000 active Facebook pages supporting Sanders have generated more than 290 million interactions "" meaning shares, likes or other user actions "" according to an analysis by Trevor Davis, a research professor at Livingston's institute. For contrast, about 350 pages devoted to former vice president Joe Biden have generated just 9 million interactions; nearly 300 pro-Warren pages come in at under 20 million interactions.
That breakdown is vastly out of sync with projected support for the candidates in polls, which show Sanders gaining ground but still behind Biden in an average of surveys. This underscores a new reality: Facebook gives individual users power over public discourse disproportionate to their authority at the ballot box.
Such outsized influence once required significant resources "" money for printed materials, access to a broadcast studio or time to reach people face-to-face. Now all it requires is a smartphone.
One popular technique introduced by Facebook last spring allows sharing to multiple groups with a few simple clicks on a mobile device, allowing enthusiasts such as Walters to broadcast their views even more quickly than before.
The rising popularity of the tactic among Sanders supporters may help explain the scores of images bashing Sanders's opponents that have appeared in nearly simultaneous bursts in recent weeks, pushed out by highly networked clusters of Facebook users, according to Davis's analysis. He did not find evidence that the campaign itself was involved in this activity, focusing instead on the informal Facebook activity by supporters. 
No other Democrat's supporters are engaged in behavior on a similar scale, which is more characteristic of the online movement galvanized by President Trump. The president's campaign aides have credited Facebook for his victory in 2016, when he poured money into advertising on the platform while also using organic posts on social media to speak directly to his followers, who responded with a torrent of posts backing him and lacerating his opponents.
Sanders has similarly embraced social media as a tool in the political revolution he promises, and his supporters are so devoted that they are described by some as being part of a cult of personality "" though the candidate's posts hardly echo the personal insults lobbed by Trump. And the senator's campaign distanced itself from the online attacks. 'As the senator has said loudly and clearly, there is no room in the political revolution for abuse and harassment online,' said Sarah Ford, a campaign spokeswoman.
The pro-Sanders forums focus on a range of themes, including the senator's independence from corporate interests and his opposition to Trump. At the same time, many of the images that fill the groups and pages are strikingly negative about rival Democrats, depicting former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg as a wine-swilling CIA plant with Republican leanings and Biden as a feckless politician who preys on women.
The meme shared by Walters, the retired Michigan factory worker, was just one of dozens of anti-Warren images circulating recently and one of several that portrayed her as the second coming of Clinton, whose own bid to become the first female president in 2016 ended in division and defeat for Democrats. The version that Walters reposted reached about 500,000 Facebook users on 50 groups since it began circulating on Facebook in September, according to Davis.
The Sanders and Warren campaigns are promising a detente after Warren accused Sanders of saying in a private meeting that a woman couldn't win the White House, and Sanders denied having done so. But the memo hasn't been received by denizens of the digital world. Sanders supporters who are active on Facebook described in interviews growing disenchantment with other candidates and rising concern that the system might be rigged against their candidate.
Already, the pro-Sanders crusade has spawned groups calling for protests at the party's national convention in July should Sanders not emerge as the nominee. #BernieOrVest is their rallying cry, echoing the Yellow Vest demonstrations that have roiled France. In December, an activist wore one of the high-visibility vests for a picture with Sanders, which he proceeded to upload to a group, claiming falsely that the senator had endorsed their movement.
Walters said that before the recent controversy, Warren 'would have gotten my vote if Bernie hadn't won.' Now he's not sure what he'll do in November should another Democrat clinch the nomination. In 2016, he cast a ballot for the Green Party's Jill Stein rather than vote for either Trump or Clinton, whom he had come to distrust and dislike.
As for the enthusiasm Sanders inspires on Facebook, Walters sees a political advantage "" even if it tips into divisiveness.
'It worked for Trump,' Walters said.
Though groups have been part of Facebook for many years, the company began emphasizing them in the aftermath of the 2016 election. That's when Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg heralded the online communities as a more intimate way for like-minded users to connect. He touted the feature not only as redress for the company's missteps but, more broadly, also as a way to 'turn around the whole decline in community membership we've seen for decades,' as he wrote in June 2017.
Changes in recent years have elevated the feature to the forefront of Facebook, including tweaks in 2018 that sought to emphasize content from groups in a user's news feed over other material.
Amid these shifts, groups also have become forums for spam and hyperactive posting, as a cottage industry of tools emerged for more efficiently plastering the online spaces using scheduling and automation technologies. Advice proliferated online for posting rapidly while eluding the platform's spam detectors, which enforce policies against excessive sharing in ways that confuse and anger users.
The hectic pace of memes spreading among Sanders supporters made some researchers suspect widespread use of automation tools and, possibly, a foreign-influence operation. Conspiratorial themes pushed in 2016 by Russian operatives, including claims about corruption in the Democratic Party, have reemerged with a fury.
But evidence this campaign season points most clearly to the frenetic work of aggrieved Americans who, distrustful of mainstream gatekeepers of information, turn to Facebook. There, the traditional guardrails of political discourse don't exist, and individual users can share torrents of divisive memes and other charged content to audiences far beyond the 'Friends' once central to the Facebook experience.
'Perhaps it's not surprising that some of the tactics used by Russian actors against American voters in 2016 are now being used by American voters against each other,' said Philip N. Howard, head of Oxford University's Computational Propaganda Project.
The pro-Sanders users appear deeply linked. The top 72 users engaged in simultaneous posting "" broadly circulating the same content in a single second "" have an average 41 direct connections to others in the same universe of groups, according to Davis's analysis. Connections entail friendship or one user following another. Overall, he estimated that tens of millions of unique users like the pages in question or are members of the groups.
Some of the most active users operate multiple groups and pages, which can obscure the origin of a particular post. The page called 'Woodland Spaces,' for example, features mainly nature photography and evocative poetry, but last week it accused Warren of a 'smear campaign' against Sanders in a Facebook group called 'Bernie's Army of One Hundred Million Americans.'
In other cases, untangling the web of common ownership reveals unseemly linkages. The same page, 'Bernies Revolution Continues,' that owns the 'Bernie Sanders' Rare Meme Repository' group also owns a group called 'The Anti Corruption Movement,' which includes posts about 'satanic Zionism,' as well as positive memes about Trump.
One Sanders supporter who saw and reposted the anti-Warren meme shared by Walters was freelance journalist Cara Rogoff Greenberg, 69, who lives in New York City. With a series of taps on her smartphone, she regularly posted to 'Jews for Bernie 2020,' 'Bernie Sanders Bernstorming Network,' '#BernieOrVest' and 10 others.
Days after posting the meme showing Warren as a mask for Clinton, Greenberg said she was placed in 'Facebook jail' "" the popular colloquial term to describe restrictions imposed by the company, often for posting too frequently "" but remains uncertain about what policy she violated and how. She posted a cartoon of a woman behind bars in the 'Women for Bernie 2020' group.
'At first I thought it was because I was abusing the privilege, sharing to a dozen or more groups at a time, but others have commented on my own timeline (I am still able to post there) that this is happening with contributors to other public Bernie groups,' Greenberg wrote, generating 75 comments and 41 likes or other reactions. 'Is it a technical block intended to prevent spam, or political repression, or FB's concern about uncredited or false info being spread? I am concerned, and have been unable to easily figure out what is really going on here or how long this is likely to last.'
Facebook lifted the temporary restrictions after a few days, she later said.
While aggressive online tactics threaten to divide a party desperate to avoid a repeat of 2016, the online enthusiasm Sanders inspires has been an asset for the Vermont independent, who is vying to compete against Trump, a reality television star with a devoted digital following.
'What are we going to do if Bernie isn't the nominee? That's a question every Democratic candidate should be thinking about,' said Keegan Goudiss, who directed digital advertising for Sanders's 2016 campaign. 'Whether or not the online conversation is real, there's going to be division that's stoked. That's true no matter how emphatically Bernie says to support the nominee.'
While the comparison to Trump's online following is imperfect, Goudiss added, there are plainly parallels, above all the 'cult of personality' energizing Americans distrustful of other politicians, as well as the projection of strength under siege.
Over time, the focus of the meme-making energy has shifted. In January 2019, most of the critical images posted about other candidates by pages with 'Bernie Sanders' or 'Our Revolution' in their names focused on Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), according to Davis's analysis. By October, still several months before Harris would exit the race, she'd faded away as a target.
Meanwhile, whereas Warren once commanded less than 10-percent of the attention, she is now the subject of nearly half of the disparaging memes, Davis's research shows. Examples include a Photoshopped image of Warren in a dark wig. 'With Booker gone,' the text reads, referring to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, 'I'm the only black candidate.' Another shows Warren taking a blade to Sanders's back. Many mock her claims of Native American ancestry, which is also a common target for Trump and his allies.
A spokesman for the Warren campaign declined to comment. The rejoinder from her supporters has been oblique. Repurposing the serpent jibe, a 'Snakes for Warren' account recently emerged on Twitter, with about 1,000 followers.
'There's no fighting back against it; there's only rolling with it,' said Misha Leybovich, a tech entrepreneur and former McKinsey consultant who has been organizing 'Warren's Meme Team,' a collection of supporters with no formal links to the campaign.
He downplayed the significance of the online onslaught, arguing: 'The vast, vast majority of supporters of both Sanders and Warren, and all the other candidates, are great. Most of us just want to see Trump out of office.'
But interviews with owners and administrators of the pro-Sanders groups present a more complex picture. Buck Bewley, who runs a repair shop near Louisville, Ky., would vote for Warren over Trump, but he has soured on the Massachusetts Democrat. So he let the disparaging meme of Warren's visage as a mask for Clinton rack up views and shares in his group, the 'Bernie Sanders Bernstorming Network.'
'We get mad and post memes saying things that we probably wouldn't say in real life,' said Bewley, 53. But he acknowledged how the Internet-stoked outrage could have unintended consequences, possibly estranging other Democrats from the Massachusetts senator.
Or, as he put it, 'I think information is power. It's a ripple effect on Facebook.'

The Democratic presidential contenders faced off Tuesday in South Carolina in the final debate before that state's primary Saturday and Super Tuesday in one week, as Bernie Sanders has emerged as the clear front-runner at this early stage in the 2020 nominating contest.
Below, some winners and losers.
Winners

Sen. Elizabeth Warren: When it comes to debate performances spanning the past two weeks, Warren's have been the strongest. She built a case for being a general-election candidate against President Trump last week by taking the bark off Mike Bloomberg. And she followed it up with a studied and detailed performance on Tuesday. Warren (D-Mass.) picked up where she left off with Bloomberg by pointing to his past support for Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (S.C.) and former senator Scott Brown (Mass.), whom she defeated in the 2012 Senate race. She again argued that Bloomberg had not sufficiently addressed the treatment of women at his company and went after him for doing business in China.
She was perhaps less forceful with Sanders (I-Vt.), saying instead that she would be a better president and going after his staff. 'I dug in. I did the work. And then Bernie's team trashed me for it,' she said. 'We need a president who is going to dig in, do the hard work and actually get it done.' One wonders whether she did much to help herself "" especially given that last week's debate didn't seem to do much for her "" but after the past couple of weeks, she will at least remain on voters' radars.

Joe Biden: He has regularly been a loser on this list, and he was again somewhat uneven on Tuesday night. But he's the leading candidate in South Carolina and a player on Super Tuesday on March 3, and he seemed likely to continue to be after the debate. Biden had some good moments, including in his appeals to black voters, which will be key on Saturday and on Super Tuesday. He noted his work to secure funding for Charleston's port, and he talked about gentrification in a way we haven't heard much in this nominating contest so far. Biden detracted from his performance a little by "" again "" repeatedly complaining about not getting enough time and blaming his Catholic upbringing for his obedience to rules about the length of answers. One thing to keep an eye on, though: When asked whether he would press on if he doesn't win South Carolina, he said he would win. At this point, he better.

Bloomberg's transparency about his money: There is kind of an unspoken bargain at play with Mike Bloomberg. It goes something like this: I may have only become a Democrat in 2018, and I may not be your ideal, but I can win "" and oh, by the way, I have hundreds of millions of dollars from my own pockets to spend. Well, on Tuesday, that bargain came closer to being spoken. Early on, Bloomberg pitched himself by saying, 'I have the experience, I have the resources, and I have the record.' Later, he noted that he spent $100 million to help elect House Democrats in 2018, but for a moment, he almost seemed to say that he 'bought' something with that money. And in between, his ads appeared during the commercial breaks.
Losers

Sen. Bernie Sanders: After the candidates spent much of last week's debate focused on Bloomberg even as Sanders is threatening to take over the race, Tuesday night represented a course-correction. Warren attacked Sanders for being ineffective. Pete Buttigieg said Russia is helping Sanders, as U.S. intelligence has stated, because the senator serves its purposes. 'Russia wants chaos, and chaos is what's coming our way,' Buttigieg said. 'Imagine spending the better part of 2020 with Bernie Sanders versus Donald Trump.' Tom Steyer warned about having the government 'take over the private sector.' Biden mentioned the mass shooting in a black Charleston church in 2015 and noted that Sanders voted against the Brady gun-control bill five times, which prompted Sanders to acknowledge that it was a mistake. Later on, Biden and Buttigieg ganged up on Sanders for praising over the decades the good things authoritarian socialist regimes had done. It prompted Sanders to say early on: 'I'm hearing my name mentioned a little bit. I wonder why.' Indeed. The question is whether it's too little, too late by his opponents.

Mike Bloomberg: It just wasn't much better than last week, which isn't good. Bloomberg did little to make an affirmative case for himself, even on the electability front. And he offered mealy-mouthed rebuttals to some of the attacks against him, including again downplaying the women who complained about their treatment at his companies. Bloomberg said he was 'probably wrong to make the jokes' but added, 'I don't remember what they were.' He called it a 'comment or two.' When Warren pressed him, he said, 'The trouble is with the senator, enough is never enough. . . . We did what she asked and, thank you, we've probably made the world better because of it.' Bloomberg has released three women from nondisclosure agreements and said his company would not use them going forward, but as Warren noted, he hasn't released all of them.

The moderators: There were two big problems here. One was that this was a complete free-for-all for much of the debate, with candidates talking over one another and with no one enforcing the rules. Playing loose can work when it means the candidates actually debate, but many times on Tuesday night, they were just allowed to talk past the moderators and game the system.
Second "" speaking of gaming the system "" was that the booing and cheering were out of control. There's a reason many debates prohibit outward shows of support or dissent: because it encourages people to stock the room and play to the cameras. We don't yet know whether that's what happened Tuesday, but Bloomberg's supporters were especially vocal, and Sanders found himself booed a surprising amount given he's competing for a win in South Carolina.

Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg has vowed to spend what it takes from his billionaire bankroll to help Bernie Sanders win the White House if the senator secures the Democratic nomination. 
But Bloomberg is also on record saying Sanders (I-Vt.) has no hope of victory. 'I don't think there's any chance of the senator beating President Trump,' he said Wednesday in the Democratic presidential debate in Las Vegas.
The contradiction points to the twisted logic that is set to dominate Tuesday's debate in South Carolina. The six other candidates onstage have about a week left to blunt Sanders's momentum, according to multiple analyses by rival candidates. They say Sanders is on track to emerge from the Super Tuesday primaries on March 3 with an insurmountable lead in the delegate hunt.
But after giving Sanders a pass for most of the year, any attacks Democrats launch on the self-described democratic socialist could undermine the party's chance of beating Trump in November if Sanders becomes the nominee. They also risk a backlash from voters who have repeatedly punished candidates who go negative on other Democrats in this race.
'There is always a reticence to want to get on the bad side of someone who is going to be the potential nominee and president,' said Tim Miller, who advised former Florida governor Jeb Bush when he found himself in a similar position with Trump in the 2016 GOP primary. 'With Trump looming, I think Democrats are going to be especially skittish to want to be seen as doing anything that is helping an absolutely loathed incumbent president.' 
The result is that Sanders's rivals have been moving gingerly to shift their messages since he swept the Nevada caucuses Saturday, winning about 34-percent of the vote and 67-percent of the national delegates. Rather than target him over the underlying concern about whether he is capable of beating Trump, they have largely been attacking him from the left, arguing that he is not sufficiently aligned with the Democratic Party's core values. 
Bloomberg and former vice president Joe Biden have circulated archival
video in recent days that shows Sanders defending his votes in Congress to protect gun manufacturers from liability for mass shootings. Biden has also hit Sanders for his past consideration of a primary challenge against 'our first African American president,' Barack Obama, during the 2012 cycle.
'When it comes to building on President Obama's legacy, Bernie Sanders just can't be trusted,' says an online video distributed Monday by the Biden campaign. 
At a rally in Denver on Sunday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) went after Sanders over the more obscure topic of Senate procedure. 
'Bernie supports the filibuster,' she said to loud cheers from a crowd of about 7,000 people. 'I'm going to get rid of the filibuster.'
The other billionaire in the race, Tom Steyer, who is in third place in a South Carolina polling average by The Washington Post after spending more money on the state than anyone else, is expected to make a more targeted attack on Sanders at the debate and in paid advertising before the Super Tuesday primaries. 
'Tom is going to aggressively make the economic case against the socialist policies of Bernie Sanders this week in South Carolina "" in particular, that Sanders policies are bad for the country and bad for working people,' said one aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss campaign strategy. 
The rapid ascent of Sanders, who won the popular vote in Iowa and the next two contests in New Hampshire and Nevada, seems to have taken many of his rivals by surprise. They spent much of past year privately arguing that Sanders had a ceiling of support that would prevent his nomination in a party where a majority of voters consider themselves moderates. 
But Sanders has shown he can broaden his coalition from the 2016 election, winning strong support among Nevada Latinos, who previously opposed him. A broad field of rivals has made it impossible for an anti-Sanders vote to coalesce. The fact that many of them are polling below the 15-percent threshold needed to win delegates has also helped him to outperform his own popular-vote share in the election result that will matter at the convention in July. 
There remains significant suspense over whether Bloomberg will pivot his huge paid advertising budget, now aimed at Trump, to go negative on Sanders. Bloomberg's top advisers view a sustained negative attack on Sanders as one of the only remaining ways to stop him from winning the nomination, especially if Warren does not rise in the polls to take away some of his support on the left and some of the more-moderate candidates do not drop out before March 3.
But the campaign has so far only pivoted with digital or unpaid messaging. Bloomberg's campaign on Monday accused Sanders of being the easiest candidate for Trump to beat and condemned him for not calling out recent vandalism against one of Bloomberg's offices, which was sprayed with the word 'oligarch,' language that echoes Sanders's rhetoric. 
'Trump himself and now the Russians are indicating that Senator Sanders is the candidate they want to run against,' Bloomberg states director Dan Kanninen said on a call with reporters. 'We can't get it done if we nominate a candidate like Senator Sanders, who has just attacked his own party.'
Other Democrats in the party have spoken out more forcefully about the danger they see presented by Sanders, who in an interview with CBS's '60 Minutes' on Sunday praised the literacy programs of former Cuban leader Fidel Castro. 
Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg condemned those comments Monday in a tweet. 
'After four years of looking on in horror as Trump cozied up to dictators, we need a president who will be extremely clear in standing against regimes that violate human rights abroad,' Buttigieg wrote.
Sanders's advisers replied by sharing video of Obama praising the level of medical care and education in Cuba. But that did not mollify leaders of the Democratic Party in Florida, a traditional swing state where immigrants from Latin America hold significant sway.  

'Florida Democrats condemn dictators who toppled democracies across the globe and stand in solidarity with the thousands of people who have fled violent dictatorships in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua,' Terrie Rizzo, the state party chair, said Monday in a statement.
Though most party strategists say it is too soon to tell whether Sanders will be able to compete against Trump in the electoral college, there is little doubt that his nomination would prove a boost to Trump's chances of winning in Florida. 
'There is no question that Bernie Sanders is the least likely Democrat to win Florida's 29-electoral votes,' said Fernand Amandi, a Democratic pollster who worked for Obama's successful 2008 and 2012 campaigns in the state. 'Avowed socialists who have openly praised Daniel Ortega, Fidel Castro, Hugo Chávez and Nicolás Maduro don't tend to do well in Florida.'

Issue-driven race turns personal
Democrats spar over gender, race, finances

INDIANOLA, Iowa "" The race for the Democratic nomination burst into a multifront flurry of attacks and counterattacks on Sunday, as the largely issue-driven contest veered personal just two weeks before the first vote.
The aggression came from multiple candidates on multiple fronts, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former vice president Joe Biden sparring about Social Security while Sanders aides excoriated Biden for his record on race. 
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) criticized Mike Bloomberg for postponing the release of his financial disclosure statements, saying that the billionaire and former New York mayor is 'trying to skip the 'democracy' part of the election' and that voters won't know of potential financial entanglements until after Super Tuesday.
It is all unfolding in the midst of a confrontation between Sanders and Warren over gender and electability, which continued to play out Sunday, when Sanders said he believed gender is an obstacle for any female presidential candidate. 
The pent-up feuds are unspooling at an unpredictable moment, with a quartet of candidates essentially tied in Iowa and trying to mobilize two of the most energized portions of the Democratic electorate: suburban women and black voters.
These dynamics are playing out in multiple early-voting states, including in Iowa, where some 60 percent of likely caucus-goers are still undecided, and South Carolina, with its heavily black population and a Feb. 29 primary, in which polls show Biden out ahead.

'There's still such a large group of undecideds, and everyone's goal is to sway the undecideds into their camp,' said Tameika Isaac Devine, the influential mayor pro tem of Columbia, S.C. 'I don't think anybody would necessarily think it's desperation time yet, but there's a strong sense of urgency.' 
It's unclear how these aggressive attacks will play in a contest where candidates who launch negative attacks are often penalized in the polls. 
One of the most fraught areas of debate has been over the role that gender should play as voters consider who would be best-positioned to defeat President Trump. Warren has said Sanders told her in a private meeting in 2018 that a woman could not win, a charge that Sanders denied. 
Asked on Sunday if he thought gender was an obstacle for female candidates, Sanders replied, 'The answer is yes.'
'But I think everybody has their own sets of problems,' he said in an interview with New Hampshire Public Radio. 'I'm 78 years of age. That's a problem. . . . If you're looking at Buttigieg, he's a young guy, people will say, 'Well, he's too young to be president. You look at this one, she's a woman.' So everybody, you know, brings some negatives.'
'I would just hope very much that the American people look at the totality of a candidate,' he said. 'Not at their gender, not at their sexuality, not at their age. But at everything. Nobody is perfect. There ain't no perfect candidate out there.'
Warren declined to engage in any further debate on the subject. When asked in Des Moines whether being a woman is a political obstacle she said, 'I have no further comment on this.'
'I have been friends with Bernie for a long time,' she said. 'We work together on many, many issues. And that's all I'm going to say on this.'
Compared with the 2016 Republican primary, when Trump mocked the appearance of his opponents and their wives and was ridiculed about the size of his hands, this most recent Democratic contest has been mild. Much of the discussion so far has focused on health-care policy, troop levels in the Middle East and immigration. 
But underlying most of the debate of late is a question of how Trump would use his politics of personal destruction against the eventual nominee, and which Democrat is most equipped to handle that. Sanders has said Trump would launch sexist attacks that could prove effective against Warren. He has also said that Biden has too much 'baggage' that the president could weaponize. 
Biden, meanwhile, has said that the positions held by Sanders, a democratic socialist, would be used by Trump to defeat him as presidential nominee and could also hurt Democrats in down-ballot races. 
Biden has grown increasingly agitated over the tone Sanders had taken with him recently, and had been simmering over a video his rival's campaign was pushing that suggested Biden wanted to cut Social Security. 
In an indication that the attacks were resonating, a voter here on Saturday pressed Biden about his position. Biden initially hesitated to name Sanders, saying that his campaign advisers would probably urge him not to challenge his rival over a video that his campaign had been circulating online. 
'It's simply a lie,' Biden said of a video that showed him lauding Paul D. Ryan for wanting to cut Social Security. 'This is a doctored tape. And I think it's beneath [Sanders]. And I'm looking for his campaign to come forward and disown it. But they haven't done it yet.'
The video did not appear to have been 'doctored' "" which Biden twice claimed "" but it had taken his comments out of context. Biden's campaign has said that he was mocking, not lauding, Ryan's position. 
Still, there are other videos of Biden that show him expressing an openness to considering changes to entitlement programs. 
When Biden was asked during his 2008 presidential campaign whether he would consider changing the cost-of-living increases or the age of eligibility for Medicare and Social Security, he said 'absolutely.'
'You have to,' he said on NBC News's Meet the Press. 'It's "" one of the things that my, you know, the political advisers say to me is, 'Whoa, don't touch that third [rail]' "" look, the American people aren't stupid. It's a real simple proposition. . . . You've got to put all of it on the table.'
Sanders on Sunday acknowledged that the video one of his aides promoted should have shown fuller context of Biden's remarks, but he insisted Biden's record deserves to be scrutinized.
'I think anyone who looks at the vice president's record understands that time after time after time, Joe has talked about the need to cut Social Security,' Sanders said in response to a question from The Washington Post as he left a radio interview in New Hampshire. 'I don't think that that is disputable.'
Asked to respond, Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates called Biden 'a champion of Social Security' and pointed to legislative scorecards when Biden was a senator from Delaware. One group, the Alliance for Retired Americans, listed him as having a 96 percent lifetime score for issues that impact retirees in 2008, his last year as a senator.

Warren has been more subtle, not mentioning her campaign rivals directly. But over the weekend, she also emphasized her proposal to increase Social Security payments.
Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) have generally avoided squabbles even amid the escalating intensity among the other candidates. 
'Now's the time for a closing argument,' Buttigieg told reporters over the weekend in Harlan, Iowa. 'Mine is going to be about not why I think I have the best policy, but why I'll be the right nominee to take on and defeat Donald Trump "" and why I've focused on bringing together not just our party, but our country when the time comes.'
The growing friction played out as the leading candidates descended on South Carolina for church services and speeches that will be delivered on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, part of a frenetic battle for the support of black voters.
Buttigieg spent Saturday scrambling to place the King holiday event on his schedule, and he faced some blunt criticism about why it wasn't on his calendar in the first place. 
Nina Turner, a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign, has tried to poke holes in the argument that Biden is the best option for African Americans. 
In an op-ed in the State newspaper in Columbia, Turner, who is black, excoriated Biden's legislative record, saying he'd buddied up to segregationist senators, worked with right-wing Republicans to pass legislation detrimental to black communities and spread the black-woman-welfare-queen stereotype. 
'Will our community side with former vice president Joe Biden, who has repeatedly betrayed black voters to side with Republican lawmakers and undermine our progress?' Turner wrote. 'Or will we stand with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and a movement that has been fighting for racial and economic justice since the civil rights era?' 
The op-ed sparked a backlash both from Biden supporters and from those who worry that intraparty stone-throwing gives Trump an easier path to reelection. 
Bernice Scott, the influential former councilwoman from Richland County, S.C., who originally endorsed Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and then, after Harris's departure, Biden, defended the former vice president in her own editorial in the State. It was headlined 'African Americans trust and support Joe Biden "" and Bernie Sanders' dirty tactics won't change that.' 
'I'm disappointed to see that Sen. Bernie Sanders and his campaign have taken their eyes off the ball,' Scott wrote. 'Instead of taking the fight to President Donald Trump, they have turned to tearing down their own.'

liberal tide may herald party takeover
Nevada win brings dismay, hostility from moderates

Bernie Sanders has seized a commanding position in the Democratic presidential race, building a diverse coalition that is driving his liberal movement toward the cusp of a takeover of a major political party. 
The senator's ascendancy, though years in the making, is forcing a sudden reckoning in the Democratic Party's hierarchy, as centrist politicians and their wealthy benefactors grapple with the upheaval brought by an electorate not only hungry to defeat President Trump, but also clamoring for radical change.
Following Sanders's resounding victory in Saturday's Nevada caucuses, and with polls showing him on the rise, Democrats are entering a season of open warfare over whether Sanders (I-Vt.) is equipped to beat Trump in what could be a brutal general election. The senator and his allies insist he could, but his detractors say he is too polarizing to win in November "" and could severely cost Democrats in congressional or state races if Republicans use Sanders's self-description as a democratic socialist to paint all Democrats as extreme.
The Sanders insurgency is the culmination of grievances that have simmered for the past decade among liberals who say Washington has all but ignored the problems of income inequality, health-care access and climate change.
'The party has shifted to the left, and I don't think many of the more traditional, legacy leaders of the party got it,' said Andrew L. Stern, a longtime former president of the Service Employees International Union. 'The good news for Bernie Sanders is, he's like a broken clock. He's been in the same place for 35 or 40 years in terms of his positions, and the times have found him.'
A headstrong, 78-year-old senator, Sanders has galvanized his supporters with an unwavering commitment to their shared cause and forceful critiques of the 'billionaire class.' They in turn see him, despite his unorthodox persona, as a weapon against a governing class that has failed them.
On the campaign trail, there is an unusual intensity to Sanders's performances, reminiscent of the energy that built around Trump on the right during his 2016 rise. Sanders has emerged as a movement candidate, with his rallies coast to coast drawing thousands of people who wait for hours to see him. 
Sanders's stump speech is a liberal wish list "" passing a Green New Deal to combat climate change; wiping out student debt and paying for it by taxing Wall Street; raising the federal minimum wage to $15-per hour; reforming immigration laws to protect the undocumented; nominating liberals to the Supreme Court and protecting abortion rights; and, of course, his signature health-care idea, Medicare-for-all, which has become a rallying cry on the left.
'People who have been locked out of power are speaking up about corporate influence over the issues that matter in their lives,' said Abdul El-Sayed, a Sanders ally and liberal organizer who ran unsuccessfully for Michigan governor in 2018. 'What you're seeing is a necessary and natural readjustment in the Democratic Party.'

Sanders's emphatic win in Nevada illustrated his potential to expand his coalition far beyond the ceiling of 25-percent or 30-percent that many party-establishment figures and commentators assumed he had. In Nevada, Sanders won with 29-percent of whites, 51-percent of Hispanics and 27-percent of blacks, according to entrance polls of Democratic caucus-goers. He won a staggering 65-percent of caucus-goers under 30 years old, and he carried every other age group except for caucus-goers over 65 years old, which former vice president Joe Biden won.
'In Nevada, we have just put together a multigenerational, multiracial coalition which is going to not only win in Nevada, it's going to sweep this country,' Sanders said at his rally in San Antonio on Saturday.
'We are bringing our people together "" black and white and Latino, Native American, Asian American, gay and straight,' Sanders added. 'We are bringing our people together around an agenda that works for the working people of this country.'
Sanders's dominance among young people, his supporters say, signals his ability to energize this potentially important demographic in November. 
'Disregard electability,' said Isabel Lozoya, 19, a Texas State University student who drove for an hour on Saturday to see Sanders campaign in San Antonio. 'It should be about picking somebody you really believe in as opposed to somebody you think other people will believe in.'
The race for the nomination is just getting started and remains fluid, with a half-dozen contenders still running, although Sanders has clear momentum after winning Nevada and the New Hampshire primary, while finishing second in the Iowa caucuses by a tiny margin.
The next primary is on Saturday in South Carolina, where the latest polls show Biden leading and Sanders running close behind. The Super Tuesday contests on March-3 may be decisive, with voters in California, Texas and 12-other states determining approximately one-third of the nearly 4,000 pledged delegates to be awarded by primaries and caucuses.

Some other candidates have stepped up their attacks on Sanders in urgent hopes of blunting his rise. Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., has been one of the most aggressive, warning in a speech Saturday night that Sanders as the party standard-bearer could be disastrous for other Democrats on the November ballot.
'Before we rush to nominate Senator Sanders in our one shot to take on this president, let us take a sober look at what is at stake for our party, for our values and for those with the most to lose,' said Buttigieg, who ran third in Nevada following a win in Iowa and a second-place finish in New Hampshire.
Sanders is bracing for a harsher assault to come from his Democratic rivals, including at Tuesday night's CBS News debate in South Carolina.
'To finally be seeing it all start to catch on is powerful, but he knows they're going to throw the kitchen sink at him. He's a realist,' said Sanders's friend Ben Cohen, the co-founder of Ben - Jerry's ice cream and a Vermont-based liberal activist.
Some Democratic leaders are sounding the alarm about the party's viability in the November election with Sanders atop the ticket. House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), an ally of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), said Sunday that Sanders could jeopardize the party's House majority.
'I think it would be a real burden for us in these states or congressional districts that we have to do well in,' Clyburn said on ABC's 'This Week.' 'If you look at how well we did the last time [in the 2018 midterm elections] and look at the congressional districts, these were not liberal or what you might call progressive districts. These were basically moderate and conservative districts that we did well in.'

Still, the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, the civil rights leader who unsuccessfully sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and 1988 with a message about 'economic violence,' said it is clear to him that the party's liberal wing is asserting control.
'They represent the direction of the party,' said Jackson, who said he has spoken recently with Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). 'They're speaking to the pain that people feel. And Democrats are beginning to understand that democratic socialism doesn't mean Eastern European socialism.'
Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, compared the disruptive mood of Democratic voters this year to the right-wing tea party movement in 2010.
'They want to shake things up. There is a sense that things are broken, and prioritizing working families has to be at the center of the economic system,' said Weingarten, whose union has not endorsed a candidate but last week approved its members to support Sanders, Warren or Biden.
Former Wisconsin governor Jim Doyle said Sanders 'definitely has tapped into the kind of youthful enthusiasm and idealism that's been at the heart of the Democratic Party for a long, long time.'
'Democrats are always best when the race is one in which it's change versus status quo, and the Democrats are change,' Doyle added. 'You go back historically to Roosevelt, to Kennedy, to Carter, to Clinton, to Obama. That's how Democrats win.'
Sanders is trying to counter the assumption of many in the so-called Democratic establishment that he is too liberal to win a general election. 
'Some of the folks in the corporate media are getting a little bit nervous,' Sanders said at a rally Sunday afternoon in Houston before an enthusiastic crowd of more than 6,200 at the University of Houston. 'And they say Bernie can't beat Trump.'
Sanders then listed the results of a few recent polls that he says show him defeating the president head-to-head nationally as well as in such states as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Steve Rosenthal, a veteran Democratic labor strategist who has been focused on mobilizing working-class white voters in a trio of battleground states "" Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin "" said it would be foolish to discount Sanders's appeal there. 
'The establishment, which I guess I'm a part of after all these years, seems to know as much about electability as a donkey knows about calculus,' Rosenthal said. 'We always get it wrong. . . . The voters are going to tell us who's electable.'
Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign, said it is expanding its outreach to a broader cross-section of voters.
'He wants to build a coalition like Bobby Kennedy or F.D.R. did "" one that is racially diverse and reaches out to everyone,' Khanna said. 'We're going to make a very concerted effort over the next few months to bring all the wings of the Democratic Party onboard.'
Working to Sanders's advantage is the persistence of several more moderate candidates "" Biden, Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg "" who appear to be competing for many of the same voters and jockeying to survive as the lone alternative to Sanders.
For the proudly liberal and activist wing of the Democratic Party, Sanders's ascent has been welcomed as a potentially historic development. Robert Reich, the liberal former labor secretary and a professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, said this moment can be traced directly back to the 2008 financial crisis, which he called a galvanizing event that led to a surge in anti-establishment fervor. 
'This isn't like 1972,' when liberal Sen. George McGovern (S.D.) won the Democratic nomination and collapsed in the general election against Richard M. Nixon, Reich said. 'In 1972, America's middle class was still growing. What you see here is a middle class responding to not having a raise in 40 years.'
Even if he fails to secure the nomination outright at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee this summer, Sanders is unlikely to go away quietly, aides and friends said. They suggested that Sanders's long run and defiant exit from the 2016 race "" doggedly carrying on with his calls for a political revolution until the final primary, weeks after Hillary Clinton had effectively sewn up the nomination "" was a revealing glimpse into his character and his desire to move the party to the left.
'He doesn't quit,' said Sanders confidant and political adviser Jeff Weaver. 'He's campaigning to win.'

REPORT JOINS word it favors TRUMP
Senator condemns efforts to sway U.S. election
U.S. officials have told Sen. Bernie Sanders that Russia is attempting to help his presidential campaign as part of an effort to interfere with the Democratic contest, according to people familiar with the matter.
President Trump and lawmakers on Capitol Hill also have been informed about the Russian assistance to the senator from Vermont, those people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence.
It is not clear what form that Russian assistance has taken. U.S. prosecutors found a Russian effort in 2016 to use social media to boost Sanders's campaign against Hillary Clinton, part of a broader effort to hurt Clinton, sow dissension in the American electorate and ultimately help elect Donald Trump.
'I don't care, frankly, who [Russian President Vladimir] Putin wants to be president,' Sanders said in a statement. 'My message to Putin is clear: Stay out of American elections, and as president I will make sure that you do.
'In 2016, Russia used Internet propaganda to sow division in our country, and my understanding is that they are doing it again in 2020. Some of the ugly stuff on the Internet attributed to our campaign may well not be coming from real supporters.'
The disclosure of Russian assistance to Sanders follows a briefing to lawmakers last week in which a senior intelligence official said that Russia wants to see Trump reelected, viewing his administration as more favorable to the Kremlin's interests, according to people who were briefed on the comments.
In that closed hearing for the House Intelligence Committee, lawmakers were also told that Sanders had been informed about Russia's interference. The prospect of two rival campaigns both receiving help from Moscow appears to reflect what intelligence officials have previously described as Russia's broader interest in sowing division in the United States and uncertainty about the validity of American elections.
At a rally Friday in Nevada, Trump called reports that Putin wanted to help him 'disinformation.'
'Wouldn't he rather have Bernie, who honeymooned in Moscow?' Trump asked, referring to the senator's travels in the former Soviet Union.
Sanders told reporters Friday after The Post's report was published that he received the briefing 'about a month ago.' Asked why he did not disclose the briefing publicly, Sanders replied, 'Because I go to many intelligence briefings which I don't reveal to the public.'
Sanders offered few details about what officials told him.
'Well, it was not clear what role they're going to play,' he said, referring to Russia. 'We were told that Russia, maybe other countries, are going to get involved in this campaign. And look, here's the message, to Russia "" stay out of American elections.'
Asked why the briefing was reported now, a month later, Sanders said: 'I'll let you guess about one day before the, the Nevada caucus. Why do you think it came out?' Sanders pointed to a Post reporter and said sarcastically: 'It was The Washington Post? Good friends.'
'We report news when we learn it,' said Kristine Coratti, a spokeswoman for The Post.
A spokesperson for the FBI declined to comment. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not respond to requests for comment.
The intelligence assessment that Russia had a preference for Trump infuriated the president. Trump lambasted his then-acting intelligence director, Joseph Maguire, and DNI staff for sharing that information with lawmakers, believing that Democrats would use it to hurt Trump in the election.
The president has been told that the Russians are also trying to sow discord among Democrats and want to influence the primaries, a senior administration official said. Intelligence officials also have told Trump that Russia wanted to help Sanders, the official said, declining to say when Trump was informed.
Sanders has frequently warned about the threat of foreign interference in U.S. elections and criticized Trump for not doing enough to stop it.
'Let me be clear: We must not live in denial while allowing Russia and other state actors to undermine our democracy or divide us,' the senator said in January. 'Russia targets the divisions in our society; we will work to heal those divisions.'
Sanders's opponents have blamed some of his most vocal online supporters for injecting toxic rhetoric into the primaries. At a Democratic candidates debate Wednesday in Las Vegas, Sanders indirectly blamed Russia, saying it was possible that malign actors were trying to manipulate social media to inflame divisions among Democrats.
'All of us remember 2016, and what we remember is efforts by Russians and others to try to interfere in our elections and divide us up,' Sanders said. 'I'm not saying that's happening, but it would not shock me.'
In recent weeks, Sanders's rivals have raised concerns about the behavior of his supporters, blaming them for viciously attacking an influential Nevada culinary union that criticized his health-care plan and said the senator did not do enough to tamp down the online rhetoric of his most ardent advocates.
The senator has responded by distancing himself from such actions, questioning on several occasions whether the online rhetoric was coming from genuine Sanders supporters.
Sanders spent Friday campaigning in California and planned to finish the day in Nevada with an evening rally designed to build excitement for his campaign ahead of Saturday's caucuses.
Despite Trump's skepticism of Russian efforts to damage American democracy, officials in his administration have repeatedly warned that Russia has ongoing plans to interfere in U.S. elections and foster divisions among Americans, part of a strategic goal to undermine U.S. standing in the world. Some analysts believe the Kremlin's goal is to cause maximum disruption within the United States and that it throws the support of its hackers and trolls behind candidates based on that goal, not any particular affinity for the people running.
'Russian attempts to sow discord in the Democratic primary would be consistent with its strategy of undermining Americans' faith in democratic institutions and processes,' said Laura Rosenberger, a former National Security Council aide in the Obama administration who is now an election security expert with the Alliance for Securing Democracy. 'We have seen consistent messaging from Russian sources pushing the narrative that the primary process is rigged, and driving the idea that the 'establishment' favors some candidates over others.'
​'Many of us have been warning for some time that the Russians would likely try to drive divisions and discord in the Democratic primary, as they did in 2016,' Rosenberger said.
Russia has tried to assist Sanders in the past.
In a February 2018 indictment of 13 Russian individuals and three companies alleged to have orchestrated the 2016 social media scheme, prosecutors charged that the group 'engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.'
Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III also alleged that, working with WikiLeaks, the Russian government purposely released stolen internal Democratic Party emails on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in July 2016, so as to exacerbate party divisions and a sense of grievance by Sanders supporters.

A progressive call to arms may also summon the right, warns demographer

No myth is stronger in progressive circles than the magical, wonderworking powers of voter turnout. It's become a sort of pixie dust that you sprinkle over your strenuously progressive positions to ward off any suggestion that they might turn off voters. That is how Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), now the Democratic presidential front-runner, has dealt with criticism that his more unpopular stances "" including eliminating private health insurance, decriminalizing the border and covering undocumented immigrants in a government health plan "" might cost him the votes he needs to beat President Trump. 
Sanders's explanation of why this is not a problem is simple, and he has repeated it endlessly. When a member of the Los Angeles Times editorial board asked him whether 'a candidate as far to the left as you' would 'alienate swing voters and moderates and independents,' the senator replied: 'The only way that you beat Trump is by having an unprecedented campaign, an unprecedentedly large voter turnout.' Faiz Shakir, Sanders's campaign manager, adds: 'Bernie Sanders has very unique appeal amongst [the younger] generation and can inspire, I think, a bunch of them to vote in percentages that they have never voted before.'
This has remarkably little empirical support. Take the 2018 midterm elections, in which the Democrats took back the House (a net 40-seat gain), carried the House popular vote by almost nine points and flipped seven Republican-held governorships. Turnout in that election was outstanding, topping 49-percent "" the highest midterm turnout since 1914 and up 13 points over the previous midterm, in 2014 "" and the demographic composition of the electorate came remarkably close to that of a presidential election year. (Typically, midterm voters tend to be much older and much whiter than those in presidential elections.) This was due both to fewer presidential 'drop-off' voters (people who voted in 2016 but not 2018) and to more midterm 'surge' voters (those who voted in 2018 but not 2016).
Nonetheless, the overwhelming majority of the Democrats' improved performance came not from fresh turnout of left-of-center voters, who typically skip midterms, but rather from people who cast votes in both elections "" yet switched from Republican in 2016 to Democratic in 2018. The data firm Catalist, whose numbers on 2018 are the best available, estimates that 89 percent of the Democrats' improved performance came from persuasion "" from vote-switchers "" not turnout. In its analysis, Catalist notes, 'If turnout was the only factor, then Democrats would not have seen nearly the gains that they ended up seeing … a big piece of Democratic victory was due to 2016 Trump voters turning around and voting for Democrats in 2018.'
Crucially, Democrats in 2018, especially the successful ones, did not run on particularly radical programs but rather on opposition to Trump himself, and to unpopular GOP actions on economic policy and health care (tax cuts for the rich and efforts to repeal Obamacare's protections, for example). In the end, the 2018 results do not support Sanders's theories "" not the central importance of high turnout, nor the supposed non-importance of changing mainstream voters' minds, nor the most effective issues to run on. 
Or take 2016. Many pundits, including Steve Phillips of Democracy in Color, have suggested that Hillary Clinton failed to inspire core Democratic voters "" notably African Americans "" and that a more progressive candidate would have done so (and won). 'The Democratic Party's fixation on pursuing those who voted for Mr. Trump is a fool's errand,' Phillips wrote. But an analysis using data from the States of Change project, sponsored by, among others, the Brookings Institution and the Center for American Progress, indicates that, even if black turnout in the 2016 election had matched that of 2012 (it dropped from 62 to 57 percent), Clinton would have still lost. On the other hand, if she had managed to reduce her losses among white noncollege voters by a mere one-quarter, she'd be president today. That's an issue of persuasion, not turnout.
What's more, States of Change data does not suggest that youth turnout, which Sanders promises to increase so significantly, was a particular Democratic problem in 2016. In fact, young voters (ages 18 to 29) increased their turnout more than any other age group in that election, from 42 percent in 2012 to 44-percent in 2016. They also increased "" if only slightly "" their margin of support for the Democratic candidate. In 2016, the age cohort that really killed Democrats was voters ages 45 to 64, who had split evenly in 2012 but leaned Republican by six percentage points four years later. Sanders's bouquet of unpopular positions hardly seems likely to help the Democrats make up ground among these voters.
But perhaps 2020 will be different if a Sanders candidacy can truly catalyze massive turnout. Then Democrats won't have to worry about persuading Obama-Trump voters or anyone else in the 'swing' category. Wrong! 
As Nate Cohn of the New York Times has noted after scrutinizing the data, it's a mistake to assume that Democrats would benefit disproportionately from high turnout. Trump is particularly strong among white noncollege voters, who dominate the pool of nonvoters in many areas of the country, including in key Rust Belt states. If the 2020 election indeed has historically high turnout, as many analysts expect, that spike could include many of these white noncollege voters in addition to Democratic-leaning constituencies such as nonwhites and young voters. The result could be an increase in Democrats' popular-vote total "" and another loss in the electoral college.
This analysis shreds an implicit assumption of Sanders and other members of the turnout-will-solve-everything crowd: that if they polarize the election by highlighting progressive issues, 'their' nonvoters will show up at the polls, but none of the nonvoters from the other side will. That view is also contradicted by many political science studies. Stanford political scientists Andrew Hall and Daniel Thompson, for example, studied House races between 2006 and 2014 and found that highly ideological candidates who beat moderates for a party nomination indeed increased turnout in their own party in the general election "" but they increased the opposition turnout even more. (The difference was between three and eight percentage points.) Apparently, their extreme political stances did more to turn out the other side to vote against them than to turn out their own side to vote for them.
The turnout equation does not necessarily return positive results for a candidate like Sanders. The reverse is more likely. It is truly magical thinking to believe that, in a highly polarized situation, only your side gets to increase turnout. And if the other side turns out in droves, you might not like the results "" a warning Democrats would be wise to heed.-

N.Va. voters are wary of Sanders but lukewarm on the alternatives

The meeting at the pub resembled a group-therapy session, with participants "" a town mayor, a former school board member and about 15 other moderate Democrats "" sharing anxiety over Tuesday's presidential primary election in Virginia.
They all wanted to know: How is it possible that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) might win the party's presidential nomination? And why weren't they excited about any of the other candidates?
'I don't get it,' Ron Goodes, 74, said to the others at the SideBar pub in Leesburg, referring to how the primary elections have gone so far. 'I don't get why there's such disarray, why there's sniping, why there is less focus on 'what I can do' as opposed to 'how lousy that other person is.' It's just a freaking mess.'
'I can't vote for Bernie,' said Sara Gallagher, 69. 'He's just too left for me.'
In the affluent Northern Virginia suburbs that will be ground zero for Democratic turnout in November, an 'anybody but Bernie' movement is struggling to take hold.
Moderate Virginia voters have turned out in droves for Democratic candidates since the election of Donald Trump in 2016, powering the party's takeover of the U.S. House, both chambers of the state legislature and county boards in booming suburbs such as Prince William and Loudoun counties.
Now, those same voters are bouncing between presidential candidates, hoping that someone "" anyone "" can generate enough excitement to foil a November matchup between Sanders and Trump that they believe would be disastrous.
Some see Sanders as a divisive populist who will turn off independents and moderate Republicans who are crucial in swing states such as Pennsylvania or Michigan. Others, averse to the democratic socialist's calls for Medicare-for-all and free college tuition, say they could stay home on Election Day if Sanders is the nominee.
After canvassing for and donating to Democrats at the state and local level, they are ambivalent, at best, about billionaire Mike Bloomberg, former vice president Joe Biden, ex-South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Their uncertainty was reflected in a Monmouth University poll last month that showed just 1 in 4 Democratic voters in Virginia were sure about whom they prefer "" and that those who back Sanders, as opposed to the rest of the field, were enthusiastic about their choice.
'Moderates are very conflicted about the strengths of candidates in their lane,' said Quentin Kidd, director of Christopher Newport University's Wason Center for Public Policy. 'There's just not a candidate who is as exciting or energetic as, oddly enough, 78-year-old Bernie Sanders is.'
Virginia's long history of across-the-aisle politics makes the state seemingly fertile ground for a presidential candidate who hovers closer to the center than Sanders. In 2016, Democrats in the state chose Hillary Clinton over Sanders nearly 2 to 1.

Yet, with establishment Democratic officials aligning themselves with different moderates "" or not endorsing at all "" Sanders appears poised to take a sizable portion of Virginia's 99 delegates into what is shaping up to potentially be the first seriously contested Democratic Party convention in 52 years.
The same Monmouth University poll showed him locked in a tie at the top of the field with Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who will appear on the ballot for the first time in the 14 Super Tuesday states and has saturated Virginia with campaign ads. Biden and Buttigieg were second and third, respectively.
But while Sanders has since gone on to decisively win the Nevada caucuses, Bloomberg has faced withering attacks on the debate stage over alleged mistreatment of women in his media company and a stop-and-frisk policy during his mayoral term that targeted African Americans and Latinos.
An accompanying tide of uncertainty has rolled through Democratic social media chat groups, debate watch parties and even candidate rallies in Northern Virginia.
Outside a Warren rally in Arlington on Feb. 13, Marguerite Metzler said that 'it's disturbing' to think of Bloomberg, a former Republican, as the only viable alternative to Sanders, whose 'building-the-base strategy' she compared to Trump's.
Though she believes Warren could be an effective president, Metzler, 69, said the senator may have blown her chances of winning in Virginia.
'There are people who like her but haven't liked some of her ideas,' she said. 'And I think she squandered that by building such a strong association with free college and Medicare-for-all.'
After ticking off a list of misgivings over the other Democratic candidates "" Biden lacks energy, Buttigieg is inexperienced "" Metzler, who lives in Springfield, landed on a possible choice: 'Maybe Amy?'

Sanders's supporters don't understand the confusion.
During a recent debate watch party in Fairfax City, Amber Beichler and Isabelle Oldfield happily cheered as Warren and the other candidates laid into Bloomberg, while Sanders emerged relatively unscathed.
Both argued that the senator from Vermont is the only one who can inspire enough passion among Democrats to defeat Trump. They cited the support he has received so far from white, Latino and African American voters worried about climate change, rising health-care costs and stagnant wages in an otherwise robust economy "" all of which Sanders has vowed to fix.
'It'll be that inspiring platform that will get people off the couch and into the voting booth,' said Beichler, 29, of Herndon.
Added Oldfield, 24, who lives in Reston, 'He's actually the perfect candidate to run against Trump, because you need a populist to win against a populist.'
Nearby, Mike Miner, 35, who supports Warren and is also from Reston, was philosophical about why Democrats are anxious about Sanders and unsure about who else should take on the president.
'When you talk to people, their number one issue is defeating Donald Trump,' Miner said. 'You cannot run this experiment multiple times and see which candidate does better, which one does a little bit worse. You're going off your gut. And that's why you're seeing such huge fluctuations in polls and support rising and falling.'
At a Buttigieg rally in Arlington this past weekend, Joseph Brecht, 21, advertised himself as the kind of voter Democrats yearn to win over. The George Mason University student held up a 'Republicans for Pete' sign that drew cheers from anyone who saw it, saying he voted for Trump in 2016 but is now disillusioned.
'I consider myself a moderate Republican, but I'm not a socialist,' Brecht said, referring to Sanders. In November, 'I'm going to try to support the Democratic nominee, but if it's someone I really can't stand, I'm just not going to vote for that office.'
Jill Weiss, 49, showed up to the rally wearing a red Moms Demand Action T-shirt. The group is an offshoot of the Everytown for Gun Safety group funded by Bloomberg that was instrumental in helping Democrats seize control of the General Assembly in the fall.
'It doesn't mean I support Bloomberg,' Weiss, of Leesburg, quickly said. She is leaning toward Biden because of his foreign policy experience but is also open to Buttigieg and Klobuchar. Reflecting on the possibility of a Sanders nomination, Weiss added: 'I always thought I was a liberal Democrat. But everything has shifted.'

Inside the Leesburg pub, the group attending the event organized by the Loudoun County Democratic Committee expressed frustration with that shifting terrain.
The suburb was key in Democratic victories in the fall in the statehouse and on the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors. In 2018, Loudoun also propelled Democrat Jennifer Wexton to victory over GOP incumbent Barbara Comstock, helping to fuel a new Democratic House majority.
Yet that afternoon, there were the formerly energized voters, wearing 'Hello my name is . . .' tags and openly worrying about not having a significant voice in what they see as the mother of all elections.
'I'm seriously contemplating not voting on March 3, which, for me, is really weird,' said Charlotte McConnell, 40. 'I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone.'
Gallagher, who said she is vehemently opposed to Sanders, said she will probably not cast a ballot in November if he gets the nomination. Jessica Puentes, 31, said she will probably stay home if Bloomberg is the Democratic nominee.

Tony Fasolo, 82, lamented the strain that Sanders's 2016 presidential run had on his relationship with his son, who backed Sanders over Clinton and still 'doesn't talk to me too much.'
Kelly Burke, the Leesburg mayor, said that without a candidate who has the same kind of gravitational pull that Sanders has, many moderates feel stuck.
'We all realize what's at stake, in that this election matters probably like no election in the life of this country, and that's why we're struggling,' she said. 'We don't want to make a mistake.'

democrats spar on unity, electability 
Some in party fear contest pushed too far to the left 

CORALVILLE, Iowa "" Making last-minute pleas to an electorate that has remained widely undecided, the presidential candidates powered toward the end of a year-long Iowa caucuses campaign by focusing Sunday on vows of electability and Democratic Party unity even as they offered sharply different visions of what that meant.
On the final full day of campaigning here before Monday night's precinct caucuses, crowds overflowed school gymnasiums and campaign offices around the state as the candidates kept a brisk pace to make their final appeals. But it was also a day marked by upheaval and signs of discomfort among top party officials over whether Iowa's vote will push the presidential race too far to the left. 
On Sunday, even as Joe Biden's campaign aides worked to play down expectations and allies sought to cast doubt on rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), an NBC News reporter overheard one of the former vice president's top surrogates, John F. Kerry, in a hotel lobby speculating over the idea that he would jump into the race. 
While the 2004 nominee later denied that he would run in 2020 "" 'I am absolutely not running for President,' the former secretary of state wrote on Twitter "" he did not directly deny the report that he had speculated about it, with NBC saying he cited as a motivating factor 'the possibility of Bernie Sanders taking down the Democratic Party "" down whole.'
It was, in some ways, a fitting cap to an unusual campaign in which Democrats, after the long campaign here, continue to grapple with which of their many options offers the best chance of defeating President Trump.
The top candidates offered conflicting views of how they would position the party to take on Trump. Biden and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg put forward a more centrist view, Sanders vowed to reshape the party in his liberal image, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) presented herself as a unity candidate residing in the middle of those two camps.
As they made closing arguments to Iowa's voters, Biden and Buttigieg touted their ability to win voters in Republican-leaning districts as a sign they would have broader appeal in the general election. Buttigieg underscored that by citing at one of his last events his favorite Beatles song: 'Come Together.'
Sanders, whose brand of politics can border on uncompromising, made an overt appeal on Sunday to those who disagree with him and focused on the most unifying force coursing through the party: opposition to Trump. 
'No matter what your politics may be,' he told a crowd in Cedar Rapids, 'I think we all understand that that is not the kind of person who should remain in the White House.'
Strategists suggested that the other front-runners "" Biden, Buttigieg and Warren "" were chasing Sanders. But a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll that might have added some clarity with its planned Saturday night release was canceled after technical problems.
Uncertainty and fear undergirded the campaign's final days. Some campaign aides worried that their candidate would be dealt a suffocating blow Monday night. And many voters and even some candidates said they were fearful about the party's divisions at the very moment they hoped Democrats would be energized.
'We better not screw this up,' Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) said Saturday night.
Democratic anxiety has only been enhanced as impeachment proceedings clouded the approach of the caucuses. Trump, who continued to hammer Democratic candidates Sunday on Twitter and in a pre-Super Bowl interview on Fox, is expected to be acquitted by the Senate on Wednesday after debate that begins Monday, further emboldening him with a message from Senate Republicans that they will stand behind him even if he requests political assistance from foreign governments. 
Impeachment has kept the senators who are running for president stuck in Washington for most of the past two weeks. Sanders, Warren and Klobuchar planned to return to the capital Sunday night, and hoped to make it back to Iowa Monday night to address supporters. Sen. Michael F. Bennet (Colo.), who has been campaigning in New Hampshire while most of his competitors were in Iowa, also planned to return to Washington late Sunday.
With a last day of campaigning that was unseasonably warm and sunny, candidates spread out to try to mobilize core supporters and convert as many undecided voters as they could. 
Buttigieg was greeted by a crowd of more than 2,000 in Des Moines. Biden, who can sometimes struggle to fill a room, saw standing-room-only audiences, with 1,100 at one event. Warren's staff had planned for roughly 350 people in Indianola, but more than three times that showed up "" with space so tight that her top campaign advisers were temporarily barred by the fire marshal from entering. 
Warren urged voters not to be afraid to vote for her and her agenda. After three years of the Trump presidency, she acknowledged, fear is prevalent among Democrats. 
'The danger is real,' Warren said to the crowd. 'Our democracy hangs in the balance. And at this moment, you will decide here in Iowa, what do we do? Do we pull back? Do we cower? Do we take the timid approach?' Warren said, drawing an implicit contrast between herself and more-moderate candidates in the race.
'Or do we fight back?' Warren continued. 'Me? I am in this to fight back. That's why I'm here. We fight back. Fighting back is an act of patriotism.'
Sanders skipped across the state, calling for sweeping change.
He framed Monday's caucuses as the start of the 'most consequential election, at least in the modern history of America.' He said his campaign was about beating Trump in November and 'bringing fundamental reform to American society.'
Sanders stopped at campaign offices in three cities, giving abbreviated stump speeches to supporters preparing to canvass for him. It was a change of pace from the large rallies he has held in recent weeks, including a concert that drew an estimated 3,000 people Saturday night. He said the time had ended for simply expressing concerns about income inequality, health care and the environment.
'Now is the time to end the complaining. Now is the time for action. Action is tomorrow night,' Sanders said.
Sanders's efforts to pressure Democrats to coalesce behind him have been made more complicated after some prominent supporters aggressively attacked some Democrats.
In Cedar Rapids on Saturday night, liberal filmmaker Michael Moore, who introduced Sanders at events across Iowa in recent days, took sharp aim at the Democratic National Committee, accusing its leaders of conspiring against Sanders and trying to boost former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg by changing qualifications for future debates.
'They did this because they are so nervous and worried about Bernie,' Moore alleged. A Sanders campaign spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said Moore's assertion was 'totally false.' She added, 'This is a conspiracy theory.'
Buttigieg began the day on a stage where he was introduced by Iowa City Mayor Bruce Teague, who had previously backed Sen. Cory Booker before the New Jersey Democrat dropped out of the race. He made a pointed reference to criticisms of Buttigieg's difficulty attracting nonwhite voters.
'I don't know if you've noticed,' Teague said. 'But I'm black.'
Buttigieg has grown more animated and more emotive of late and his crowds, generally politely supportive, have become more raucous. 
His campaign touted the 27 counties that voted for Barack Obama and Trump as evidence of his effort to reach more than just true-blue Democrats. He suggested that 'a massive American majority' agrees on things like gun background checks or dealing with climate change, and suggested he is the candidate best equipped to activate it. 
Two voters at the Coralville event told him they are Republicans voting for a Democrat for the first time. 
'I'm not trying to trick anybody into thinking I'm more conservative than I am,' Buttigieg said Sunday, in a response to a different voter who asked how he plans to persuade Republicans. 'I can't say that we will agree 100 percent of the time, but I promise we will navigate those differences with respect and that everyone will be heard.'
When a voter told Buttigieg she was planning to vote for a Democrat for the first time and wondered why she should vote for him over Biden, Buttigieg said he was offering 'just a different approach.'
'Every single time my party has won the White House in the last 50 years, we have done it with a candidate who is new in national politics, who is opening a door to a new generation of leadership, and who either doesn't work in Washington or hasn't been there very long,' he said. 'That is how we win.'
Biden began the day courting voters in eastern Iowa, attempting to rally a crowd at a Catholic university by saying he was the candidate with not only the most widespread appeal but the one with the experience to unite a divided nation once in office. 
'We have to unite not only the Democratic Party,' Biden told a standing-room-only crowd in Dubuque. 'We have to unite the country. It's the only way we're going to be able to govern. We have to pull the country together, Democrats, independents, and Republicans. I refuse to accept the notion that we're at war with the Republican Party.' 
That bipartisan appeal, though, was tested later in the day when Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) raised the prospect that Republicans could attempt to impeach Biden because of the work his son did in Ukraine while Biden was vice president. 
'I think this door of impeachable whatever has been opened,' Ernst said in an interview with Bloomberg News. 'Joe Biden should be very careful what he's asking for because, you know, we can have a situation where if it should ever be President Biden, that immediately, people, right the day after he would be elected would be saying, 'Well, we're going to impeach him.' '
Earlier in the day, some of Biden's top advisers sought to play down any results in Iowa, arguing that the impact of a loss for him would be limited and suggesting voters consider the results of the first four states "" not just the first.
'We've never said that we were going to run away with it. We've always said that this would be a fight, this would be a close race,' Symone Sanders, a senior adviser, said during a breakfast with reporters hosted by Bloomberg News. 'We ain't shocked.'
Biden advisers also attempted a difficult task: casting the former vice president, who has led in most national polls throughout the race, as the underdog.
'Since before vice president Biden got into this race "" since before April 25 "" people have been writing our campaign's obituary,' Sanders said, adding that they remained confident. 'Tuesday morning will be no different.'
Former senator Christopher Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who has been campaigning with Biden, also sought to raise alarms about what a Sanders victory would mean to the party's chances. 
'Bernie describes himself as a socialist "" certainly the president will have a field day with that argument,' Dodd said. 'Bernie would have a very difficult time winning the election in November as our national candidate.'
He said Sanders would be unable to campaign with many Democrats and would 'pose a serious threat' to the House majority. 
'I hope no one is offended by that,' Dodd said. 'That's just the reality.'

On the craps table of this campaign, there's a $500 million chip sitting on ""Super Tuesday."" The bettor's name is mike - small ""m,"" according to the visual design of his campaign, like he's your modest neighbor from the split-level down the block instead of a titan of media and finance with estates in Bermuda and Southampton. 
That's Bloomberg. Mayor of New York from 2002 to 2013. Democrat, then Republican, then independent, then Democrat. Purveyor of fancy data terminals. Ninth-richest person in the world. A few months ago Bloomberg saw a moribund field of candidates and thought he could vault his way to the nomination through a delegate grab on Super Tuesday.
So now it's mike, responsible presidential candidate, asking for the car keys as the nation stumbles around.
Is he trying to save the party, or accidentally sabotaging it? Is ""mike"" just a proxy for Bloomberg as he tries to buy the presidency?
""My first answer to that all the time is: What's the right price to save democracy from Donald Trump?"" said Tim O'Brien, a senior adviser to mike, at a Bloomberg house party in McLean, Va., Thursday night. There, Northern Virginians sipped Chianti and canned Perrier and whispered about Joe Biden as if he were an uncle in hospice care (this was 48 hours before his defibrillation in South Carolina). They shuddered at the thought of Bernie Sanders, democratic socialist, for his perceived radicalism and dismissed Elizabeth Warren, capitalist reformer, for her vendetta against mike.
What's a democracy worth? A year ago, before mike arrived on the scene, Bloomberg pledged a half billion to vanquishing Trump. In Virginia, over the past three years, he spent $3.5 million to help flip the statehouse to Democrats, whose gun-control advocates now speak of him with reverence. So far this year, Bloomberg has spent $50 million to pepper online platforms with advertising. Now, mike is in your Facebook feed. He's in your Google search results. Every time you glance at the television, he's there. The 2020 presidential candidates have spent $26 million on TV ads in Texas alone; 80 percent of that was for mike, according to Advertising Analytics. One ad cost $4.3 million all by itself, and said that mike has ""la fuerza para enfrentar a Trump"" (the strength to face Trump).
He's created an entire economy. mike's campaign officially began 13 weeks ago, but already Bloomberg has spent more on his campaign than the Texas city of Arlington (population: 400,000) has in its annual budget. The least senior members of his staff of 2,000 make $6,000 a month (nearly twice their counterparts' wages on Team Warren and Team Sanders). He has deployed an army of meme makers, enlisted mural artists to transform campaign spaces and hired at least one comedian to secretly punch up his speeches. This past weekend he zoomed to Super Tuesday states in private jets to headline campaign events with free booze and barbecue. 
He knows money might not buy him love, but maybe it can buy him like.

""He's the best person to win,"" said Rennea Henn, 71, standing in a sea of ""I LIKE MIKE"" signs at a rally at a former airfield in San Antonio Sunday night. She doesn't like Sanders and that ""gimme gimme"" mentality she believes he instills in the kids. She would happily vote for Biden, but even after the former vice president's boffo victory in South Carolina, she is concerned about his unevenness. ""He said he had four women he wanted to pick for VP, and he couldn't even remember their names,"" Henn said.
Rewind to Friday, when mike hopscotched eastward across Tennessee in private jets: He rallied 1,000 people in downtown Memphis, where a handful of protesters hoisted signs that said ""Oligarch,"" ""What is your price?"" and ""Our Democracy is not for sale."" At a distillery in Clarksville, near the Kentucky border, mike corked a barrel of bourbon in front of a friendly crowd, while a couple of dozen protesters outside carried Trump-Pence flags and signs like ""Mini Mike take a hike.""
""I won't talk until the cows come home,"" mike said inside, pausing for laughter that didn't come. Then: ""They told me that would work in Arkansas."" (He'd been in Arkansas the previous day.)
mike knows he can't land a joke. mike knows that he's not charismatic. mike knows that the New York City Police Department's stop-and-frisk policy got out of control when Bloomberg was mayor, and mike is sorry about that. But he would like you know that he's good in a crisis, that's he a ""pragmatic problem-solver,"" that he can bedevil Trump while consolidating support to defeat him. 
Bloomberg's millions have helped solve at least one problem, which has to do with mike's age. When 38-year-old Pete Buttigieg suspended his campaign Sunday night - thereby stepping on mike's paid prime-time ""address"" on the coronavirus - the top of the field got hopelessly geriatric, with Warren as spring chicken at age 70. At 78, mike is older than Biden by nine months, and younger than Sanders by five, but Bloomberg's $500 million investment has bestowed mike with the appearance of vigor, steadiness and omnipresence. It has threatened to render sentimental and obsolete the retail politics of Iowa and New Hampshire. Americans shop online and buy what's on TV, and that's where mike is meeting them. He never looks tired. 
It has also bought a ground game for the virtual candidate. 

""We've built the biggest infrastructure that Texas has ever seen,"" said Ashlea Turner, mike's state director. On the ground in Texas he's got 19 field offices and 180 paid staffers, including Amanda Salas, 33, who grew up conservative, supported John McCain in 2008, Bernie Sanders in 2016, and now has settled in the middle with mike.
""I gotta look at what people in my electorate are looking at: solid Democrat but pretty conservative,"" said Salas, while door-knocking Saturday in a Hispanic neighborhood of San Antonio.
The mike campaign has seven full-time staffers in the remote islands of American Samoa, according to CNN, as part of a play to lock down the U.S. territory's six delegates. 
Tennesseans, who vote Tuesday, are shocked to be lavished with attention by a Democratic candidate at this stage. mike has seven offices in Tennessee, including ones in Jackson and Johnson City, in largely rural areas on either side of the state that rarely see this kind of action from a presidential candidate. 
Ernest Brooks, a councilman from the city of Jackson in West Tennessee, accepted Bloomberg's apology for stop-and-frisk and praised his economic initiatives for black Americans.
""It's been many, many presidential cycles"" since a candidate set up an office in his county, said Brooks, a paid surrogate. ""Decades.""
 On Friday in Blountville, near the Virginia border, mike spoke in a Trumpian setting: an airplane hangar with a gargantuan American flag behind him. Included in the buffet of pulled pork and casserole were two vats of banana pudding so big that the candidate could've bathed in them. There were a couple MAGA hats in the crowd of 350. A man under one of them was named Craig Widner.
""I don't like hardly any of what Mike Bloomberg stands for,"" said Widner, who owns an insurance business, ""but I do respect that he had the guts to show up in East Tennessee for an event that's probably not gonna work out well for him."" 
The main goal was not to win outright but to walk away with delegates, and to be prepared for a brokered national convention in Milwaukee in July. Last week, popular distaste with this strategy manifested in spray paint (""Eat the Rich"") on the campaign office in Johnson City, Tenn.

""When people make comments that he's buying the election, I'm very put off by that,"" said regional field organizer Kristi Carr. ""Because all I have is awe that a candidate would invest their own money in my home state and my home region that has never had that kind of investment before.""
Out in Kingsport, mike's sole canvasser Friday was a 16-year-old named Carrson Everett. He's the founder of his high school's club for Democrats (membership: 15) and president of the county's society for young Democrats (membership: five). Carrson was originally for Bernie Sanders, but was turned off by his supporters and liked what he heard at the opening ceremony for mike's office in Johnson City. Carrson can't vote, but he can knock on doors.
""I get irritated with Democrats who are not in red areas because I think they feel like, 'Well, I just don't need to do anything,' "" he said while canvassing in Kingsport. ""And I'm like, 'We are working our butts off out here!' ""
Speaking of red areas, did you know mike's favorite color is maroon? You would if you'd went to his ""women for mike"" rally Saturday morning at a hotel ballroom in McLean, Va. Bloomberg trivia looped on flat-screen TVs as supporters feasted on croissants, coffee and speared cantaloupe. Arlington resident Twana Barber was undecided until last week, when she was persuaded by mike's work on gun violence and the endorsement of a former mayor of Alexandria. As for stop-and-frisk and mike's history of sexist comments, Barber said she is a Christian who believes in forgiveness and second chances.
""We've all had a past, and we've all said things that we wish we could take back,"" said Barber, who works in public relations. ""I want to see what he's going to do for us going forward. And sometimes that ugly past makes us better human beings.""
mike was introduced by a dozen women who have been working for Bloomberg LP for years. He took the stage to U2's ""Beautiful Day"" and said: ""Good morning, women for mike. I am mike for women. Nice to meet you."" 
He talked about getting ""it"" done, and getting ""things"" done. He talked about decency, honesty and sanity. He talked about having the resources to defeat Trump.
The price of a democracy - whether one intends to save it or merely acquire a controlling interest - cannot be estimated easily. There are some things money can't buy, they say.
""I know he's done all these commercials on what he's doing for black businesses and how he's promoted women,"" said Rep. A. Donald McEachin (D-Va.), a Biden supporter who has taken potshots at Bloomberg on Twitter, ""but that doesn't relieve the angst, especially among younger voters.""
Enthusiasm. Fervor. Youthful idealism. Bernie Sanders supporters have it, and it's not for sale. One poll of Virginia, which also votes Tuesday, had mike tied for first with Sanders earlier this month; a more recent poll placed him third, with Biden at the top. mike was polling third in Texas, which had the largest population increase of any state in the country from 2018 to 2019. It's diverse, and getting more so: Last year for every new white resident, there were nine new Hispanic residents - a demographic mike has been courting. The state is young and getting younger (median age 34). Each year it inches toward becoming a blue state, and mike thinks he can finally wrest it away from Republicans. 

In Texas, on the final weekend before Super Tuesday, the campaign decided that San Antonio should be home to one of their biggest pushes in the state. On Saturday morning, marine biologist Paige Newman, 55, showed up to Bloomberg HQ and quickly realized that she was the only person not being paid to be there. This was the first time Newman had ever volunteered for a campaign. She wants Trump out and thinks that mike is the most credible candidate on climate change. His candidacy is not a high-stakes gamble, Newman believes. It's a smart bet. 
She walked down Coyote Hill Road and Mustang Ridge, in the northeast suburbs of San Antonio, her phone open to mike's canvassing app. In one driveway was a man with a long brown beard, sleeves of tattoos and a shirt that read: ""So far this is the oldest I've ever been."" Newman approached.
""Nope, nope, nope,"" said Atticus McCoy, 37. America has a rich guy in the White House, he said. ""We don't need another.""
He said he prefers the candidate who believes that billionaires - including Bloomberg, and therefore ""mike"" - should not exist.
""I like Bernie,"" McCoy told Newman, ""but he's never going to win.""

Trump and Sanders tapa deep vein of anger even as villains and goals differ

TACOMA, Wash. - About 17,000 people packed into a concert and sports arena at the center of this port city, pulsating with excitement and anger. They were there to see Bernie Sanders, whose rebellious presidential campaign has been bringing people in by the thousands for months.
Onstage, a city council member gave a speech urging a ""powerful socialist movement to end all capitalist oppression."" An actor accused the news media of slanted coverage. In the crowd, one Sanders supporter hoisted a sign that read: ""Obi-Wan Bernobi - He's our only hope."" Another wore a jumpsuit festooned with pictures of Sanders. A third screamed the names of large corporations and declared, ""You're next!""
A few days later, thousands gathered at the convention center in Las Vegas to express their ardor for President Trump, waving signs, snapping photos and pumping their fists passionately as he took the stage. In return, he expressed his devotion to the Americans who helped elect him in 2016, the ones he claimed everyone else had forgotten.
""With your help,"" Trump told them, ""we're going to defeat the radical socialist Democrats."" He called the crowd ""amazing people"" and declared, ""Under my administration, we're finally taking care of our own citizens first.""
Four years after Trump seized control of the Republican Party with a right-wing populist movement, a new populist crusade has risen on the left, fueled similarly by grievance and anxiety and powered by Sanders's remarkable drive to dispatch Trump from the White House.
Each is motivated by a disdain for elites they perceive as having flourished while other Americans suffered, a rejection of the establishment and the figures who have controlled it, and a contempt for the institutions that over the decades have blunted, as they see it, the success of efforts like theirs.
Their collision in November would be unprecedented in modern American politics, a signal not only of the persuasive powers of the two men at the center of the movements but also of economic and cultural forces that have bent the American political landscape to their benefit.
""At a time when there's no real dominant ideology which can unite people,"" historian Michael Kazin said, ""it's not surprising that people sort of go into their separate camps and find solace and comfort.""
Trump's and Sanders's movements reflect a broader shift across Western democracies toward a politics rooted in passionate emotion and grievance - one that has pushed the Brexit movement in the United Kingdom from little-regarded sideshow to official British policy under the aegis of a prime minister whose public appeal is similar to Trump's. In Germany, a far-right movement has gained influence in government.
Meanwhile, left-wing populism and self-described democratic socialists are gaining power throughout Europe and the Americas, at times replacing an older guard of liberals who embraced globalization.
""Populism is the future of American politics,"" said Stephen K. Bannon, a former top Trump adviser who labored for years to connect Trumpism to global ultraconservative populism. ""The question is whether it's right or left - the deconstruction of the administrative state or democratic socialism.""
As he tried to envision a Sanders-Trump matchup, Kazin said he could recall no parallels in U.S. history. It's a product of a moment in which there is no binding political philosophy, said the author of ""The Populist Persuasion.""
Different villains, goals
There are critical distinctions between the Trump populism that has remade the Republican Party and the Sanders populism that is seeking to replicate that victory among Democrats.
For Sanders, whose movement is based in economic inequality, the culprits are the financial elite, billionaires and chief executives who have succeeded while workers have either been laid off or watched their wages stagnate in an economy where costs are otherwise rising. His events are infused with laments of shellshocked Americans who talk of their struggles to keep up.
The tenets of the Sanders platform follow suit: enacting a Medicare-for-all government health-care system, steep new taxes on ""the billionaire class,"" free college for all Americans and sharp cutbacks in U.S. military interventions overseas - a fundamental expansion of the role of government in the United States.
For Trump, whose movement is based on cultural resentments and who has been accused by critics of stoking white nationalism, the culprits have been immigrants, women and others seen as displacing those who traditionally benefited from the economy's boom times, a group mostly white and male that reflects the president's most avid backers. His supporters speak of their dislocation as job losses have mounted in the upper Midwest and their fear of crime at the hands of the undocumented, even when statistics suggest that those concerns are unfounded.
Trump's solutions have focused on reversing decades of cultural change, including his efforts to ban Muslims from entering the country, build a border wall and pass restrictive immigration policies, and curb the environmental protections that have grown for the past half-century - a vast downsizing of the role of the federal government. (His signature tax plan benefited the economic elites that he has inveighed against, but he has lost little ground among his supporters who don't fit neatly into that category.)
If the policy proposals and malefactors defined by Trump and Sanders differ, some similarities have been striking - from their riffs about trade policies hurting workers and their boasts about crowd size to their taunts against the mainstream wings of their parties. Sanders's current ascent in a Democratic primary riddled with divisions takes after Trump's 2016 triumph in a fractured Republican field, with each securing victories because of loyal, if limited, bases of support.
Shared fury
On both sides, those appeals have honed a sense of shared affliction, even fury. At a recent Sanders rally in Myrtle Beach, S.C., a ""Lock him up!"" chant rose among some in the crowd, one that echoed the signature crowd chant at Trump rallies aimed at his 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton.
The fervor of Sanders supporters has come most sharply into focus at his largest events, which are reminiscent of the mega-rallies Trump held four years ago and has continued to stage as he seeks a second term. No other candidates have demonstrated an ability to fill arenas for rowdy gatherings that feel more like rock concerts than political set pieces.
At the Tacoma rally on Feb. 17, Sanders's enemies were Republicans, Wall Street and most audibly, the top brass of the party Sanders is seeking to lead as a candidate for president.
""The Democratic establishment is getting nervous!"" Sanders bellowed after listing other adversaries he said were fretting over his rise. The crowd roared louder than ever, as if the home team just scored a game-winning touchdown. ""You know what? They should be getting nervous.""
His devotees share his contempt for the Democratic Party. Misty Lopez showed up four hours early to snag a first-row seat at Sanders's rally. The 42-year-old nurse was eager for an ""extreme makeover"" in the United States that she felt only Sanders could deliver - if top Democrats didn't thwart him first.
""It's nice to be surrounded by people with your same values for a little while,"" Lopez said. She really liked his heath-care proposal - ""I've seen people die because they don't have health insurance"" - but worried that the Democratic National Committee would try to prevent Sanders from winning the nomination.
""Hopefully, the DNC doesn't try to keep blocking that,"" she said. (Many of Sanders's supporters blame the DNC for his loss in 2016, although Clinton won more votes and delegates.)
In recent days, Sanders has dropped his usual taunt from his stump speech and instead decries the ""establishment"" more generally - a sign of what some top aides say is his new focus on Democratic unity, following early wins that have vaulted him into the top position.
At the same time, he has stoked disputes with other Democrats. And his remarks about the Democratic establishment fearing his rise bear echoes of Trump, who also relished the nervousness he caused among traditional Republicans.
""The establishment can't believe it. Because they've never seen it happen before,"" Trump said proudly in Iowa late in 2015, as he was romping over a field of more conventional Republicans en route to winning the party's nomination.
Targeting the media
Among the shared targets of Sanders, Trump and their surrogates is the news media - one of the institutions they blame for maintaining a status quo they deride.
As a candidate in 2016, Trump routinely accused television camera operators of refusing to show his large crowds. He lambasted reporters from the podium, often by name. He regularly flings insults at reporters via Twitter, his favorite communications vehicle. Trump has reprised these tactics in his reelection bid.
""You fake news people,"" he said in Las Vegas, pointing at reporters.
Sanders also regularly accuses the ""corporate media"" of unfair coverage, often as he is lauding other workers in stressed occupations. In Tacoma, actor Tim Robbins gestured to the press area after a loud ""Bernie beats Trump!"" chant erupted as he spoke. ""Now maybe the people behind those cameras will start listening to you,"" he said.
Some Trump allies see a recognizable foe in Sanders.
""Sanders and Trump have both cultivated cults of personality around themselves with a fanatic base of supporters. Both are angry old white guys who you either love or hate. There's no in between,"" said Dan Eberhart, a prominent Trump donor. ""Americans love entertainment. And that's what Trump and Bernie deliver.""
But many Sanders supporters reject comparisons with Trump and cast the president as a ""fake"" populist who uses the mantle to cover up his support for the interests of corporate donors and GOP leaders. They also say Sanders, with his calls for justice, is the opposite of Trump on matters of race, immigration and climate change.
Indeed, the racially charged atmosphere of Trump rallies is absent from the Sanders events. Nor has Sanders called for violence against protesters and reporters, as Trump has.
""If Bernie got on that stage [and] talked about murdering families, committing war crimes, punching people in the face, I would leave,"" said Lopez, the nurse.
Crossover hopes
While they have criticized each other in blunt terms, Sanders and Trump are also making subtle entreaties to each other's voters, calculating that there are discontented crossovers they can pick up.
Sanders has often called Trump a ""fraud"" who failed to make good on his vows to deliver relief to working-class Americans. Sanders argues that unlike Trump, he will actually help them. The subtext: Trump fooled you once. Don't let him fool you again.
""He is a sellout to the working families of this country that he promised to defend,"" Sanders has said repeatedly. He contrasted his policies with Trump's, particularly his push for a Medicare-for-all health-care system and Trump's attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
Last spring, Sanders made a campaign swing through the upper Midwestern states that were key to Trump's win. His tour culminated in a televised town hall on the preferred network of Trump and his supporters: Fox News Channel.
Trump, meanwhile, has consistently accused Democrats, without evidence, of rigging the election against Sanders - presenting himself as a sympathetic figure to Sanders backers upset with the Democratic establishment.
""The Democrats are treating Bernie Sanders very unfairly,"" he told reporters on Feb. 23, the day after Sanders won the Nevada caucuses. ""They don't want Bernie Sanders to represent them. It sounds like it's '16 all over again for Bernie Sanders. And he won. He had a great victory yesterday.""
Two days earlier, Trump tweeted that the ""Do Nothing Democrats"" were seeking to block Sanders's nomination. ""It's all rigged, again, against Crazy Bernie Sanders!"" he said, mixing avowed sympathy with name-calling.

As he defends 1980s remarks, Democrats call him naive and vulnerable

The mayor of tiny Burlington, Vt., was back from Nicaragua and eager to share the good news.
The country's Soviet-backed government "" forged via armed rebellion "" was cutting infant mortality, reducing illiteracy and redistributing land to peasant farmers. Its Sandinista leaders, branded terrorists by the U.S. government, impressed him with 'their intelligence and their sincerity.'
 Three years later, Bernie Sanders was fresh off the plane from Moscow, reveling in the beauty of the land and the contentedness of the people. 
And a year after that, he returned from Cuba having tapped into a revolutionary spirit 'far deeper and more profound than I understood it to be.'
With Sanders now surging to the top of the Democratic presidential field, those three-decade-old impressions introduced a volatile new element in the race Monday as rivals reacted to Sanders's decision to defend his remarks, not disclaim them. 
Asked about his favorable reviews of Fidel Castro's Cuba in a '60 Minutes' interview that aired on CBS on Sunday night, Sanders said the communist leader deserved criticism for 'the authoritarian nature' of his government "" as well as praise where it was due, including for 'a massive literacy program.'
'Is that a bad thing? Even though Fidel Castro did it?' he asked.
The comments offered instant fodder for opponents who had already been sharing the old clips and highlighted the risk to a candidate with a track record of sympathy for communist and socialist governments that is unlike any other recent Democratic nominee. 
Rivals seized on the brand-new video to portray the senator from Vermont as naive "" a possible preview of attack lines in Tuesday night's debate and of the barrage Sanders is likely to endure in the general election if he makes it that far.
'Fidel Castro left a dark legacy of forced labor camps, religious repression, widespread poverty, firing squads, and the murder of thousands of his own people,' former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg tweeted. 'But sure, Bernie, let's talk about his literacy program.'
Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg compared Sanders to President Trump, tweeting that after four years of giving dictators a pass, the United States needs 'a president who will be extremely clear in standing against regimes that violate human rights abroad.'

The fact that Sanders's long-ago travels in the communist world have become an issue in the 2020 campaign reflects how unorthodox a choice he would be to lead the Democratic Party.
Sanders has promised to remake the party in his far-left image as a 'democratic socialist,' and he argues that his vision for a political revolution is best exemplified by thriving democratic, first-world societies like Denmark. 
Yet in the 1980s, during the dying days of the Cold War, Sanders indulged a fascination with far more disruptive and divisive strains of a socialist ideology he has embraced throughout his adult life. 
Returning home from visits to some of the United States' most avowed enemies, Sanders offered some criticism but also plenty of praise in Vermont community television recordings. Many of the videos were kept in storage for decades "" including during his 2016 campaign "" and, even after being posted online, have remained relatively unknown. 
Now, Sanders's comments are coming back to life as opponents say his warm feelings toward his hosts decades ago make him vulnerable to attack and reveal a soft spot for left-wing despots. 
'If people are going to vote for socialist candidate Bernie Sanders, they need to understand what socialism means historically. And it's not Scandinavia,' said Marion Smith, executive director of the congressionally authorized Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation. 
Smith recently tweeted a clip from a 1988 news conference in which Sanders lauds the Soviet Union for its chandelier-filled transit stations and its 'palaces of culture.' Smith demanded an apology for what went unmentioned. 
'He turned a blind eye to what was known about the ongoing systematic human rights abuses, the suppression of religious and ethnic minorities, the jailing of dissidents,' Smith said. 'He was very clearly joining the ranks of the useful idiots who believed in the propaganda of the Soviet Union and carried it to the West.' 

Sanders has consistently pushed back against accusations that he was duped, insisting his travels were about building bridges and avoiding conflict. 'He believed then and believes now that issues of war and peace are local issues because they direct government investment away from working people here at home,' the Sanders campaign said in a statement to The Washington Post. 'That's why as mayor of Burlington he focused on Reagan's dirty wars.' 

Sanders is not the first would-be president to confront scrutiny over long-ago travels. When he ran in 1992, Bill Clinton faced questions over a 1969 trip to the Soviet Union. John F. Kerry, the Democrats' 2004 nominee, took heat from Republicans for a 1985 visit to Nicaragua "" the same year that Sanders visited. 
But Clinton was in Moscow as a student tourist, while Kerry went to Managua as a senator preparing to vote on whether to back President Ronald Reagan's plan to spend millions of dollars funding the ruling Sandinistas' rivals, the Contras. While there, Kerry challenged the government over its curbs on individual liberties, and he carried back to Washington a proposal for peace.
The reasons the mayor of Burlington, Vt. "" population 38,000 "" would repeatedly cross the world's great geopolitical chasm are less straightforward.

Sanders's infatuation with revolutionary left-wing movements, particularly those in Latin America, was long-standing, and it became a key feature of his first stint in elected office. 
Sanders has recalled feeling 'very excited' by Castro's 1959 revolution, which played out during his teens. 'It just seemed right and appropriate that poor people were rising up against rather ugly rich people,' he said in 1986. 
As a college student at the University of Chicago, he was a member of the Young People's Socialist League. He spent his 20s and 30s as a radical activist, failed third-party candidate and sometime carpenter. 
But it wasn't until Sanders was elected mayor of Burlington in 1980, at age 39, that he began putting his ideas into practice. 
And while many of his local policies hewed to the conventional "" redeveloping the city's waterfront or attracting a minor league baseball team "" his forays into foreign policy stood out. 
At the time, the Reagan administration was zealously fighting the Cold War. Democrats on Capitol Hill were following along in principle, if not always in the particulars. Sanders saw an opportunity to transform Burlington into a de facto capital for an alternative foreign policy, one that viewed the left-wing revolutions of Latin America less as threat than as opportunity.
In the early years of his mayoralty, that meant organizing a referendum disavowing U.S. support for the military regime in El Salvador and condemning the U.S. invasion of Grenada, which toppled a communist government. 
Later "" once he had proved himself an adept administrator of the city and was comfortably reelected "" it meant travel to countries regarded as adversaries in Washington.
'He was trying to show that we weren't all Ronald Reagan,' said Lauren-Glenn Davitian, a founder of CCTV, Burlington's public access television. 'He was curious. And he was mad about how these stories were being told. He wanted to see for himself what was really happening.' 
When Sanders returned, he also wanted to share what he found with Burlington residents through interviews, news conferences and his own program on CCTV, 'Bernie Speaks with the Community.'-
In July 1985, Sanders was back from Nicaragua having been, as he put it, 'the highest-ranking American to visit them during the celebration of their revolution.' 
It had been six years since the Sandinistas stormed to power, overthrowing the hated Somoza dynasty, and the government had welcomed Sanders, as he described it, 'in a special way.' That meant access to the top leadership "" right up to President Daniel Ortega. 
As Sanders sat in a bare Burlington office recounting the trip "" the sound of what appears to be a power drill blaring nearby "" he acknowledged to his young CCTV interviewer that Sandinista-led Nicaragua was no panacea.
'You walk into houses, and they're not houses like we know in Burlington, Vermont,' Sanders said. 'They are shacks.' 
Health care, he reported, was free. But it was 'terrible. . . . It's not the Medical Center of Vermont there, believe me.' 
On the whole, however, he found plenty of reason for optimism. 'Nobody denies that they are making significant progress,' he asserted. 
He was particularly impressed, he said, by the country's leaders, including Ortega, who is back in power in Nicaragua, having ruled for the majority of the past 40 years. Ortega now stands accused by human rights groups of violent oppression; in 1985, his grip on power was less absolute.
Watching the video decades later, Latin America scholar Richard Feinberg said Sanders appeared to have had 'a rather simplistic' view of the developing world, as well as an overly rosy assessment of Nicaragua's leaders. But the reason for Sanders's attraction, he said, was clear.
'In Nicaragua, he found his equivalents to his view of the United States . . . allegedly a small group of wealthy people at the top versus the struggling, noble poor,' said Feinberg, who teaches at the University of California at San Diego and was a national security official during the Clinton administration.
Sanders's visit to the Soviet Union in the late spring of 1988 offered a more complex picture. The CCTV video marking the trip "" which was posted online just last year "" begins in an unlikely place: Sanders's sun-splashed wedding on the shores of Lake Champlain. The next day, the newlyweds were off on what Sanders has described as 'a very strange honeymoon.' 
The trip was actually official city business, with Sanders and his delegation exploring the potential for a sister-city relationship with the Soviet city of Yaroslavl.
The Soviet Union was in the midst of a momentous transition "" one that would end with its collapse a little over three years later. 
Speaking to reporters at the airport upon his return, Sanders lauded 'the openness of Soviet officials to acknowledge many of the problems that they have. I went there expecting them to say, 'Everything is great; there's no problem.' That certainly wasn't the case.'
As in Nicaragua, health care was lacking, even if it was free. 'They acknowledge it's 10 years behind the U.S. in terms of medical technology,' he said. 
But Sanders also found much to admire, including investments in culture and 'the most effective mass transit system that I've ever seen.'
So did his new wife, Jane, who was then director of Burlington's youth services department and who marveled at the fact that resources weren't concentrated in private hands. 'They put the money into public facilities,' she told reporters at a news conference.
Bernie Sanders expressed hope that, after 'a dismal history,' the Soviet Union could be redeemed by moving 'forward into some of the early visions of their revolution, what their revolution was about in 1917.' 
William Taubman, an Amherst College historian of the Soviet Union who was living there at the time, said Sanders's comments need to be understood in the context of the moment, which was dominated by then-leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of opening and liberalizing his nation.
'He was not doing what the real suckers might have done, which was to say, 'Gosh isn't it wonderful?' ' Taubman said. 'I don't think he was a dupe.'
A year later, Sanders was seemingly more impressed by his experience in Cuba. By that time, he was on his way out as mayor and was no longer producing new episodes of his community television program. 
But he shared his thoughts with the Burlington Free Press, telling the paper that while the country had 'deficiencies,' it appeared to have solved the sort of problems that still plagued the far wealthier United States.
'I did not see a hungry child. I did not see any homeless people,' he said. 'Cuba today not only has free health care but very high quality health care.'
He had wanted to meet Castro. He had to settle for the mayor of Havana. But the people's enthusiasm for their leader told him what he needed to know.
'The people we met,' he reported 'had an almost religious affection.'-

Some allies of Sen. Bernie Sanders are beginning to map out how he might govern and what his administration could look like if he wins the presidential election "" a once inconceivable concept for many congressional Republicans and Democrats who regard his ideas as impractical.
Independent advisers in contact with Sanders's campaign are informally speculating about who could be tapped to lead key agencies such as the Treasury Department, what legislation would be prioritized and which executive orders Sanders would approve amid congressional resistance to his agenda.
Sanders (I-Vt.), who won the New Hampshire Democratic primary Tuesday after a top showing in Iowa last week, has proposed more than $50-trillion in federal spending and vast new government mandates "" including a national rent-control standard and a ban on exporting crude oil "" that have until recently been far outside the Democratic mainstream.
Interviews with more than a dozen internal and external advisers reveal how his campaign team is squarely focused on locking up the Democratic primary, but his success has led others to try to gauge what might be next. Many of them spoke on the condition of anonymity because the process remains so fluid and many decisions have not been made.
His inner circle of advisers, which includes aides to former Senate majority leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) and a number of Washington outsiders, have not started designing a potential administration. They cautioned that such talk is premature and not occurring in the campaign, which they stressed is focused on winning the nomination and defeating President Trump.
But Sanders's momentum has led allies to debate ways he could put his ideas into action. And as he rises in national polling, Sanders is expected to face greater scrutiny about how he could translate his sprawling domestic policy agenda into legislative reality. His 2020 campaign has relied heavily on outside experts and advocacy groups once confined to the fringes of Democratic politics, while also elevating to key positions those with closer ties to the party establishment.
Some parts of Sanders's policy agenda remain unchanged from 2016 "" advisers say Medicare-for-all and a $15-an-hour minimum wage would probably top his list of first priorities. He has expanded his 2016 agenda by adding policies such as a Green New Deal, a housing guarantee for all Americans, the elimination of all student debt held in the country, and an aggressive wealth tax on multimillionaires and billionaires.
Critics say it is unclear whether Sanders's team is up to the daunting legislative and policy challenges ahead, while supporters see a major asset in their rejection of the traditional Democratic channels and policy priorities.
Sanders has hired three former aides to Reid, who had a knack for holding the line during public debates while also cutting deals with Republicans at opportune times. Faiz Shakir, Sanders's campaign manager, is seen as bringing a steadying approach to the senior leadership of the campaign, while deputy campaign manager Ari Rabin-Havt and national policy director Josh Orton were also brought in from 'Team Reid.'
At the same time, Sanders has retained longtime advisers in key roles. Warren Gunnels, who has served as an aide to Sanders for more than two decades, is viewed as one of the most crucial voices in stewarding his economic policy agenda, in part because of the loyalty Gunnels showed Sanders even when he was a little-known House backbencher from Burlington, Vt. Jane Sanders, the senator's wife, has also helped craft the 2020 campaign's climate and housing policies.
Bernie Sanders's advisers have clashed repeatedly with the major Democratic think tanks that have traditionally driven Democratic policymaking. His policy team, working with national political director Analilia Mejia, has instead consulted with environmental and immigration activist organizations such as the Sunrise Movement and the Center for Popular Democracy. It has also worked with labor-funded groups such as the Economic Policy Institute and the Democracy Collaborative, an international organization connected to leftist Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party in Britain, and new think tanks such as the People's Policy Project, which was founded in 2017 and is funded by small-dollar donations. These groups, regarded as marginal players among Washington insiders, could gain new prominence should Sanders run the table in the election.
Sanders's staff has also increasingly turned to a clutch of economic advisers who have largely flown below the radar, such as Darrick Hamilton of Ohio State University on economic and jobs policy, Tara Raghuveer of the People's Action network on housing policy, Sarah Anderson of the Institute for Policy Studies on business taxes and Carol Zabin of the University of California at Berkeley on Sanders's Green New Deal proposal.
Other economists who have previously had a hand in the Sanders campaign are also a source of speculation, by people who work with the campaign, about roles in the White House or the Treasury Department should he win the election. Some of the most frequently cited names for top economic posts include Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University; Stephanie Kelton, a former Sanders aide who is now at Stony Brook University; Robert Reich, a Clinton administration labor secretary; and Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel laureate also at Columbia.

Skeptics say Sanders's rejection of the typical Democratic policies and institutions may make it difficult to enact legislation, arguing that he has not passed much legislation through Congress during his approximately three decades there. (Sanders has pointed to his record of passing bipartisan amendments through a GOP-led Congress, as well as his recent work with Republicans on the war in Yemen.) Trump faced similar tensions in his takeover of the White House and the Republican Party, with bitter battles erupting routinely between long-standing GOP aides and Washington outsiders who disagreed about his direction.
'You're clearly going to get people with less Washington experience in a Sanders administration, which means they'll bring a fresh eye to new ideas and problems,' said Howard Gleckman, a policy expert at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank. But they 'may also know less about how to get things done,' he said.
Campaign officials defended circumventing the traditional Democratic think tanks, arguing that they are conflicted by corporate donations and millionaire donors from which Sanders is trying to break the party free.
'In this campaign, Bernie and our staff are building policy in an unprecedented, grass roots way: by listening directly to the needs of people and generating plans that will actually solve the problems caused by toxic greed of powerful interests,' Shakir, the campaign manager, said in a statement. 'This campaign is not taking its cues from the same Washington apparatus that has developed policy that for too long has left millions of working people, young people, and people of color behind.'

Asked about Sanders on Tuesday, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) declined to criticize him. Sen. Richard J. Durbin (Ill.), the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate, played down Sanders's showing in Iowa and said 'some aspects of his proposals I just don't think are practical.'







Although many Democrats and Republicans have for years considered a Sanders presidency extremely improbable, his success in Iowa and New Hampshire may give them pause. Some allies also point to how quickly Trump reshaped the Republican Party on issues such as trade and immigration "" and wonder whether a similar realignment would be possible in the Democratic Party.
'If you were sitting there in 1931 or 1963, you could not have predicted what FDR's New Deal or LBJ's Great Society would be,' said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), Sanders's campaign co-chair.

Coordinated attacks come as Democratic rival blasts handling of Iran
President Trump and his campaign have launched their most sustained attacks yet on Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, highlighting the Vermont senator's rising poll numbers and sharp criticism of the White House's handling of tensions with Iran.
In a coordinated string of press statements, Twitter posts and televised digs over the past week, Trump and his allies have trained their sights on Sanders, seeking to tarnish his foreign policy credentials and commander in chief appeal. The attacks represent a shift for Trump, who had previously devoted more of his energy to criticizing former vice president Joe Biden. 
Trump's allies say the president drives the campaign's political strategy, acknowledging that he is an avid consumer of the public polling and the cable-TV punditry that has documented Sanders's growing strength in the Democratic presidential primary. 
Trump mentioned Sanders by name 10 times during his rally last week in Ohio "" more than any other candidate. He continued the attacks on Twitter over the weekend and on Monday, singling Sanders out for more direct criticism than other Democratic contenders.
'Wow! Crazy Bernie Sanders is surging in the polls, looking very good against his opponents in the Do Nothing Party,' Trump wrote Sunday on Twitter. 'So what does this all mean? Stay tuned!'
Sanders, who has pilloried Trump for authorizing the drone strike that killed Iranian Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, had a curt response: 'It means you're going to lose.'
Trump's campaign has released three statements in the last week specifically attacking Sanders on foreign policy, a significant escalation that has been mirrored by top Twitter accounts managed by campaign aides.
On Monday, the campaign accused Sanders of defending 'the world's top terrorist' and 'pushing a naive, dangerous policy of appeasement toward Iran.' Other aides attacked Sanders on issues ranging from student loans to human rights.
Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman, said the focus on Sanders is not a sign of fear of the Vermont senator or any other candidate, arguing that 'Trump would beat any of them handily.'
'Over the last year, the campaign has engaged various Democrats when the opportunities have presented themselves,' Murtaugh said. 'In Sanders's case, his surge in the polls coincided with his emergence as the chief apologist for the Iranian regime. We needed to point out that he would be dangerous as president since he made clear he would appease terrorists and terror-sponsoring nations.'
Sanders, who has been staunchly opposed to America's entanglements in the Middle East, has used the conflict with Iran to draw a contrast both with Trump and with his Democratic rivals. He has accused Trump of abandoning his 2016 pledge to extract the U.S. from costly wars and has made a direct appeal to Trump voters who are disillusioned by the president's performance in office. 
'Bernie, who has spent his entire life standing with the working class, is going to spend every moment of the general election reminding working Americans that Trump was lying when he said he would stand with them and that he would end the endless wars,' said Mike Casca, the Sanders campaign communications director. 'He's the most corrupt president in American history, and Bernie Sanders is going to sweep him out of the White House.'
Earlier this month, Sanders introduced legislation to block funding for military conflict with Iran, something he said would be 'disastrous.'
'At a time when we face the urgent need to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, to build the housing we desperately need, and to address the existential crisis of climate change, we as a nation, must get our priorities right,' he said in a joint statement with Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.).
Sanders has seen his poll numbers rise and his fundraising improve as he has campaigned on bringing about a 'revolution' capable of ousting Trump from office. A poll released Friday by the Des Moines Register and CNN showed Sanders narrowly leading a close race in Iowa just three weeks before the Feb. 3 caucuses there. The survey is the first to have Sanders leading in the state, and it showed that he enjoys support from 20 percent of likely voters.
Sanders raised $34.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, a massive sum fueled by his online fundraising machine that bested all Democratic contenders. 
Some Trump allies have described Sanders's fundraising as an impressive sign of his potential staying power in the Democratic primary. 
And while most of the Trump campaign's recent attacks on Sanders have focused on foreign policy, the president's surrogates have ramped up their critiques of his domestic agenda as well. Aides said they expect the onslaught against Sanders to continue and intensify, as Trump uses the liberal senator as a stand-in for the entire field of Democrats. 
Trump is scheduled to hold a rally today in Wisconsin, a state where Sanders has said his appeal to working-class voters could put him in a strong position to defeat Trump. Last year, Sanders embarked on a 'Bernie Beats Trump' tour to highlight his strength against the president in key states.
'FACT: Bernie Sanders Is A Wealthy, Fossil Fuel-Guzzling Millionaire,' read one statement from the Trump campaign on Thursday, a day after the campaign released a statement saying he 'Can't Be Trusted To Defend American Lives.'
Sanders has cast doubt on the Trump administration's shifting explanations for the strike that killed Soleimani, accusing the president of concocting a reason to conduct an 'assassination' of a foreign official.
'The difficulty that we have, and I don't mean to be rude here, is we have a president that's a pathological liar,' he said Friday on NBC's TODAY show. 
Trump's campaign has responded by trying to brand the senator as soft on terrorism, a scorched-earth tactic that has come to define the strategy of the president's reelection bid. 
'How many American children have to be left fatherless before Bernie Sanders will defend American lives?' Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale tweeted Sunday.
Some of Trump's advisers say they are spoiling for a general election fight with Sanders, describing him as a 'socialist' who turns off moderate voters. 
'I'd rather face Bernie versus Biden,' said Bryan Lanza, who advised Trump's 2016 campaign and transition. 'Let's have the real contrast of who these parties are. Let's have the real debate.'
Trump appeared to egg on a battle between Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Monday, tweeting that the two liberals are fighting over voters. He also turned his fire on former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who has been running ads targeting Trump on health care and other issues. 
'Bernie Sander's volunteers are trashing Elizabeth 'Pocahontus' Warren. Everybody knows her campaign is dead and want her potential voters,' he wrote, misspelling the slur he regularly uses against Warren. 'Mini Mike B is also trying, but getting tiny crowds which are all leaving fast. Elizabeth is very angry at Bernie. Do I see a feud brewing?'

Elizabeth Warren's biggest applause line at Tuesday night's Democratic debate had all the road-tested messaging appeal of a pink-pussyhatted women's march. Gesturing to the male candidates on the stage, she whipped out some math: 'Collectively [the men] have lost 10 elections. The only people who have won every election . . . are the women!' 
The audience ate it up. The future is female! Nasty women! Nevertheless she persisted, and so did Amy Klobuchar!

Surely the moment was planned. Memorizing each of your opponents' loss records could be read as petty, but it got the job done. It dispensed with the sexism question the way we like to see the sexism question dispensed with onstage: breezily, and with a girl-power flourish.
Many female candidates have a go-to line, something capable and Annie Oakleyish that they can pull out for such an occasion; Klobuchar likes to say that of course a woman can beat Donald Trump, 'Nancy Pelosi does it every day.' What else are the candidates supposed to do? In debate after debate, moderators wedge sexism somewhere between Medicare-for-all and the Iran nuclear deal, then set their timers. I
n 45 seconds or less: Is America ready for a female president?
As if that question could be answered in 45 seconds, or 75 seconds. As if we haven't been trying to answer it for years.
The hook this time around was a Rashomon-like conversation that took place between Warren and Bernie Sanders more than a year ago as both were considering White House runs, and which CNN had revealed on Monday. Warren says Sanders told her that a woman couldn't win in 2020, and 'I disagreed.'
In the debate, Sanders denied he'd ever said such a thing, highlighting his track record for supporting female politicians, including Warren herself. Earlier that day, his campaign had outlined his version of the conversation in a statement: 'What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could.' 
Pundits had 


teed this up as a conflict, as if one of the candidates were lying. In 45 seconds or less: how quickly can
 you throw your longtime friend and colleague under the bus?

It's entirely possible that both of them were telling the truth, though. It's possible Sanders believed he was merely warning Warren that the race would be even harder for her, and it's possible Warren believed he was saying something more forceful: that President Trump's skill with weaponizing misogyny made Sanders doubt a female candidate's viability.
It's possible we still prefer our discussions of sexism in politics to be peppy, upbeat one-liners, because the alternative is for them to be messy rehashings of 'whether a woman can be president.' That question isn't ever about the woman but about her potential voters and the moral fantasies we spin about ourselves.

Presumably, whatever Bernie Sanders said or didn't say, he wasn't trying to imply that a woman wasn't good enough to win "" which would be a judgment about women "" but rather that any woman running for president would face a country that wasn't good enough to vote for her. Which is a judgment about society.
In that case, Sanders wasn't saying anything that worried Democrats, including many women, haven't said for months "" the 'electability' argument via which hordes of voters apparently plan to vote for Joe Biden not because they like Joe Biden but because they think their neighbors do. That argument says: I'm not sexist, but in order to defeat Donald Trump, we have to live in the real world, which is.
That argument is reasonable, sort of. If your primary goal is putting out a fire, then your instinct is to hand the hose to the firefighter wearing the most flame-retardant gear. In this case: the candidate protected by his age, sexual orientation and XY chromosomes. That argument is also utterly exhausting. Because it's also saying: I'm not sexist, but my position is that we should capitulate to the sexists by nominating only male candidates until the problem miraculously fixes itself. I'm not sexist, but rather than trying to make the world better, I think we should meet the world where it is, which is to say, in hell.
When is someone acknowledging sexism, and when is someone just being sexist?
That's actually the conversation that should have happened on the debate stage. 
Not Elizabeth Warren firing up a women-take-care-of-business sound bite, but Elizabeth Warren admitting that, yeah, it's actually heartbreaking to have even your good friends tell you that the country won't believe in you enough to vote for you. Yeah, you worry that if you lose, people are going to say it's because you're a woman, and the loss will unfairly impact female candidates for years to come.
Not Bernie Sanders denying that he'd ever even thought such a thing but Bernie Sanders admitting that of course he'd thought such a thing, just like many voters had. He worried that the country would eviscerate a female candidate, as had happened many times before, and he was trying to balance that fear against his very real desire for gender equality in politics.
Not two candidates trying to convince the country that it isn't sexist "" Look at how many times you've voted for ladies! "" but two candidates talking frankly about sexism and our fears surrounding it. 
That's what America needs if it's going to stop enacting the same hackneyed psychodrama over and over. Something like: The only sexism we have to fear is the fear of sexism itself.
Which might be too clunky to work as a rah-rah T-shirt slogan, but it does fit into 45 seconds.

Are his tweets helping or harming Sanders's chances?


ATHENS, Ga. - Just after waking up, Zach McDowell powered on his tablet and searched through Reddit. He picked up his cellphone and checked Twitter. Scanning through the rants of strangers praising and maligning his preferred presidential candidate, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), he asked himself a question: To tweet or not to tweet?
The question itself was new for McDowell, whose tweets defending Sanders used to be impulsive and unthinking. But as Sanders picked up momentum in the Democratic primaries, his critics continued to harp on the aggressive, online swarm of predominantly white male supporters that had rallied around the democratic socialist from Vermont. They called them the ""Bernie Bros.""
""I prefer the term Bernard Brother,"" McDowell said, because it seemed more respectable. As a white, mustachioed 23-year-old just out of college and working a $15-an-hour tutoring job, he fit the description. He acted the part too, occasionally joining in online pile-ons.
Now, McDowell was questioning his rules of online engagement. What if, for once, the pundits were right? The wrong tweet might feed into the stereotype and alienate potential supporters. Meanwhile, moderate Democrats were coalescing around former vice president Joe Biden, who was campaigning on restoring a sense of American civility. 
The criticism of Sanders's online attack squad has been harsh. As she ended her campaign Thursday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) decried the ""organized nastiness"" of some of his supporters, saying he did not do enough to rein them in.
Sanders has

 disavowed the most abusive voices while defending the majority of his backers.
""We have over 10.6 million people on Twitter, and 99.9 percent of them are decent human beings,"" Sanders said at a recent debate. ""And if there are a few people who make ugly remarks, who attack trade union leaders, I disown those people. They are not part of our movement.""
McDowell applauded Sanders's statement, but he also worried the criticism was overblown. He was just playing politics in the way he knew how.
His generation had grown up absorbing the news through ""The Daily Show"" and ""The Colbert Report,"" which intimately intertwined politics and absurdity. And political punditry on 24-hour news channels can seem as aggressive as any battle royal.
The gaming of American politics didn't seem much different from sports or the games he played online. And if that was the way politics was being played, should it not come with the trash-talking, irreverent hyperbole that comes with any other fan base on the Internet?
""I've seen people be just as vicious if you have a fight between Star Wars versus Star Trek,"" McDowell said.
Using a pseudonym and a private Twitter account closed to the general public, McDowell had added to a chorus of Sanders supporters who compared former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg to a rat and joked that Biden's campaign was ""elder abuse.""
When he saw a video with Warren, he searched his keyboard for the snake emoji - a common trope applied to Warren after she alleged Sanders told her that a woman couldn't beat President Trump. ""Hiss,"" McDowell had typed.
On this February morning, he was scrolling through Twitter again. Up came an ad for former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, featuring a montage of the ""Bernie Bros"" supposedly going too far.
The ad included examples of Sanders supporters threatening to ""come after"" fans of other candidates. But those instances were lumped in with a picture of Sanders photoshopped to make it seem like he was aiming a cartoonish gun at the viewer. ""I am no longer asking for your vote. #Bernieorbust,"" it said.
McDowell laughed so uncontrollably his eyes started to water. ""I don't know how I'm supposed to be threatened by this,"" he said. ""It's clearly fake, unless you're so old, and you have no glasses.""
Then came a tweet from an African American political analyst, Jason Johnson, who had referred to some Sanders supporters as ""racist liberal whites"" and ""misfit black girls"" after they attacked him for disputing the idea that Bloomberg is an oligarch.
""This guy has a PhD, and he doesn't understand what an oligarch is?"" McDowell said of Johnson.
McDowell tried to respond to Johnson. But the pundit had already blocked him.
That's when McDowell remembered that, months ago, he had tweeted at Johnson, who complained Sanders's supporters were taking his words out of context. 
McDowell replied: ""shut up nerd."" 
""I was just trying to be funny,"" he said. ""Maybe it is a failed attempt. Twitter is not real life.""

A movement unto itself

In real life, McDowell was driving to a house on a sunny Saturday in this college town where he was meeting with a group of Sanders supporters.
""What up?"" yelled a black woman with a large Afro named Mariah Parker standing on the porch.
""What up!"" McDowell replied. He stepped inside a living room filled with about 15 Sanders supporters, all under 40. Two-thirds of the group were women; one-third was black.
""The Bernie Bro stuff is an erasure of the stories of people like me,"" said Parker, who is 28. Sanders's unlikely political ascent had inspired Parker to run for office herself. In 2018, she became the first black LGBTQ woman to sit on the local county commission, and now she was organizing door-knocking campaigns to drum up support for Sanders in South Carolina.
""Are you all ready to elect the first Jewish, democratic socialist president?"" she asked the group to cheers.
McDowell jumped back into his Hyundai. Joining him were two friends he met in the library while he was a student at the University of Georgia.
""Would you like to sit in the front?"" Lydian Brambila, a 27-year-old student, asked Ryan Vogel, 36.
""No way,"" Vogel said. ""I don't want to be a Bernie Bro."" 
The three laughed. When others used the term, it stung like a slur. But when fellow Bernie fans used it, it felt like an inside joke.
Vogel, who is white and grew up wealthy, resented the lack of empathy some of his conservative relatives had for working people. Brambila was born to Mexican immigrants who worked long hours for little pay and taught their child to believe that the American Dream could be achieved by working hard and doing well in college. 
""The system didn't work for me,"" said Brambila, now a graduate student working a $15-an-hour job and sinking into debt getting treatment for debilitating migraines.
McDowell grew up upper-middle-class, the son of a commercial real estate agent and a stay-at-home mom. He was around 11 years old during the financial crisis of 2008. His father's company went bankrupt, and his parents began to cut back.
 ""My dad would come home, as a shell of a person, and his friends all hated their jobs,"" McDowell said. ""I was terrified in college that was the only way to live, and I was just trying to figure how to mitigate that suffering. And then came Bernie.""
Sanders's 2016 campaign gave the three a sense of relief that their family shame, their parents' exhaustion, their inability to attain the American ideal was not their fault. They believed Sanders when he said the struggles of working people were baked into a system reliant on greedy corporations and reckless lawmakers.
As McDowell's love for Sanders grew during the last presidential election, he became more suspicious of the Democratic establishment.
Problems counting votes during the 2016 primaries led him to believe that the Democratic National Committee and the system were working against Sanders.
""I felt like I was going insane in 2015 and 2016,"" McDowell said. ""All these things were happening, and we couldn't prove it. I just internalized a lot of it, thinking something was going on. Maybe that was the point of it, to make us feel powerless.""
So he began following Sanders supporters sleuthing online for clues that the fix was in. Soon he was reading ""Das Kapital"" and picking up jokes about Karl Marx. He found kindred spirits in a podcast called ""Chapo Trap House,"" a profane political comedy show whose hosts were unabashed Sanders supporters.
They joked that Buttigieg was in the CIA (hence, the rat imagery), mocked the sexual prowess of Bloomberg and became a cultural touchstone on the Reddit pages that McDowell perused.
""It's amazing how as crass and profane as the Chapos are, they are just as easy to show how heartfelt and sincere they are about the politics they espouse,"" McDowell said. ""To write that off as them being 'Bernie Bros' is just an oversimplification.""
This wave of young, radical support online was a movement unto itself, with a lexicon that borrowed from Chomsky and Lenin, potty humor and kink: ""Chud"" was the word they used for an obnoxious Trump supporter, and the ""Neolibs"" were the new generation of establishment Democrats. The art of applying theory to the real world was referred to as ""praxis,"" and to extricate oneself from the struggle was to ingest the ""black pill."" 
Generations of young socialists had longed for the revolution in American politics, and McDowell and his friends were eager to be a part of it, even if they worried it wouldn't succeed.
""Sometimes, I guess I worry that just, like, I'm going to die and not see anything change,"" Brambila said, as Bruce Springsteen's ""Born in the U.S.A."" played in the car. ""Do you think they will truly form solidarity with working people? I fear that I'll be alone. Just me and my advanced opinions.""
""You can't black pill yourself,"" McDowell said. ""You have to also take action. That's why we're going out today.""

Taking the conversation offline
They arrived in a working-class, majority-black area in Greenville, S.C. It was a hilly neighborhood with no sidewalks and decrepit single-family homes surrounded by oak trees. 
The campaign had assigned them to knock on 31 doors, which were all highlighted on a phone app. 
""Hi, I'm a volunteer with the Bernie Sanders campaign,"" McDowell said when a resident answered the door. ""Bernie is a candidate who believes in economic justice for all. Do you know about the primary coming up?"" 
The first woman who answered was a 30-year-old single mother working two jobs. She said she supported Sanders's policies to raise the minimum wage and legalize marijuana. At another home, a medical lab technician in his 40s told them he was between tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Sanders, which McDowell said would make the decision easy because Yang had dropped out of the presidential race. ""I didn't know that,"" the man said.
They continued walking along the street when a Suburu stopped in front of them. There were three older people inside.
""Can you give us some directions?"" the driver said. ""We keep on running into dead ends.""
The driver peered over the car window, squinting through her glasses.
""Y'all are Bernie?"" the driver said.
The Sanders trio nodded.
 ""We are out for Biden,"" the driver said. She seethed: ""We goin' beat you."" 
Then, the car sped off.
""OK boomer,"" Vogel joked. Political confrontation was more awkward in person.
The neighborhood was now in the rear-view mirror, and McDowell was back in his car, heading back to Georgia. 
The political landscape in South Carolina was different from what they had seen online. Over the course of the afternoon, not one voter had asked about Sanders being socialist or about their tweets. Many just wanted to have a conversation.
""They wanted to be treated with dignity,"" said Vogel from the back seat. ""We need to talk to people like they have dignity.""
Vogel's online presence did not always reflect that sentiment. After 2016, he stopped posting serious messages about politics on Facebook. It was ruining too many friendships, particularly when he noted sarcastically on Election Day, ""Who could have anticipated that the least popular Democratic candidate ever could lose to Trump?"" He didn't cast a ballot for president that year, abstaining from choosing between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
""I remember being so mad at you,"" Brambila said. ""How dare you, with the privilege of not being scared, choose not to vote? I was angry and wanted you to feel shamed.""
""I feel bad about it,"" Vogel said. ""A lot of people still aren't talking to me.""
This time around, Vogel tried to keep his political commentary lighter. The soft sell did not seem to work, either. After he posted a meme using a Star Trek character to criticize Warren as a faux liberal, he found himself getting into an online argument with someone who condemned him as a ""cultist"" for Sanders and a ""Bernie Bro.""
Brambila argued that perhaps it was time to take the conversation offline. More success could be found talking in person, like they did while door-knocking. What was there to be gained by piling onto celebrities' feeds, mocking supporters of other candidates with cheeky memes and threatening violence? 
""It's just, now that we might win, maybe we should find ways to be more welcoming,"" Brambila said. ""Maybe it changes our approach, to help find solidarity with more people.""
""I'll be honest,"" Vogel said. ""With all this Bernie Bro stuff, I'm more hyper aware of things I do online. I just am.""
McDowell wasn't so sure he was ready to give up social media just yet. He thought Brambila had a point and that threatening violence went too far. But he found camaraderie online. And he felt some of the criticism directed at Sanders's supporters was not in good faith - designed more to undermine the movement than anything else.
Vogel glanced at his phone. On the Twitter feed: A New York Post headline that Judge Judy vowed to ""fight the Bernie Sanders revolution to the death."" A friend of Vogel's in Hollywood compared Sanders's movement to Trump's. Chris Matthews, then still an MSNBC host, likened Sanders's victory in Nevada to the fall of France to the Nazis in World War II.
""How is saying that okay?"" McDowell asked of Matthews, who had later apologized for the comments. ""That boy ain't right. He needs some milk.""
Brambila apologized to Vogel for trying to shame him for not voting in 2016. 
""I'm no longer 'vote blue no matter who,' "" Brambila said. ""These people don't support my interests.""
""We live in Georgia,"" Vogel said. ""It's not like a Democrat is going to win here anyway.""
""If our boy doesn't win, then it probably means the DNC cheated again,"" McDowell said. ""I think he's going to win. This country is going to see the bigger picture.""
It was dark by the time they returned to Georgia. After dropping off Vogel and Brambila, McDowell wrestled with himself about what to do if Sanders lost the nomination. He considered Trump to be more dangerous than Biden and worried about how a second term might affect immigrants and minorities in this country. 
Twitter might not be real life, but politics was, and dogma had its limitations. Sitting out of the election was a black pill he did not want to take.

Choose your scapegoat: Democrats, the media, the Chinese government, the ""deep state,"" Bernie Sanders or even ""identity politics."" 
All received some share of the blame this week from conservative media figures for the growing public concern over the coronavirus, the communicable disease that has spread across the globe.
In fact, many conservative commentators have expressed less interest in the spread of the virus or efforts to combat it than in the story of the virus - a story they are convinced shows bias designed to harm President Trump.
Rush Limbaugh's, Sean Hannity's and Tucker Carlson's commentaries mixed paranoia, erroneous information and sometimes dangerous conspiracy theories about the virus, which has killed about 2,800 people, mostly in China, where it was first detected.
Trump, who often engages in a feedback loop with allied media figures, has already picked up on one strand of the popular pundits' thinking: that the news media and Democrats have hyped the threat posed by the outbreak. 

""Low Ratings Fake News MSDNC (Comcast) & @CNN are doing everything possible to make the Caronavirus look as bad as possible, including panicking markets, if possible,"" he tweeted Wednesday, misspelling the name of the disease in the process. ""Likewise their incompetent Do Nothing Democrat comrades are all talk, no action. USA in great shape!""
Hannity took Trump's argument a step further Thursday with a focus on the Democrats, who he argued were ""sadly politicizing and weaponizing an infectious disease as their next effort to bludgeon President Trump.""
Limbaugh - who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from Trump this month - was early to tar the media as the villain. The conservative radio titan said on his program Monday that the media's coverage of the virus was ""an effort to get Trump"" and spook investors. (The Dow Jones was down more than 1,100 points Thursday, adding to its drop over the past week.)
During the same broadcast, Limbaugh repeated a debunked theory that the virus was engineered by the Chinese as a bioweapon. But then he dismissed the coronavirus as just ""the common cold, folks.""
Experts say that's not the case. Early reports suggest that about 2 percent of those who contract the coronavirus die of it, making it about 20 times more lethal than the flu. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the flu killed about 34,000 people in the United States during the 2018-2019 flu season.
In view of the uncertainty and risk, the attacks on the news media could be particularly damaging and ill-timed, given that they may undermine sources of reliable information at a time when such information is vital.
China has also drawn suspicious glances from Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who suggested on her prime-time program this week that Chinese officials may be taking some consolation from the growing crisis because it might hurt Trump's reelection chances.

 ""I think they want to use this - I mean, in China, they don't want to deal with Trump anymore, with the tariffs,"" she said on air Tuesday. ""I think for them, the best thing would be if this hurt Trump in his reelection, correct?""
Ingraham also bashed Democrats for ""relishing in this moment,"" adding, ""How sick that these people seem almost happiest when Americans are hurting.""
Among those who came into conservatives' crosshairs this week was Nancy Messonnier, the head of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. During a media briefing Tuesday, Messonnier said an outbreak of coronavirus in the United States was inevitable. The warning quickly turned out to be accurate when reports of the first apparent case of ""community transmission"" of the virus in the United States came out Thursday.
Despite Messonnier's expertise and experience with infectious diseases, conservatives spied a ""deep state"" conspiracy. They called her comments into question because of a family connection: She is the sister of Rod J. Rosenstein, the former deputy attorney general who oversaw special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's investigation of Trump.
Limbaugh suggested Wednesday that Messonnier couldn't be trusted because she's related to Rosenstein, a theme echoed by the far-right, conspiracy-minded Gateway Pundit blog.
 Noting that Messonnier spoke while Trump was on a state visit to India, the Pundit's Joe Hoft wrote Wednesday: ""The brother of the CDC's Dr. Nancy Messonnier, is the corrupt disgraced former DAG Rod Rosenstein. Following in his footsteps, Dr. Messonnier dropped a bomb on President Trump while he was in India yesterday. . . . This was eerily similar to past presidential trips when former and corrupt DAG Rod Rosenstein and the corrupt and criminal Mueller gang would drop shocking news as the president was overseas.""
But the ""real"" threat might be Bernie Sanders, the front-runner in the Democratic presidential race, not coronavirus, according to Fox Business host Stuart Varney.
""The real driver [of the stock market's 10 percent fall over the past four days] is obviously the spreading virus,"" Varney said. ""There's no question about that. But politics is a factor. And if you see a Bernie Sanders presidency or a Democrat presidency looming at you, as the president says, anything can happen in an election. No matter how remote, you're going to get worried if you're an investor.""
Limbaugh also invoked Sanders, judging him more worrisome than the virus: ""There's no question that Bernie Sanders poses a far greater threat to this country and the Democrat Party than the coronavirus - and I mean to say that,"" he said Wednesday. ""The Democrat Party, as it's currently constituted, poses a much greater threat to this country than the coronavirus does.""
The most abstract critique may have come from Tucker Carlson, who blamed ""wokeness"" for misinforming people about the dangers posed by the virus.
""For weeks the media told you it was wrong to worry about the coronavirus,"" Carlson said. ""If you think maybe we ought to take some steps to protect ourselves from it, then you're a bigot.""
""Countless publications wagged their fingers in the face of readers, and told them it was irrational, probably immoral, in fact, to worry more about the coronavirus than the annual flu,"" he continued. ""Identity politics trumped public health and not for the first time. . . . They would let you die before they admitted that diversity is not our strength.""

REPORT JOINS word it favors TRUMP
Senator condemns efforts to sway U.S. election
U.S. officials have told Sen. Bernie Sanders that Russia is attempting to help his presidential campaign as part of an effort to interfere with the Democratic contest, according to people familiar with the matter.
President Trump and lawmakers on Capitol Hill also have been informed about the Russian assistance to the senator from Vermont, those people said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive intelligence.
It is not clear what form that Russian assistance has taken. U.S. prosecutors found a Russian effort in 2016 to use social media to boost Sanders's campaign against Hillary Clinton, part of a broader effort to hurt Clinton, sow dissension in the American electorate and ultimately help elect Donald Trump.
'I don't care, frankly, who [Russian President Vladimir] Putin wants to be president,' Sanders said in a statement. 'My message to Putin is clear: Stay out of American elections, and as president I will make sure that you do.
'In 2016, Russia used Internet propaganda to sow division in our country, and my understanding is that they are doing it again in 2020. Some of the ugly stuff on the Internet attributed to our campaign may well not be coming from real supporters.'
The disclosure of Russian assistance to Sanders follows a briefing to lawmakers last week in which a senior intelligence official said that Russia wants to see Trump reelected, viewing his administration as more favorable to the Kremlin's interests, according to people who were briefed on the comments.
In that closed hearing for the House Intelligence Committee, lawmakers were also told that Sanders had been informed about Russia's interference. The prospect of two rival campaigns both receiving help from Moscow appears to reflect what intelligence officials have previously described as Russia's broader interest in sowing division in the United States and uncertainty about the validity of American elections.
At a rally Friday in Nevada, Trump called reports that Putin wanted to help him 'disinformation.'
'Wouldn't he rather have Bernie, who honeymooned in Moscow?' Trump asked, referring to the senator's travels in the former Soviet Union.
Sanders told reporters Friday after The Post's report was published that he received the briefing 'about a month ago.' Asked why he did not disclose the briefing publicly, Sanders replied, 'Because I go to many intelligence briefings which I don't reveal to the public.'
Sanders offered few details about what officials told him.
'Well, it was not clear what role they're going to play,' he said, referring to Russia. 'We were told that Russia, maybe other countries, are going to get involved in this campaign. And look, here's the message, to Russia "" stay out of American elections.'
Asked why the briefing was reported now, a month later, Sanders said: 'I'll let you guess about one day before the, the Nevada caucus. Why do you think it came out?' Sanders pointed to a Post reporter and said sarcastically: 'It was The Washington Post? Good friends.'
'We report news when we learn it,' said Kristine Coratti, a spokeswoman for The Post.
A spokesperson for the FBI declined to comment. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence did not respond to requests for comment.
The intelligence assessment that Russia had a preference for Trump infuriated the president. Trump lambasted his then-acting intelligence director, Joseph Maguire, and DNI staff for sharing that information with lawmakers, believing that Democrats would use it to hurt Trump in the election.
The president has been told that the Russians are also trying to sow discord among Democrats and want to influence the primaries, a senior administration official said. Intelligence officials also have told Trump that Russia wanted to help Sanders, the official said, declining to say when Trump was informed.
Sanders has frequently warned about the threat of foreign interference in U.S. elections and criticized Trump for not doing enough to stop it.
'Let me be clear: We must not live in denial while allowing Russia and other state actors to undermine our democracy or divide us,' the senator said in January. 'Russia targets the divisions in our society; we will work to heal those divisions.'
Sanders's opponents have blamed some of his most vocal online supporters for injecting toxic rhetoric into the primaries. At a Democratic candidates debate Wednesday in Las Vegas, Sanders indirectly blamed Russia, saying it was possible that malign actors were trying to manipulate social media to inflame divisions among Democrats.
'All of us remember 2016, and what we remember is efforts by Russians and others to try to interfere in our elections and divide us up,' Sanders said. 'I'm not saying that's happening, but it would not shock me.'
In recent weeks, Sanders's rivals have raised concerns about the behavior of his supporters, blaming them for viciously attacking an influential Nevada culinary union that criticized his health-care plan and said the senator did not do enough to tamp down the online rhetoric of his most ardent advocates.
The senator has responded by distancing himself from such actions, questioning on several occasions whether the online rhetoric was coming from genuine Sanders supporters.
Sanders spent Friday campaigning in California and planned to finish the day in Nevada with an evening rally designed to build excitement for his campaign ahead of Saturday's caucuses.
Despite Trump's skepticism of Russian efforts to damage American democracy, officials in his administration have repeatedly warned that Russia has ongoing plans to interfere in U.S. elections and foster divisions among Americans, part of a strategic goal to undermine U.S. standing in the world. Some analysts believe the Kremlin's goal is to cause maximum disruption within the United States and that it throws the support of its hackers and trolls behind candidates based on that goal, not any particular affinity for the people running.
'Russian attempts to sow discord in the Democratic primary would be consistent with its strategy of undermining Americans' faith in democratic institutions and processes,' said Laura Rosenberger, a former National Security Council aide in the Obama administration who is now an election security expert with the Alliance for Securing Democracy. 'We have seen consistent messaging from Russian sources pushing the narrative that the primary process is rigged, and driving the idea that the 'establishment' favors some candidates over others.'
​'Many of us have been warning for some time that the Russians would likely try to drive divisions and discord in the Democratic primary, as they did in 2016,' Rosenberger said.
Russia has tried to assist Sanders in the past.
In a February 2018 indictment of 13 Russian individuals and three companies alleged to have orchestrated the 2016 social media scheme, prosecutors charged that the group 'engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.'
Special counsel Robert S. Mueller III also alleged that, working with WikiLeaks, the Russian government purposely released stolen internal Democratic Party emails on the eve of the Democratic National Convention in July 2016, so as to exacerbate party divisions and a sense of grievance by Sanders supporters.

A Democrat in Michigan scrolled through a surge of nasty Facebook memes about Sen. Elizabeth Warren last week before fixing on one that captured his growing dislike of the candidate. It depicted her smiling face as a mask. Behind it was Hillary Clinton.
Matt Walters, 64, a retired factory worker and supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), shared the image onward to eight Facebook groups and tens of thousands of potential eyeballs with a few taps on his smartphone "" using a popular new mass-posting technique that allows ordinary Americans to operate with rapid-fire speed reminiscent of Russian bots and trolls in 2016.
In that small way, Walters contributed to a massive wave of hostile memes about Sanders's Democratic rivals that both reflects the rising divisiveness in the party's nominating contest and, in the view of social media experts, exacerbates it.
'I'd call it a force multiplier,' Walters, a onetime union activist, said of Facebook.
The volume and viciousness of the memes "" portraying Warren (D-Mass.) as a snake, a backstabber and a liar "" reflect how Facebook identifies and rewards emotionally charged content to generate reactions from its billions of users. That serves the company's ad-driven business model, which equates engagement with profit. But it also, in the view of experts who study Facebook's effect on political speech, distorts democratic debate by confirming biases, sharpening divisions and elevating the glib visual logic of memes over reasoned discussion.
Facebook's 'algorithm not only aggregates people, it activates people in a way that accentuates extremism,' said George Washington University professor Steven Livingston, director of the university's Institute for Data, Democracy and Politics. 'It inflames passions. It inflames the nature of the discourse.'
Facebook spokesman Andy Stone declined to comment for this story.
Since the beginning of 2019, nearly 3,000 active Facebook pages supporting Sanders have generated more than 290 million interactions "" meaning shares, likes or other user actions "" according to an analysis by Trevor Davis, a research professor at Livingston's institute. For contrast, about 350 pages devoted to former vice president Joe Biden have generated just 9 million interactions; nearly 300 pro-Warren pages come in at under 20 million interactions.
That breakdown is vastly out of sync with projected support for the candidates in polls, which show Sanders gaining ground but still behind Biden in an average of surveys. This underscores a new reality: Facebook gives individual users power over public discourse disproportionate to their authority at the ballot box.
Such outsized influence once required significant resources "" money for printed materials, access to a broadcast studio or time to reach people face-to-face. Now all it requires is a smartphone.
One popular technique introduced by Facebook last spring allows sharing to multiple groups with a few simple clicks on a mobile device, allowing enthusiasts such as Walters to broadcast their views even more quickly than before.
The rising popularity of the tactic among Sanders supporters may help explain the scores of images bashing Sanders's opponents that have appeared in nearly simultaneous bursts in recent weeks, pushed out by highly networked clusters of Facebook users, according to Davis's analysis. He did not find evidence that the campaign itself was involved in this activity, focusing instead on the informal Facebook activity by supporters. 
No other Democrat's supporters are engaged in behavior on a similar scale, which is more characteristic of the online movement galvanized by President Trump. The president's campaign aides have credited Facebook for his victory in 2016, when he poured money into advertising on the platform while also using organic posts on social media to speak directly to his followers, who responded with a torrent of posts backing him and lacerating his opponents.
Sanders has similarly embraced social media as a tool in the political revolution he promises, and his supporters are so devoted that they are described by some as being part of a cult of personality "" though the candidate's posts hardly echo the personal insults lobbed by Trump. And the senator's campaign distanced itself from the online attacks. 'As the senator has said loudly and clearly, there is no room in the political revolution for abuse and harassment online,' said Sarah Ford, a campaign spokeswoman.
The pro-Sanders forums focus on a range of themes, including the senator's independence from corporate interests and his opposition to Trump. At the same time, many of the images that fill the groups and pages are strikingly negative about rival Democrats, depicting former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg as a wine-swilling CIA plant with Republican leanings and Biden as a feckless politician who preys on women.
The meme shared by Walters, the retired Michigan factory worker, was just one of dozens of anti-Warren images circulating recently and one of several that portrayed her as the second coming of Clinton, whose own bid to become the first female president in 2016 ended in division and defeat for Democrats. The version that Walters reposted reached about 500,000 Facebook users on 50 groups since it began circulating on Facebook in September, according to Davis.
The Sanders and Warren campaigns are promising a detente after Warren accused Sanders of saying in a private meeting that a woman couldn't win the White House, and Sanders denied having done so. But the memo hasn't been received by denizens of the digital world. Sanders supporters who are active on Facebook described in interviews growing disenchantment with other candidates and rising concern that the system might be rigged against their candidate.
Already, the pro-Sanders crusade has spawned groups calling for protests at the party's national convention in July should Sanders not emerge as the nominee. #BernieOrVest is their rallying cry, echoing the Yellow Vest demonstrations that have roiled France. In December, an activist wore one of the high-visibility vests for a picture with Sanders, which he proceeded to upload to a group, claiming falsely that the senator had endorsed their movement.
Walters said that before the recent controversy, Warren 'would have gotten my vote if Bernie hadn't won.' Now he's not sure what he'll do in November should another Democrat clinch the nomination. In 2016, he cast a ballot for the Green Party's Jill Stein rather than vote for either Trump or Clinton, whom he had come to distrust and dislike.
As for the enthusiasm Sanders inspires on Facebook, Walters sees a political advantage "" even if it tips into divisiveness.
'It worked for Trump,' Walters said.
Though groups have been part of Facebook for many years, the company began emphasizing them in the aftermath of the 2016 election. That's when Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg heralded the online communities as a more intimate way for like-minded users to connect. He touted the feature not only as redress for the company's missteps but, more broadly, also as a way to 'turn around the whole decline in community membership we've seen for decades,' as he wrote in June 2017.
Changes in recent years have elevated the feature to the forefront of Facebook, including tweaks in 2018 that sought to emphasize content from groups in a user's news feed over other material.
Amid these shifts, groups also have become forums for spam and hyperactive posting, as a cottage industry of tools emerged for more efficiently plastering the online spaces using scheduling and automation technologies. Advice proliferated online for posting rapidly while eluding the platform's spam detectors, which enforce policies against excessive sharing in ways that confuse and anger users.
The hectic pace of memes spreading among Sanders supporters made some researchers suspect widespread use of automation tools and, possibly, a foreign-influence operation. Conspiratorial themes pushed in 2016 by Russian operatives, including claims about corruption in the Democratic Party, have reemerged with a fury.
But evidence this campaign season points most clearly to the frenetic work of aggrieved Americans who, distrustful of mainstream gatekeepers of information, turn to Facebook. There, the traditional guardrails of political discourse don't exist, and individual users can share torrents of divisive memes and other charged content to audiences far beyond the 'Friends' once central to the Facebook experience.
'Perhaps it's not surprising that some of the tactics used by Russian actors against American voters in 2016 are now being used by American voters against each other,' said Philip N. Howard, head of Oxford University's Computational Propaganda Project.
The pro-Sanders users appear deeply linked. The top 72 users engaged in simultaneous posting "" broadly circulating the same content in a single second "" have an average 41 direct connections to others in the same universe of groups, according to Davis's analysis. Connections entail friendship or one user following another. Overall, he estimated that tens of millions of unique users like the pages in question or are members of the groups.
Some of the most active users operate multiple groups and pages, which can obscure the origin of a particular post. The page called 'Woodland Spaces,' for example, features mainly nature photography and evocative poetry, but last week it accused Warren of a 'smear campaign' against Sanders in a Facebook group called 'Bernie's Army of One Hundred Million Americans.'
In other cases, untangling the web of common ownership reveals unseemly linkages. The same page, 'Bernies Revolution Continues,' that owns the 'Bernie Sanders' Rare Meme Repository' group also owns a group called 'The Anti Corruption Movement,' which includes posts about 'satanic Zionism,' as well as positive memes about Trump.
One Sanders supporter who saw and reposted the anti-Warren meme shared by Walters was freelance journalist Cara Rogoff Greenberg, 69, who lives in New York City. With a series of taps on her smartphone, she regularly posted to 'Jews for Bernie 2020,' 'Bernie Sanders Bernstorming Network,' '#BernieOrVest' and 10 others.
Days after posting the meme showing Warren as a mask for Clinton, Greenberg said she was placed in 'Facebook jail' "" the popular colloquial term to describe restrictions imposed by the company, often for posting too frequently "" but remains uncertain about what policy she violated and how. She posted a cartoon of a woman behind bars in the 'Women for Bernie 2020' group.
'At first I thought it was because I was abusing the privilege, sharing to a dozen or more groups at a time, but others have commented on my own timeline (I am still able to post there) that this is happening with contributors to other public Bernie groups,' Greenberg wrote, generating 75 comments and 41 likes or other reactions. 'Is it a technical block intended to prevent spam, or political repression, or FB's concern about uncredited or false info being spread? I am concerned, and have been unable to easily figure out what is really going on here or how long this is likely to last.'
Facebook lifted the temporary restrictions after a few days, she later said.
While aggressive online tactics threaten to divide a party desperate to avoid a repeat of 2016, the online enthusiasm Sanders inspires has been an asset for the Vermont independent, who is vying to compete against Trump, a reality television star with a devoted digital following.
'What are we going to do if Bernie isn't the nominee? That's a question every Democratic candidate should be thinking about,' said Keegan Goudiss, who directed digital advertising for Sanders's 2016 campaign. 'Whether or not the online conversation is real, there's going to be division that's stoked. That's true no matter how emphatically Bernie says to support the nominee.'
While the comparison to Trump's online following is imperfect, Goudiss added, there are plainly parallels, above all the 'cult of personality' energizing Americans distrustful of other politicians, as well as the projection of strength under siege.
Over time, the focus of the meme-making energy has shifted. In January 2019, most of the critical images posted about other candidates by pages with 'Bernie Sanders' or 'Our Revolution' in their names focused on Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), according to Davis's analysis. By October, still several months before Harris would exit the race, she'd faded away as a target.
Meanwhile, whereas Warren once commanded less than 10-percent of the attention, she is now the subject of nearly half of the disparaging memes, Davis's research shows. Examples include a Photoshopped image of Warren in a dark wig. 'With Booker gone,' the text reads, referring to Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey, 'I'm the only black candidate.' Another shows Warren taking a blade to Sanders's back. Many mock her claims of Native American ancestry, which is also a common target for Trump and his allies.
A spokesman for the Warren campaign declined to comment. The rejoinder from her supporters has been oblique. Repurposing the serpent jibe, a 'Snakes for Warren' account recently emerged on Twitter, with about 1,000 followers.
'There's no fighting back against it; there's only rolling with it,' said Misha Leybovich, a tech entrepreneur and former McKinsey consultant who has been organizing 'Warren's Meme Team,' a collection of supporters with no formal links to the campaign.
He downplayed the significance of the online onslaught, arguing: 'The vast, vast majority of supporters of both Sanders and Warren, and all the other candidates, are great. Most of us just want to see Trump out of office.'
But interviews with owners and administrators of the pro-Sanders groups present a more complex picture. Buck Bewley, who runs a repair shop near Louisville, Ky., would vote for Warren over Trump, but he has soured on the Massachusetts Democrat. So he let the disparaging meme of Warren's visage as a mask for Clinton rack up views and shares in his group, the 'Bernie Sanders Bernstorming Network.'
'We get mad and post memes saying things that we probably wouldn't say in real life,' said Bewley, 53. But he acknowledged how the Internet-stoked outrage could have unintended consequences, possibly estranging other Democrats from the Massachusetts senator.
Or, as he put it, 'I think information is power. It's a ripple effect on Facebook.'

As the presidential campaign got underway last year, we watched the media lavish its affections on Beto O'Rourke for a while, and then Kamala Harris, briefly, and Elizabeth Warren for quite a while.
But, as it will, love waned.
Joe Biden became the new sure thing "" experienced, solid and empathetic. Most of all, he possessed that ineffable quality: electability. But last week, after the Iowa caucuses, the attention shifted squarely to Pete Buttigieg, portrayed as a centrist savior, though it's still debatable whether he actually won.
Then Tuesday night, the news media's roving crush moved to Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar. Her third-place finish in the New Hampshire Democratic primary became the story of the night.
Never, though, has mainstream media turned its loving eyes to the front-runner, Bernie Sanders.-Quite the opposite.
'He is a grumpy, angry person on the stump, and he is not going to be elected,' raved Republican strategist Sara Fagen on ABC News one recent Sunday morning.
At the New York Times, columnist Thomas Friedman scoffed at the Sanders surge to write in praise of former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who is on the verge of being the next flavor du jour, if his record on criminal justice doesn't catch up with him.
On a sentence-by-sentence basis, straight news coverage may not have reflected an anti-Sanders bias, but the framing of that coverage "" choices made on headlines and emphasis "" sometimes did. (Sanders, in a home page headline in the Times, 'tightens grip' on the party's liberal wing, which sounds more threatening than victorious.)
Meanwhile, Klobuchar was queen for a day, garnering headlines such as this one from Yahoo News: 'Riding wave of momentum, Klobuchar lands in 3rd place in New Hampshire primary.' You heard words such as 'Klobucharge' and 'Klomentum' bandied about.
On MSNBC Tuesday night, host Chris Matthews fawned: 'Bernie indicts. She finds a way to care.'
Amy Goodman, host of the progressive news program 'Democracy Now' and a Sanders defender, recalled hearing one cable pundit say Sanders had 'flatlined at Number One.' On a recent episode she bemoaned that most of the media coverage is 'so anti-Bernie it's just remarkable.'
The subtext behind much of the disdain is a partly a deep-seated sentiment that Sanders, if nominated, has little chance of winning the general election. But it's also partly "" and more insidiously "" that many journalists don't identify easily with Sanders in the same way they do with, say, Warren or O'Rourke or Buttigieg.
In Iowa early this month, I asked one local reporter who had met all the major candidates who would be the strongest Democratic candidate. 'I don't have a hope, I have a fear,' came the answer. It wasn't hard to figure out what that meant or how that sort of visceral dislike might make its way, subtly, into coverage.
While many reporters and pundits have seemed, until very recently, to casually discount Sanders, a few opinion writers are taking him very seriously "" seriously enough to shoot off flares about what a bad choice they think he would make.
'Running Sanders Against Trump Would Be an Act of Insanity,' thundered the headline on a New York magazine piece by Jonathan Chait in late January.
He wrote: 'No party nomination, with the possible exception of Barry Goldwater in 1964, has put forth a presidential nominee with the level of downside risk exposure as a Sanders-led ticket would bring. To nominate Sanders would be insane.'
'Bernie Can't Win,' opined David Frum in the Atlantic, characterizing Sanders in unflattering terms as 'a Marxist of the old school of dialectical materialism, from the land that time forgot.' At The Washington Post, columnist Jennifer Rubin has been equally tough; one recent headline: 'Bernie Sanders's Trump-like campaign is a disaster for Democrats.'
In turn, Sanders keeps dissing what he calls the corporate media, as he has for years.
In the official editorial-board interview with the New York Times recently, Sanders blustered that he doesn't cozy up to powerful media figures as other candidates are wont to do.
'I'm not good at pleasantries. If you have your birthday, I'm not going to call you up to congratulate you, so you'll love me and you'll write nice things about me,' he said.
A few media figures are giving him his due, if a little grudgingly. CNN's Jake Tapper was one: 'Take a step back. He is 78 years old, he is a Democratic socialist, he is a Jewish American, originally from Brooklyn "" it is a stunning achievement by Senator Sanders and for his movement.'
Sanders, though, doesn't seem to mind. His ardent followers bond with him and with one another by despising the mainstream media, often enough with good reason.
It may well be that he doesn't need or want the help of cable pundits, columnists and other opinion-makers.
From Beto to Biden, their crushes, so far, have turned into heartbreaks.
Maybe media love "" fickle and fleeting "" is a valentine Bernie Sanders would rather do without.
