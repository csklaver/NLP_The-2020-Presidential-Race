N.Va. voters are wary of Sanders but lukewarm on the alternatives

The meeting at the pub resembled a group-therapy session, with participants "" a town mayor, a former school board member and about 15 other moderate Democrats "" sharing anxiety over Tuesday's presidential primary election in Virginia.
They all wanted to know: How is it possible that Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) might win the party's presidential nomination? And why weren't they excited about any of the other candidates?
'I don't get it,' Ron Goodes, 74, said to the others at the SideBar pub in Leesburg, referring to how the primary elections have gone so far. 'I don't get why there's such disarray, why there's sniping, why there is less focus on 'what I can do' as opposed to 'how lousy that other person is.' It's just a freaking mess.'
'I can't vote for Bernie,' said Sara Gallagher, 69. 'He's just too left for me.'
In the affluent Northern Virginia suburbs that will be ground zero for Democratic turnout in November, an 'anybody but Bernie' movement is struggling to take hold.
Moderate Virginia voters have turned out in droves for Democratic candidates since the election of Donald Trump in 2016, powering the party's takeover of the U.S. House, both chambers of the state legislature and county boards in booming suburbs such as Prince William and Loudoun counties.
Now, those same voters are bouncing between presidential candidates, hoping that someone "" anyone "" can generate enough excitement to foil a November matchup between Sanders and Trump that they believe would be disastrous.
Some see Sanders as a divisive populist who will turn off independents and moderate Republicans who are crucial in swing states such as Pennsylvania or Michigan. Others, averse to the democratic socialist's calls for Medicare-for-all and free college tuition, say they could stay home on Election Day if Sanders is the nominee.
After canvassing for and donating to Democrats at the state and local level, they are ambivalent, at best, about billionaire Mike Bloomberg, former vice president Joe Biden, ex-South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Their uncertainty was reflected in a Monmouth University poll last month that showed just 1 in 4 Democratic voters in Virginia were sure about whom they prefer "" and that those who back Sanders, as opposed to the rest of the field, were enthusiastic about their choice.
'Moderates are very conflicted about the strengths of candidates in their lane,' said Quentin Kidd, director of Christopher Newport University's Wason Center for Public Policy. 'There's just not a candidate who is as exciting or energetic as, oddly enough, 78-year-old Bernie Sanders is.'
Virginia's long history of across-the-aisle politics makes the state seemingly fertile ground for a presidential candidate who hovers closer to the center than Sanders. In 2016, Democrats in the state chose Hillary Clinton over Sanders nearly 2 to 1.

Yet, with establishment Democratic officials aligning themselves with different moderates "" or not endorsing at all "" Sanders appears poised to take a sizable portion of Virginia's 99 delegates into what is shaping up to potentially be the first seriously contested Democratic Party convention in 52 years.
The same Monmouth University poll showed him locked in a tie at the top of the field with Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who will appear on the ballot for the first time in the 14 Super Tuesday states and has saturated Virginia with campaign ads. Biden and Buttigieg were second and third, respectively.
But while Sanders has since gone on to decisively win the Nevada caucuses, Bloomberg has faced withering attacks on the debate stage over alleged mistreatment of women in his media company and a stop-and-frisk policy during his mayoral term that targeted African Americans and Latinos.
An accompanying tide of uncertainty has rolled through Democratic social media chat groups, debate watch parties and even candidate rallies in Northern Virginia.
Outside a Warren rally in Arlington on Feb. 13, Marguerite Metzler said that 'it's disturbing' to think of Bloomberg, a former Republican, as the only viable alternative to Sanders, whose 'building-the-base strategy' she compared to Trump's.
Though she believes Warren could be an effective president, Metzler, 69, said the senator may have blown her chances of winning in Virginia.
'There are people who like her but haven't liked some of her ideas,' she said. 'And I think she squandered that by building such a strong association with free college and Medicare-for-all.'
After ticking off a list of misgivings over the other Democratic candidates "" Biden lacks energy, Buttigieg is inexperienced "" Metzler, who lives in Springfield, landed on a possible choice: 'Maybe Amy?'

Sanders's supporters don't understand the confusion.
During a recent debate watch party in Fairfax City, Amber Beichler and Isabelle Oldfield happily cheered as Warren and the other candidates laid into Bloomberg, while Sanders emerged relatively unscathed.
Both argued that the senator from Vermont is the only one who can inspire enough passion among Democrats to defeat Trump. They cited the support he has received so far from white, Latino and African American voters worried about climate change, rising health-care costs and stagnant wages in an otherwise robust economy "" all of which Sanders has vowed to fix.
'It'll be that inspiring platform that will get people off the couch and into the voting booth,' said Beichler, 29, of Herndon.
Added Oldfield, 24, who lives in Reston, 'He's actually the perfect candidate to run against Trump, because you need a populist to win against a populist.'
Nearby, Mike Miner, 35, who supports Warren and is also from Reston, was philosophical about why Democrats are anxious about Sanders and unsure about who else should take on the president.
'When you talk to people, their number one issue is defeating Donald Trump,' Miner said. 'You cannot run this experiment multiple times and see which candidate does better, which one does a little bit worse. You're going off your gut. And that's why you're seeing such huge fluctuations in polls and support rising and falling.'
At a Buttigieg rally in Arlington this past weekend, Joseph Brecht, 21, advertised himself as the kind of voter Democrats yearn to win over. The George Mason University student held up a 'Republicans for Pete' sign that drew cheers from anyone who saw it, saying he voted for Trump in 2016 but is now disillusioned.
'I consider myself a moderate Republican, but I'm not a socialist,' Brecht said, referring to Sanders. In November, 'I'm going to try to support the Democratic nominee, but if it's someone I really can't stand, I'm just not going to vote for that office.'
Jill Weiss, 49, showed up to the rally wearing a red Moms Demand Action T-shirt. The group is an offshoot of the Everytown for Gun Safety group funded by Bloomberg that was instrumental in helping Democrats seize control of the General Assembly in the fall.
'It doesn't mean I support Bloomberg,' Weiss, of Leesburg, quickly said. She is leaning toward Biden because of his foreign policy experience but is also open to Buttigieg and Klobuchar. Reflecting on the possibility of a Sanders nomination, Weiss added: 'I always thought I was a liberal Democrat. But everything has shifted.'

Inside the Leesburg pub, the group attending the event organized by the Loudoun County Democratic Committee expressed frustration with that shifting terrain.
The suburb was key in Democratic victories in the fall in the statehouse and on the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors. In 2018, Loudoun also propelled Democrat Jennifer Wexton to victory over GOP incumbent Barbara Comstock, helping to fuel a new Democratic House majority.
Yet that afternoon, there were the formerly energized voters, wearing 'Hello my name is . . .' tags and openly worrying about not having a significant voice in what they see as the mother of all elections.
'I'm seriously contemplating not voting on March 3, which, for me, is really weird,' said Charlotte McConnell, 40. 'I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone.'
Gallagher, who said she is vehemently opposed to Sanders, said she will probably not cast a ballot in November if he gets the nomination. Jessica Puentes, 31, said she will probably stay home if Bloomberg is the Democratic nominee.

Tony Fasolo, 82, lamented the strain that Sanders's 2016 presidential run had on his relationship with his son, who backed Sanders over Clinton and still 'doesn't talk to me too much.'
Kelly Burke, the Leesburg mayor, said that without a candidate who has the same kind of gravitational pull that Sanders has, many moderates feel stuck.
'We all realize what's at stake, in that this election matters probably like no election in the life of this country, and that's why we're struggling,' she said. 'We don't want to make a mistake.'

Super Tuesday is over, though with many votes yet to be counted in the California primary, things could shift in the hours and days ahead.
That said, we have a pretty good idea about how the Democratic nominating contest just changed. Below, some takeaways.


This race has a new front-runner: Joe Biden.

Some Super Tuesday delegates are still up for grabs, especially in California, and this race is far from over. But we do have a new front-runner and favorite for the nomination: Joe Biden.
Biden won early, and even more importantly, he won big in the states he won on Super Tuesday. That means he has now built a significant delegate lead, barring a massive rout in California by Sen. Bernie Sanders (that's highly unlikely). The delegates are, after all, what matters now in this race.
Biden has also reversed the trajectory of this race. After Sanders won the popular vote in the first three states, there was a real reason to believe he might be about to build a potentially insurmountable delegate lead. It might not have been enough to get him a majority and to avoid a contested convention, but he seemed the clear leader with the wind at his back.
That's now Biden. As of publishing time, Biden was on track to be the clear delegate leader. Texas had not been called but was a dead heat between him and Sanders. Biden won by far the most states and even picked off a few Sanders won in 2016, Minnesota and Oklahoma. Biden also performed better than the most recent polls predicted in many states, suggesting the picture for him nationwide is improving.
Remember when candidates were asked at the Nevada debate whether a candidate with a plurality - but not a majority - of delegates should be the nominee? Sanders was the only one to commit to it. That shows how much this race changed in two weeks.



It's far from over - and next week looms.

Biden got rather bold in his election-night speech, referring to his turnaround by saying, ""We were told when we got to Super Tuesday, it would be over. Well, it may be over for the other guy."" 
It's still far too early to say what Biden meant with any certainty. Exit polls and absentee voters' surveys suggested Sanders had an early lead in California, which allocates 30 percent of all delegates available on Super Tuesday. Biden appears to have avoided the worst-case scenario there, which would have been to somehow fall below the 15 percent delegate threshold and hand Sanders a huge shift. But Sanders could still close the gap significantly as California's results slowly trickle in.
What Biden did, though, was inoculate himself against Sanders winning California by doing two things: racking up big delegate margins in some of those Southern states, and picking off a couple 2016 Sanders states.
But keep this in mind: Sanders is so far doing well in the West. If he wins California, it will join Colorado, Nevada and Utah in his win column. He might also win Texas. The farthest west Biden has won thus far is Oklahoma.
And who votes next Tuesday? Washington and Idaho. Also voting: Michigan and North Dakota, which Sanders won in 2016, and Missouri, where he came within a hair of winning. The one really, obviously favorable state for Biden next week is Mississippi. If Sanders can rack up some real delegates in California and beat Biden next week, who knows how this race will look? 


It sure looks like the end of the line for Bloomberg and Warren.

Also benefiting Biden on Super Tuesday was Mike Bloomberg's poor performance. Bloomberg bet heavily on Super Tuesday states - quite literally, spending hundreds of millions of dollars in them - but saw his momentum halted by some poor debate performances and Biden's sudden rise.
Bloomberg's campaign said early on election night that they felt he would remain relevant in this race by hitting the 15 percent threshold for winning delegates in just about all Super Tuesday states, but he's under that mark in more than half of them. As of publication, Bloomberg was below 15 percent in Alabama, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Virginia and Vermont.
The candidate Sanders would most like to see drop out meanwhile - Elizabeth Warren - will face her own questions after faring little better than Bloomberg. She also lost her home state, finishing third in Massachusetts, and her birth state of Oklahoma. Warren has been picking up some key endorsements in recent days, but without a win and with that Massachusetts rebuke, what's the argument for her candidacy?

This is a now a two-candidate race; the question is whether Bloomberg and Warren will accept that.


This was about black voters, pure and simple.

After awful performances in Iowa and New Hampshire, Biden staked his campaign on waiting for states with bigger black populations to vote. The question was whether he'd even be relevant by the time they got to weigh in.
That question has been answered. Biden's rise owes foremost to an overwhelming wave of support from black voters - bigger even than some early polls in this race suggested it might be.
Biden parlayed House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn's (D-S.C.) endorsement into a bigger-than-expected win Saturday in South Carolina, where black voters were 57 percent of the electorate and favored Biden 4 to 1 over Sanders. Then black voters essentially delivered Biden a big sweep of the South on Tuesday. They delivered a large chunk of the vote, and they went for Biden 57 percent to 18 percent.
Those margins are bigger than Biden might have hoped. A November Quinnipiac University poll put his black support at 44 percent, and a January Washington Post-Ipsos poll focused on only black voters showed him getting 48 percent of them nationwide. That number slipped to 31 percent in a Post-ABC News poll when Biden was struggling in mid-February, but it has since rebounded a massive way.
There is a narrative about how the Democratic establishment has come to Biden's rescue. What really happened is African Americans did.


The missing Bernie Sanders youth surge.

Not only did Sanders see Biden assert himself on Tuesday, but he also saw one of his major electoral arguments severely undermined.
The Post's Philip Bump wrote before the results came in Tuesday about how Sanders had failed to expand the Democratic electorate as he had promised to, with Sanders running well behind his performances in the 2016 primaries. Part of that owed to the more crowded field, sure, but it wasn't exactly an affirmation of Sanders's electability argument.
That argument took another hit Tuesday. The biggest reason was lack of young voters who turned out. Exit polls showed only about 1 in 8 voters were between the ages of 18 and 29 years old. By contrast, nearly two-thirds were 45 or older, and about 3 in 10 were 65 or older.
Sanders has countered the idea that he's too politically extreme by arguing he'll turn out low-propensity voters in the general election. We're just not seeing that yet.

Watchdog groups are concerned voters aren't getting the full picture
The ad that interrupted some Hulu subscribers as they watched the NBC comedy 'Brooklyn Nine-Nine' this month opened with a clip of President Trump speaking.
'The 'deep state' is trying to inject our health system with socialist price controls,' a narrator then interjected, before a banner flashed at the bottom of the screen: 'TEXT 'SOCIALISM SUCKS' TO 41490.' 
But neither FreedomWorks, the conservative group behind the ad, nor Hulu, a television-and-movie streaming giant, is required to reveal much more to the public about the 30-second spot or whom it targeted, leaving watchdogs and regulators fearful that federal election laws aren't fit for the digital age "" and that voters remain vulnerable to manipulation.
Four years after Russian agents exploited popular online platforms to push propaganda, sow unrest and promote the Trump candidacy, the U.S. government has made virtually no progress on bringing more transparency to paid political speech. The risks remain high that voters could be duped and deceived by foreign governments, U.S. candidates and advocacy groups "" particularly online, where major regulatory gaps exist.
Campaign finance experts say they are especially concerned about video-streaming services at a moment when more Americans are shifting their viewing habits from cable to the Web. Politicians have followed people online, and over the past year, their ads have appeared on popular platforms such as Roku, the maker of hardware and software that powers Internet-connected TVs, and lesser-known options such as Tubi, which offers ad-supported movie streaming.
But nothing requires these fast-growing digital providers to disclose whom these ads targeted and who viewed them. The absence of federal transparency rules stands in stark contrast with traditional TV broadcasters, such as ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC, which for decades have been required to maintain limited public files about political ads.
'I'm really worried people are going to be bombarded and not going to have the information they need to assess all of what's coming at them,' said Meredith McGehee, the executive director of Issue One, which advocates for transparency in campaign spending.
On Hulu, which boasts more than 30 million subscribers, political ads have become so prolific that its users have complained loudly "" on the company's public-facing forums. 'I have Hulu for entertainment, not so I can be tortured with political ads,' wrote one user in January.
Beyond mere nuisance, the lack of transparency has also sparked criticism in Congress, where some lawmakers say it's long past time to update federal laws to prevent potential abuse.
'At a time when our adversaries are using disinformation campaigns to undermine our democracy, we need to be pushing for more disclosure and transparency, not less,' Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), a White House hopeful, said in a statement.
Hulu declined to comment for this story, and Roku did not respond to a request for comment.
For many ethics watchdogs, the lack of visibility into online advertising reflects a broader election-year challenge: Campaigns are spending more than ever to try to reach voters and influence their decisions, armed with powerful digital tools "" yet federal regulations haven't kept pace.
Political advertising could surpass $6 billion on television, search, social media and other digital platforms by November, according to the analytics firm eMarketer. Traditional television still captures the majority of these ad dollars, researchers said, but spending on myriad sites and services has grown exponentially as campaigns embrace fresh ways to target their messages based on a voter's age, location or other personal traits.
The consequences of those new digital tactics became apparent in 2016, when 'trolls' tied to the Russian government relied on narrowly targeted social media ads to inflame tensions around race, religion and other political fault lines. The prospect of foreign interference again looms over 2020 as voting begins, but digital experts say the more likely threat this cycle is homegrown "" campaigns and their allies that peddle half-truths and outright falsehoods in ways people can't easily discern.
Under pressure to prevent abuse, some companies have created their own ad archives. Facebook and Google-owned YouTube maintain public repositories of the posts, photos and videos that campaigns and their allies pay to promote, with limited information on whom those ads targeted and how much an advertiser spent. The archives, while often criticized for being incomplete, have still helped watchdogs identify potential wrongdoing "" including efforts by Trump to pay to promote falsehoods on Facebook.
But a wide range of other tech companies "" including Hulu and similar video services "" share much less about political ads, even as they reap big bucks and emerge as key battlegrounds in the presidential race.
Like much of the Web, these video portals allow political campaigns and their allies to target their messages at specific categories of viewers. A political candidate or group might create an ad buy calibrated to voters based on their geographic area, age, gender or likely socioeconomic status. The ads can be run on an individual streaming service or purchased through a third party to reach an audience that spans multiple streaming sites.
Companies such as Premion, an ad subsidiary of the Virginia-based TV conglomerate Tegna, claim to aid in such ad campaigns: It allows local and regional political advertisers to conduct 'voter targeting' across more than 125 streaming services, including Tubi. Representatives for Tegna and Premion did not respond to a request for comment.
Some streaming platforms appear to try to entice well-heeled political advertisers with the promise of near-pinpoint accuracy. Sling TV, a Web-based television offering from Dish Network, participates in an ad-selling consortium that grants campaigns 'precise demographic or voter attribute targeting' on streaming and traditional television. The ad consortium, called D2 Media, did not respond to a request for comment.
Hulu, for its part, attracts advertisers with potential access to a 'younger and more engaged audience' through 'personalized and precise targeting,' though the company does not elaborate in materials it offers online. The FreedomWorks ad this month about the deep state, for example, was part of a 'significant five-figure buy within the Beltway/DC Metro area targeting Republicans and some independents,' Peter Vicenzi, a spokesman for the group, said in an email.
Seeing an opportunity, Democratic presidential contenders also have ramped up their streaming offensive. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has spent at least $326,000 on political ads on Hulu between Nov. 1 and Dec. 31, according to a Washington Post analysis of Federal Election Commission records. A week before voters began to caucus in Iowa, former vice president Joe Biden's campaign announced its own Hulu ad blitz. And Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., spent more than $100,000 to advertise on Roku in November, according to FEC spending records, along with additional ad spending on Hulu.
Those few disclosed amounts represent only a fraction of all political ad spending on Hulu and its competitors, given the fact that many Democratic and Republican campaigns purchase ads through third parties. As a result, the total spent is not itemized fully in their FEC reports. Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, for example, appears to have bombarded movie-and-TV streaming sites with ads, much as he has on traditional television. His election spending reports don't reflect his prolific approach "" but frequent, loud complaints from social media users do. His campaign declined to comment.
Some portion of the $40 million digital ad campaign launched in January by Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC, is focused on platforms including Hulu, the group previously announced. This cycle, Priorities USA expects to spend at least seven figures total on ads that appear on streaming services in addition to the group's traditional television spending, according to Madeline Kriger, the group's director of integrated media.
Still, she described the disclosure rules as a 'mess,' citing the fact that the laws differ depending on where an ad actually runs.
'It is on them entirely to make up their own rules because there's so little regulation,' Kriger said. 'The problem will not be solved until there's an actual law to follow.' 
Broadcast television, by comparison, is heavily regulated: The scarce but crucial airwaves that power radio and TV signals are government property. Decades-old rules mandate that broadcasters must keep public files indicating which candidates, campaigns and political groups run ads on their stations and the general topics those ads cover.
Members of Congress, led by Democrats Klobuchar and Sen. Mark R. Warner (Va.), have sought to transfer that approach to the Web, requiring all major websites to keep a running archive of political ads and their targets. But partisan squabbling "" and at times lobbying from the tech industry "" has stymied their bill, known as the Honest Ads Act, from coming to a vote. Broadcasters, meanwhile, have petitioned federal regulators in recent months for permission to disclose less about political ads, infuriating campaign finance watchdogs, who point out that voters would suffer if they knew less about who was trying to influence them.
'It would immunize them from the disclosure requirement, which are pretty pitiful as they are,' said Angela Campbell, the co-director of the Institute for Public Representation at Georgetown Law School and a lawyer for campaign finance groups challenging the effort.
Some state lawmakers have sought to act in Washington's place: Maryland, for one, adopted its own wide-ranging political ad law in 2018, hoping to shine more light on advertising about state and local candidates. But federal judges ruled the law was unconstitutional in December, agreeing with plaintiffs in the news industry, including The Washington Post, that it violated the First Amendment by regulating speech.
The murky legal landscape even contributed to a decision by the music-streaming app Spotify earlier this year to halt all political ads. For the many services that still allow it, though, presidential candidates and their allies have found a major boon: Voters ages 18 to 29 watch less traditional television and generally distrust ads on social networking yet take action 80 percent of the time after viewing a political ad video online, according to a study by Sling TV and Telaria, an ad tech company.
With spending on streaming increasing "" and Washington seemingly sitting by idly "" some lawmakers said it has resulted in serious loopholes that malicious actors could exploit.
'As we enter the full-swing of another presidential campaign,' Warner said in a statement, 'greater transparency "" including disclaimers on all political ads and a robust political file regime "" is now more important than ever.'

DeWine cites 'health emergency' despite judge's ruling on voting
The coronavirus pandemic disrupted the 2020 presidential election as the Ohio governor announced late Monday that polls would not open ""as a health emergency"" despite a state judge's ruling that the election must go on.
""During this time when we face an unprecedented public health crisis, to conduct an election tomorrow would force poll workers and voters to place themselves at an unacceptable health risk of contracting coronavirus,"" Gov. Mike DeWine (R) said in a tweet. He also promised to push for a remedy through the courts ""to extend voting options so that every voter who wants to vote will be granted that opportunity.""
The announcement was sure to create more uncertainty as voters, poll workers and county election officials received yet another reversal regarding the fate of Tuesday's presidential primary, with voting set to begin at 6:30 a.m.
Earlier Monday, Franklin County Court of Common Pleas Judge Richard A. Frye rejected a temporary restraining order supported by DeWine to seek the delay, saying in a hearing late Monday that rescheduling the election would ""set a terrible precedent.""
""There are too many factors to balance in this uncharted territory,"" Frye said at a court hearing Monday evening.
It was unclear how quickly the status of the lawsuit would be resolved. A lawyer for the plaintiffs, Diane Menashe, said via text they will appeal Frye's decision in the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Columbus. It remains unclear whether they will appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court if necessary - or if the suit has been rendered moot by DeWine's announcement.

Edward B. Foley, a former solicitor general of Ohio and a professor of constitutional law at Ohio State University, said the judge's ruling denied a request from private plaintiffs to delay the primary but may have left room for the sort of emergency directive made by the governor, which appears to preserve votes already cast while preventing in-person voting for reasons of public health. But he said there were still unanswered questions about exactly the state of those early votes, as well as future opportunities for voters who have not yet cast a ballot but intended to on Tuesday.
""We need greater clarity from the governor as to whether he's actually calling off the election,"" said Richard L. Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California at Irvine.

DeWine and Secretary of State Frank LaRose issued a joint statement after the ruling defending their effort to postpone voting Tuesday.
""The only thing more important than a free and fair election is the health and safety of Ohioans,"" they said in the statement.
""Logistically, under these extraordinary circumstances, it simply isn't possible to hold an election tomorrow that will be considered legitimate by Ohioans. They mustn't be forced to choose between their health and exercising their constitutional rights.""
On Twitter, the whiplash of election officials played out in real time.
At 7:37 p.m., about four hours after it had tweeted that the primary was delayed, the Summit County Board of Elections revised its announcement.
""We are aware the information we originally gave was incorrect. We apologize for any confusion we may have caused. We'll get the proper information out as soon as we have it,"" the account tweeted.
A few moments later, the Wayne County Board of Elections tweeted on its account: ""We have NO Official word regarding the status of tomorrow's election. Please stay tuned.""
Some Ohio counties began signaling to voters on social media that the primaries were back on. Franklin County, the state's most populous, said in a statement that poll workers should ""prepare to report.""

""You are encouraged to monitor your text and email for further updates. We regret any confusion that's been created and appreciate your patience and cooperation,"" the board of elections said in a statement around 9:20 p.m.
Mike West, communications manager for Cuyahoga County Board of Elections, said his office did not tell poll workers the election was postponed because of the possibility the judge would rule against it.
""We were very careful not to stop doing our work to prepare for tomorrow's election, because we wanted to wait for the official ruling,"" he said.
A spokeswoman for Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost had no information either, and said the office was in the middle of figuring out what to do.
""That's the million dollar question right now,"" said Bethany McCorkle, Yost's communications director. ""People are trying to figure out where that would be appealed and if there's time.""
The drama underscored the challenges more and more states could face as the election calendar unfolds with the pandemic as backdrop, as well as the threat to voter access that could ensue, legal experts said.
Marc Elias, a Democratic election lawyer in Washington, said ""there is no perfect option at this point.""
""Every state needs to do the best that they can to ensure voters can participate in the primary election,"" he said. ""For some states, moving forward as planned makes the most sense. For other states with more time to plan, they may be able to mitigate some of the problems with a delay.""

DeWine said at a news conference earlier Monday that he believed the state should cancel in-person voting in the state's primary Tuesday, noting that to allow it would not be in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines against gatherings of 50 people or more. He said he wanted to postpone in-person voting until June 2 and extending absentee balloting during the intervening weeks.
""It is clear that tomorrow's in-person voting does not conform and cannot conform with these CDC guidelines,"" the governor said in an announcement that caught some local election officials by surprise.
""We cannot conduct this election tomorrow, the in-person voting for 13 hours tomorrow, and conform to these guidelines,"" DeWine said. ""This was not a decision that was easily made, like most of the decisions we've had to make,"" he said. ""But I believe it is the right thing to do.""
In the daily coronavirus briefing from the White House, President Trump weighed in on DeWine's decision and whether the three other states holding primaries Tuesday should follow suit, saying he would leave that decision up to the states.
But, he said: ""I think postponing elections is not a very good thing. They have lots of room in a lot of the electoral places. . . . I think postponing is unnecessary.""
The announcement and subsequent judge's decision created new uncertainty for the two main Democratic White House contenders, former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Despite Biden's victories in recent primaries, Sanders has shown no sign that he will concede soon, and the havoc created by the pandemic could slow Biden's newfound momentum.
In three other states with presidential primaries Tuesday, officials contended with more poll workers announcing they would not show up for work, more voting location closures and worries that the public would stay home. But officials in Arizona, Florida and Illinois said their primaries would proceed Tuesday.
""We're not going to panic,"" Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) of Florida said during a news conference Monday.
Still, election officials acknowledged that voters were worried - and that they need to take precautions for their health.
""The longer we wait the more difficult and dangerous this will become,"" said Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs. ""My message to voters is: Stay informed and make a decision that is right for you.""
As they prepared for Tuesday's vote, local officials confronted shortages of poll workers and cleaning supplies and the need to close some polling locations, many of which were in senior living facilities.
In Arizona, the Maricopa County Elections Department closed 78 polling locations, citing widespread shortages of cleaning supplies. Now, rather than being limited to their local precinct, voters may cast ballots at any of 151 geographically dispersed polling centers.
The last-minute change is expected to create confusion for voters accustomed to going to the assigned polling location in their neighborhood, but officials said the change ""allows equal access to the polls, while prioritizing the health and safety of the public.""
As of Sunday, there were 13 confirmed or presumed positive covid-19 cases in Arizona.
Poll-worker shortages in Florida prompted one election official in Pasco County, north of Tampa, to draft sheriff's deputies, school district workers and county employees to fill in.
""I reached out to our county administrator and the sheriff, and also the school supervisor, and I said, 'We're hemorrhaging poll workers by the hour, and we need your help,' "" Brian Corley said Monday.
Corley said that because of the coronavirus, many poll workers are afraid to show up - and he cautioned that people who are sick should not vote in person.
""This is the only time you'll hear me discourage voting,"" Corley said. ""But if you're sick, don't come to the polls.""
Corley said voters can ask someone to pick up a mail-in ballot for them at the office of the supervisor of elections and have it returned it to the office by 7 p.m., when polls close. In Florida, voters can designate someone to pick up their ballot with a written affidavit.
Corley's office usually employees 1,000 poll workers, many of whom are retirement age. By Monday morning, 150 said they would not be coming in - and he said he expected more to drop out. There are more than 250,000 registered voters on Pasco County's rolls.

Former mayor wants to help Democrats fight Trump in swing states 
Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg has decided to donate significant components of his shuttered presidential campaign to the Democratic Party, a historic bequest that includes an $18 million cash infusion to organize for the general election in swing states.
The decision, which exploits a provision in campaign finance law available only to federal candidates, amounts to a shift in strategy for the billionaire political activist, who had previously promised to personally fund ground staff and offices in six states through an independent expenditure effort.
He now hopes that much of the same operation will be run through the state and national Democratic Party, which would allow for it to directly coordinate with the Democratic nominee, whom he expects to be former vice president Joe Biden. An independent expenditure campaign is barred from such coordination.
""While we considered creating our own independent entity to support the nominee and hold the President accountable, this race is too important to have many competing groups with good intentions but that are not coordinated and united in strategy and execution,"" Bloomberg's campaign wrote in a memo Friday to Democratic Party Chairman Tom Perez.
""Since Mike suspended his campaign and endorsed Joe Biden, the former vice president now controls the race. It is critically important that we all do everything we can to support our eventual nominee and scale the Democratic Party's general election efforts.""
To accomplish the goal, Bloomberg will transfer cash remaining in his presidential campaign account, which he donated, to the Democratic National Committee's Battleground Build-Up 2020 effort for use in the general election. The money will allow the party to hire hundreds of additional organizers, party officials say. Bloomberg also will transfer the long-term leases he has signed on some offices in some swing states to state Democratic parties.
Bloomberg's advisers plan to work with the DNC on shifting staff from his payroll to the party. All personnel would have to reapply for their jobs, and those hired by the party will be paid at DNC salary levels, according to a party official. Bloomberg was previously paying $6,000 a month for organizers, well above the market rates offered for other campaigns.
""Our country is in crisis, and a change in presidential leadership is more important now than ever to protect our families, our communities and our economy,"" Perez said in a statement. ""With this transfer from the Bloomberg campaign, Mayor Bloomberg and his team are making good on their commitment to beating Donald Trump.""
But the transition will be disruptive for hundreds of Bloomberg organizers in swing states. They were previously told their jobs would continue through the general election, but they now find themselves facing the prospect of unemployment amid an economic crisis brought about by the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Organizers received an email Friday saying their jobs would end that day, though they will continue to receive pay through April 7 and health benefits through April 30. 
""As a token of our appreciation, we are offering you the opportunity to keep your laptop and iPhone,"" said one email from the Bloomberg campaign to organizers. The email also noted that the value of the devices, $1,400 or $1,700, depending on the laptop, will be counted as taxable income.
Under normal circumstances, federal rules allow individuals to give a maximum of $355,000 per year to the DNC. The party has set up a Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee with state parties, that allows wealthy individuals to give $865,000 in one year. Bloomberg has already donated the maximum allowed to this account.
But the new shift of resources means he is able to give more than 20 times the maximum a donor can give to the national party in one year, because of provisions that allow federal candidates to donate unlimited amounts of leftover money to national and state parties as they wind down their campaigns. This has effectively given Bloomberg a super-donor status because he self-funded his White House bid.
Campaign finance experts said such a mass transfer of personal money was uncharted territory.
""This has never, to my knowledge, been an issue before, because anybody other than somebody worth multiple billions would want their money back even if they self-funded,"" said Charlie Spies, a campaign finance lawyer.
If someone mounted a self-funded bid solely to evade the individual contribution limit and donate leftover campaign funds to the party, that would be considered a straw donation scheme, experts said.
But Bloomberg is shuttering a real campaign effort, and his decisions point to a loophole in the federal law that wealthy self-funded candidates can exploit, experts said.
""I think it'd be absolutely wrong to suggest that it's a ploy to get around the limits. . . . But it does suggest you could do that,"" said Beth Kingsley, a campaign finance lawyer. ""It does seem that there ought to be limits the same way there's an individual [contribution] limit.""
Although Bloomberg's plans to establish a new independent expenditure campaign have been put on hold, his advisers continue to look at possible vehicles for a media campaign to support the Democratic nominee later this year. A super PAC he used in 2018 to support House candidates, Independence USA, still exists, and he still has the capability to form a new group.
Since leaving the race earlier this month, Bloomberg has announced a broad range of donations to the larger Democratic cause, including $2 million for black voter registration and $2 million to Swing Left, which is working to elect Democrats to Republican-held seats in 2020.

The Vermont senator can quit and still move his agenda forward, says The Post's

Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders do not want it on their consciences that they helped reelect President Trump. The future of the country really does depend on how both of them act over the next few weeks. 
They should realize four things. First, if they don't work together, and fast, Trump really could win reelection. If the urgency of putting an end to a genuinely dangerous presidency was not clear before his bungling of the coronavirus crisis, it should be now. Second, they need each other to achieve their respective core goals, both in the short term and in the long run. Third, there is a history of the left working with a governing center to achieve substantial social reform. Finally, neither of them has a monopoly on wisdom. Each must pay attention to the other's central concerns.
What will be asked of them is not easy: Sanders has to acknowledge, quickly, that there is no way he is going to win the Democratic nomination he has spent five years fighting for. Biden has to reach out to a candidate who has regularly attacked him as a tool of the establishment and to a constituency of young voters who think he's over the hill. 
If they can't do all these things, they will strengthen Trump in November. The difficult truth is staring them in the face: They need each other to win.

Democrats showed in 2018 the good things that can happen when their progressive and moderate wings work together. The party grabbed control of the House with a popular-vote majority of nearly 10 million. That's enough to retake the White House.
If the vote for president matched the popular vote for House candidates in every state, according to calculations by my Brookings Institution colleague William Frey, the Democratic nominee would get 293 electoral votes. That means victory, but it's only 23 more than the 270 required to win the presidency, which is not much of a cushion. Biden thus badly needs the constituencies Sanders has mobilized, particularly Americans under 35. Biden will be sunk if they vote for third-party candidates or stay home.
In 2018, progressives realized they had an interest in victories by many politicians around the country with more moderate views than their own. Moderates, in turn, grasped the turnout and activism that progressives could provide. Both sides also understood that it's foolish to argue about whether elections depend solely on either mobilizing voters or persuading them. If all the wings of the Democratic Party don't mobilize, Biden will lose. But especially in swing states - Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Arizona are at the top of the list - Biden will also lose if he doesn't persuade at least some of Trump's 2016 voters to switch sides and many moderate independents and Republicans to come his way. 
This is why Biden needs Sanders, but also why Sanders needs to give Biden some room to do what he needs to do to win. Accepting defeat might make Sanders grumpy, but he can move forward with pride - and that is what he seemed to do when he signaled a de-escalation of the campaign Wednesday. He acknowledged he was ""losing"" but said his forces had ""won the ideological debate."" 
He was onto something. He has fundamentally altered the nature of the conversation in the Democratic Party. Together, he and Elizabeth Warren have moved even the most moderate Democrats to the left. His proposals for Medicare-for-all, free college and bold action on climate change, and his warnings about the dangers of concentrated corporate power, set the terms of this year's debate. Candidates were judged by how close or far they were from his core objectives. That's a big deal.
Moreover, Sanders's movement is now a permanent force in the Democratic Party, much like organized labor was in the old days, or the religious right is now in the GOP. Democrats will not be able to ignore the left wing that Sanders has brought to life. He made democratic socialism a popular idea among young Americans. Unlike their elders, they associate socialism not with the Soviet Union but with a decent, democratic society that pays attention to the needs of the powerless, the marginalized and the working class. A 2018 survey showed that 58 percent of adults under 30 identified socialism as a system that ""provides citizens with health insurance, retirement support, and access to free higher education""; only 38 percent saw it as government control of ""key parts of the economy, such as utilities, transportation and communications industries."" 
But for all his achievements, it's clear now that Sanders speaks for only about a third of Democrats. (So far, he has received just over 30 percent of the popular vote in the Democratic primaries.) His task is to accept his role as a source of pressure for far-reaching reform inside the Democratic coalition.
There's a role model for him: Sidney Hillman, the strategic mastermind of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, the left wing of the labor movement of the 1930s and 1940s. The CIO gave critical support to Franklin D. Roosevelt when he needed it against the party's right wing, but it also pushed FDR in a more progressive direction.
Sanders and his movement should embrace the idea that they need a sympathetic moderate liberal - his name now is Joe Biden - in power to achieve anything they have in mind. They have a right to ask Biden for some reassurances, but they should not waste a lot of time on foolish platform fights or demands for symbolic gestures. What matters is the policy agenda Biden pursues after he is elected.
The good news for Biden is that there are many issues on which outreach to Sanders's supporters could also help the likely Democratic nominee with the broader electorate, too. A commitment to increasing the power of workers in an economy that has seen unions weaken sits well with both Sanders's objectives and Biden's Scranton, Pa., working-class roots. More vocal and aggressive moves on climate change would help reassure younger voters. Strong pledges to limit the power of big money in politics would reinforce the message House Democrats sent with their comprehensive elections and ethics bill, H.R. 1. Biden could also take some steps closer to Sanders on universal access to public universities and job training. And while Biden would be ill-advised to change his position on health care, he could shift from bashing Medicare-for-all to giving Sanders credit for moving the broader health-care argument in a more progressive direction.
Finally, Biden's pledge to work with Republicans is too central to his persona for him to abandon it. But he needs to do far more to show that he recognizes the growing power of right-wing radicalism in the GOP and its habit of obstructionism.
More broadly, Biden needs to make very clear that he accepts the Sanders movement's critique of Democratic politicians who gave in too readily to the right-wing political consensus that Ronald Reagan established after 1980. Democrats have spent too much time negotiating with themselves and offering preemptive concessions that rarely won them Republican support. They built the Affordable Care Act around Republican ideas, made one change after another at the GOP's request - and won not a single Republican vote on final passage. When they are in power, Democrats are terribly sensitive to Republican criticisms of deficit spending, and they work to bring budgets under control; then they look on when Republicans win power and let the red ink flow freely to finance tax cuts for their wealthy supporters. Sanders's backers are understandably tired of Democrats always looking over their right shoulders. 
Biden also should reject the premise of another foolish argument: that Democrats must choose between restoration or transformation as the core goal of the next four years. Plainly, the country needs both. Restoring the norms and values that Trump has ripped apart is a precondition of progress. But that's the point: What voters seek to restore is progress.
The next president needs to be mindful that Trump's election was a sign of how much transformation the country needs. The growing economic inequalities of the past 40 years - with their racial, regional and individual components - helped Trump win and made it easier for him to divide the country into warring factions. 
And here is what Biden and Sanders should acknowledge together: Democrats are a far more progressive party today than they were even in 2008, when Barack Obama was elected president. This is true both because of pressure from the inside - from Sanders and Warren, and from new left-of-center voices such as Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (N.Y.) and Ayanna Pressley (Mass.) - and because nearly everyone has a less sanguine view of unregulated capitalism since the great crash of 2008. 

Polling in the past few weeks suggests that 80 percent or more of Sanders's supporters are already inclined to vote for Biden over Trump. If Biden reaches out, as he should, Sanders should reciprocate by dissociating himself more forcefully than he has from the most toxic among the Bernie Bros - even though he also has a right to remind Democrats that the vast majority of his backers are idealistic partisans for social justice who don't spend their lives on Twitter. One Sanders organizer asked me in Iowa in January: ""Why do the media judge us by the loudest of our supporters rather than the kindest of our supporters?"" Sanders should also stop claiming that Biden's victory was a product of dastardly moves by ""the Democratic establishment."" In fact, Biden's victory was built on a foundation of African American votes in South Carolina and elsewhere, and on the intense desire of millions of middle-class Democrats to beat Trump.
It takes a coalition to save a country, and coalitions are hard. They succeed when their members focus on what they share rather than what pulls them apart. Starting with Sunday's debate, Biden and Sanders have to begin a process of reconciliation that will send a message to their respective supporters, and the rest of the nation, that change begins with getting Trump out of office - but it won't end there.
Two men in their late 70s should be especially mindful of how history will judge them. If they get this wrong, nothing else they have done will matter.

Technology - specifically the Internet - has upended primaries, robbing parties of power, just as it has upended almost everything else. There's no going back to the days when ""the party"" could stop an insurgent candidate. Good or bad, that's reality. 
Donald Trump's takeover of the Republican Party in 2016 proved that the GOP is spent as a candidate-selecting force. An insurgent from outside the party, armed with a bellicose Twitter account, demolished the establishment - which then lined up behind him.
The Democratic Party's power to choose its nominee is over, too. There are many reasons for this, but the biggest change has been the rise of small-donor money.
Once, if the party's big-dinner donors all moved behind the establishment front-runner, the front-runner was guaranteed to become the nominee. That all changed with Howard Dean's campaign, which I managed in 2004. With very primitive online fundraising tools, we broke the record for the most money raised by a Democrat to that point. The establishment rallied to stop Dean, and won. But four years later, Barack Obama rolled over the pro-Clinton establishment, raising close to half a billion dollars from small online donations. In 2020, Joe Biden's reliance on the establishment donor base puts him at a disadvantage relative to candidates who can outraise him online (not to mention the billionaires).
Voters hold the power now. But the one area where a party can exert some control is its primary calendar. If the first primary had been in South Carolina, not Iowa, we might be talking about a Joe Biden-Kamala Harris race. Here's the challenge: How do we offer an early contest that allows someone like Pete Buttigieg to come out of nowhere but is also diverse enough to be representative of the nation? 
I propose that the first ""primary"" should not be held in a state or a regional group of states. Rather, clusters of three congressional districts in three different regions of the country would be the sites of the first contest. Ideally, the clusters would be in areas Democrats need to win in a general election. So in the Southwest, three congressional districts from Nevada, Arizona and New Mexico would make up one cluster; in the Midwest, it would be districts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Ohio; and in the Southeast, the districts might be drawn from North Carolina, Georgia and Florida. These places would all hold primaries on the same day in February. Nine congressional districts would be small enough to give a dark-horse contender a chance to break out, yet the results might also help voters measure the strength of the candidates across three regions.
It may not be perfect, but it's better than what we've got.

AKRON, Ohio "" By the time Mike Bloomberg sniffed the hydroponic basil growing in an old tire factory here, he had already traveled 1,700 miles in three hops on his chartered plane, met with the mayor of Chicago and climbed into a soybean tractor on the frozen plains of southern Minnesota.
It was a show of force "" four states in less than 17 hours on Wednesday, each event meticulously produced for local press, with separate rented motorcades and a button-down advance staff that choreographed his movements like a ballet. No other presidential candidate in the Democratic field would have tried to pull this off in January. 
As the cameras shuttered before the purple grow lights of an urban farm, he asked whether anyone knew the difference between a good salesman and a great one. The good salesman, he explained, can face rejection at one door and move on to the next just as convinced he will make the sale. 
'The great salesman knocks on the same door,' he said with a sly smile. 
The thing that makes Bloomberg different is that he can knock on all doors at once. Bloomberg is running aggressively to win the Democratic nomination, but he is simultaneously building out a general election machine to defeat President Trump, with a new structure "" data, field organizing, advertising and policy "" that aims to elect Democrats up and down the ballot even if the party's voters reject the former New York mayor this spring. 
The party he is moving to transform, which he only rejoined in October, has become little more than a bystander to his ambition. With more than 800 employees, $200 million in ad spending so far and a fully catered Times Square office that houses hundreds of employees, 'Mike Bloomberg 2020, Inc.' does not resemble a primary campaign in any traditional sense. It is an experiment in what happens to democracy when a single faction operates without economic constraints. 
While most presidential efforts start early and poor, the Bloomberg project exists in an inverted dimension, a fact that has caught the attention of Trump, who spent years closely tracking Bloomberg's political career in New York. The president has been monitoring Bloomberg's campaign, impressed by his extraordinary spending and fearful of his potential rise, according to Trump confidants with whom the president has discussed Bloomberg. They spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy.

Bloomberg's aides, in turn, have delighted in trying to find ways to get Trump's attention and increase his anxiety, such as the recent purchase of an $11 million Super Bowl ad that will run against a similar spot purchased by Trump's campaign. When Trump tweeted an attack on Bloomberg on Monday, the former mayor's team was delighted.
'Glad to see you're watching our ads,' Bloomberg tweeted in response. 
The extravagance is part of the message, an attempt to demonstrate his competence and show that he can manage something big with good intentions. 
'We also want people to know that we are building a juggernaut pointed at Donald Trump and the Republican Party,' said Tim O'Brien, a senior adviser to the campaign who has been taking the message to state parties around the country. 'One of Mike's goals is to make a machine that lasts. This idea that he wants to do a vanity run or is just buying exposure is belied by that.'

To begin with, that means building a fully staffed general election campaign in January to win primary contests in March, with a suite of high-profile recruits on the payroll, including former top executives for Facebook, Foursquare and GroupM, the world's largest advertising media company by billings. No one at headquarters knows what he will ultimately choose to spend, but they operate for the moment without budgets, putting the 12th-richest person on the planet on a path to spend $1-billion or more.
He wants Democrats to know he is happy to spread the money around. During a swing through Texas on Saturday, when his campaign staged more than 150 events in 27 states in a show of organizing prowess, he cast himself as a potential benefactor and mentor for all state and local party organizations. 
'I think you look at each,' Bloomberg said, when asked whether he would boost them. 'You look to see how well they're run, and if you tried to help, that you'd be able to help. That's number one. And number two would be that your money would be used efficiently. And it's not just money. We can bring some advice.'
Whether he wins or loses the nomination, the ubiquitous television and digital ads he is running have been crafted as the opening exchange in a conversation about Trump's failures that will continue through November.
'I am looking forward to making a multi-month-long case to voters that will end on Election Day with his defeat,' says Howard Wolfson, a top adviser overseeing the paid media efforts. 
New health-care spots that began airing Monday focus nearly as much on attacking Trump as introducing Bloomberg. 'America is sick of Donald Trump, and America is getting sicker,' begins one ad voice-over, as the screen shows unflattering photos of the president. 'There are 1 million more uninsured Americans every year under Trump.' 
In a sign of how closely Trump is monitoring Bloomberg's spots, the president responded Monday to a new ad that denounced Trump for supporting a Justice Department lawsuit to overturn protections for people with preexisting conditions. 
'Mini Mike Bloomberg is spending a lot of money on False Advertising,' Trump wrote, in a tweet that was itself misleading. 'I was the person who saved Pre-Existing Conditions in your Healthcare.' 
(Trump argues that he will urge Congress to reinstate the protections if he succeeds in court at removing them.)
Bloomberg's data operation, cryptically called Hawkfish, aims to incorporate expensive demographic and targeting data, parts of which can later be fed back into the party's databases or repurposed for the broader fight against Trump and Republicans. The fact that he is a candidate gives him greater access to party data than he would otherwise have, and as a candidate, he also benefits from lower television ad rates in swing states before their primary contests than he would if he simply advertised against Trump as a regular citizen. 
The massive campaign staffs he has been bringing on in swing states "" 60 in Arizona and more than 80 in North Carolina, for example, at a time when most candidates are focused in Iowa "" have been promised jobs through the July convention or November election, long after his primary campaign closes up shop.
On the walls of the campaign headquarters in Manhattan, on a floor previously occupied by the New York Times, two digital countdown clocks hang in pairs. One ticks to Super Tuesday, March 3, when Bloomberg hopes to pick up delegates in 14 states after declining to campaign in the first four contests. The other aims at the general election in November. 
'Either it is going to be the best primary campaign in American history, or the greatest IE that has ever been created,' said campaign manager Kevin Sheekey, using the political lingo for an independent expenditure campaign, the super PAC-type efforts that wealthy interests use to influence elections. 
All parts of any campaign that have been run before "" an aggressive constituency operation, a surrogate team, a Spanish-language effort, local media teams in dozens of states so far "" have been built out. Top aides have been telling Bloomberg to give his cellphone number to superdelegates whose support could play a decisive role in a contested convention. 
His campaign is turning out a steady stream of campaign swag "" sold at cost, not to raise money "" in the hopes of a coming demand for 'I LIKE MIKE' and 'Democracy is not a witch hunt' T-shirts.
His own social set has been taken care of, as well. Even though Bloomberg will not accept campaign contributions, part of his political operation, called Committee for Mike, is courting Wall Street executives, New York philanthropists and other local leaders with special events and weekly invite-only conference calls. The request is influence. 
'Amplify our message by acting as validators in the media, within your professional network, and other spheres,' the campaign wrote in a recent email to the group, after Bloomberg invited dozens to a campaign breakfast briefing at one of his Upper East Side buildings.
Despite all the spending, his primary hopes depend largely on factors well beyond his control. If former vice president Joe Biden performs well in the early states, Bloomberg's moderate appeal will likely be overshadowed. But in the case of a stumble, or a divided field, Bloomberg could position himself as a party broker with a minority of delegates, or as a moderate unity candidate, aiming to bring together the party. 
On the campaign trail, much of what he is doing in the meantime is defiant in its vague appeal. An engineer by nature who likes to talk about delegating authority, he is focused on process and efficient message delivery. Despite 12 years as mayor, he is still learning to emote and talk with his hands. His campaign signs have the same blue-on-blue design used by the 2012 Obama campaign, and his entrance song at events, lifted from John F. Kerry's acceptance speech at the 2004 convention, is U2's 'Beautiful Day.'
His policy, though sometimes nuanced on paper, is uncomplicated in presentation, leaning heavily on phrases known to move focus groups. 

'My pitch, I guess,' he told more than 500 potential supporters in Ohio on Wednesday, reading from notes, 'is if you want health insurance for everyone, if you want to combat inequality with fairer taxes and better jobs, if you want to share my belief in opportunity for all, if you support a commitment to quality education in this country for everybody, if you want to clean out the White House, clean out the Oval Office, if you want to get things done, join Team Bloomberg.' 
At an earlier event in Chicago, only a couple hundred showed up, and some of them seemed less than convinced. One group of a half-dozen younger attendees in the audience said they found out about the event through their employer, which one young woman said she was 'scared' to identify. 
But a few feet away, fear of a different sort had produced real support. 'We are really scared,' said Brenda Gordon, a teacher of dentistry from Chicago, speaking of Trump. She said she came to the event after signing up for the email list for a man she believed could win, whom she called 'my exception to the old white man rule.' 
'He is everything Trump wishes he was,' she said. 'He is a real billionaire.' 
As Bloomberg finished his remarks in Akron, and prepared to travel back to Queens, where his day had begun, he admitted that he was not looking forward to the fourth flight.
But he also wanted the crowd to know that he is just getting started.
 'Tomorrow, it starts again,' he said. 'I'm the luckiest guy in the world.'

Mike Bloomberg, the former New York mayor who poured half a billion dollars into his presidential campaign, dropped out of the race on Wednesday and endorsed the surging candidacy of Joe Biden, whose string of victories on Super Tuesday has upended the nominating contest. 
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who lost 10 of 14 state primaries to Biden on Tuesday, adopted a more aggressive tone with the former vice president Wednesday as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) flew home to Boston to reassess her campaign, weighing whether to end her bid and allow liberals in the party to unite behind Sanders the way moderates quickly coalesced for Biden. 
After a head-spinning four days, a primary race that began with a historically large and diverse field - powered by a half-dozen women attempting to tap into an activated female electorate - has now boiled down to two white men in their late 70s who each have spent about a half-century running for political office. 
Biden and Sanders are now preparing to catapult their candidacies into a new round of contests over the next two Tuesdays, when 10 more states will vote and award nearly 900 additional delegates, a stretch that could determine the race. 
As the results from the states that voted on Super Tuesday became more definitive, the shape of the campaign shifted swiftly and forcefully. Sanders cruised into Super Tuesday hoping to surge to a potentially insurmountable lead. But now, Biden is narrowly ahead - and looking at a more favorable map as demographics in the upcoming contests largely tilt in his direction. Biden has 433 delegates to Sanders's 388, with California still tallying results.
Voter turnout in several states was dramatically higher than in 2016, with Democratic voters motivated to choose a nominee who they hope can unseat President Trump. But Sanders, whose campaign has long argued that it was expanding the electorate with new, younger voters, conceded that had not happened. 
""Have we been as successful as I would hope in bringing young people in?"" Sanders said to reporters at a campaign office in Burlington, Vt. ""The answer is no.""
Sanders for months has had trouble taking a sharp line against Biden, jabbing occasionally at him as if they were in a fight on the Senate floor rather than a brawl for the Democratic nomination. But the future of his candidacy may depend on whether he can trigger a seismic shift in how voters view the former vice president. 
""Joe Biden is someone I've known for many years. I like Joe, I think he is a very decent human being,"" Sanders told reporters Wednesday. ""Joe and I, we have a very different voting record. Joe and I have a very different vision for the future of this country, and Joe and I are running very different campaigns, and my hope is, in the coming months, we'll be able to debate and discuss the very significant differences that we have.""
Sanders, who has been criticized for the bullying and vitriol that some of his supporters employ on social media, also reiterated that he does not want the campaign to turn into a ""Trump-type effort where we're attacking each other, where it's personal attacks - that's the last thing this country wants."" 
Sanders and Warren spoke earlier on Wednesday, and she told him that she is assessing her campaign's future. 
Roger Lau, Warren's campaign manager, sent an all-staff email Wednesday morning thanking them and explaining that the candidate will make a decision about her future in coming days.
""Last night, we fell well short of viability goals and projections, and we are disappointed in the results,"" Lau wrote, according to a copy of the email obtained by The Washington Post. ""We are going to announce shortly that Elizabeth is talking to the team to assess the path forward.""
He also asked that Warren be given some time to figure out her next move. ""This decision is in her hands, and it's important that she has the time and space to consider what comes next,"" Lau wrote. 
Warren and Sanders spoke by phone Wednesday. Their top surrogates and allies have discussed ways for them to unite and push a common liberal agenda, The Post reported Wednesday.
Aside from Warren, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), who has earned a single delegate from American Samoa, is the only other candidate remaining. 
Bloomberg's strange ride
Bloomberg's exit from the race concluded one of the most unusual campaigns in politics, in which a billionaire tested the limits of money's impact on the first stages of a highly volatile presidential primary race. 
But after dismal results - picking up delegates but failing to win a single state outright - the former mayor on Wednesday morning called Biden to discuss his decision. 
""I'm sorry we didn't win. It's still the best day of my life, and tomorrow's going to be even better,"" Bloomberg said to cheers from a crowd later in the day in New York. He reiterated that he ""entered the race for president to defeat Donald Trump, and today I am leaving the race for the same reason.""
Bloomberg has pledged to employ large field staffs in six swing states in the general election, even though he is no longer a candidate. The billionaire's data operation, Hawkfish, will also continue operating to elect Democrats up and down the ballot. 
""Mike fully intends to put his resources and commitment in the broadest way possible behind Joe Biden's candidacy,"" said Tim O'Brien, a senior adviser to Bloomberg. ""We have long-term leases and long-term contracts with the team, and the intention was always to put this big machine we have built behind whoever the nominee is.""
Bloomberg's aides, however, have not announced whether they will take out ads in the primary campaign to help Biden or whether Bloomberg campaign staffers in upcoming primary states will work for Biden's nomination.
Campaign finance rules generally give self-funded campaigns significant leeway to spend money, even if the funds support other candidates. Bloomberg also has the option of renaming or rehiring his staff as part of a separate independent group to help Biden, according to campaign finance experts. 
Biden is not the only Democrat in the party eager for Bloomberg to stay invested. 
Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), who benefited in 2018 from a $20 million donation Bloomberg gave to an outside group supporting Senate Democrats, released a statement after Bloomberg left the race. 
""Mayor Michael Bloomberg's deep and impactful record of action on gun safety, fighting climate change, and advocating for immigration reform made him a strong and worthy competitor in this primary,"" Schumer said. ""His continuing commitment to these fights - and to defeating the divisive and damaging Trump presidency - is statesmanlike and will permanently inure to his credit."" 
There are six states voting on Tuesday, awarding 352 delegates. The largest prize is Michigan, but Missouri and Washington state also have large hauls. Biden is poised to do well in Mississippi, which has the same demographics as the Southern states he swept on Tuesday.
Perhaps the only major moment to change the race comes during a March 15 debate in Phoenix. Two days later, four important bellwether states - Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio - vote and award 577 delegates, the second-biggest single-day haul remaining in the race.
By the end of March, nearly two-thirds of the delegates will have been awarded, and pressure will grow on any candidate who doesn't have a chance at reaching a majority to drop out of the race. It takes 1,991 delegates to win the nomination.
Biden's Texas upset
Biden carried 10 of 14 Super Tuesday states. He swept the South and won in the Upper Midwest, carried Massachusetts and Maine, and scored a major upset by winning Texas. 
Sanders won his home state of Vermont, as well as Colorado and Utah, and was expected to win the biggest delegate prize of California.

Most tallies had Biden with an overall lead of about 45 delegates. Perhaps more important, he was able to build a powerful coalition that included African American voters and the white working class, winning over women in the suburbs and disaffected Republicans. 
Turnout was up sharply in many of the states, with nearly every one voting in bigger numbers than in 2016 and some states exceeding the 2008 contest that has been the modern barometer for voter enthusiasm. 
In Texas, turnout was up about 60 percent compared with 2016, while Tennessee saw a 37 percent increase. 
About 1.3 million voters in Virginia cast ballots in the Democratic primary, up from the previous record of about 986,000 during the 2008 contest. 
There are still significant risks for Biden, and he will test whether voters care about his verbal gaffes or whether Republican attempts to re-litigate the actions of his son Hunter will gain additional traction. Biden's son served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, while he was vice president and attempting to crack down on corruption in Ukraine. While there has been no evidence of wrongdoing, the actions of the Bidens became a part of Trump's impeachment trial.
Biden's campaign - and his growing list of prominent endorsers - has increasingly tried to showcase his character and empathy. 
They say that making the contrast between a longtime politician who even opponents say is a good and decent person will provide a strong contrast with Trump, who has stretched traditional limits of civility and discourse.
""We set high expectations for the campaign [on Tuesday], and he absolutely blew through those expectations and had a record-breaking night,"" said Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.), co-chairman of the Biden campaign. ""People know Joe Biden. He's authentic. He has empathy. He's concerned, and he has experience.""

Concern high after activists rush the stage at Super Tuesday rally
Joe Biden's presidential campaign on Wednesday began privately deliberating whether to formally request Secret Service protection for the candidate, according to a person with knowledge of the situation, a day after protesters rushed the stage at his event in Los Angeles in what experts called a major security breach.
Both Biden and fellow candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) rely on private security firms to handle their public appearances, which is unusual this late in a presidential campaign cycle in comparison with 2016, 2012 and 2008. But their emergence over the past week as the clear front-runners in the Democratic primaries has prompted calls for the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the U.S. Secret Service, to authorize full-time protection for both of them.
""Taking into consideration the remaining candidates' large campaign operations, high polling averages, as well as physical threats to their safety . . . I urge you to immediately initiate the consultation process to determine whether to provide USSS protection"" to Biden and Sanders, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss), the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, wrote in a letter Wednesday to acting DHS secretary Chad Wolf.
Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.), a member of the Homeland Security Committee and co-chair of Biden's campaign, told reporters that Democratic lawmakers were ""worried about"" security for the Democrats on the campaign trail even before the incident at Biden's speech on Super Tuesday.
The Biden campaign has begun deliberating over whether to move forward with a formal request to the Secret Service, according to the person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to comment freely about a sensitive security matter. The Sanders campaign did not immediately respond to questions on the subject. The DHS also did not respond to a request for comment.
The onstage skirmish during the former vice president's remarks in Los Angeles highlighted the potential risks for candidates addressing large crowds. A pair of vegan activists holding signs reading ""Let Dairy Die"" rushed the stage before being physically pushed and pulled away by bystanders including Biden's wife, Jill, and a campaign aide in a video that has circulated widely online.
The incident was a ""massive security failure,"" said Jonathan Wackrow, a risk-management consultant at Teneo who served as a Secret Service agent in the agency's Presidential Protective Division. ""These were environmental activists. Anyone aligning with a specific ideology is potentially dangerous. I think both Bernie and Biden would want it at this point.""
The question over which presidential candidates deserve taxpayer-funded Secret Service protection, and when such protection should begin, can be a tricky calculation - for federal officials and the candidates themselves. Under federal guidelines, a candidate must meet minimum standards that include being a ""major"" candidate in his or her party - generally defined as a someone who is regularly appearing at rallies, conducting a national campaign and receiving at least 15 percent support in established polls. Biden and Sanders both meet such requirements.
Campaigns must request protection from the DHS, and a bipartisan congressional advisory committee - led by the Senate majority leader, currently Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) - helps review the request before the DHS secretary makes a decision.
Outsourcing security to the federal government can be a boon for cash-strapped campaigns and also bestow a heightened legitimacy on candidates. But some candidates in past presidential campaign cycles have tried to hold off over concerns that a large security entourage could hamper their ability to interact more directly with supporters.
Both Biden, during his eight years as vice president, and Sanders, during his 2016 contest against Hillary Clinton for the Democratic presidential nomination, have received Secret Service protection in the past.
""Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden need secret service protection,"" Robert Gibbs, a White House press secretary under President Barack Obama, said on MSNBC on Tuesday. Of the skirmish at Biden's event, he added: ""What happened tonight was nothing short of genuinely scary. . . . They should have Secret Service protection in the next 24 to 48 hours.""
Obama received Secret Service protection earlier than any other candidate - in May 2007, nearly a year and a half before the 2008 election. The congressional advisory committee at the time warned that the first viable African American candidate for the White House faced an unusually high security risk. (Hillary Clinton, who also was running for the Democratic nomination at the time, already received Secret Service protection in her capacity as a former first lady.)
In 2012, the eventual Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, got protection in February of that year, while Donald Trump and Ben Carson, running for the GOP nomination in the 2016 cycle, began receiving Secret Service coverage in November 2015.
In 2016, Trump and Clinton had instances at their campaign events in which Secret Service agents jumped onstage to surround them over concerns about protesters.
As president, Trump receives round-the-clock protection. Former presidents continue to have smaller Secret Service details - but Biden no longer is granted such protections as a former vice president.
Wackrow, the former agent, has not seen intelligence reports about the 2020 candidates. But he suggested Biden's threat profile might be magnified because of President Trump's unfounded allegations that the former vice president had acted improperly when his son Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company.
That accusation led Trump last summer to privately pressure Ukraine's president to open an investigation into the Bidens, a demand that ultimately led House Democrats to impeach Trump. The president has berated the Bidens in public remarks and called on China to open an investigation into Hunter Biden's business activities in that country.
""They've now made him a target,"" Wackrow said. ""It's all rhetoric, but rhetoric can transcend to physical harm.""

KEENE, N.H. "" Within three minutes of getting in line for an Elizabeth Warren rally, I've been handed a business card for a woman-empowerment organization called Brass Ovaries, and the founder, my linemate, has drawn me into a conversation about Warren that has begun to feel like the only conversation to have about Warren: the kind that's about hope, and despair, and how it's possible to love America and also want to throw it out the window.
'I went to one of her events before, and I gave her one of my Brass Ovaries pins,' Michelle Johnson says. 'And I started to explain how it's about fed-up women "" but she said, 'Oh, I get it,' and I said, 'I knew you would,' because Elizabeth always gets it, doesn't she?'
This is the first part of the Warren conversation. It involves dreaming of a version of the country where leaders are excellent at explaining certain things, such as the current shortcomings of health care and child care; and where they don't need other things explained to them at all, like what it feels like to be an exasperated woman.
But Michelle, who plans to vote for Warren in her state's Tuesday primary, also finds herself having a second, more maddening part of the Warren conversation. When she told her mother that she thought Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.) would be a good running mate, her mother blanched. 'America isn't ready for two women on the ticket,' she said, then added that America might not even be ready for one.
That part is about fear. It's about fearing a version of America that was certified as the real version four Novembers ago, when Hillary Clinton lost to Donald Trump. Or so people keep saying.
It's a conversation that isn't really about Elizabeth Warren at all; it's about the rest of us.

There we were in New Hampshire, in the exhaust fumes of Iowa's caucuses, which had been such a spectacular fiasco that Warren's supporters in Keene now believed it was up to them to sort things out and, ideally, to sort things out for Warren. For all the chaos in Des Moines, one thing was clear: Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg were wrestling through a tie with a quarter of the votes apiece.
And Warren, who had topped polls in October, had finished a distant third.
This alone didn't faze her New Hampshire supporters. She'd outpaced the erstwhile front-runner Joe Biden, after all, who took his fourth-place finish as a 'gut punch.' Plus, while Iowa was 'a bunch of people running around in a gymnasium,' as one voter here put it, their state's election was a civilized primary, and was also in the backyard of the senator from Massachusetts.
But then a new prediction came out. It had Warren polling at 10 percent in the Granite State. Behind Sanders. Behind a rising Buttigieg. Behind even Joe Biden. (She's fared better in other recent polls but still well behind Sanders and Buttigieg.)
Then Warren's campaign announced that it was pulling ad dollars in Nevada and South Carolina.
Then it was time to really think about Elizabeth Warren. Which really means sorting through what version of America you believe in "" the one where we are ready to vote a woman into the Oval Office, or the one where we aren't "" and whether it's the believing, one way or another, that makes your version true.




'The thing is, I can picture her up there on the debate stage with Trump, and she's debating him to pieces,' says Deb Wilson, a retired New Hampshire educator. 'To pieces.'
'We need her,' says Wendy Keith, a social worker. 'We need her so badly. We need someone that strong and that smart.'
'I think having a woman in the White House "" I think she'll care for us,' adds Esther Scheidel, standing next to Wendy.
'Of course, I'm not voting for her because she's a woman; I don't even think of her as a woman,' another supporter chimes in a few minutes later, having overheard the earlier conversation, 'I think of her as a candidate.'
Then this line-stander decides he doesn't want to be quoted after all and shoos me away, but it's a preposterous statement, right? It's a preposterous, relatable, vexing statement. It's impossible not to see Warren as a woman. Many of her policies were explicitly shaped by that identity, as she readily acknowledges. Is 'not thinking of Warren as a woman' supposed to be a compliment?
What I think this man means is that ever since 2016, we have been trapped in a vague debate about electability, and whether it's only men who have it. In the fog of uncertainty over Hillary Clinton's complicated defeat (she neglected Wisconsin, she used a private email server, she was a 'nasty woman' slain by weaponized misogyny, she still won the popular vote), the debate has mutated into an abstract panic about whether any woman can get elected in 2020.
Trying to ignore Elizabeth Warren's femaleness is an attempt to neatly sidestep the whole problem. To pretend that we have the capacity to vote entirely on merits. To behave as if each election can happen in a vacuum, uninformed by the elections and the hundreds of years of history that came before it.
Can you ignore that while Pete Buttigieg might be a millennial wunderkind, a female 38-year-old mayor of a midsize town would have a hard time being taken as seriously if she up and ran for president? Can you ignore that Bernie Sanders's shouting is seen as righteous but if Kamala Harris ever raised her voice, it was seen as anger? How did Joe Biden automatically get to wear the cloak of electability for nearly a full year before Iowa tore it off?
Warren has made some massive bungles "" the DNA test, ugh "" but is it ever, ever possible to scientifically determine how much 'I don't like her' is a code for 'I wouldn't like any woman'?
These days, of course, people don't say, 'I won't vote for a woman'; they say, 'I'm scared my moderate father-in-law needs a man on the ballot to motivate him to the polls.'
This isn't progress. This is treating the election as a psychic reading.
'I'm leaning toward Warren,' says Frank Brownell, a retired editor who relocated to Keene from Upstate New York. 'I'm not a big Buttigieg fan. But I want to pick someone to win.' He sighed, deeply troubled. 'Women have such a burden. I actually wish women ran the world.'
If he wished women ran things, I asked him, was there a reason he was still merely leaning toward Warren? Here was a woman he liked who was offering to run the country, and he literally had the chance to give her the job.
'I'm going to vote for her,' he decided, then waffled. 'I don't know, I don't know.'
His qualms weren't with Warren. He loved Warren. His qualms were about everyone else, everyone else who might not be ready to vote for a woman. 'I'm hopeful but I'm not hopeful. I don't think America is what I always hoped it was.'




Here are some things that happen at Elizabeth Warren events: Warren sprints onstage, much tinier and slighter than she appears on television, to Dolly Parton singing '9 to 5.' She shares that she was her parents' late-in-life baby, and her mother never stopped referring to her as 'the surprise.' She talks about her first marriage, and then she jokes that it's never good when you have to number your marriages. She tells a story about a toaster, and the toaster becomes a metaphor for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which she helped create, and the CFBP becomes a metaphor for how things can change, but only if you are willing to believe they can change.
You have to believe; that's the key. You have to jump into the void of possibility. Ready or not.
She is optimistic and upbeat, almost comically so, as if she is Elizabeth Warren playing SNL's Kate McKinnon playing Elizabeth Warren. She is empathetic in a way that could feel phony if you're not accustomed to that sort of thing in a politician.
At one event in New Hampshire, a little girl approaches the microphone, accompanied by her mother.
'My name is Elizabeth,' she says.
'Your name is Elizabeth?' Warren reels back. 'Oh wow! Double Elizabeths! I feel the power.'
'I'm seven years old.'
Warren pauses, deadpan. 'I'm . . . not.'
'I want to know if you will close the camps,' the 7-year-old Elizabeth asks.
Here, Warren's response grows impossibly soft and intimate, so soft that it feels almost indecent to listen to, like this has become a private conversation. The camps in Texas where they are holding children? Warren asks. The 7-year-old nods. Those camps.
'Yes,' Warren says. 'Yes.'
And then people in the audience tear up because in that moment, they did 
seem to believe things could change, that Warren was the best candidate, that others thought so, too, and just needed to be convinced that it's safe to vote for her. That there's nothing to fear in nominating this woman but fear itself.
'If everyone is trying to play that [electability] game,' offers Nancy Loschiavo, a Warren supporter, 'then what has our country come to?'
But, Loschiavo hastens to add, she'll absolutely vote for whomever the nominee is.
Everyone at the Warren events hastens to add that.
A survey had come out a few days before, asking each candidate's supporters whether, assuming their own first choice dropped out, they would vote for whoever was the Democratic nominee. Some supporters professed a my-guy-or-bust attitude "" nearly half of the Yang Gang said they wouldn't vote for another Democrat. But Warren's supporters, more than anyone else, said they'd vote for whomever they needed to vote for.
One way to read this is that Warren doesn't have crossover appeal: She appeals only to the folks who would have voted Democratic no matter what. Another way to read this is that her supporters are as practical as they are passionate: There's an outcome they'd prefer, but if it doesn't happen, they'll move on to the next best thing. They've got a plan for that.
After talking to enough of her fans, I think it's the second explanation. The second explanation, mixed with something deeper:
Loving Elizabeth Warren means planning for America to break your heart.
It means watching her tweet out an optimistic message after Iowa, and then watching how all of the early replies instruct her to defer to Sanders and drop out.
It means making sure to preface your pro-Warren statements with 'I don't have anything against the male candidates,' as if the act of supporting a female one was somehow misandrist in itself.
It means listening to people complain about her schoolmarmishness and quietly wondering what was so wrong, exactly, with sounding like a schoolmarm. What's so wrong with sounding like a grandmother? What's so wrong with her animated hand gestures, her cardigans, her preparedness, her laugh, her husband, her brain, her work, her femaleness, her voice?
It means hoping things will break your way but accepting that they probably wouldn't, because America never quite seems to work that way, does it?
America doesn't just render a verdict on the acceptability of women and their clothes and laughs every four years; America does that every day, in a lot of different ways. That's the reason Michelle Johnson feels moved to make 'brass ovaries' pins, and the reason Elizabeth Warren doesn't have to ask her to explain why.




'The biggest reluctance I hear is 'Can a woman win?' ' says Ron Jones, who, along with his friend Tom Harris, has been canvassing for Warren and had come to see her speak in a Nashua community college gym. 'I point out that a woman has already won,' he said, referring to Clinton's popular-vote victory.
'I tell them, look at other countries with successful female leaders,' says Harris. 'I tell them, look at successful female CEOs.' Or just look around you. 'Women are the majority in the country!' says Jones.
Inside the gym, attendees filled the folding plastic chairs, and when those were full, leaned against the walls, parkas draped over their forearms. Seatmates introduced themselves to one another and talked about why they liked Warren, and why there were still reasons to be hopeful, maybe.
'I just want someone to bring energy back,' M.K. Hayes tells the fellow New Hampshirites sitting next to her. 'And with her, there's no cynicism, but there's urgency. With her, you can say, 'I'm liberal and I'm proud.' '
Her husband likes Warren, too, but he's not here today. He likes her, she explains, but he might not vote for her; he's not sure it's the practical thing to do.
'I am trying to get him to vote with his heart,' Hayes says. 'I am trying to get him to have the courage to risk.'
The music in the gym gets a little louder. When '9 to 5' comes on, Warren sprints onstage. She talks about her family. She talks about her toaster. She says she is running a campaign from the heart, because she believes 2020 is 'our moment.'
'I believe in that America,' Elizabeth Warren says, and then she tries to convince the audience that they believe in that America, too.

Trump and Biden forgo rallies for critical ads and webinars amid pandemic

President Trump calls himself a ""wartime president"" and former vice president Joe Biden says the nation must ""put politics aside,"" but both leaders have allowed their campaigns to launch deeply personal offensives against the other in recent days as they confront a likely general election clash before a
nation
grappling with a viral pandemic. 
The faceoff comes as much of the presidential campaign has been either put on hold or shifted online as the contenders retool for an new era of economic crisis and social distancing. Fundraisers have been postponed, rallies have been canceled, and new technologies are under consideration.
General election strategists have put new polls in the field and shuffled plans for spring advertising campaigns, even as Biden's sole challenger for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), remains in the race. 
Few are willing to predict with any certainty how the events of the past few weeks will affect what is still expected to be a close election in November. But Democrats are hopeful that the crisis will put into sharp relief the arguments they have been making for months. 
Anita Dunn, a senior adviser to Biden, said that the American people were seeing in the pandemic response the consequences of ""the chaos around this president."" 
""There is a price that this nation pays for that behavior,"" Dunn said. ""As we move forward that is going to be a case we prosecute.""
Republicans, by contrast, are hopeful that Trump's role as head of the federal response to the novel coronavirus will insulate him against the coming Democratic critiques about his leadership. Trump has told advisers that his daily news conferences are helping him because they show him involved, and advisers are hoping to utilize the video footage of New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo praising the president in ads.
""Anybody who attempts to politicize and weaponize a public health crisis is revealed to be petty and peevish,"" said White House counselor Kellyanne Conway. ""To criticize Trump now is to criticize public health officials, FEMA, first responders, private-sector businesses that are all coming forward to help.""
Neither side has pulled its punches in near-daily diatribes.
Trump's campaign communications director accused Biden of pushing critiques of Trump that ""dangerously undermine the federal public health effort by purposely sowing confusion and fear merely for the sake of politics."" 
Biden, who has refrained from criticizing Trump while he is abroad out of respect for the office, told reporters Friday that Trump ""is falsely telling us he's taking action he has not taken, promising results he's not delivering and announcing actions that he has not even ordered.""
Biden's campaign also released a digital video accusing Trump of adopting a ""don't test, don't tell mind-set"" that failed to prepare the nation for the coronavirus.
As it adjusts to the pandemic, the Biden campaign has been scrambling to build out a new television studio in the recreation room of his Delaware home so he can communicate with voters - his first presentation took place Monday morning - and his staff is exploring technological solutions that would allow him brief interactions over video conference with individual voters that would imitate a rope-line encounter.
The campaign's immediate focus is on the policy response to the virus, but the political message focuses heavily on the Democratic case that Trump has mishandled the crisis. 
Biden used his address Monday to escalate his criticism of Trump's handling of the pandemic, saying he hoped Trump ""steps up and starts to get this right.""
""Trump keeps saying that he's a wartime president,"" Biden said. ""Well, start to act like one.""
""Donald Trump is not to blame for the coronavirus, but he does bear responsibility for our response,"" he added.


The attack builds upon a broader argument that the pandemic confirms concerns many potential swing voters have about Trump. 
""What the coronavirus response has done in very short order is demonstrated an immediate, tangible, significant impact of the president's impulsiveness and the chaos he has sowed,"" said Guy Cecil, the chairman of Priorities USA, a super PAC that plans to spend $150 million in an effort to defeat Trump this year. Priorities bought $6 million in television and digital ads this week in Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, criticizing Trump's virus response and praising Biden's. 
Democrats have also noted with relief that the viral emergency has forced a break in the Trump campaign's effort to disqualify Biden with personal attacks as he tries to unify the Democratic Party and refill his own campaign's considerably inferior coffers. 
""Biden is always going to do best when we look at this election as a referendum on who would be the best commander in chief,"" said Robby Mook, who managed Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. ""And this is a commander in chief moment."" 

Trump campaign advisers do see some liability in how the president handled the opening days of the virus - particularly in the lack of testing and the continuing slow response despite vocal pleas from overwhelmed hospitals. Some close to the president fear that if the stock market continues to drop - and unemployment goes into the double digits - it would be difficult to reelect the president who has cast his central argument as a booming economy. 
Trump has sought to rewrite history in some ways, insisting that he was focused on the pandemic early even as he downplayed it publicly and ignored warnings about its potential on American soil. He also is working to negotiate a large stimulus package that aides hope will have political benefits. 
Trump advisers have been cheered by recent public polling that finds more than half of the country approves of Trump's response to the crisis, a number far better than his typical approval numbers in polls. Some advisers say they believe the country will rally around the president during a crisis.
""Americans want to see their president out front and leading in a time of national crisis and that's exactly what President Trump is doing,"" Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign communications director, said in a statement. ""At the same time, Joe Biden and the Democrats offer nothing but ineffective partisan sniping from the sidelines.""
Biden himself has been pushing a different story line about Trump's performance. 
""The president has been behind the curve throughout this whole response,"" Biden told reporters Friday. ""Stop saying false things that make you sound like a hero . . . Stop, stop, stop swerving between overpromising, buck-passing, and start delivering protection to our people.""
Biden has been talking at length with his advisers to formulate an economic plan. Although staying largely in the background, he has been in frequent contact with House and Senate Democratic leaders to keep tabs on legislation that they are crafting and to offer his own feedback. While Trump has been holding calls with governors, Biden has, too. He has been in contact with Cuomo, Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee (D), and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D), among others.
But he has been frustrated that he's confined to his home in Wilmington, Del. - the virus has a higher mortality rate among older Americans like Biden, who is 77 years old - and the constraints that limitation has placed on his campaign. 
His advisers feel he is at a distinct disadvantage in an all-digital campaign because Biden's strength lies in the way he builds an emotional rapport with voters face-to-face, a type of campaigning that will be hindered now that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging Americans to avoid crowds larger than 10 people. 
Now, he has said, when campaign aides enter his home, they are first putting on masks and wearing gloves. 
The biggest shift in Biden's digital strategy is in fundraising. Over the weekend he held two high-dollar virtual fundraisers - appearing via video. But at the same time he was hoping to escalate his online fundraising appeals among those willing to give smaller amounts, aides said, the economic crisis has made them wary of hammering supporters over the head asking for money. Instead, they are trying softer approaches, sending emails that try to draw people into the campaign in other ways.
An aide said Biden's vast army of high-profile endorsers, many of them former presidential candidates, will probably be featured in digital events soon, too, perhaps even holding their own events. Former Olympic figure skater Michelle Kwan, who has campaigned for Biden in several states, has volunteered to host yoga online during the time of quarantine. 
Trump begins what is effectively the start of the general election with a vast advantage in money, but replenishing his accounts is suddenly more problematic. One Republican strategist involved in the Trump campaign's efforts said it was a difficult time to ask for money because the markets are down and people are worried.
The president has no fundraisers or rallies planned at the moment, though Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, RNC finance chairman Todd Ricketts and others continue to make fundraising calls behind the scenes. 
Volunteers from Trump Victory, the RNC's field effort, are still calling supporters; a Republican official with knowledge of the matter said they made 1.4 million calls on Saturday. Officials working in battleground states across the country are holding webinars with field organizers and volunteers to strategize on reaching voters. (Trump's headquarters staffers, as well as Biden's, are working from home to lower their risk of catching the virus.)
The Trump campaign plans to lean on its significant data operation in the coming months to communicate digitally with supporters.
""The campaign and RNC have built up a massive, unparalleled database containing the contact information of tens of millions of voters and we are putting that information to work to maintain contact with voters and spread the President's message,"" Murtaugh said. ""We continue to consider new, creative ways to interact with voters, provide them with information, and let them know how they can help.""
American Bridge, another Democratic group spending money to defeat Trump, recently released a new digital ad that cuts together quotes from Trump downplaying the severity of the coronavirus with reports of the horrific potential consequences of the pandemic. 
Bradley Beychok, president of American Bridge, said the group was going to conduct research over the coming weeks about how to best push a message in television ads to hurt Trump among white working-class voters in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
Like other Democrats, he was hopeful that the president's support would take a hit.
""Trump's superpower sometimes is deflection,"" Beychok said. ""It is a very hard thing for Trump to distract people from what is going on right now.""

A scrappy coalition of activist groups supporting Sen. Bernie Sanders plans to intensify its fundraising and organizing efforts against the Democratic establishment, which is coalescing around former vice president Joe Biden after recent presidential primary wins.
The sprawling network of socialists, climate-change activists, millennial organizers and other liberal advocates, who raise money from millions of members and have knocked on many doors in support of Sanders (I-Vt.), say they plan to cite the coronavirus outbreak and the uncertain economy to advance him as the only candidate who can enact broad economic and environmental change.
Their efforts come even as major Democratic super PACs line up to spend millions for Biden as the candidate they consider best positioned to win the party's nomination.
Sanders, a prolific fundraiser in his own right among donors giving in smaller amounts, defied expectations to win early nominating contests before falling behind in delegates in recent weeks.
""It really looked like Bernie Sanders was winning, and now we're back into something that's a little more familiar: being the underdog,"" said Alan Minsky, executive director of Progressive Democrats of America, one of the groups in the People Power for Bernie coalition. ""The progressive left has not come this close to winning in America in my lifetime.""
Since Super Tuesday on March 3, the landscape of independent groups supporting the two candidates has changed significantly. 
On Biden's side, many of the party's wealthiest donors have embraced his candidacy after sitting on the sidelines or previously supporting other moderates in the primary. They are directing donations to the campaign and to the super PACs that raise and spend unlimited amounts to boost his chances.
These donors - including financier Donald Sussman, one of the party's most generous givers, and billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who dropped out of the race - are newly supporting Biden and giving at an overwhelming clip, according to donors and fundraisers. 
""I've never experienced anything like it,"" said Alan Kessler, a longtime Biden donor and fundraiser, of the onslaught of donor interest. Fundraising for Biden ""was a really tough slog two weeks ago. It's not tough now."" 

Meanwhile, People Power for Bernie said it is prepared for the long haul for the democratic socialist, who still has a narrow path to victory. 
Among those in the coalition are activists working to elect socialists to city councils; housing advocates who want every person in the country to have access to affordable housing; youth activists rallying around combating climate change; protesters who camped outside the Florida governor's office in the wake of Trayvon Martin's death; and undocumented immigrants pushing for immigrant rights.
These groups have held events nationwide promoting Sanders, have filmed viral videos attacking moderate Democrats and have knocked on countless doors on behalf of Sanders. They are sharing talking points on Google Docs and stocking up on print fliers and snacks for door-knocking as they try to mobilize younger and minority voters for Sanders in upcoming contests.
Some activists are less optimistic. At least one group, the Center for Popular Democracy, said that it will remain supportive of Sanders's campaign message but that it is shifting national messaging to be more focused on progressive values because it is ""realistic about the challenges in the road ahead.""
""We always understood that the establishment was never going to be okay with someone as radical and progressive as Sen. Sanders to be the heir apparent to the Democratic nomination for president,"" said Natalia Salgado, political director of Center for Popular Democracy.
In all, at least 16 groups unconnected to the campaign have spent money to promote Sanders by running ads and holding get-out-the-vote campaigns. These groups include the nine organizations in People Power for Bernie. 
Although some of the groups in the coalition are newly formed and have little paper trail, others have existed for a few years and have cash to spend. 
For instance, the Center for Popular Democracy had about $22.6 million in 2017, according to the group's latest tax filing. People's Action, a nonprofit organization, received $7 million in grants in 2017. 

It is unknown how much most of these groups have raised to support Sanders in the 2020 cycle or where they are getting their money because they are not required to disclose their donor lists. Advocates for more transparency in political donations - predominantly on the left - refer to this type of funding as ""dark money."" 
The groups reject that label, saying they have internal measures to vet the sources of their donations so that they are not taking money from billionaires or special interests that would undermine their mission. They said they are respecting their donors' desire to remain private.
""Being an openly socialist organization, for us, it feels very important to protect the privacy of our members while also making it very clear that we don't accept corporate funding,"" said Sean Estelle, one of the leaders of the Democratic Socialists of America's national campaign to support Sanders. 
On Biden's side are some of the most well-funded super PAC operations, whose donors are made public. These groups have spent more than $9.8 million to support Biden, mainly through Unite the Country, a super PAC started by Biden's allies.
Bloomberg, who dropped out of the presidential race after Super Tuesday, is starting a group to run independent expenditures to support Biden. On Wednesday, Bloomberg's campaign published copies of its anti-Trump ads for public use - worth $275 million in ad spending - as the campaign shifts the billionaire's resources to help defeat President Trump in November. 
Priorities USA Action, the main pro-Democratic super PAC, is shifting its advertising messaging to defend Biden - a sign that the establishment considers him the likely nominee.
American Bridge, another major Democratic super PAC, on Wednesday also shifted its general-election messaging to support Biden. It began running $2.2 million in ads in Pennsylvania, aimed at boosting Biden through television, radio and digital ads. 
""The voices of Democratic voters are loud and clear: they want Joe Biden to be our standard-bearer,"" American Bridge President Bradley Beychok said in a statement. ""That's why we are rallying behind his candidacy and will deploy every resource at our disposal from now until November to ensure Joe Biden is the next President of the United States.""

HOUSTON - Joanne Armstrong was tired of screaming at the television. It's why she volunteered for Lizzie Fletcher in 2018. And it's why she doesn't want Bernie Sanders to be the Democratic nominee for president this year.
Armstrong, a physician in her 50s, decided to channel her anger at President Trump two years ago by going door-knocking, for the first time ever, to help Fletcher, a Democratic congressional candidate in the suburban Houston district where she lives. In the midterms, Fletcher toppled nine-term Republican congressman John Abney Culberson, a powerful appropriator, picking up a seat that had been comfortably in GOP hands since George H.W. Bush won it in 1966. 
Armstrong worries that Fletcher, still a freshman, would lose her quest for a second term if Sanders (I-Vt.) is at the top of the ticket and that Trump would handily win a second term. She said it was hard enough to persuade voters to take a chance on a Democratic candidate last time when she could warn while canvassing about how Republicans were trying to destroy the Affordable Care Act without a replacement plan, putting people with preexisting conditions at risk. But Sanders's Medicare-for-all plan also threatens to upend the system, jeopardizing people's private health insurance coverage. Houston is world renowned for its medical centers, especially related to cancer treatment.
""People looked at Trump in 2018 and said this is not who we are. But Bernie also isn't who we in Houston are,"" Armstrong said. ""I'm still tired of screaming at the TV after three years. I don't want four more years.""
Texas is the second-biggest prize on Super Tuesday, behind California, with 228 delegates up for grabs. Houston, the fourth-most-populous city in the country, has become a battleground within the battleground. Harris County, home to Houston, has more than 4 million residents, a bigger population than that of 26 states.
Joe Biden on Monday had a rally scheduled at Texas Southern University. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) spoke to a crowd of 2,000 at an outdoor rally on Saturday night. Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg stumped here last week with the mayor of Houston, who endorsed him. Sanders visited the University of Houston on Feb. 23, where he celebrated his triumph in the Nevada caucuses. 
Two polls published Sunday put Sanders ahead but by significantly different margins among likely voters in the Lone Star State, reflecting the degree to which the contest remains fluid and also how hard it is to predict what the electorate will look like in this evolving megastate. Sanders led Biden 34 percent to 19 percent in an NBC-Marist poll, with Bloomberg at 15 percent and Warren at 10 percent. But Sanders led Biden by only four percentage points, 30 percent to 26 percent, in a CBS-YouGov poll, which was within the margin of error, with Warren at 17 percent and Bloomberg at 13 percent.
Sanders fares particularly poorly in the same well-to-do suburban areas that fueled the Democratic wave in the midterms and where Trump remains most vulnerable. The 7th District, where Fletcher already faces a tough reelection fight, is the sort of place that national Democrats fear they would lose if Sanders leads the ticket. Mitt Romney carried the district with 60 percent of the vote in the 2012 presidential election, but Trump lost it to Hillary Clinton in 2016 with 47 percent. Establishment-minded Democrats worry that voters who don't like Trump or Sanders might stay home, especially moderates who voted for candidates like Fletcher in 2018. They fear that Sanders would galvanize more Republicans than he would bring in the new voters he promises to mobilize.
Armstrong is undecided but eager to vote for a Democrat in Texas's presidential primary on Tuesday who can block Sanders from winning the nomination. She really likes Warren, but she's mainly concerned about beating Trump. She texted all weekend with friends as far away as New Jersey and Massachusetts to mull what she should do. ""I would vote for Joe Biden. He's not my first choice, but I would if I thought he was the only one who could beat Bernie,"" she said. ""I just don't want Bernie. There's a big contingent that doesn't want Bernie, but they're all splitting. . . . Do I vote my conscience, which is Warren? Or do I vote strategically, which is Biden?""
The Galleria, in the heart of Fletcher's district, is one of the largest and ritziest malls in the United States. It has every fancy chain store you can think of, plus an indoor ice-skating rink. It was packed over the weekend as I interviewed more than 30 voters.
Charlotte Sullivan, 70, a retired HR director, looked at Bloomberg but concluded that he's a Democratic version of Trump. ""All my antennae go up,"" Sullivan said. ""It's the feeling that tells me something's not right about him. I've had very few circumstances in my life where that instinct took me in the wrong direction. My gut says, 'Don't go with Bloomberg.' ""
Carol Alvarado, a Democratic state senator who represents Houston, endorsed Biden on Sunday after his win in the South Carolina primary. Democrats picked up a dozen state House seats in 2018 and could win control of the chamber if they gain nine more in 2020. Several of their best pickup opportunities are around Houston. Alvarado, who leads the Senate Democratic Caucus, identified certain seats in both the state House and Senate that they're more likely to win if the former vice president is the nominee.
""We could lose seats if we're having to talk about democratic socialism,"" she explained in an interview. ""And if we lose those seats, that gives Republicans a larger majority - which matters for the next decade."" She's referring to redistricting. The outcome of the 2020 state elections will determine who draws the boundaries that will be in effect until 2031. Alvarado said a Democratic-controlled legislature could also vote to expand Medicaid under the ACA, something Republicans have declined to do. ""There's just so much riding on this election for the future of Texas,"" she said.
Houston is also the epicenter of the American energy industry, and Sanders's plan to ban fracking and pass a Green New Deal makes moderates jittery. When you fly into town, you see the scope of the region's dependence on fossil fuels in the form of tankers and refineries.
""People's livelihoods are directly tied to that industry,"" said Rep. Marc Veasey (D-Tex.). He represents a Fort Worth district, where he notes that many African Americans and Latinos depend on energy industry jobs that Sanders could put in jeopardy. He said union members also regularly express ""worry and concern"" to him that Sanders's Medicare-for-all proposal would take away health-care benefits they've negotiated hard to secure from their employers.
Veasey lamented that Sanders being at the top of the ticket would make it harder to play offense against people like freshman Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Tex.) in the Houston suburbs. Veasey, who endorsed Biden in November, added that many of his Democratic colleagues would have little choice but to distance themselves from Sanders if he's the nominee to get reelected. ""There's absolutely no question about that,"" he told me Sunday.
The CBS-YouGov poll asked likely Democratic voters in Texas which candidate has the best chance of beating Trump, regardless of whom they support. Interestingly, Latino voters said Sanders has the best chance of winning the general, topping Biden by a 24-point margin. Black voters thought Biden had the best chance, besting Sanders by a 25-point margin. White voters were more evenly split: 32 percent said Biden, 28 percent said Sanders, 18 percent said Bloomberg, and 13 percent said Warren.
Anthony Blake, a 35-year-old management consultant, will vote for Sanders in the primary. ""Sometimes I think you've got to fight fire with fire, as terrible as that sounds,"" he said. When I asked about the electability fears expressed by his fellow Houstonians, he pointed to several recent polls that showed Sanders leading Trump in head-to-head matchups and in many cases outperforming other Democrats. ""The data doesn't really show that,"" he said, playing down the concerns of elected lawmakers. 
He added that he comes from a conservative family. ""They've been Republicans for 30 years now, but they dislike Trump,"" he said. ""They're terrified of Bernie right now, but they'll vote for him over Trump."" 
The NBC-Marist poll showed 1 in 4 likely voters in Texas remained undecided. Sarita Gomez-Mola, 70, is among them. The foreign-language interpreter, who lives in the 7th District, said she will cast her ballot for whoever she concludes on primary day has the best chance of blocking Sanders from clinching the nomination, which she acknowledged may be Biden. A friend visiting from New York encouraged her to think about Bloomberg, but she's ""angsting"" over which of the Democratic alternatives to Sanders could best unify the party.
""Will the Sanders voters support Bloomberg? I worry,"" she said. ""But Bernie cannot hijack the Democratic Party. He's divisive, and we're lurching from one extreme to the other. There would be nothing but gridlock. If Barack Obama couldn't get his priorities passed, how is Sanders going to?""
Gomez-Mola's husband is a geologist who works for an oil company. ""All his colleagues are Trumpers,"" she said. ""They will all vote for Trump, no matter who he's up against."" Likewise, she said, she'll vote for any Democratic nominee over Trump. 
""I was born in Cuba, and I'm very afraid of Sanders because of all the changes he wants to make,"" said Gomez-Mola. ""But even if Fidel Castro came back from the grave and was the nominee, I'd support him over Trump. Castro was my nemesis all my life, but Trump is just that bad.""
This is exactly what the Sanders campaign is counting on. The senator's strategists express confidence that dislike for Trump is so strong among Democrats that even moderates will coalesce and consolidate behind Sanders if he wins the nomination.

The campaign for the Democratic nomination has moved at warp speed over the past 10 days, and on Tuesday night it reached a decisive turning point. Barring something unforeseen, Democrats now know that former vice president Joe Biden will be the party's nominee to challenge President Trump in November.
Biden scored a group of victories over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Tuesday, adding to the overwhelming - and unexpected - successes of a week ago on Super Tuesday. He romped in Mississippi, where he was expected to romp. He won handily in Missouri, where Sanders came agonizingly close four years ago. Most important, Biden won where Sanders could not afford to lose, in the general election battleground state of Michigan.
Biden remains well short of the 1,991 pledged delegates needed for a first-ballot victory at the national convention in Milwaukee in July. But with Tuesday's results, he has solidified his lead in the delegate battle and, with the states that will hold their primaries in the next two weeks, that advantage inevitably will grow. Sanders has little time and few delegates remaining to be selected to have much chance of changing the trajectory.
Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio hold primaries next Tuesday. Sanders lost all four to Hillary Clinton in 2016, in many cases by big margins. By the time those four states tally results next week, just over 60 percent of the pledged delegates will have been allocated. A week later comes the Georgia primary and probably another big Biden victory. Given the sudden momentum shift the campaigns have experienced, there is little to give Sanders any confidence that he can reverse the trends enough to overtake the surging Biden.

As a result of Tuesday's results, Sanders and Biden now face new - and different - challenges. For Sanders, it is dealing with the question of how long to keep the fight going in a year when defeating the president is the overriding priority for Democratic voters. For Biden, it is making the pivot to a general election campaign, while bringing unity to his own party.
Sanders is no quitter. He has shown in this campaign and in 2016 that keeping on competing hard and arguing his case are his default positions. That's the case even when the odds look long, as they did last fall after he suffered a heart attack and was being written out of the race, only to bounce back and, for a time, become the front-runner for the nomination. 
Now he is the underdog, and distinctively so, thanks to the rapid, unprecedented coalescence around Biden's candidacy by former rivals and millions of voters. That leaves Sanders - not at this moment perhaps but sooner than he might like - with the question of how long and how hard he will try to battle against the former vice president and what he will urge upon his passionate following.
Sanders has said repeatedly that the Democratic candidate who has the most delegates - even if that is a plurality and not a majority - should be selected as the party's presidential nominee. He first said that when he believed he would be that candidate. Today, every bit of arithmetic and modeling says that candidate is Biden, with the odds growing that the former vice president could assemble a majority rather than just a plurality of the delegates going into the convention.
Asked Sunday by ABC's George Stephanopoulos whether he would drop out of the race if it were clear that he could not win a plurality, Sanders hedged. 
""Look, we will fight for every vote that we can, as we're - as we try to win this election,"" he said. ""I'm not a masochist who wants to stay in the race that can't be won. But right now, that's a little bit premature. Let's not determine what will happen on Tuesday, what will happen in the future.""

In that interview, Sanders put down his own markers for success. He said that he believed he had ""a great chance"" to win in Michigan and Washington. Michigan was the state that brought his candidacy back to life four years ago when he shocked Clinton by narrowly winning the state. On Tuesday night, the state fell into Biden's column not long after the polls closed. It was as crippling a loss as Sanders has suffered this year.
Meanwhile, the results in Washington were just beginning to be reported Tuesday night. But even if Sanders were to win Washington, the delegate split would be far narrower than it was four years ago, when the state's contest was a caucus rather than a primary and he won it with more than 70 percent of the vote.
Four years ago, Sanders balked at endorsing Clinton even at the close of the primaries, after she had won in California and her victory was secured. That led to difficult negotiations between the two camps and a contentious opening to the Philadelphia convention. This year, many Democrats say the party cannot afford to go through a repeat of that experience. What Sanders decides about his candidacy will have a profound effect on efforts to unify the party before, not after, the convention.
But this is more than an issue for Sanders. It is of enormous consequence for Biden as well. Unity demands something of those on the losing side, but it often requires much more of the winning side. Sanders has a following, especially among young voters, for a reason. He has identified ills in an unequal economic system that they are feeling acutely. Biden has fared poorly among younger voters in part because Sanders and his agenda speak to them in ways Biden and his message do not. 

Biden and his team have other work to do and less time than it might seem to get it done. Even if Sanders chooses to keep running far into the spring, Biden will have to begin to make a swift pivot toward the general election, with the goal of turning a campaign operation that has drawn criticism even from prominent supporters into a machine capable of waging a general election against the Trump forces.
Biden won states on Super Tuesday where he had spent little or no money, in states where he had held no rallies. He was winning because nearly two-thirds of Democrats appeared to be looking for a more moderate alternative to Sanders and Biden was the last candidate standing. The deficiencies in his organization that contributed to his loss in Iowa cannot go unattended, say sympathetic Democrats.
Biden will start a general election campaign many months behind the Trump campaign in identifying the voters who will make the difference in November and communicating directly to them. For the November election, he will need to scale up his operation, sharpen his message and reach beyond to voters who either shifted to Trump in 2016 or sat on the sidelines.
Trump remains the great unifier of Democrats, but it will take something more on the part of both Sanders and Biden to bring the party fully and enthusiastically together if the party is to be ready for what promises to be a general election that voters in both parties see as the most important in their lifetimes.

impeachment trial takes shape today 
McConnell proposes rules to gain a quick decision
The White House argued in a legal brief filed Monday that the two articles of impeachment against President Trump are 'structurally deficient,' decrying a 'rigged process' and urging senators to 'immediately' acquit the president of the charges that will be formally presented at his trial that starts in earnest this week.
The filing came as the House's designated impeachment managers and Trump's legal counsel conducted final preparations ahead of the trial proceedings that will begin Tuesday, marking the substantive start of just the third Senate trial of a U.S. president in history. On the Republican side, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) circulated ground rules for a rapid trial, while Senate aides and GOP lawyers were also weighing contingency plans in case Democrats are successful in forcing witnesses to testify.
Trump's legal team, led by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, wrote that Trump 'did absolutely nothing wrong' as it accused the House Democrats who impeached the president of attempting to overturn the results of the 2016 election and 'to interfere in the 2020 election.'
'The only threat to the Constitution that House Democrats have brought to light is their own degradation of the impeachment process and trampling of the separation of powers,' Trump's lawyers wrote in the 171-page legal brief. 'Their fixation on damaging the President has trivialized the momentous act of impeachment, debased the standards of impeachable conduct, and perverted the power of impeachment by turning it into a partisan, election-year political tool.' 
Some of the preparations Monday came in the form of walk-throughs of the Senate chamber by both sides, scoping out the surroundings that will house all 100 senators for hours of opening arguments and questions in Trump's impeachment case over the next several days. 
But the two sides also spent Monday previewing the case they'll make on the Senate floor through dueling filings and efforts to refute the other side's arguments about whether Trump's attempts to pressure Ukraine amount to impeachable conduct. Both the Democratic House managers and Trump's legal team are battling to persuade a small group of swing GOP senators who will decide whether they will need additional witnesses and evidence to determine Trump's fate. 
McConnell's organizing resolution, which he circulated late Monday afternoon, offers each side 24 hours to make its opening arguments, starting on Wednesday but compressed into two session days. It is unclear whether Democrats would press to use all their time, which could push testimony past midnight.
After the House managers and Trump's lawyers make their case, senators will be allowed 16 hours to question the opposing sides.
After that, the sides will debate for a maximum of four hours on whether to consider subpoenaing witnesses or documents at all, followed by a vote on whether to do so. If a majority of senators agree, then there will probably be motions from both sides to call various witnesses, with subsequent votes on issuing subpoenas.
The resolution also allows Trump's team to move to dismiss the charges at any time "" although it is not explicitly mentioned in the four-page measure "" because doing so is allowed under standard impeachment trial rules. The Senate trial also won't automatically admit evidence from the House process, according to GOP officials, a key difference from the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton more than two decades ago. Though the material will be printed and made available to senators, it won't be automatically admissible unless a majority of senators approve it.
The resolution infuriated Democratic senators, with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) calling the document a 'national disgrace' and accusing McConnell of shrouding testimony and rushing the trial. 
'We are gratified that the draft resolution protects the president's rights to a fair trial, and look forward to presenting a vigorous defense on the facts and the process as quickly as possible, and seeking an acquittal as swiftly as possible,' said Eric Ueland, White House director of legislative affairs.
The administration laid out two main points as it seeks a quick acquittal for Trump: that the articles of impeachment are 'deficient' because they don't involve any violations of law, and that the House's charge of obstruction of Congress will damage the constitutional separation of powers. 
House Democrats "" in a separate filing that was also due Monday "" disputed the White House's argument, asserting that abusing the powers of his presidency was an impeachable offense and that Trump was the 'Framers' worst nightmare come to life.' 
The White House's legal brief submitted to the Senate "" offering the first detailed glimpse into its defense against the two impeachment charges "" was adamant that Trump did nothing wrong, deploying a legalese version of the scorched-earth rhetoric commonly used in the president's Twitter feed. One Democratic aide working on the impeachment trial, who spoke to reporters in a briefing on the condition of anonymity, likened the brief to an 'extremely extended version of a presidential tweet.'
The proceedings Tuesday will formally begin with a debate over the McConnell resolution. The impeachment managers and the president's lawyers will have an opportunity to debate the proposed rules, while Schumer is expected to offer changes to the measure that would allow the Senate to call several witnesses desired by Democrats at the outset. Democrats could also push for more than one vote on witnesses and documents.
But all 53 Republican senators are expected to support the rules as written by McConnell. Once those parameters are set, the formal arguments will begin.
After spending several hours in a nearly empty Capitol, holding talks with staff on the resolution, McConnell left at 7 p.m. Monday, saying the final touches were now in place.
'As you can imagine, we're discussing getting ready for tomorrow. And we'll be ready to go,' he told reporters, indicating he had no real discussions with Schumer about how Democrats would fight the resolution. 'That's a good question to ask him.'

In their own 111-page brief filed Saturday, the House's seven impeachment managers laid out their case against Trump that they will present to senators, arguing that the president's conduct posed a national security threat and that he obstructed congressional efforts to obtain testimony and documents about his dealings toward Ukraine. 

The House's legal brief reiterated many of the findings and arguments that Democrats have made for months "" including allegations that Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military aid for Ukraine and a coveted White House meeting with its leader, Volodymyr Zelensky, to pressure the country into conducting investigations into former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter.
The president's lawyers argued in their filing, however, that House Democrats had no evidence to back up its accusation that Trump conditioned the aid and the White House visit on an investigation into a political rival. The attorneys also defended Trump's conduct, saying a July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky that is at the heart of the House's impeachment case was 'perfectly appropriate' and that the Ukrainian leader has not indicated any impropriety with the conversation.
The lawyers pointed to a rough transcript of the call as proof that Trump did not seek a quid pro quo in his request for the probe of the Bidens and of a debunked theory alleging Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.
In the call, Trump told Zelensky that 'I would like you to do us a favor though because our country has been through a lot and Ukraine knows a lot about it.' Those favors do not involve Trump's personal interests, argued the White House lawyers, who added: 'The President cannot be removed from office because House Democrats deliberately misconstrue one of his commonly used phrases.' 
That transcript of the call, Trump's lawyers also said, shows that the president was speaking about issues of burden-sharing among European nations as well as corruption "" two foreign policy issues that not only were in his purview as commander in chief but reflected his 'longstanding concerns' about foreign aid. 
The lawyers said it would have been 'appropriate' and 'entirely proper' for Trump to ask Zelensky about those issues, including about Hunter Biden, who served on the board of Burisma, Ukraine's largest private gas company, whose owner came under scrutiny by Ukrainian prosecutors for possible abuse of power and unlawful enrichment. Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing. 
In response to the White House's argument that there was no underlying crime, Democrats are likely to cite an opinion issued after Trump's impeachment from the Government Accountability Office that the administration's withholding of aid was a violation of law. Trump's legal team is expected to argue that senators must focus solely on the information relied upon by the House in its Dec. 18 vote to impeach the president. 
As for the obstruction-of-Congress charge, the president's legal team called it 'frivolous and dangerous' because Trump had the right to assert certain executive branch privileges. 
'Accepting that unprecedented approach [from Democrats] would fundamentally damage the separation of powers by making the House itself the sole judge of its authority,' the lawyers wrote in the brief. 'It would permit Congress to threaten every President with impeachment merely for protecting the prerogatives of the Presidency.' 
Earlier Monday, the seven Democratic managers walked in procession from the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) to the Senate chamber a few minutes after 11 a.m. Reporters were not allowed to view the walk-through, as the doors to the third-floor galleries above the Senate chamber were locked, and aides said the lawmakers would not discuss the visit.

The White House also announced late Monday that eight of the president's most ardent House Republican defenders would join the impeachment team to 'help expeditiously end this brazen political vendetta.' The GOP lawmakers are Reps. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), Mike Johnson (La.), Jim Jordan (Ohio), Debbie Lesko (Ariz.), Mark Meadows (N.C.), John Ratcliffe (Tex.), Elise Stefanik (N.Y.) and Lee Zeldin (N.Y.).

Democrats at a turning point, torn between investigations and policy 
Democrats find themselves at a crossroads after Wednesday's acquittal of President Trump, torn between continuing investigations into a president they call a danger to democracy and a desire to concentrate on health care and other issues more likely to resonate with voters.
The party seized control of the House in 2018 in part on a promise to hold Trump accountable. But in the past year, Trump has emerged unscathed from former special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's probe into 2016 election interference and a nearly five-month impeachment inquiry. The latest polls show Trump attaining the highest approval ratings of his presidency.
Democrats, by contrast, face a muddled presidential primary field, with no obvious front-runner to take on Trump in November. And the party was embarrassed this week when chaotic caucuses in Iowa failed to produce a clear winner. Hours before Trump's acquittal, House Democrats gathered in a private meeting in the Capitol to vent their frustrations while others fretted about the need for a new election-year strategy.
One of the first decisions they face is whether to subpoena Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton, who details in a forthcoming book that Trump told him that he withheld military aid to Ukraine to force that country to pursue investigations of a political rival, former vice president Joe Biden, and his son Hunter "" the charges at the heart of the impeachment inquiry. 
On Wednesday, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) suggested that it was a matter of time before the chamber would call Bolton.
'When you have a lawless president, you have to bring that to the fore. You have to spotlight that,' Nadler told reporters. 'You have to protect the Constitution, whatever the political consequences.' 
But other Democrats cautioned that no decision has been made about Bolton and expressed a desire to move on.
'We also have to have our own idea and vision. We can't win the next election just being against Trump,' said Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.). 'We have to be for something.'
Republicans, meanwhile, were in soaring spirits. While Democrats have accused the GOP of a coverup in ending the impeachment trial without calling witnesses, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) seemed unconcerned. Shortly after the acquittal vote, he told reporters that swing-state polls indicate Democrats' decision to impeach Trump is backfiring.
'Right now, this is a political loser for them,' McConnell declared minutes after Trump's acquittal. 'They initiated it. They thought this was a great idea. And at least for the short term, it has been a colossal political mistake.' 

The party's frustration with their predicament was on clear display Wednesday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) vented to her colleagues in the private caucus meeting that Trump's Tuesday night State of the Union address was a 'pack of lies.' 
Democrats, including Pelosi, often say they can both investigate and legislate. But they're also vexed by a reality that investigations of Trump overshadow other accomplishments, drowning out work on trade and prescription drugs that is vital to keeping their majority and winning the White House. 
Privately, some Democrats fear that if they continue investigating Trump in such a public fashion, it could backfire and embolden him further before the election. 
'We need to be better prepared, better ready to take on the attack-and-smear machine, less inclined to quarrel amongst ourselves and more eyes on the prize than we have been,' said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).
The soul-searching for Democrats comes as Trump has experienced perhaps one of the best weeks of his presidency, highlighted by a prime-time address to the nation that was largely well received by Republicans with surprising reality TV moments.
House Democrats, meanwhile, were still angry about Trump's State of the Union address, in which the president claimed some of their policies as his own "" though his administration has pursued the opposite. 
Trump, for example, vowed that he would protect Americans with preexisting health conditions "" a promise at direct odds with his administration's legal efforts to gut the Affordable Care Act, which includes the guarantee that patients can't be denied that coverage.
Pelosi, in a dramatic gesture after Trump finished his address to Congress on Tuesday evening, shredded a copy of his words while standing on the dais behind him. On Wednesday morning, a visibly irritated Pelosi told her colleagues that she was looking for 'one page I could spare that didn't have a lie on it' and couldn't find it "" and that she had no regrets about what she did.
'He disrespected the chamber he was in . . . to use it as a backdrop for a reality show . . . to give a speech that had no connection with reality,' she said, according to multiple Democratic officials in the room, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk frankly. 'It was a pack of lies. . . . About a quarter through it I thought: 'You know "" he's selling a bill of goods like a snake oil salesman. We cannot let this "" we cannot let this stand.' '
Pelosi's fury resonated with her members, who gave her a standing ovation in the private caucus meeting. 
Rep. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.) argued after the meeting that the State of the Union was no venue for a 'political campaign' and that the award of the Presidential Medal of Freedom to conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh was 'nutty.' 
Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) agreed Democrats 'need to remind people what [Trump's] record is, and the fact that he just is a pathological liar.'
'Her instinct for where the caucus is at is unerring. It did capture the way people are feeling,' said Rep. Andy Levin (D-Mich.) of Pelosi ripping up the document.
Pelosi's leadership team has signaled a desire to focus on policy in the coming months. House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries (N.Y.) and Rep. Katherine M. Clark (D-Mass.) used a weekly news conference Wednesday to discuss a host of legislative proposals that have been stalled in the GOP-controlled Senate. And the Democratic response to the State of the Union barely mentioned impeachment, focusing instead on things like gun control, income inequity and infrastructure.
And yet some impeachment investigators say they also have a duty to keep digging on Trump, probing his financial interests, allegations that he used his office for self-enrichment and that he obstructed justice. As he left the caucus, Nadler, for example, argued to reporters that Democrats needed to continue investigating the Ukraine matter and the broader probe into the 2016 campaign despite the pending Senate acquittal. 
Between investigating and legislating, Democrats appear genuinely torn. And the Democratic split screen was on full display within 30 seconds in a news conference that Pelosi's lieutenants held after the morning caucus. 
'As far as I'm concerned, the shredder wasn't available and so she did what she needed to do,' Jeffries said of Pelosi ripping apart Trump's speech. A few breaths later he pledged to keep working with the president. 
'We are going to work with President Trump whenever and wherever we can on behalf of the American people, but disagree when we must,' he said, suggesting the president's values would 'decimate the middle class.'

Finally, after three years of a presidency like none other, after street protests and raucous rallies, after awkward Thanksgiving dinners and broken friendships, after predictions of fractured democracy and celebrations of disrupted government, Americans will begin voting Monday.
They will vote on whether to turn away from smash-mouth politics or double down on a presidency that serves as a national blowoff valve. They will vote on whether they prefer a restoration of quieter governing or a wholesale change of the economic system. Above all, they will vote on whether they have had enough of President Trump "" and what to do about the direction of a country that all sides seem to agree faces significant trouble. 
When Iowa voters assemble in caucuses Monday evening to begin selecting presidential nominees, they will lead off a tightly packed parade of opportunities for Americans to state their verdict, including potentially bitter Democratic primaries culminating with the ultimate decision day on Nov. 3. 
This vote feels momentous, said Chris Buskirk, publisher of American Greatness, a conservative website, because Trump supporters 'hope that his reelection would finally legitimize him as president' and because the president's opponents see one last opportunity to get rid of the man they blame for exacerbating the country's divisions.
'But actually, I'm not optimistic that this election will solve anything,' Buskirk said. 'The divisions and stresses in the country may be worse than they were three years ago. It's almost a World War I mind-set now "" it's trench warfare, and you fight and scramble, and you get nowhere.'

In Iowa, for almost half a century the place where Americans begin the selection of presidents, the vote follows more than a year of intense campaigning. Ben Mowat, a 19-year-old from Colorado, chose to attend Drake University in Des Moines because he wanted to participate in the first-in-the-nation caucuses.
'It feels weird,' the freshman said. '2020 was this idea, and now it's here.'
Mowat, a volunteer for Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., said he has been driven by the prospect of ejecting Trump from the White House, but his excitement is tempered by a sense of responsibility and even, sometimes, the dread of a possible loss.
'I feel guilty when I'm not knocking doors,' he said.
Katie Cameron and Susan Tille, sisters who drove more than two hours from Livermore, Iowa, to attend Trump's rally in Des Moines on Thursday night, can't wait to vote to assure a second term for a president they say has given the economy a healthy boost.
'He's made a lot of positive changes,' said Tille, citing the growth in her 401(k) retirement account. 'He's done a lot of good for the economy.'
The sisters, who own a swimming pool store, want to send a message to Trump's opponents, telling them to stop fighting his every move. Cameron, whose 2016 vote for Trump was her first after a lifetime of steering clear of politics, said she has become more politically engaged in the past three years and considers herself a member of his base. She's no fan of some of Trump's tweets, but she said Americans have gotten used to 'how he communicates.'
By now, Frank Luntz figured that emotionally exhausted Americans would be hungry for unity, eager to embrace moderate messages and candidates who promised to find and claim common ground.
But Luntz, a longtime Republican consultant who conducts focus groups for news organizations, has been taking the temperatures of voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and other states, and he has found that 'people are desperate to vote, but the center has collapsed.' 
'They want the pitchfork message, not the unity message "" on both sides,' he said. 
'I wish I was wrong, but that fear of losing the country is deep and very emotional, on both sides,' Luntz added. 'The Trump side believes the left is trying to overturn democracy, and they will fight like hell to prevent it. And the Democrats have a disdain for Donald Trump that I've never seen. This isn't as bad as 1968, but it's pretty damn bad.'
In the '68 election, amid the Vietnam War, riots in American cities, political assassinations and a widespread sense that the country was spinning out of control, Richard Nixon won the presidency with chilling TV ads reflecting the fear of crime on dark city streets and a slogan that spoke to existential angst in the electorate: 'This time, vote like your whole world depended on it.'
A similar root anxiety about the future of the country and the planet pervades many voters' attitudes now.
Psychologists hear it from clients whether they are pro- or anti-Trump. 'It is a collective anxiety, and it is bipartisan,' said Washington therapist Elisabeth LaMotte. 'This is not a trusting time.'


On the anti-Trump side, La Motte sees people for whom politics is a significant driver of stress, 'but it's more complicated than that.'
'I hear much more concern about the environment and the future of the planet than I did two years ago,' she said. 
In the pro-Trump camp, she said: 'I hear people say they can't talk to certain people anymore. They're feeling isolated and frustrated, like there isn't permission to say what you think and feel, even to close friends.'
Many people have found it necessary to step away from the political fray: They limit their news diet, avoid talking to certain friends and get involved in community activities. Others have become more politically active.
'I tell people with political anxiety to do something productive or proactive, like volunteering for a campaign,' said Jennifer Contarino Panning, a clinical psychologist in Evanston, Ill. 'Voting is a crucial part of that; in 2018, I saw people find some relief in voting. It gave a sense of hope, and people are desperate for that.'
At a Buttigieg campaign event in Ankeny, Iowa, flight attendant Tamara Galeazzi, 52, could hardly wait for Monday's caucuses.
'It's almost like, 'Thank God it's almost over,' ' she said. 'Being in Iowa, we hear it from Day One until the caucus. When the commercials start slowing down the day after, it's like, 'Thank goodness, normalcy.' I'm nervous. Very nervous. This cannot go on for another four years. Just pick someone on our side, and stick with it. It's very nerve-racking.'
But for many people, the vote is neither a sufficient salve to the stress of the Trump era nor a big enough cudgel to break through to people on the other side of the divide.
'I work primarily with progressives, and they looked to the Mueller report and the impeachment trial for some relief, and then nothing changed,' Panning said. 'They felt hopeless and fatigued. Now they're really hesitant to believe in anything.'
LaMotte said her patients in Virginia, Maryland and the District have edged away from politics over the past few years, choosing instead to engage in their local communities, finding relief from the stress of national news in getting involved with a Girl Scouts group or volunteering at a neighborhood school. She sees hope in a growing resilience, even if it's not necessarily associated with voting.
Luntz has heard little such hope. The voters he has been surveying 'have weaponized grievances and are seeking revenge against the other side,' he said. 'Whatever the result of the election, half the country will believe America has been saved, and half will say it's been destroyed. These two Americas do not eat together, do not play together. They say it's too late for unity. They have simply lost trust.'


Some voters who crave a unifying message fear that their fellow Americans are too frustrated or exhausted to bring about change. Austin Bayliss, 32, sees worrying signs that antipathy to Trump may not be enough to carry Democrats to victory. That recipe failed four years ago, he said, 'and sometimes I feel like I'm right back there.
'What are the Democrats going to do to close the enthusiasm gap?' said Bayliss, who runs a professional wrestling company near Iowa City. 'You'd think the chance to hit back at Trump would be enough, but I went to Joe Biden's event yesterday in Muscatine, and there were 60 people there and 45 media. I was the youngest person there.'
The enthusiasm gap Bayliss worried about was palpable at Trump's rally Thursday. Martha Ahrens, a retired court system worker who traveled to the event from Boone, Iowa, said the Democrats' persistent attacks on Trump have bolstered her support of the president, who she said can be 'arrogant' but has done well with the economy.
Like a number of others at the Trump rally, she said she's more excited to vote this year than she was in 2016. 'Everybody is so tired of everything. They're tired of the Democrats constantly since he was elected going after him,' she said. 'It's just one thing after another, you know, instead of focusing on what they're going to do as president.'

Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Democrat who represents suburbs outside Richmond, unseated a conservative Republican in 2018 and spends many weekends meeting with constituents, making a particular effort to sit down with pro-Trump voters. She sees a divide so deep that one election cannot heal it.
'We used to debate ideas,' she said. 'Now it's just, 'You think this, therefore you're bad,' a zero-sum game, us versus them. We've been moving to this place where our entertainment is disagreement.'
Nonetheless, the congresswoman says many voters this year 'want a restoration of, just, decency, just respecting people.' To get there, however, will take many one-on-one encounters, not just a political platform and a bunch of ads. 
'I walked into a place, and a woman started wagging her finger at me, saying, 'I love Donald Trump,'-' Spanberger recalled. 'I said, 'Ma'am, a lot of people do.' She saw me and expected a fight. I don't know that she wanted a fight, and that's an important distinction. But I changed the tone and acknowledged what she said, and she softened, and we had a really good conversation.'
The yearning for a return to a less combative politics is palpable among many Iowans who plan to attend the Democratic caucuses. Mary Amborn, 78, from Ottumwa contemplated traveling to Des Moines on Thursday to protest at the Trump rally there, but she decided instead to stay closer to home and hear Biden speak at the American Legion Hall.
Amborn, who is leaning toward voting for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) but was still considering Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.), said she's doing well but feels compelled to vote against Trump on behalf of her 26 grandchildren and great-grandchildren, including three who served in the military and one who is a homeless veteran 'who can teach college calculus, but he can't keep a home.'
'I am very, very happy,' she said. 'I have a great retirement. I have wonderful medical. I worked the factory for years and years at John Deere. Now, the folks who have my job, when they retire, they will not have medical. And so I am worried about those that follow me. If I get it wrong, my 26 grandkids "" they will suffer.' She wiped away tears. 'I can hardly talk about it. I'm voting for them.'
After a 2016 election in which the long-standing leadership in both parties seemed out of sync with voters' frustrations and concerns, Luntz sees a similar disconnect developing this time: 'The Trump campaign seems overconfident,' he said. 'Trump energizes people at his rallies but not beyond that hardcore group. They don't understand the fatigue that some Trump voters feel. People are tired of having to defend Trump's language.'
Luntz doesn't see Democratic candidates clicking with voters either. 'The Democratic message is so over-caffeinated against Trump that it's overwhelming people who are already suffering from insomnia,' he said. 'I have no idea what's going to happen.'

It was a sight to behold: a former vice president, two senators and a former mayor on a stage in New Hampshire a week ago, arguing over the impossible. Would Sen. Bernie Sanders deliver Medicare-for-all immediately, as he promised to do? Would doing so double the federal budget, as former vice president Joe Biden countered? Should they maybe go with Medicare-for-all-who-want-it, as former mayor Pete Buttigieg suggested? It didn't exactly roll off the tongue, but he has said it would put the United States on a 'glide path' to something he called 'a Medicare-for-all environment.' And what of the fact, raised by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, that Buttigieg tweeted a pledge two years ago to 'indubitably' support Medicare-for-all? 
Given what actually happens in the nation's capital these days, the men and women on the stage may as well have been arguing over the price of unicorn at the local market and how they'd cook it. Set against the current political backdrop, the elaborate policy debates among the candidates seeking the Democratic nomination (Will college be free for everyone, or for everyone but the rich kids? Would a tax on wealth over $50 million be a flat tax or a progressive tax?) feel increasingly delusional. 
It's not just because President Trump, an incumbent in a strong economy, stands a good chance of winning a second term. Even if one of the Democratic candidates were to beat him in November, they would become president, not emperor. As such, they'd have to deal with the Senate, an institution where fast and sweeping legislation is difficult to pass in any scenario, to say nothing of one dominated by Republican Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Using tactics that push the limits of what's acceptable, he has transformed the chamber from the 'cooling saucer' the framers envisioned to a Sub-Zero freezer, a place where 300 bills passed by House Democrats don't even merit debate, let alone votes, even with the insurance policy of Trump's veto. 
It's healthy to debate policy, but Democrats aren't doing it in a vacuum. Research shows that contentious primaries hamper a party's performance in the general election. Candidates are bickering about blue-sky proposals "" with Sanders supporters destroying backsliders, Biden invoking segregationists to insist that legislative compromise works and Buttigieg going after Biden for his vote to invade Iraq 17 years ago "" but they're having a semantic argument. The stalemate moots their differences. The next Democratic president will be lucky to seat a Supreme Court nominee. In a climate of such vicious and total partisan obstruction, the only real issue is electability. 

Hashing out policy differences within a party can be a good and important process. A president can implement many policy changes by executive fiat, especially in the realms of immigration and law enforcement (as Trump has amply demonstrated). A president can also create change by interpreting existing law and choosing what to emphasize through Cabinet appointments and regulation. Spelling out where you stand on, say, health care in the primary race is an important signal to voters of a candidate's priorities and how she would administer the Department of Health and Human Services. 
Intra-party arguments also help generate ideas for the future. Proposals that at first seem outlandish often become orthodoxy later. 'When you read conservative magazines when they're out of power in the 1960s, they're having all kinds of arcane ideological battles about crazy things like privatizing Social Security,' says Seth Cotlar, a historian at Willamette University. 'And people are saying: 'Are you crazy? That's never going to happen!' And they're right in that they're not going to happen then. But then, in 2004, President George W. Bush proposed privatizing Social Security. If we look at politics not as what's going to happen next year but how do you build popular support and awareness for ideas, that takes a really long time.'
None of that is relevant today. McConnell was a big, beautiful wall long before Trump showed up. The man stole a Supreme Court seat from a Democratic president in 2016 under a flimsy pretext "" it would be unfair to confirm a justice in an election year, he said "" but now says openly that he wouldn't apply such logic if Trump wanted to fill a court vacancy this year. He's not going to alter his winning strategy by casting aside his stupendously successful cynicism for a President Klobuchar.
Fine, you might say. Democrats have to win the Senate and the presidency and keep the House. If they do, then they'll be justified in haggling over the intricacies of the Green New Deal. Set aside that projections show Republicans keeping their Senate majority in November. Set aside the fact that a Democratic takeover in the chamber would probably constitute just 50 blue senators plus a possible tiebreaking vote from a Democratic vice president. Even control of the chamber, political scientists say, wouldn't guarantee an easy legislative path for liberal lawmakers. 'If it's not Mitch McConnell, it's Joe Manchin,' says Dan Hopkins, a political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania, referring to the conservative Democratic senator from West Virginia, where Trump is wildly popular. 'If it's not Joe Manchin, it's [Arizona Sen.] Kyrsten Sinema. Even if the Democrats were to take the Senate, they would be limited by their own most centrist members. Maybe they have 50 seats, but they're only going to pass what their entire caucus votes for.'
Controlling both chambers of Congress still wouldn't stop Republicans from wielding a tremendous amount of power through the filibuster, which takes 60 votes to break through. And McConnell would surely devise other creative stalling and blocking maneuvers. 'Under the last two Democratic administrations with unified government, Republicans put up more opposition than most out-of-power parties tend to be able to do,' says Princeton political scientist Frances Lee, recalling that Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama had the luxury of Democratic control of Congress in the first years of their first terms, and Republicans still managed to block much of their legislative agendas. During Clinton's first term, Republicans in the 103rd Congress thwarted a bill that would have protected striking workers from retaliation and another that would have provided some public financing for political campaigns. During Obama's first two years, the GOP blocked a measure that would have strengthened disclosure requirements for political donations; significantly weakened the Dodd-Frank regulations of the banking sector just as it was threatening to sink the entire economy; and (ironically) nixed Democrats' proposals to give tax incentives to companies that bring jobs back from overseas. Now, when polarization and partisanship are at still higher levels, Lee says, 'you could certainly expect a solid wall of opposition' from Republicans. 
What about Biden's theory that, without Trump and his divisive rhetoric, Republicans will again work across the aisle, just as they did when Biden was a jaunty young senator from Delaware? 'With Trump gone, you're going to begin to see things change,' he said last summer. 'Because these folks know better. They know this isn't what they're supposed to be doing.' Surely a moderate in the White House could find a way to get Republicans on board with, say, student loan forgiveness, right? But today, 'Republicans have no incentive to work with Democrats,' says Julia Azari, a political scientist at Marquette University. 'The 20th-century grand-coalition model is increasingly unlikely in today's environment.' Because local elections have become highly nationalized, because liberals and conservatives live in different, non-intersecting informational universes, because Republicans have become viciously good at threatening dissenters with primary challenges (or physical harm) and because the president has become such a potent and all-encompassing political and cultural symbol, there is little cause these days for senators to vote with a president of the other party. 

In other words, Democratic primary candidates and their supporters can fight all they want about pie-in-the-sky policy proposals, but they'll sooner get some roast unicorn than see Medicare-for-all enacted next year. Which is why you can vote for Sanders even if you oppose Medicare-for-all, and why Elizabeth Warren's backers can easily give their support to moderate Buttigieg even if they don't love everything he's said on the debate stage. 
The policy stakes are lower than voters believe, but the focus on them is much higher. In a 2016 study that examined the impact of divisive primaries, political scientists Alexander Fouirnaies and Andrew B. Hall found that the longer and more contentious a nominating process, the worse the party performs in November. 'Divisive primaries exert a substantial penalty on parties in the general election,' they wrote. They found that the negative effect was amplified the higher up the food chain you go: The more national and high-profile the office, the greater the eventual penalty. The most damaging kind of primary, they found, was the kind in which ideological purity is at stake. In other words, this one.
There's a possible bright spot, though, according to Princeton historian Julian Zelizer. 'Most moments of a lot of legislating happen when no one expects them to happen, and it happens in very difficult environments,' he told me. In 1961, when a naive and bright-eyed John F. Kennedy proposed a thing called Medicare, it was deemed preposterous. When Lyndon B. Johnson took over after his assassination, Congress was gridlocked on seemingly everything. But the upswell of the civil rights movement and the 1964 electoral sweep changed the equation; a year later, Medicare became law. During the first year of Obama's presidency, a financial crisis, disillusionment with Bush-era Republican policies and the dramatic election of the country's first black president gave Obama an opening to pass something as ambitious as the Affordable Care Act. Despite everything that would come later "" Merrick Garland, Obama nominees literally dying while waiting for McConnell's Senate to confirm them "" 'it was a unique set of factors that created this little window that closed pretty quickly,' Zelizer explains. 
For that little window to open at all, though, Democrats need to stop tearing each other down over the details and focus on making sure this moment doesn't completely pass them by.

The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus across the United States put the outbreak on a collision course with the presidential primaries, threatening to disrupt the process at a pivotal moment for Democrats as they select their nominee.

Louisiana announced Friday that it would delay its White House primaries from April 4 to June 20, becoming the first state to reschedule because of covid-19. Shortly after, the four states set to vote Tuesday said jointly that their contests would proceed as planned, referring to guidance from public health officials who have declared voting safe if best practices are followed. 
But a rush of developments heightened pressure on elections officials already struggling to minimize risks to voters and injected a sense of deep uncertainty about how the 2020 race will unfold amid the growing pandemic. 
By the end of the week, the presidential campaigns had gone virtual: Former vice president Joe Biden invited voters in Illinois to a videoconference town hall Friday, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) scheduled daily news conferences from Burlington, Vt., and President Trump temporarily suspended his rallies.
As the president declared a national state of emergency Friday, colleges shuttered and cities across the country banned large gatherings, there was building worry about the outbreak's impact on the voting process. The United States currently has 2,151 coronavirus cases, with 48 deaths.
Fear about exposure was expected to lower in-person turnout for Tuesday's contests in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio, when 577 delegates are up for grabs - a potential risk for Biden as he seeks to lock up the Democratic nomination. The former vice president has had strong support from older voters, who are more at risk to suffer serious health issues if they contract covid-19.
""We've just never had a situation like this before,"" said Michael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida, who said Biden could suffer if seniors stay home, while Sanders could see his support diminish if students being sent home from college campuses are unable to participate. 
""It's so hard to predict,"" he said. 
The joint statement from the chief elections officials in the four states voting Tuesday came amid worries that fears about the coronavirus would keep people from showing up at the polls. 
The statement noted that voting involves ""people from a nearby community coming into and out of the building for a short duration,"" as opposed to the kinds of large gatherings that are now banned in many jurisdictions. 
Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose said it came about after text conversations between his chief of staff and the top aides to Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee and Illinois Elections Board Chairman Charles Scholz. 
""My chief of staff was reaching out to the other [top staffers] and saying, 'Hey, listen, we need to push back on this so it doesn't become a disinformation thing or a misinformation thing,'"" LaRose said.
 ""This is about pushing calm, accurate, decisive information out there where there is too much nonsense churning on social media causing people anxiety,"" he added.
 Still, in local jurisdictions, election officials struggled to keep up with an onslaught of calls from concerned residents and the practical demands of obtaining guidance from election, public health and other leaders at every level of government. 
""It is a difficult situation for everyone,"" said Adam Johnson, chief deputy clerk in DuPage County, Ill. ""We are actively reaching out and trying to get the information as quickly as people have it, but we understand that everyone is responding in real time to this situation."" 
Under guidance from state and local health departments, election officials around the country took action this week to increase their personnel and lower health risks, often by moving hundreds of polling places out of nursing homes and stockpiling supplies to disinfect voting equipment. 
In DuPage County, officials announced Friday that volunteers would be paid $200 rather than $130 for Election Day and $15 per hour instead of $10 per hour during early voting.
In Ohio, amid a statewide campaign to recruit poll workers, the state auditor offered employees a paid day off if they sign up. 
And in Maricopa County, Ariz., officials took the unusual step of preparing to mail ballots to eligible voters who were not on the permanent early-voting list, a decision that echoed recommendations from vote-by-mail advocates. But the move was blocked on Friday by a superior court judge, who ordered Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes not to mail out the ballots after the state's attorney general, Mark Brnovich (R), filed an emergency motion to block the action. In the filing, the attorney general argued that the county official lacked authority to mail ballots to voters who had not requested them, and that the move risked ""creating a swarm of illegal ballots and immense voter confusion.""
Fontes said he was trying to help people fearful for their safety to participate in the primary.
""The ballots were at the door of the warehouse,"" he said in an interview Friday evening. ""My job is to help voters vote. Especially in a time of a global pandemic, it's unfortunate that politics intervened.""
Taking a different approach, Louisiana announced that the best way to protect public health - including the health of its elderly poll workers - was to use a special emergency provision in state law to delay its primaries until the summer. 
Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said elections were delayed in 2005 and 2008 after hurricanes. He said his thought of postponing the primaries had unanimous support in across leaders in state government, both Democrats and Republicans. 
""We spent most of yesterday working as a team, looking for ways to try to carry out the election. We kept running into barrier after barrier. . . . When I contacted the governor's office, I think that there was some relief in us coming to that decision,"" Ardoin said at a news conference Friday. 
In addition to Louisiana's decision, the Wyoming Democratic Party announced that it would do away with the in-person portion of its caucuses, scheduled for April 4, and instead encourage voters to participate by mail, dropping off ballots on March 28 and April 4. 
The Nevada Democratic Party also canceled its county conventions and the state party in Iowa postponed similar gatherings. 
The prospect of a delayed nomination process drew concern from the Democratic campaigns. 
""Our elections can be conducted safely in consultation with public health officials,"" Kate Bedingfield, Biden communications director, said in a written statement. She encouraged people who feel healthy, are not exhibiting symptoms and don't believe they've been exposed to the virus to vote Tuesday. 

Experts said there was no risk of the general election being postponed. Under federal law, it must take place on the Tuesday following the first Monday in November. The Constitution also mandates that the new Congress be seated on Jan. 3 and presidential terms begin on Jan. 20. 
Marc Elias, a leading Democratic attorney who specializes in voting rights, said he knew of no special powers that would allow Trump to change the date of a general election, even in case of a national emergency. 
In states with upcoming primaries, local election officials are now racing to figure out how to mitigate potential health risks of casting a ballot.
In New York, a critical state where voters will weigh in on the presidential nominating contest on April 28, state elections board Co-chairman Douglas A. Kellner said board officials have been coordinating with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's (D) office, as well as with legislative leaders, to discuss alternative voting options. 
A move to delay April's presidential primary is ""possible given the circumstances,"" he said. In the meantime, Kellner said, some local counties were making changes to their absentee voting procedures that exceeded their authority.
""Two counties have gone rogue and taken it upon themselves to take emergency actions that aren't authorized by law,"" he said.
Erie County had altered the application form to include the novel coronavirus as an excuse for requesting an absentee ballot, he said. 
Jeremy J. Zellner, an elections commissioner in Erie County, said it was the commissioners' job ""to make sure people are not disenfranchised, and we believe very strongly we do have the authority to do this based on the governor's emergency declaration and the illness provision in state election law.""

President Trump's defense team spent more than 10 hours over three days alternately trying to dispute the facts of the impeachment case and going on the political offensive against one of his leading 2020 rivals. 
But in the final minutes of the presentation, Trump's lead attorney returned to a subtle, but critically important, subtheme of their argument: Let the voters decide the president's fate. 
Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, closed out Tuesday with a break-the-glass strategy designed to steer even the most skeptical of Trump's Republican critics away from calling witnesses or even considering voting to convict the president. 
'Most importantly, most importantly,' Cipollone said, explaining what he asked of them, 'to respect and defend the sacred right of every American to vote and to choose their president. The election is only months away. The American people are entitled to choose their president.'
This has always been the ultimate fallback strategy for Trump's lawyers. Even if senators find the president guilty of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, they should not administer Trump the political death penalty because the 2020 campaign has already begun.
So much so that Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) bolted once Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. gaveled Tuesday's session shut before 3 p.m., the earliest weekday ending so far, giving her enough time to race to Iowa to campaign ahead of Monday's critical caucus in the fight for the 2020 Democratic nomination. 
This line of defense became more critical after Sunday's New York Times report that former national security adviser John Bolton had sent a book manuscript to the White House for review, including allegations that Trump ordered nearly $400-million in security aid to be withheld until Ukraine announced investigations that would benefit the president politically. 
What had seemed like a glide path to witness blocking and swift acquittal, perhaps by Saturday, hit a roadblock as GOP senators voiced new concern about hearing what Bolton had to say. 
The White House had stonewalled the House probe, denying evidence and witnesses.
On Saturday, in their brief opening remarks, Trump's legal team referred to the effort to remove the president as its own form of 'massive election interference,' the very accusation lodged against Trump for his actions with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky.
By Monday evening, Cipollone gave a more direct 'let the voters decide' mantra, a position he returned to in his closing remarks Tuesday afternoon. 
It almost gave license to GOP senators to, preferably in hushed tones, admit that the president might have done something wrong but that the ultimate jury is the American people, who will cast their ballots in November.
But Cipollone's client "" famous for labeling 'perfect' a call to Zelensky that set off this investigation "" is not willing to cede an inch of ground when it comes to right and wrong.
He does not want Republicans to admit he did anything wrong in his bid to pressure Zelensky to start investigations into Trump's political rivals, which has left Republicans in an awkward dance outside the Senate chamber. 
The anti-Russia hawks have struggled the most trying to explain Trump's delay of $391-million in congressionally appropriated aid to Ukraine "" in the midst of the fight against Russian aggression, they feared angering a president to whom loyalty among GOP voters is fierce. 
By Tuesday, they finally felt a little more free to simply defend the president by saying that nothing he did warrants his removal from office. Alan Dershowitz, the celebrity lawyer and emeritus Harvard law professor, spent an hour Monday evening outlining his belief that nothing Trump had been accused of necessitated his ouster from office. 
Citing Dershowitz's discussion of 'corrupt motive,' Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.) explained that any president who is doing something that is constitutionally acceptable "" such as leveraging foreign aid for a nation to fight corruption "" is within his rights even if the demand is one that will benefit the president personally. 
'There may be mixed purposes; one, policy-wise, and the other political,' Cornyn said, paraphrasing Dershowitz's defense. 
Does Cornyn acknowledge that Trump's bigger motivation was to influence his own 2020 reelection? 
'At best there were mixed motives, that there was a policy decision that had incidental, personal political benefits,' Cornyn said. 'But if that's the standard, then you're going to make impeachment the new normal, and we might as well kiss elections goodbye.'
It was not quite a full admission that Trump did something wrong, but Republicans finally felt that Dershowitz had given them a legal basis for their decisions to block witnesses and ultimately vote to acquit the president. 
But, in between their attacks on former vice president Joe Biden's family and relitigating 2016 controversies, his legal team found ways to circle back to their slightly more reasonable position for those Republicans who feel that Trump has acted against U.S. interests in Ukraine. 
'At the end of the day, the most important thought is this: This choice belongs to the American people. They will get to make it months from now,' Cipollone said during Monday's closing remarks. 
He argued that there was 'no basis' in the facts of the case or the Constitution, but the experienced lawyer understood that a critical bloc of his jury felt uncomfortable with the latest development regarding Bolton. 
So, he went to back to the fail-safe answer: 'I would urge you to quickly come to that conclusion so we can go have an election.'
Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), a hawk on matters related to Russia, appreciated that touch because he felt that the bar for impeaching and removing a president is higher than for federal judges serving lifetime appointments. 
'Which has been historically the place on elective office. That's what it was for Johnson,' Lankford said before Tuesday's session started. 
In 1868, when Congress was dominated by Republicans, they tried to impeach Andrew Johnson in a highly politicized setting. Just a few Senate votes saved Johnson, who went on to lose the Democratic nomination later that year, as Ulysses S. Grant won the election.
So, knowing the vast majority of GOP votes were in his pocket, Cipollone ended his pitch Tuesday by aiming at those few wavering Republicans and possibly one or two Democrats. 
'The American people are entitled to choose their president,' he said. 'Overturning the last election and massively interfering with the upcoming one would cause serious and lasting damage.'

GOP hurls corruption claims at Democrat seen as top threat to reelection

DES MOINES "" With President Trump holding a campaign rally here Thursday ahead of the Iowa caucuses, his allies had coalesced around an effort to damage former vice president Joe Biden's prospects in the state that begins the 2020 presidential nominating contests. 
Republican lawmakers have used the spotlight of Trump's impeachment trial to accuse Biden of corruption, a U.S. senator from Florida is running television ads against Biden in Iowa, and several Trump campaign surrogates have ramped up their attacks against the former vice president as they prepare to fan out across the state in support of Trump's reelection bid. 
'There is a mountain of evidence to suggest the Bidens' behavior was harmful to the United States,' Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) said Wednesday from the U.S. Capitol, where several GOP lawmakers used the impeachment trial's question-and-answer session to insinuate wrongdoing by Biden.
Trump's campaign is dispatching Vice President Pence and more than 80 other surrogates to Iowa ahead of Monday's caucus votes. The group includes several Republicans who have launched the most pointed attacks against Biden and his son Hunter during the impeachment process.
Trump's rally in Des Moines came on the eve of a critical Senate vote over whether his impeachment trial would include witnesses. The president has used his recent rallies to criticize several of his Democratic rivals, with Biden receiving the lion's share of the attacks.
Biden responded Thursday by drawing a sharp contrast with Trump in a speech and with a new television ad, both aimed at highlighting differences in character between the two men and previewing a potential general-election matchup.
'In Joe Biden's America, the president's tax returns will not be a secret,' Biden told a standing-room-only crowd at an elementary school in Waukee, Iowa, his first of three stops for the day. 'Political self-interest will not be confused with national interest. And no one, not even the president of the United States, will be above the law.' 
'Character is on the ballot. America's character,' Biden's prepared remarks said. 'I do not believe we're the dark, angry nation we see in Donald Trump's tweets.'
On Thursday, Trump mocked several of his Democratic rivals during a speech that stretched longer than an hour, declaring Biden's campaign 'over.'
'Joe had a crowd so small the other day that they set up a round table,' Trump said.
Earlier in the rally, he decried the impeachment process as a 'deranged, witch-hunt hoax' driven by partisan 'rage.'
After former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, a member of Trump's impeachment defense team, spent 30 minutes Monday echoing the president's attacks on Biden from the Senate floor, Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) bluntly assessed the political impact the broadside could have on the first-in-the-nation caucuses.
'Iowa caucuses, folks, Iowa caucuses are this next Monday evening,' Ernst told reporters on Monday. 'And I'm really interested to see how this discussion today informs and influences the Iowa caucus voters, those Democratic caucus-goers. Will they be supporting Vice President Biden at this point? Not certain about that.'
Biden, who has denied any wrongdoing, has responded by arguing that Republicans' focus on him signals their fear that he is the strongest candidate to defeat Trump in November.
'Joni Ernst just spilled the beans,' Biden wrote on Twitter. 'She and Donald Trump are scared to death I'll be the nominee. On February 3rd, let's make their day.'
Biden's campaign has also pushed back against the onslaught, criticizing Republican threats to call Biden and his son as witnesses in Trump's impeachment trial as partisan attempts to interfere in the 2020 race.
Trump stands accused of withholding military aid and a critical White House meeting from Ukraine to pressure the Eastern European nation to announce investigations into the Bidens. In her presentation at Trump's trial, Bondi accused Biden of corruptly pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor in 2015 while his son Hunter served on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company.
'Trump desperately wants to impact the outcome of the Democratic primary, dropping into Iowa a few days before the caucus to spread a message of division, discord, and hate,' Biden's campaign said in a statement previewing Thursday's speech. 'Trump has been trying to prevent Biden from getting the nomination since the moment the VP got into the race, getting himself impeached by the House and tried in the Senate in the process.'
Biden's campaign also released the new ad, which runs for one minute and is titled 'Character.' It criticizes Trump's behavior in the White House while describing Biden as a steady leader. 'It's said, 'In here is where your character is revealed,' ' the ad says, flashing an image of the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office. 'But it's in life where your character is formed.'
The ad ran Thursday in Iowa's top five media markets, Biden's campaign said.
Although Biden events can resemble classroom lectures on electoral math, the former vice president is wrapping up his Iowa bid by talking less about policy and more about character. Trump, he said Thursday, has led a 'culture of cruelty' from the White House. 
'This is a president who laughs at, insults and demeans other people. He pits us against one another. He traffics in the ugliest lies,' Biden said in Waukee.
Several polls have shown Biden leading Trump nationally and in key swing states in a hypothetical general-election matchup.
Polling in Iowa shows a close race in the Democratic caucuses, with Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg all vying for a victory on Monday.
Trump does not face serious competition in the Republican caucuses, which also take place Monday. 
His campaign's decision to send more than 80 surrogates into the state is aimed at engaging Trump supporters rather than affecting the outcome of the close Democratic race, said Kayleigh McEnany, a Trump campaign spokeswoman. 
'We're not there to shape the Democrat outcome,' she said. 'We're there to showcase the support for the president.'
Still, many of the surrogates will inevitably highlight the 'contrast' between Trump and some of the leading Democrats, she said. 
During a 'Women for Trump' event this month in Des Moines, McEnany and Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law, criticized Biden and Sanders as too liberal for the country.
Lara Trump is listed as one of the dozens of surrogates the Trump campaign plans to send to various caucus sites to meet with supporters and engage with local media in Iowa. Others include Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds (R), acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and several Cabinet secretaries.
Several Republican members of Congress who have been leading defenders of Trump against impeachment will also participate. Among them will be Reps. Jim Jordan (Ohio), Mark Meadows (N.C.), Matt Gaetz (Fla.) and Elise Stefanik (N.Y.)
'Our Caucus Day operation is just a preview of what is to come,' Brad Parscale, Trump's campaign manager, said in a statement this week. 'This will be the strongest, best funded, and most organized presidential campaign in history. We are putting the Democrats on notice "" good luck trying to keep up with this formidable reelection machine.'
Some non-surrogates are also seeking to influence the Iowa race. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) began running television ads this week in Iowa accusing Biden of 'corruption.'
The concerted attacks on Biden could end up 'rebounding against' Trump and his allies, said Jim Messina, who was campaign manager for President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection bid.
'Donald Trump's focusing on Joe Biden has helped Joe Biden during this primary process,' he said. 'Democrats understand that Trump is worried about Biden. And it helps Biden's electability argument.'

The 'electability' option crowded out other candidates "" then collapsed, says

After a fourth-place finish in Iowa and a fifth-place finish in New Hampshire, it's time to take a good, hard look at former vice president Joe Biden, the once-dominant, now-floundering Democratic 'front-runner.' Not to get too technical about it, but I would like to postulate that the Democratic front-runner should be, you know, in front.
Fourth- and fifth-place finishes do not in any way constitute being in front. Yes: To run on electability, one should demonstrate the ability to be elected. And that's shown by "" stick with me here "" winning elections. Perhaps a guy who ran for president two previous times but never placed better than fourth was an odd choice to make the case for electability in the first place.
Things could change after South Carolina, of course. That's the spin coming out of Biden's headquarters, and it's certainly true that Iowa and New Hampshire are lousy proxies for the rest of the country. But it looks like Biden is worse than unelectable "" he's also been a huge spoiler.-
Biden has distorted the whole 2020 primary cycle: He sat on top of the polls as the default front-runner for months, and in the process he sucked up endorsements (five senators, more than two dozen House members, state-level elected officials all over the place) and cash (though perhaps-not enough of it) that could have gone to other candidates who, instead, had to drop out for lack of money and establishment support. And then he lost the first two elections. It's only since his front-runner status started to slip that other centrist candidates have had much of a chance. The promise of Biden's electability kept former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg from entering the race until November and, as New York magazine put it, 'almost single-handedly stunted the growth of every other center-left-alternative.' Well before Bernie Sanders set off a panic among party insiders by winning the early contests, Biden took up the space that could have been occupied by an Amy Klobuchar or a Pete Buttigieg or a Cory Booker or a Kamala D. Harris.
It did, in fairness, almost seem like it could work. For a while, it looked as if being chosen by Barack Obama might be enough for Biden to squeak by while Sanders and Elizabeth Warren engaged in mutual progressive destruction. He could coast on his eight years of being a completely fine vice president, an almost-incumbent.
But he wasn't doing what needed to be done in a modern campaign. He didn't go on Rachel Maddow, and he didn't do selfie lines or Periscope or any of the other stuff that all the other modern candidates did. Biden is not, to put it mildly, a digital native. And even when the pundit class believed that he would win the hearts of white working-class men in diners, even then, Biden had trouble raising-money-because he just isn't that good at this, and-old clips show-he has never been very good at this.
-He pulled a Hillary Clinton-not-going-to-Wisconsin-esque move by-disappearing-in New Hampshire. He told bizarre stories such as one about meeting a black gang member called-Corn Pop, a tale that took place in 1962, beguiled all who heard it and, shockingly, actually happened. He called a female student 'a lying dog-faced-pony soldier' at a rally. I'm not entirely sure what 'a lying dog-faced pony soldier' is, but I know what it's not "" it's not a good thing to call a woman in front of lots of cameras. But anyone who knows Biden knows gaffes are kind of his thing. And they have been for years, which is part of the reason he hasn't already been president.
So now we're just over two weeks from Super Tuesday, and finally Biden has proved what many of us suspected all along: that to be electable, one must win elections. And suddenly the Democratic Party is scrambling to find a centrist front-runner who can occupy what has been called, up until the past few weeks, the Joe Biden lane.
It may be too late for centrists anyway; with Warren fading and Sanders consolidating the left, the moderates may have squandered their chance at the nomination as the Bernie wave washes over them. But still. The best thing Biden could do for the party is to drop out before the absolute only way for people to stop Sanders, if they want to, is to call the superdelegates in Milwaukee and have them vote for a billionaire ex-Republican.
'I've never paid attention to all the front-runner talk from the time I entered the-race,' Biden said in New Hampshire. If only no one else had, either, then perhaps we wouldn't be in this mess.

More than 80 break with tradition to endorse 
a presidential candidate
More than 80 career national security professionals have signed an open letter of support for Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, saying that President Trump ""has created an existential danger to the United States.""
Most of the signatories, who include career diplomats, intelligence officers and defense policymakers, have served both Republican and Democratic administrations. They noted that their policy views cover a spectrum and as officials they ""have often been in opposition, sometimes bitterly, with each other."" 
But in a letter published online Wednesday, they expressed a shared belief that Trump's approach to leadership has undermined the country's role in the world. 
""His reelection would continue this downward spiral and will likely have catastrophic results,"" say the signatories, most of whom have never publicly endorsed a candidate for president. 
Doug Wise, a former CIA clandestine officer and former deputy director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, broke a career-long vow to serve in silence by signing the letter. 
""We need to restore courtesy, respectability and consensus decision-making based not on the personal interests of Donald J. Trump but on the personal interests of Americans,"" said Wise, who retired in 2016 after 48 years of government service. 
Wise, who leans Republican, said that he has never voted for president, content to trust in the American democratic system ""to produce a good president and commander in chief."" But the system has failed, he said. So this November, he said, he will cast his first vote for president - for Biden.
Larry Pfeiffer, former senior director of the White House Situation Room and a former chief of staff to then-CIA Director Michael Hayden, said he leans Republican. ""If Donald Trump wasn't running, and it was Mitt Romney versus Joe Biden, I'd be endorsing Mitt Romney,"" he said. ""And I probably wouldn't be public about it.""
Pfeiffer, who served five presidents dating to Ronald Reagan, said he sees himself as nonpartisan, so much so that endorsing a candidate feels like ""an unnatural act.""
Margaret Henoch, a former CIA officer who joined the agency in the Reagan administration, agreed that a public endorsement is ""absolutely"" unheard of for career professionals. But these are not normal times, she said. 
Henoch said her endorsement is ""not political."" It's driven by a desire to restore ""the stability of the country and the world and the respect for the role and function of government"" in a democratic society.
Paul Rosenzweig said he was a Republican but became an independent in 2017 because ""the standard-bearer for my party no longer represented the values that I think the party should stand for.""
""Even though I am sure I will disagree with much of what [Biden] does, I am also certain that the overall result will be far superior under Biden than under Trump,"" said Rosenzweig, who served as a senior policy adviser at the Department of Homeland Security under President George W. Bush and as a senior counsel to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr in the Clinton administration.
James R. Clapper Jr., a former director of national intelligence who entered government service in the Kennedy administration and retired in 2017, has voted ""both ways"" in federal elections. He considers himself a ""Democrat domestically and a Republican in the foreign and national security realm.""
He, too, said he would vote for Biden. ""I just think he would represent, if elected, a restoration of normality to the country,"" said Clapper, a retired Air Force lieutenant general who served in five Democratic and five Republican administrations.

MANCHESTER, N.H. "" What becomes of the 'electability candidate' when he starts to lose?
In former vice president Joe Biden's case, it can seem as if he's short-circuiting. In New Hampshire, his news conferences were a stream of 'C'mon mans!' He filled his rallies with a repeated question about the state of the country: 'What in God's name is going on? What in God's name is going on?'
Throughout this endless slog of a primary race, Biden has clung to his front-runner status primarily based on the fact that he could win. But after a 'gut punch' fourth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, no one is sure exactly where he stands, least of all him.
'I've never paid attention to all the front-runner talk from the time I entered the race,' he told a crowd in Manchester.
'I've been the front-runner all the way through,' he said later on the same day.

What in God's name is going on?

'He is one of the most admirable people I've ever known,' said James Carville, the legendary Democratic strategist, who had thrown his support behind the presidential campaign of Sen. Michael F. Bennet (Colo.), who dropped out Tuesday night following a poor showing in New Hampshire. 'But he's never been a good candidate. This is not his first rodeo, and he ain't roped a cow yet.'
To make matters worse, Carville said, stating the obvious, Biden is older, and running for president isn't getting any easier.
'I'm 75, I know,' he said. 'I'm thinking about how I'm going to get back in my car without tripping on ice.'
There's a surreal feeling surrounding the Biden campaign's efforts in New Hampshire. At first, he wasn't even there, spending the day last Thursday huddling with his team in Delaware trying to figure out a path forward. And when he did arrive, on Friday evening, he stood onstage at Saint Anselm College and announced to the audience of nearly 8-million people watching the Democratic debate that he expected to lose the first-in-the-nation primary.
'I took a hit in Iowa,' he said, 'and I'm probably going to take a hit here.'
Maybe this is a strategic move by a candidate whose best play, for now, is to manage expectations.

In the final sign that the former vice president expected a weak showing here, Biden blew off his election night party in Nashua, N.H., where supporters had been invited to gather. Instead, he headed to Columbia, S.C. As results rolled in Tuesday night, it seemed Biden made the right choice. As of 9 p.m., he had placed a disappointing fifth.
But how exactly are his people in New Hampshire supposed to feel about that? Does anyone know what place they should be fighting for?
'If he came in second that would be a big win,' said Bill Shaheen, a Biden surrogate and husband of Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.).
'I'd be happy in the top three,' said Heather Ledoux, a registered nurse who turned her house in Litchfield into a canvassing staging area.
'Top four counts as a win,' said Bob Mulholland, a member of the Democratic National Committee and a Biden supporter.
'I'm not going to prognosticate,' former secretary of state John F. Kerry said when asked what would count as a success. 'You'll know it, we'll all know it, we'll feel it.'


Three days before the New Hampshire primary, Michelle Kwan, Olympic figure skater and director of surrogates for Joe Biden, arrived at the campaign's Concord field office with a joke.
'Let me just skate in here,' she said, sliding into the room with her arms outstretched.
She immediately launched into a spiel about why Biden is the best candidate for president: his character, his integrity, his record of getting things done. The heads of a dozen volunteers nodded in unison, but there was still one thing the volunteers were unsure of.
'Hi,' a man piped up during a pause in Kwan's speech. 'I just wanted to make sure everybody in the room knew who you were.'
'You never told us who you are,' someone else agreed.
'Oh, I'm sorry,' said Kwan, who previously worked on Hillary Clinton's silver-medal campaign. 'When I said 'skate in,' I literally meant skate in. I'm an Olympic figure skater.'
It was a meaningless stumble, as far as hectic campaign organizing goes, until you consider the kind of campaign Biden has been running: one that emphasizes the need to rewind the American story to the recent past "" when Biden himself, along with many of his champions (Kwan, Kerry, former senator Chris Dodd), seemed slightly less dated.
Still, there are glimpses of the qualities that Biden and his supporters hope will make him an appealing candidate for these times. For many Democrats the world is a dark and scary place, and Biden doesn't shy away from that. At a rally in a high school gymnasium in Hudson, in front of his biggest New Hampshire crowd to date, Biden's speech touched upon the suicide epidemic, Sandy Hook, battered wives, homeless children, stories of voters suffering from job loss and Stage 4 cancer.
'Butterflies are dying,' he said. 'Bumblebees are dying. And that means we are in real trouble.'
A jittery electorate, the theory goes, may look for the safest candidate. What's a more natural transition than vice president to president? And if anyone can offer some hope in a time of tragedy, it may be Biden; not just because he has experience taking on the National Rifle Association or because he wrote the Violence Against Women Act but also because he's lived through tragedy himself. More than ever he has been talking about the loss of his first wife and daughter in a car crash, and the recent death of his son Beau due to brain cancer.
'I've lost a lot in my life,' he has been saying at the close of his events. 'I'll be damned if I'm going to stand by and lose my country, too.'
His events can be subdued affairs, but that line never fails to draw roars from the crowd.
'He's strong, he's resilient, he gets up and he keeps going,' his wife, Jill, told a group of supporters in Peterborough before she headed out to knock on some doors herself.
For anyone on the fence about Joe Biden, Jill had this to offer: When he first showed up on her doorstep for a blind date in 1975, she wasn't sure if she liked him, either. She was a college student, used to hanging with the bell-bottomed crowd, and here was a guy coming to pick her up wearing a perfect suit and leather loafers.
'Thank God this is only one date,' she remembered thinking.
He won her over, of course, with his grace, his character and his intellect. Yeah, even today he might be a little old-fashioned: with all that talk about bipartisanship and tamping down expectations about liberal dreams such as Medicare-for-all. But he's got character, integrity "" a 'gentleman,' Jill remembers telling her mom on the phone when she got home after their date. Perhaps if voters give him a chance, they can be wooed, too?
They say that Democrats fall in love and Republicans fall in line, but right now, Democrats just seem to be falling all over themselves. The Iowa caucuses, with their technical glitches and late reporting, offered no winnowing of the field and little clarity about what happens next.
Kwan's message to the campaign workers in Concord was to 'make sure that what happened in Iowa only happens in Iowa.' They could still turn this around, but time was against them.
A whiteboard hung on the wall of the office, purporting to count down the time until voting would begin. It said: '15 days.'
'This,' Kwan said, pointing to the sign, 'is incorrect.'


When a campaign appears to be on a downward spiral, it becomes easy to see signs of doom.
Some, like the vulture that took flight just blocks away as Biden wrapped a speech in Manchester, are purely metaphorical.
'They're not uncommon,' said a representative from the New Hampshire Audubon society. 'They are usually not here in the dead of winter. But if they sense that there can be some food, they start working their way up.'
But not every instance of foreshadowing is as easy to dismiss. There was Biden's anemic cheering section at the McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club Dinner "" a raucous fundraiser held in a Manchester hockey arena "" that appeared smaller even than the group that came out to support nominal presidential candidate Deval Patrick. There are the ways in which Biden has begun acting like an underdog, attacking his opponents as too inexperienced ('Pete Buttigieg . . . he's a smart guy, but he's been the mayor of a city smaller than the city we're in now') or too extreme to win a general election ('I didn't put the label on Bernie. Bernie calls himself a Democratic socialist').
Even his supporters have begun talking about him like a long shot.
'No one ever expected Donald Trump to be elected president, either,' said Barry Nestor, standing outside the Rex Theatre in Manchester, wearing socks on his hands to keep warm before seeing Biden speak.
But perhaps the hardest signs of bad news to ignore, for a candidacy like Biden's, were the polls that showed him coming in anywhere from third to fifth place.
'I never believed in polls,' Kerry said at a canvassing event in Portsmouth. 'I hate them. They should not be allowed to be printed two weeks prior to an election.'
They have the ability to distort an election, Kerry said, to change the minds of undecided voters based on who they think has the best chance of winning.
So what exactly is a candidate running on the strength of his ability to get elected supposed to do when the polls turn against him?
Find another poll, of course.
'Well, if you notice,' Biden said at a news conference in his Manchester headquarters, 'I'm still winning nationally.'

Arguments for and against President Trump's ouster ended Monday in the Senate impeachment trial, with the House managers calling the president a danger to democracy because of his actions toward Ukraine and Trump's legal team arguing that impeachment, not Trump's conduct, is the real threat. 
Two days before Trump's expected acquittal, the two sides summarized their arguments and pleaded for agreement before a chamber that had largely made up its mind. Democrats have nowhere near the two-thirds of the Senate needed to remove Trump from office, and the only remaining drama centered on a few possible swing votes from each party, particularly the handful of Democrats who would hand Trump a messaging victory if they join Republicans on the final votes. 
In a floor speech, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) declined to announce his decision, but asked his colleagues to consider censuring Trump, a less severe rebuke than removal from office that few senators were willing to pursue. Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) said that he remains undecided about how he will vote.
Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) condemned the House's probe while also calling Trump's behavior 'shameful and wrong.' But she said she could not vote to convict.
Meanwhile, House manager Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.) argued that senators who believe Trump will change in his approach to the presidency are mistaken. 
'He has betrayed our national security, and he will do so again. He has compromised our elections, and he will do so again. You will not change him. You cannot constrain him. He is who he is. Truth matters little to him. What's right matters even less and decency matters not at all,' Schiff said. 
White House Counsel Pat Cipollone argued that Trump has done 'nothing wrong.' 
'These types of impeachments must end,' he told the senators. 'You will vindicate the right to vote. You'll vindicate the Constitution. You'll vindicate the rule of law by rejecting these articles. And I ask you to do that on a bipartisan basis.' 
Closing statements from House managers and Trump's legal team consumed just over four hours on the Senate floor, a leisurely day reflecting the sense on Capitol Hill that the trial's outcome was a foregone conclusion. The Senate voted Friday to block witnesses and evidence related to Trump's conduct, barring additional information that could sway moderate Republicans and setting up a final vote for Wednesday, after Trump's State of the Union address on Tuesday night. 
The feeling of anticlimax was heightened by a shift in the political spotlight toward Iowa, with the first nominating contest of the 2020 election Monday night. The four Democratic senators who are running for president were prevented from traveling to the early voting states until after the arguments concluded in the early afternoon. 
Both the House managers and Trump's legal team crafted their remarks with a view toward the campaign trail, as voters will decide the future of his presidency. 
'We're sitting here on the day that election season begins in Iowa. It is wrong. There is only one answer to that, and the answer is to reject those articles of impeachment, to have confidence in the American people, to have confidence in the result of the upcoming election, to have confidence and respect for the last election and not throw it out,' Cipollone said in his closing remarks. 
Trump is accused of withholding military aid and an Oval Office meeting to push Ukraine's leaders into announcing probes of Democrats, including former vice president Joe Biden, now a presidential candidate, and his son Hunter. The House impeached the president in December on two charges "" abuse of power and obstruction of Congress "" related to these allegations and his response to the investigation. 
Schiff argued that Trump lacks the character to comport himself properly as president, describing his behavior as 'far more destructive' than the actions of Presidents Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton that triggered their impeachment proceedings. 
'If you find that the House has proved his case and still vote to acquit, your name will be tied to his with a cord of steel and for all of history,' Schiff told Republicans who have called Trump's behavior inappropriate. 'But if you find the courage to stand up to him, to speak the awful truth to his rank falsehood, your place will be among the Davids who took on Goliath, if only you will say enough.'
Lawyers for Trump said his conduct was not improper and not impeachable. 
'However you are to define high crimes and misdemeanors, there is no definition that includes disagreeing with a policy decision as an acceptable ground to removal of a president of the United States,' said Trump attorney Jay Sekulow. 
More Senate Republicans have acknowledged since Friday that the president's behavior was problematic, though none is expected to cross party lines and vote to eject him from office. 
'I think it's not something that should have been done, and I think that [is] needlessly inviting a lot of controversy when you're going after a person that might not even be your opponent,' Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the chamber's president pro tempore, told NBC News. 

After Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) called Trump's conduct 'inappropriate' on Friday, Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) told reporters, 'Let me be clear: Lamar speaks for lots and lots of us.' He declined to elaborate. 
At least 10 Senate Republicans have made similar comments, including Richard Burr (N.C.), Susan Collins (Maine), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Rob Portman (Ohio), Mitt Romney (Utah), Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Patrick J. Toomey (Pa.). But only Collins and Romney joined Democrats to vote in favor of witness testimony on Friday. 
These comments have contributed to speculation that Congress could pursue censure, as Manchin proposed. 'What the president did was wrong,' Manchin said in his floor speech.
But multiple senators of both parties dismissed the idea as they arrived at the Capitol on Monday.
Asked to gauge the appetite for censure among Republicans, Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) said, '. . . zero.'
The vast majority of Republicans, he said, believe that Trump committed no wrongdoing and that he has been subjected to a partisan, politically motivated investigation.
Several Democrats said they were also uninterested in the idea, calling it a punishment well short of what Trump's alleged conduct deserves.
'What he did was an impeachable offense. I think it's absolutely obvious, and giving a slap on the wrist doesn't do any good,' said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.).

Former vice president Joe Biden moved aggressively Sunday to capitalize on his dramatic South Carolina victory, welcoming a round of key endorsements and insisting in television interviews that he alone can unite his anxious party and stave off the ascent of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).
Biden's newfound confidence came as like-minded contenders confronted pleas to drop out and back him ahead of this week's primary elections - and as Democratic operatives deliberated over the timing and nature of those decisions.
A significant boost for Biden came Sunday evening, when former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg - one of his rivals for moderate votes - ended his campaign with a speech that, while not an endorsement, echoed Biden's arguments for consolidating behind him. 

Several influential Democrats from Super Tuesday states also gave Biden a lift on Sunday as they announced their support, including former senator Barbara Boxer of California. In Virginia, Rep. Jennifer Wexton - who won her suburban district in 2018, turning the seat blue for the first time in 38 years - endorsed Biden, calling him a ""steady, empathetic leader.""
Wexton's nod came after other prominent Virginia Democrats such as Sen. Tim Kaine, former governor Terry McAuliffe and Rep. Robert C. ""Bobby"" Scott endorsed Biden - a reflection of the urgency in the party's establishment to counter Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist.
Biden's efforts are rooted in his campaign's belief that he needs to use the burst of momentum and attention from South Carolina to rally Democrats to his side before Tuesday's elections, when 14 states and one territory will vote to award 34 percent of the convention delegates. Biden has lagged behind rivals in organizing and fundraising for months.
Biden attempted to make up for past deficiencies with a round-robin set of television appearances in which he contrasted his centrist approach with Sanders's pitch for a federal overhaul, which centers on a move toward a single-payer health-care system.
""People aren't looking for a revolution,"" Biden said on CNN's ""State of the Union."" ""They're looking for results.""
On NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" the former vice president boasted of the gains already seen by his campaign, which has struggled since its start to keep pace with better-financed candidates.
""A lot of supporters stepped up the last 24 hours; we raised over $5 million,"" Biden said.
While Saturday's South Carolina's primary was a thunderclap - Biden decisively won the contest, in which African American voters had a significant say for the first time this election season - it provided an affirmation of his candidacy rather than a guarantee of coming success. Sanders is polling strongly in many Super Tuesday battlegrounds, and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on advertising in those states.
""This race is a long way from being over and is as competitive as ever,"" said Shelia A. Huggins, a member of the Democratic National Committee from North Carolina, which votes on Tuesday. ""Joe is still in the game. But Democratic voters here and everywhere are more strategic than decided at this point. Everyone wants to beat [President] Trump. What they're debating is just how much change they want to see.""
Sens. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii remained in the Democratic race on Sunday night. But throughout the day, there was pressure on Buttigieg and Klobuchar, in particular, to consider ending their bids after they struggled in South Carolina and the Nevada caucuses to expand their appeal among minority voters. Liberal investor Tom Steyer dropped out late Saturday.
Those conversations - a flurry of phone calls and meetings - rippled with political calculations as top Democrats mapped out the brutal stretch ahead. 
For many Biden allies, Bloomberg - the billionaire centrist whose name will appear on ballots for the first time Tuesday - remains the biggest headache, and they are hopeful that he may soon decide to bow out. On Sunday, they passed around a clip from MSNBC in which David Plouffe, Barack Obama's 2008 campaign manager, said, ""The reality is Bloomberg needed Biden to lose South Carolina to have any chance.""
""Bloomberg is the one in focus because he has the resources to go on indefinitely and compete and divide the center-left vote with Biden,"" said David Axelrod, a senior adviser in the Obama White House.
Although Biden's campaign would welcome a narrowed field, several allies are also informally telling allies of Klobuchar and Warren to consider staying in the race until Tuesday night, to deny Sanders a major delegate haul in the Super Tuesday states of Minnesota and Massachusetts, according to three people briefed on the talks who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak frankly.
In the arcane process that Democrats use to pick nominees, delegates are awarded proportionally to any candidate who hits a threshold of 15 percent of the vote. Those rules put a premium on candidates who have broad support to win statewide, which determines a portion of the delegates, and also win individual congressional or state Senate districts, which account for the rest. And the setup benefits campaigns that can pinpoint the areas where they can either win a few extra delegates - or potentially deny an opponent from doing so.
Fourteen states and one U.S. territory will hold nominating contests on Tuesday, to award about one-third of the 1,991 delegates needed to clinch the nomination. Tuesday's states also include Arkansas, Maine, Utah, Oklahoma and Colorado.
After winning 60 percent of the African American vote in South Carolina, Biden's Super Tuesday outlook is best in states where those voters represent a high percentage of the Democratic electorate, such as Alabama. 
""Once things start settling, you'll see that Joe Biden will overwhelmingly take more delegates,"" Frank Love, the Arkansas state House minority leader, predicted Sunday, as Biden's wife, Jill, campaigned in North Little Rock. The core reason, he added, was that Biden was the partner of ""the greatest president of our generation"" and is ready to defeat Trump and pick up that Obama legacy.
Sanders's campaign aides say that he is ready to make gains with younger, more liberal African American voters in states such as North Carolina and have argued that South Carolina is older and more moderate than most of the states voting on Tuesday.
""Wait until you see what happens in other states,"" said Sanders deputy campaign manager Ari Rabin-Havt. ""Transmuting a population, one state's population to every state in the country, is a mistake.""

Bloomberg has attempted to make inroads with African American voters but has encountered continued problems over his past support of stop-and-frisk, a police strategy that opponents say is a form of racial profiling. Before announcing his candidacy, he apologized for defending the practice.
As Bloomberg spoke Sunday in Selma, Ala., at Brown Chapel AME Church, about 10 people stood and silently turned their backs to him. The incident caused a stir in the church, but Bloomberg continued his remarks without interruption. Others continued to listen, some cheering and applauding.
Biden and Sanders are now running near polar opposite campaigns. The once-ailing Biden operation is trying to ride the wave of momentum and attention as he reminds voters of his work alongside Obama and warns them of the perils of backing Sanders.
""I have gotten major, major things done. I'm able to cross the aisle and get things done. And so I think it's about who can not only win, bring along a Senate and keep a House, the House of Representatives, but who can then get something done,"" Biden said on CNN.
Sanders, meanwhile, is roaring before thousands at rallies and is counting on his grass-roots organizing in states such as California and Texas, which he has been building since his insurgent 2016 campaign.
Sanders raised $46.5 million in February, his presidential campaign said Sunday, a huge sum that could help sustain him in a lengthy battle for the nomination. The senator from Vermont won nominating contests in Nevada and New Hampshire last month before placing a distant second in South Carolina.
Sanders, who has criticized Biden for his past backing of military intervention in Iraq and his support of free trade, attacked Biden on Sunday as an ally of the wealthy and centrist Democratic establishment that he is trying to overhaul.
Speaking at a rally in San Jose on Sunday, Sanders said: ""At a time when the American people are sick and tired of endless wars, of the terrible death rate we have seen from these wars, the trillions of dollars we have spent on these wars, please do not forget Joe Biden voted for the war in Iraq.""
""We've got to be honest,"" Sanders told the crowd. ""Which campaign can beat Trump?"" His supporters chanted ""Bernie! Bernie!""
Most national Democrats treaded carefully as they approached the candidates and senior aides to struggling campaigns, knowing that the decision to drop out is deeply personal as well as political. With Obama on the sidelines and former nominee Hillary Clinton also quiet, there was also open debate about who, if anyone, had enough political capital to force an exit.
Warren, for her part, showed no signs of relenting. Her campaign announced that she raised $29.3 million last month, more than doubling her January haul thanks to a boost from her well-reviewed debate turn in Nevada - and the campaign increased its advertising spending in Super Tuesday states to $2.4 million. A pro-Warren super PAC is also spending millions.
Klobuchar's aides and confidants said she was campaigning hard ahead of Super Tuesday and felt good about her chances in her home state. 
""I want to go everywhere,"" Klobuchar told a Utah television station on Sunday. 
Buttigieg on Sunday met with former president Jimmy Carter near Carter's home in Plains, Ga. Carter told reporters, ""He doesn't know what he's going to do after South Carolina.""
Buttigieg replied, ""Every day, we'll do the math.""

Hours later, Buttigieg dropped out before a rapturous crowd in South Bend that chanted ""2024! 2024!""
""The truth is that the path has narrowed to a close for our candidacy, if not for our cause,"" he said.

Klobuchar, Steyer also had winning moments on the debate stage
The Democratic presidential primary entered a new phase Friday night, with the Iowa results finally all in and the candidates debating in New Hampshire ahead of Tuesday's primary.
Below, some winners and losers:
Winners

Bernie Sanders: Sanders weathered early attacks on his electability "" partially because the other candidates didn't completely commit to the attack "" and proceeded to have a mostly easy debate. He's a candidate who is often criticized for saying the same things over and over again, but he brought something new Friday night and gave some passionate responses that may resonate.
An answer in which he bore down on President Trump seemed to play particularly well. He said Trump had set a precedent in which 'you're going to have presidents who say, 'Hey, governor, you want highway money, you better support me. Well, you're not going to get it because I am the president. I can do anything I want. Hey, Congress, you want to investigate me? Don't be ridiculous. Who cares about the Congress? Who cares about the separation of powers? Who cares about the Constitution? . . . The president of the United States? I have all of the power, and I'm able to intimidate members of my own party.' ' Sanders added of Senate Republicans: 'They knew that Donald Trump is a cheat, but they didn't have the guts.'
Mostly, though, the night lacked a sustained or powerful line of attack on Sanders who, after all, is leading most of the polls in New Hampshire. Pete Buttigieg took more incoming on Friday.

Amy Klobuchar: The senator from Minnesota has been solid at debates, and Friday was one of her best "" mostly because she landed some punches on her top opponent, Buttigieg. She began by noting that he unequivocally supported Medicare-for-all in a 2018 tweet even though he doesn't anymore (Buttigieg responded that he had been 'consistent' on the issue but unfortunately wasn't pressed to explain). And then she had one of the strongest moments of the night when she gave plaudits to Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) and Mitt Romney (R-Utah) for casting tough votes to remove Trump. She was also the first to praise Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, whom Trump removed from the White House on Friday over his impeachment testimony.
Klobuchar then pivoted to another potent attack on Buttigieg for his statement that the impeachment trial exhausted him. 'It is much harder to lead and much harder to take those difficult positions,' she said, 'because I think this going after every single thing that people do, because it's popular to say and makes you look like a cool newcomer "" I just, I don't think that's what people want right now. We have a newcomer in the White House. And look where it got us.' Yikes. Klobuchar has had good debates before, though, and she still finished fifth in Iowa. She needs to do quite a bit better in New Hampshire. She clearly thinks her path goes through Buttigieg. We'll see.

Tom Steyer's warning: Steyer is easy to caricature as a candidate, and he often seems too eager to get into the mix. But early in Friday's debate, he made arguments that the Democrats would do well to heed: that they need to prosecute the economic case against Trump. 'If you look at what Mr. Trump is saying, he's saying those words: 'It's the economy, stupid,' ' Steyer said. 'I trust every one of these people a million times more [than Trump]. But we're going to have to take Mr. Trump down on the economy because if you listen to him, he's crowing about it every single day. And he's going to beat us unless we can take down on the economy, stupid.' Trump's numbers are indeed on the rise. Democrats, though, haven't figured out what their economic rebuttal to him is "" including Friday night.
Losers

Pete Buttigieg: Buttigieg got a treatment Friday night that he simply hasn't gotten before. The ever-prepared candidate may not have had any disastrous moments, but the Klobuchar attack wasn't the only one that might give some voters pause. He noted that drug arrests in South Bend, Ind., where he served as mayor, were below the national average, but then the moderator noted that they actually went up on his watch. Buttigieg responded by talking about systemic racism. Elizabeth Warren was asked whether his response was sufficient and said bluntly, 'No.' Steyer said he was 'worried about Mayor Pete' as the nominee. Plenty of candidates pointed in the same direction: that Buttigieg just isn't ready and is too big a risk. The drug arrests question also recalled Buttigieg's main liability as a candidate: his lack of support from African Americans.
One strong moment for Buttigieg, though, came when he was asked whether there was a danger in nominating Joe Biden given Republicans are investigating his son, Hunter Biden. 'No, we're not going to let them change the subject,' Buttigieg said. 'This is not about Hunter Biden or Vice President Biden or anybody. This is about an abuse of power by the president.' Nothing that happened Friday was perhaps crippling for Buttigieg, but his performance wasn't as confidence-inspiring as past ones, and it reinforced some of his liabilities.

Joe Biden: Rarely do you see a candidate begin a debate by waving the white flag, but that's kind of what Biden did on Friday. At the start of the debate, Biden acknowledged he took 'a hit in Iowa, and I'll probably take a hit here. Traditionally, Bernie won by 20 points last time.' Okay, maybe that's some expectation-setting, but usually you see that on the trail rather than in a high-profile debate in front of a bunch of would-be voters.
As the debate wore on, Biden didn't really do much to suggest his prediction was wrong. He rebutted an answer about the politics of the past by saying, 'The politics of the past, I think, are not all that bad.' He proceeded to try to rescue the point by noting significant legislation he had participated in. Then Buttigieg shot back just as quickly, 'Those achievements were phenomenally important because they met the moment, but now we have to meet this moment, and this moment is different.' At another particularly puzzling moment, Biden predicted Congress would codify Roe v. Wade if the Supreme Court overturned it, which . . . seems pretty optimistic given the politics of abortion. 
Biden tries really hard to emphasize that the past shows what can be done in the future, but you wonder how many people are buying it. Mostly, though, there was nothing Friday night to suggest Biden would arrest his backward momentum "" in New Hampshire or anywhere else.
In the middle

Elizabeth Warren: She was mostly a spectator early on "" which isn't ideal if you are the third-place candidate in Iowa. But she had some moments as the debate wore on. Particularly strong were her comments on race, in which she implored her party to focus on black voters more frequently "" even when they weren't seeking their votes. 
'Year after year after year, election after election after election, Democrats go to people in the black community and say, 'Boy, we really care about these issues. Racism is terrible. We all want to do something,' ' she said. 'And then somehow the problem just seems to keep getting worse. Well, I think it's time we have real concrete plans that are going to make a difference in people's lives.' She used the moment to argue that her wealth tax would help black people close the economic gap.

Voters, campaigns and election officials in four states holding contests Tuesday are braced for a presidential primary day unlike any in memory, as the surging threat of the novel coronavirus has forced major changes at voting locations, rattled poll workers and left voters worried about how to cast their ballots.
In Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio, election officials have raced to replace poll workers who have said they will not show Tuesday, supply thousands of precincts with sanitizing supplies, and notify voters whose polling locations, many in senior facilities, have been moved as a result of the pandemic. 
Voters, meanwhile, have flooded information hotlines. Among their urgent questions: where to vote, how to deliver a ballot if they are under quarantine and how to vote if they registered while attending a college that is closed.
As the coronavirus spreads, the Democratic Party of Puerto Rico announced Sunday that it would seek to postpone the territory's March 29 primaries, joining Louisiana and Georgia. A New York election official said Sunday that discussions are underway about whether to delay that state's contests.
The rapidly changing landscape left officials worried about the threat of two equally dire outcomes Tuesday: chaos at voting places, with diminished staffs causing long lines and increasing the risk of exposure to the deadly virus; or low turnout levels fueled by public fear. 
Either scenario could roil the Democratic presidential contest and complicate former vice president Joe Biden's efforts to secure the nomination over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Among the four states voting Tuesday, 577 delegates are up for grabs.
""I really don't have any idea how it will go,"" said Wendy Sartory Link, supervisor of elections in Palm Beach County, the second-largest of Florida's 67 counties. 
Of roughly 3,500 poll workers originally signed up to work at 435 voting locations in Palm Beach, about 650 have canceled amid fears about the virus, Link said.
That means some polling locations slated to have 10 workers on hand could instead have seven, or even five. It also will mean fewer check-in stations and, if turnout is robust, longer lines, she said.
Link said her office successfully notified all voters whose precincts were moved as a result of the pandemic, for instance if the original location was in an assisted-living facility. Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) on Friday ordered locations near certain vulnerable populations moved.
One of the biggest challenges, voting advocates said, is just making sure people know how to cast their ballots.
Marcia Johnson-Blanco, co-director of the Voting Rights Project at the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said her team is making its way through a mountain of calls from voters, including college students who registered on campus but are home now and self-quarantined individuals not sure how to deliver their ballots in states that don't allow third parties to handle them.
""We're just in uncharted territories on so many fronts,"" Johnson-Blanco said.
On Sunday, people voting early in Ohio, Florida and Illinois crowded into polling locations at higher-than-usual rates - in many cases to avoid potentially longer lines Tuesday.
Lisa Hamilton, 55, a teacher's aide from Shaker Heights, Ohio, said she voted Sunday because she is in remission after battling multiple myeloma and was worried about her vulnerability to the coronavirus. But she and other voters encountered crowds at the Cuyahoga County Board of Elections headquarters, with wait times between 30 and 45 minutes, according to election officials. 
""I have my Purell, I have my tissue that I picked up the pen with and voted with, I asked the person behind me, who was coming too close, 'Please give me some more space,' "" Hamilton said. ""I don't know if I offended anybody, but I am worried about being out here with so many people. But at the same time I think it's so important.""
At an early-voting site in West Palm Beach, Fla., Jane Murphy, a middle school assistant principal, sanitized her hands twice in between casting her vote for Biden, directed by poll workers to a container of hand wipes by the door. 
""We have to be responsible citizens, even in a pandemic,"" Murphy said. 
Marc Elias, a Democratic election lawyer in Washington, said Tuesday represents the country's first test of how to administer an election in the middle of a pandemic - and is likely to provide a road map for the necessary preparations for the more critical general election in November. 
A bad day, he added, ""will feed not only a narrative that people are waiting a long time but also that there's a public health crisis as well.""
Catherine Turcer, executive director of Common Cause Ohio, said the public's fears could overtake their desire to vote - though she encouraged people who feel comfortable to turn out. 

""We're asking people to go into pretty confined conditions, and even with all sorts of wipes and the things that can be done to make things safe, it is anxiety-provoking,"" she said. 
In France, voter turnout in the first round of local elections Sunday was down 20 points compared with 2014, according to French media, as some questioned President Emmanuel Macron's decision to proceed with the vote. 
So even as state and local officials in the United States intensified their warnings about the coronavirus threat Sunday, they also sought to reassure voters that casting their ballots was safe.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) ordered all bars and restaurants to close at 9 p.m. Sunday until further notice, calling it a ""life and death"" decision. But like leaders in the other three states holding elections this week, he said there were no plans to delay the primaries.
""It is important for us to be able to exercise our constitutional rights,"" DeWine said, ""and to interrupt an election in the middle of it poses some very, very serious consequences.""
In a video posted Friday on YouTube, Ohio Department of Health Director Amy Acton said it was ""absolutely"" safe for people who are healthy to serve as poll workers.
""We need you,"" Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose said in the same video. ""This is your patriotic duty. . . . A no-call, no-show on Tuesday is absolutely not acceptable.""
Still, Ohio and Illinois are still struggling to recruit enough poll workers to prevent disruptions Tuesday, advocates and officials said. In Cook County, Ill., Clerk Karen A. Yarbrough tweeted that all training requirements will be waived for volunteers.
At the county level, officials are taking a variety of precautions, but some said they have struggled to provide supplies for all voting locations.
In some Ohio jurisdictions, cotton swabs will be available to use on screen-based voting machines. In Franklin County, the most populous in the state, voters will have access to finger cots, also known as finger gloves or finger condoms, as they cast their ballots.
Paul Lux, supervisor of elections in Okaloosa County, in Florida's Panhandle, said he wasn't able to secure hand sanitizer for all 42 voting locations. Lux also learned Sunday that local officials had just closed two city recreation centers slated to serve as voting locations. Scrambling to find alternatives, he was able to persuade city leaders to cordon off portions of both buildings to allow voting to proceed.
Meanwhile, key states due to vote in April were weighing their own emergency decisions.
Douglas A. Kellner, New York State Board of Elections co-chairman, said talks were underway with the governor's office and legislative leaders about postponing the presidential primary from April 28 to June 23. 
In Wisconsin, which is scheduled to hold its primaries April 7, the elections commission asked local clerks to mail absentee ballots to voters in nursing homes. Officials urged all voters to cast absentee ballots if possible.
Back in Florida, Michele Levy, a poll worker near Orlando, said she will show up Tuesday as a matter of principle. ""The voters need us now,"" said Levy, a board member with the League of Women Voters of Florida.
She said the county has not provided sanitizing supplies for where she'll work Tuesday, Orange Technical College in Winter Park, so she is encouraging voters to bring their own. 
""I intend to wash my hands a lot and just, you know, hopefully things will go well,"" she said. ""I don't know what else to do. We're all a little concerned, but we'll be there.""

When Bolivia's leftist president was pressured to resign by his country's military after an audit found signs of a tainted election two months ago, many American leaders showed little interest in condemning the ouster. Some said it was a potentially positive step for democracy "" a sign, as President Trump put it, that 'the will of the people will always prevail.'
A sharply different response came from Sen. Bernie Sanders, who immediately condemned 'what appears to be a coup.' The ousted leader, Evo Morales, who had challenged term limits to remain in power, later thanked the senator from Vermont and Democratic presidential candidate, referring to him affectionately as 'brother.'
Most of Sanders's rivals paid little attention to the incident in a faraway place. But for Sanders, the episode offered a glimpse into an un or tho dox foreign policy worldview "" anchored by a passionate opposition to U.S. military interventions "" that has been overshadowed by his famously liberal domestic policy agenda.
With the Iran crisis thrusting foreign affairs to the forefront of the campaign, just as Sanders rises in early state polls, Democrats who previously waved off the senator's views as fringe ideas now must contemplate the possibility of a democratic socialist becoming commander in chief of the United States. Trump has already upended the world order with an 'America First' approach that tests Western alliances, and Sanders would deliver another jolt "" echoing some of Trump's criticisms of military actions and free trade but realigning the country's priorities even more thoroughly.
Beyond his objection to Morales's removal, Sanders has pointedly declined to label Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro a dictator. He called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a 'racist,' and he has campaigned with Reps. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) and Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.), vocal supporters of a controversial Israel boycott movement. He said China has done more to address extreme poverty 'than any country in the history of civilization.'
And as Sanders has noted repeatedly in recent days, he opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq that most U.S. leaders, including former vice president Joe Biden, supported, advancing an argument that he is the most unwavering antiwar candidate in the race.
'I think it would be a fundamental shift, assuming his principles hold in the transition from campaigning to governing,' said Aaron David Miller, a former adviser to six secretaries of state and now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'You've had a consensus in this country on certain principles. Joe Biden represents that consensus. And to a degree, Obama as well.'
Even some Democrats note that Sanders has put much more emphasis on domestic policies than global ones. 'It hasn't been his strong suit,' Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said of Sanders's foreign policy.
Sanders and his supporters say he's been right on foreign policy far more than the supposed experts, and that the establishment is responsible for a series of misguided military adventures. Besides, they say, Sanders's positions are often more nuanced than he's given credit for "" he has criticized Morales and Maduro, for example, even while questioning the wisdom of removing them.
'What were the two major foreign policy blunders in our lifetimes? Help me out here. What were they? Vietnam was one, and Iraq was the other,' Sanders said Saturday at a town hall in Newton, Iowa. 'I marched against the war in Vietnam. I was a kid. As a United States congressman in 2002, 2003, I helped lead the effort to prevent us from invading Iraq.'
Sanders's campaign declined to make him available for an interview. In a statement, Sanders's national policy director Josh Orton said that 'Washington's foreign policy establishment has been consistently wrong' and that a Sanders administration would 'begin to repair the damage done by Trump.'
Sanders, 78, was strongly influenced by the Reagan-era U.S. interventions in Latin America, which appalled many liberals. Those years also influenced his broader approach to the region, which stands apart from many Democrats. Sanders was at odds with many in the party last year, for example, when he refused to call Maduro a dictator, even as he made critical comments about the authoritarian socialist leader.
His comments about Morales, whose success lifting Bolivians into the middle class made him an iconic figure among socialists, also stood out. At a Univision forum, Sanders praised Morales for addressing poverty and empowering indigenous people. He added that it was fair to question whether he should have stayed in power so long "" almost 14-years "" but it was a far less critical approach than other Democrats took toward a man whom many viewed as increasingly authoritarian.
Sanders has been accused by members of both parties of not being tough enough on repressive socialist regimes. 'He's not going to pretend we face remotely equivalent threats from left-wing authoritarianism than from right-wing authoritarianism,' said a senior Sanders aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to be candid.
When he ran for president four years ago, Sanders often appeared unprepared for a rigorous foreign policy debate. Facing opponent Hillary Clinton, a former secretary of state, he often sidestepped questions about specific global challenges.
Following his loss, Sanders sought to shore up his foreign policy credentials. After the 2016 election, he hired Matt Duss, who has helped the candidate with his foreign policy chops. Now his top foreign policy hand "" and seen inside Sanders's world as a potential future national security adviser "" Duss rose from blogging about policy to helming the Foundation for Middle East Peace.
In the years after his loss to Clinton, Sanders delivered some lengthy speeches on foreign policy, including one at Westminster College in Missouri, where Winston Churchill gave his famous 'Iron Curtain' address.
That 2017 Sanders speech encapsulated much of his thinking on world affairs, people close to him said. In it, he tethered his foreign policy vision to his populist domestic agenda, declaring, 'We cannot convincingly promote democracy abroad if we do not live it vigorously here at home.'
Sanders argued that the events of the past two decades have discredited the notion that the United States should use its military might to shape the world to its liking. He decried U.S. interference in Iran and Chile in the 20th century. He underlined the need for alliances to confront adversaries such as North Korea. On a smaller scale, he touted the value of partnering with a sister city in Russia when he was mayor of Burlington, Vt.
Many Democrats remain unimpressed. On the campaign trail, Sanders has increasingly clashed with Biden, who touts his extensive foreign policy experience in the Senate and Obama administration.
David Lammy, a member of British Parliament who has gotten to know Sanders in recent years, noted that Sanders's views would fit more comfortably in a typical European center-left party. 'Whether he were in Germany or France or the U.K., of course, Bernie, his politics would be very familiar and probably quite mainstream,' Lammy said.
He added, 'Clearly, in the U.S. context, it has been a slightly different experience.'
While Sanders's un or tho dox views make some Democrats nervous, the most pointed hostility comes from Republicans. Asked what he thinks of Sanders's foreign policy platform, Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) said, 'A disaster.'
Standing next to him in an elevator in the Capitol was Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who chuckled and interjected, 'Does he have a foreign policy?'
Yet this is a time of foreign policy upheaval in both parties. Trump himself has upended decades of Republican thinking, praising figures such as North Korean leader Kim Jong Un while questioning the role of NATO. A populist non-interventionism is surging in both parties, championed by figures such as Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) and Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.).
That has given Sanders a sometimes surprising array of foreign policy partners on Capitol Hill. He teamed up with Sen. Mike Lee, a conservative Republican from Utah, on a measure to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. Their legislation passed the Senate and forced Trump to issue his second veto.
On Saturday, Lee signed on to Sanders's bill to prevent Trump from deploying funds for military action against Iran without congressional approval.
Other alliances have been more controversial. Omar and Tlaib, who have endorsed Sanders for president, strongly support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement to pressure Israel over its policies toward Palestinians.
Many Democrats and Republicans, including some who have criticized Israeli policies, object to the BDS movement as going too far. 'To me, BDS has no place,' said Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), formerly the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Sanders himself does not support the BDS movement. But he has been a vocal critic of Netanyahu, and he has said he is willing to make foreign aid to Israel contingent on fostering more peaceful relations with Palestinians, a condition many Democrats and Republicans are unwilling to impose.
When it comes to international trade, Sanders opposes an emerging U.S. deal with Mexico and Canada, arguing that it does not go far enough in protecting American jobs. The deal has the support of the AFL-CIO and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), among others on the left.
To some moderate Democrats, including Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, Sanders's message at times can resemble the current president's promises to avoid needless wars. 'Kind of like Trump?' Tester mused in a brief interview at the Capitol. Sanders's identification as a democratic socialist is 'something he has to overcome' in his pitch to be commander in chief, Tester added.
Trade politics also divided Sanders and President Barack Obama. 'He may have more differences with Obama on foreign policy than Trump, is the great irony,' said John Cavanagh, who has known Sanders since 1991 and directs the Institute for Policy Studies, a liberal think tank. 'Both he and Trump can sit down with workers in the Midwest. It's just that one does it in a racist and xenophobic way.'
But Sanders has his stark differences with Trump as well. The senator from Vermont was a lonely voice opposing the most recent defense spending bill. And Sanders favors international diplomacy to tackle big issues such as the Paris climate accord.
Until recently, Sanders's proposals have been overshadowed by his sweeping domestic agenda. But the U.S. killing of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani prompted Sanders to-amplify the linchpin of his foreign agenda: his long-standing opposition to U.S. intervention abroad.
News of the airstrike came late Jan.-2, after Sanders had spent the day campaigning in Iowa. Inside a restaurant at the Doubletree Hotel in Cedar Rapids, Sanders huddled with aides including campaign manager Faiz Shakir and his deputy, Ari Rabin-Havt, according to a person with knowledge of the situation. Duss, the foreign policy adviser, joined by phone. Together, they crafted a statement calling the killing an 'assassination' and drew a connection to the instability caused by the Iraq War.
'It gives me no pleasure to tell you at this moment we face a similar crossroads fraught with danger,' he said the next day during a town hall meeting at the National Motorcycle Museum in Anamosa, Iowa. 
For some at the town hall, his aversion to military conflict resonated. 'We've been through this in the past,' said Thomas Wiand, 51. 'We went through unnecessary wars continually.'
Others were more cautious. 'Sometimes you have to go and do what needs to be done to correct the situation,' said Craig Bruxvoort, 62, a grain farmer who applauded Trump for ordering Soleimani's killing.
Those who have worked with Sanders on foreign policy describe him as methodical and inquisitive. Suzanne DiMaggio, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment who is advising Sanders on Iran, recalled him asking specific questions about the consequences of Soleimani's killing.
'A lot of the questions focused on the internal political dynamics in Iran: What are the likely scenarios that will now emerge? How will it affect those who are moderates in Iran?' DiMaggio said.
Ben Rhodes, who served as deputy national security adviser under Obama, remembered briefing Sanders on the Iran nuclear deal for about an hour. 
A more vivid memory for Rhodes was how Sanders was affected by talking to veterans and family members of soldiers killed in combat.
'I remember him telling me once, he said, 'Obama doesn't get enough credit for how many troops Obama took out from Afghanistan,'-' said Rhodes, who has offered informal advice to Sanders and other candidates. 'And Bernie measured that by not having to attend as many funerals in Vermont.'

NASHUA, N.H. "" Outside the castle-themed Radisson Hotel where Joe Biden has been staying, his campaign bus was parked and ready for events. 

But on Thursday, just five days before the crucial primary here, the candidate was nowhere to be found. 
Biden spent Thursday gathered with his top advisers at his home in Wilmington, Del., seeking a reset and perhaps a last-ditch effort to save his candidacy, beginning with a debate Friday night. He held no public events.
Following dismal results in the Iowa caucuses that have rattled many in his orbit, his campaign is now simultaneously trying to lower expectations here "" with some suggesting they would consider a finish as low as third place a victory "" while also bracing for a second straight difficult Election Day. 
In one troublesome sign for the financially strapped campaign, it canceled nearly $150,000 in television ads in South Carolina, which votes Feb. 29, and moved the spending to Nevada, whose Feb. 22 contest follows New Hampshire's. The move seemed to acknowledge that Biden's campaign cannot sustain a continued run of bad news.
'From a Biden perspective, there's going to be a course correction in all three states before Super Tuesday,' said Dick Harpootlian, a South Carolina state senator who is in regular contact with Biden's campaign. 'He's got to have sharper elbows.'
He suggested that those inside the campaign realized the gravity of the moment and that Biden had to better 'explain the difference with his opponents.'
'History may write that the best thing that ever happened to Joe Biden was getting gut-punched in Iowa,' he added. 'It woke him up, it woke his campaign up and his supporters up. They were complacent. . . . You've got to talk about the other guy.'
But, at least on Thursday, it was the other guy talking about Biden.
Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., who along with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) finished at the top in Iowa, continued his media blitz, appearing on shows from ABC's 'The View' to the gossip site TMZ, where he argued that he "" not Biden "" was the most electable Democratic candidate.
'If your focus is on electability . . . the best way, I think, to demonstrate you're a candidate who can win is to go win,' he said on TMZ.
One person close to the campaign, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal strategy, expects a dramatic reshuffling of his operation if Biden does not show improvement in New Hampshire. Biden has rarely fired staffers during his decades-long career, so any changes would probably mean internal shifting of responsibilities. 
Even before then, disputes have emerged among some of his top advisers, who have generally split between an older group that has been with Biden for decades, and a younger group that, while loyal, has joined his staff more recently. There have been disagreements since the start of the campaign over how much to focus on the middle-class economic message that has defined much of Biden's career and how much to center his message on President Trump.
Biden's first evident shift after Monday night's drubbing came Wednesday when he dedicated a third of a speech to criticizing his rivals "" after long insisting he would not attack others. The development, which targeted Sanders and Buttigieg, energized some supporters.
Dave Nagle, a former Iowa Democratic Party chairman and former congressman, said he was stunned by how poorly conceived the Biden message was in his state. He received four pieces of mail from the Biden campaign. Only one mentioned the economy. The rest were about Trump, civility and international affairs, issues that did not move voters, he said. 
'He has got to get his message right and his message out here wasn't right. His presentations were not focused. They were rambling. They were stories about what his father told him and what his mother told him,' he said. 'I think the Biden campaign got his message from the '80s, when it is totally different now. If he retools his message I think he can be very competitive.'
But his ability to expound was constrained. Biden had reserved only $165,000 in television ads in the final week before the New Hampshire primary, according to data from Advertising Analytics, although a super PAC backing him is airing an additional $580,000 worth. Sanders is airing nearly $500,000 in ads, while Warren is airing nearly $360,000.
Among the top-tier candidates, Buttigieg will have the most air cover, with his campaign spending $570,000 and an additional $815,000 coming from Vote Vets, a super PAC supporting him. That puts Buttigieg and his allies at about twice the spending of Biden and his backers.
Biden's advisers have been attempting to bat down questions about his longevity "" including some far-fetched suggestions that he drop out soon "" and on Thursday afternoon they sent out a fundraising email with the subject line: 'I'm not going anywhere.' 
They are most concerned with trying to survive to states that are more friendly to his more diverse base. In South Carolina, in particular, he has kept a commanding polling lead largely based on his strong support among African American voters, who make up nearly two-thirds of Democratic primary voters there. 
'The donor class, the staff, the volunteers in a presidential campaign are nervous inherently,' said former Pennsylvania governor Ed Rendell, who has been a top Biden fundraiser and remained optimistic. 'The fact that Joe had a subpar performance in Iowa makes them more nervous. That's to be expected.'
The Biden campaign declined to comment on the record, but an adviser who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss strategy said that the campaign was preparing for a long nomination fight.
'Joe Biden has never been handed anything in his life and he's here to fight for every delegate in this long process,' the adviser said. 'The vice president has forcefully argued that Wall Street didn't build this nation "" hard-working working class and middle-class Americans did "" which is why he's running to rebuild the middle class.'

Biden's super PAC is seen as a more important vehicle to prop up a campaign that has struggled to raise money. Larry Rasky, a longtime Biden loyalist who helped form the group, was on the phone Thursday trying to round up multimillion-dollar donations. 
'The reports of our demise are highly exaggerated,' Rasky said.
'Nobody was thrilled about the results in Iowa but they certainly are not jumping ship based on the results,' he said. 
Harpootlian said a third-place finish would make Biden 'the comeback kid,' Bill Clinton's description of himself after the then-governor of Arkansas battled to a second-place finish here in 1992.
'Then he goes to Nevada "" and then thank God he comes to a normal state,' he said, referring to the fourth-voting state, South Carolina.

Mike Bloomberg is lagging behind his Democratic competitors in the polls, and he will not appear on the next presidential debate stage or on the ballot in Iowa, New Hampshire or South Carolina.
But the former New York mayor has attracted the obsessive attention of President Trump, who is annoyed by Bloomberg's constant ads targeting him, concerned about the billionaire's outsize spending, focused on his growing numbers in the polls and seemingly fixated on his TV appearances.
The president has repeatedly attacked Bloomberg on Twitter, calling him 'Mini Mike' to insult his small stature, and frequently focused on him in conversations with campaign advisers and White House officials.
'It's very clear that the ads we are running have gotten under his skin because they are effective,' said Howard Wolfson, a senior Bloomberg aide. 'Mike's poll numbers are improving, the president is screaming. Mike is a data-driven guy. When he sees data is working, he doubles down.'
Wolfson said to expect more blistering ads against the president in coming months. So far, Bloomberg's spots have targeted Trump over impeachment, his position on vaping, his health-care-policy decisions and his relationship with the military. Many have prompted rapid responses from Trump, sometimes minutes after they air.
Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey debuted a new ad on 'Fox - Friends' on Thursday that cited a new book by two Washington Post reporters, who chronicle how Trump lashed out at U.S. military leaders, characterizing them as 'dopes and babies.' Trump responded shortly after the spot aired.
'Mini Mike Bloomberg is playing poker with his foolhardy and unsuspecting Democrat rivals,' Trump tweeted. 'The fact is, when Mini losses [sic], he will be spending very little of his money on these 'clowns' because he will consider himself to be the biggest clown of them all "" and he will be right!'
Trump's advisers have repeatedly encouraged the president to focus on other opponents instead. Campaign manager Brad Parscale and senior adviser Jared Kushner have warned against giving Bloomberg more attention and do not see him as the threat that Trump does, aides have said. There is no plan for the campaign to target him with advertisements at this point, advisers said.
Trump has repeatedly brought up Bloomberg "" calling him 'evil,' in the words of one close adviser "" and said that he wants to destroy Trump with unrelenting money, even if the president does not believe Bloomberg can win, according to aides.
He has called Bloomberg's ads 'lies' that are unfair depictions of his record in the White House. Several advisers have said the president also references Bloomberg's 2016 Democratic convention speech as a sore point and repeatedly asks advisers about his polling numbers, which have hovered below 10-percent in public surveys.
Other advisers have sought to elevate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), hoping that a leftist candidate could give Trump a good foil in the general election.
Parscale said this week that he would only worry about Bloomberg if he surpassed former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in the Democratic race.
'It's a free country, and he can set his money on fire if he wants to. He's still in a statistical tie with the back of the pack in the Democrat field,' said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman.
Trolling the president is different from convincing skeptical primary voters and defending his own record on issues such as stop-and-frisk policing in New York City. Bloomberg endorsed George W. Bush, for instance, and welcomed the Republican National Convention in New York in 2004.
But his path to the nomination could become clearer if former vice president Joe Biden stumbles in Iowa and New Hampshire, creating an opening for Bloomberg to use his significant advertising budget to argue that he is the most electable alternative.
In the meantime, the campaign has been using attacks on Trump as a rallying cry, both to recruit staff to his campaign and to convince Democratic primary voters that his campaign is more than the vanity project of another billionaire candidate.
Sheekey said the campaign will either be the 'best primary campaign in American history' or the greatest independent spending campaign against an incumbent president that has ever been created.
As it stands, the Bloomberg advertising campaign is squarely focused on states that could help get Bloomberg the nomination, with only about 1 in 4 dollars going to the six swing states that his advisers expect to be competitive in the general election, according to Facebook ad spending data and a source familiar with the television buys, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because that person was not authorized to share the information publicly.
But that swing-state spending has still been considerable. Through Jan.-11, Bloomberg has spent $198-million on television advertising, including more than $47-million for spots in the projected swing states of Arizona, Florida, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. On Facebook, he has blasted another $3.6-million to voters in those states.
Before the year is over, he has promised to spend $100-million on a digital effort to defeat Trump in swing states, and he has committed millions more to an effort to register 500,000 new voters in those states. He is also building a data operation that he intends to use to elect a Democratic president whether or not he is the nominee, his advisers say.
In an interview, Wolfson said he wanted to draw a contrast with Democrats, who are attacking one another in New Hampshire and Iowa. Bloomberg has not competed in those states, knowing he would be unlikely to fare well, and is focused on Super Tuesday on March 3.
'We've chosen a different path. They are in Iowa and New Hampshire attacking one another. We're making the case against Donald Trump,' Wolfson said. 'Voters among all else are looking for a candidate that is best qualified to take on Donald Trump in a general election.'
Many of the ads Bloomberg has run include some mention of Trump, with many of the spots focusing on the president's perceived weaknesses among swing voters.
'Health care is a huge vulnerability for him,' Wolfson said of Trump. 'It's the issue that won the Democrats the midterms. It is difficult for him to defend his own record on health care.'
Bloomberg's aides also plan on using the ground campaign that Bloomberg is building against Trump, whether or not he wins the nomination. Those hired in potential general-election swing states "" 60 in Arizona and more than 80 in North Carolina, for example "" have been told they will have a job through the summer conventions or the November elections to organize against Trump.
Bloomberg seems to have approached the endeavor as a no-risk proposition, given that he has decided that defeating someone he calls an 'existential threat to our country' is one of his top priorities.
'My Plan B is a hell of a lot better than anybody else's Plan A,' he has told advisers, according to one aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.
Either Bloomberg wins the nomination and the presidency or he remains the 12th-richest person in the world with a chance of taking credit for defeating Trump.
On the stump, Bloomberg seems to delight in needling Trump, calling him a 'real estate promoter' and not a businessman. He will recount the phone call from Trump after the 2016 election, when the president-elect offered his cellphone number. Bloomberg says he didn't bother to write it down.
-Bloomberg also repeats an anecdote about Trump not knowing how to use a New York City subway card when they rode together many years ago. Trump has said this description is untrue, saying the gates were opened for them because they were traveling with a large entourage.
'I never had a MetroCard when I rode the subway with him,' Trump told The Washington Post last year.

Some security experts wary of tactic, pointing to stakes of Iran conflict
Days after President Trump ordered a drone strike that killed a top Iranian general, the commander in chief's 2020 campaign turned the attack into a political pitch, purchasing roughly 1,000 ads on Facebook that touted his military credentials "" and sought to raise money for his reelection push.
The online advertising blitz began late Monday as Trump's team sought to defend the killing of Qasem Soleimani, a major general in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. Many of the ads solicited personal information from voters that could be useful as the campaign seeks to mobilize voters on Election Day.
The digital strategy mirrors Trump's previous social media campaigns concerning impeachment, immigration and other signature issues, relying on a mix of narrowly targeted messages "" along with headline-grabbing tweets seen by millions "" to command the political conversation, mobilize his base and advance his policy agenda with an eye to the election. Trump's campaign also alerted supporters with a series of similar text messages highlighting Soleimani's death.
'From a campaign perspective, any time the president accomplishes something "" and fighting terrorism is among his biggest campaign promises, keeping our country safe "" that is grounds for making the argument that he should be reelected,' said Matt Braynard, the data director for Trump's 2016 campaign, who says he is not involved in the president's reelection effort.
But some experts bristled at Trump's tactics in the context of national security, stressing that the stakes are higher than usual: Every ad, tweet and social media statement from Trump carries significant weight in a rapidly developing conflict, they said.
'Growing campaign email lists based on fear and online fundraising for political gain should hardly be a priority of the commander in chief during a national security crisis,' said Graham Brookie, the leader of the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, which studies disinformation. He previously served in the Obama administration.
A spokesman for the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
Democrats and Republicans long have sparred over efforts to advertise their military accomplishments in the course of a major election. In 2012, GOP lawmakers and candidates blasted President Barack Obama for running television spots touting his order to kill Osama bin Laden, which critics said were unseemly.
But Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites have become even more pervasive and powerful in the years since Obama left office, an evolution heralded by the successful digital strategy that catapulted Trump to the White House in 2016.
Tweets helped Trump push his political views to millions instantly, and Facebook ads allowed the president's team to target narrow slices of voters with specific messages that would most outrage, engage or persuade them. Both have been put to great use again by the president's campaign in the days after he ordered the attack on Soleimani, dismaying Democrats, some of whom long have called on tech giants to place limits on Trump, one of the most prolific but controversial social media users in U.S. politics.
Beginning this week, Trump's team has run scores of Facebook ads highlighting Soleimani's death, many pitching an 'Official Military Survey' that asks supporters a series of questions, including whether they agree with the president's 'decision to take out the very dangerous Iranian terrorist leader.'
Those who fill it out are asked to submit their personal information, including their emails and phone numbers "" a standard practice for candidates like Trump, whose campaign has spent $27-million on Facebook ads since May 2018 in part to build lists of supporters, the company's archive shows. After clicking a button to submit responses, participants also are asked for donations ranging up to the maximum of $2,800 per election.
Trump's campaign and his Republican allies also have sent a series of texts in recent days highlighting the Soleimani killing. 'Pres Trump made our Military STRONG again!' began one message from the Republican National Committee, according to Nomorobo, an app that helps smartphone users block robocalls and texts. The texts link to the Trump campaign's data collection survey.
Another batch of texts "" sent Wednesday after Trump spoke about Iran "" included a 'presidential address approval poll,' which asks viewers to rate if he was 'historic,' 'great,' 'good' or 'other.'
'A huge piece of Trump's message and platform from day one is about presenting himself as a strong, machismo leader to his base,' said Tara McGowan, who leads the progressive-leaning digital group Acronym, which estimated that Trump has run roughly 1,000 ads so far.
'It is clear from the amount of messaging and resources the Trump campaign is putting behind this messaging that he sees this as an advantage for his campaign for reelection,' McGowan said, decrying what she called the president's 'politicizing this military event.'
To be sure, Trump's Facebook ads do not appear to violate the platform's policies. Dozens of Trump's ads have been removed from Facebook, according to the company's public archive, but only because they broke the company's technical rules for how ads with buttons should be formatted.
At least one of Trump's 2020 Democratic rivals, former vice president Joe Biden, has run ads of his own this week touting his experience on the world stage and questioning Trump's fitness as commander in chief.
Other 2020 Democratic contenders have ratcheted up their criticisms of Trump on the campaign trail. Speaking to reporters following a town hall in Iowa on Sunday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) questioned the timing of the strike, noting that it unfolded 'as Donald Trump faces a potential impeachment trial in the United States Senate next week.'
Andrew Yang, the entrepreneur and former tech executive who has made prolific use of the Internet to power his outsider bid for the Democratic nomination, said matters of war were a bridge too far for quick advertising tactics.
'You hope that our government is making decisions based upon national security concerns and what's best for the country,' he said in an interview, 'and not using that as an opportunity to gather voter data.'

For the Fox News journalist coveringthe presidential campaign, asking candidates questions can be a challenge


DES MOINES "" The day Joe Biden announced his candidacy for president, Fox News correspondent Peter Doocy showed up at the wrong place.
Having no contacts at the Biden campaign, Doocy took his cameraman and producer to Biden's house in Wilmington, Del., only to have a neighbor inform them that the former vice president wasn't home.
'I looked at Twitter and saw some other reporters tweeting that he was going to make the announcement at the train station,' Doocy recalled recently. He rushed over to the station and caught the moment.
His first question for the 2020 candidate: 'If you're the best choice for the Democrats in 2020, why didn't President Obama endorse you?'
'I asked him not to endorse,' answered Biden. Fox News hosts replayed the answer, and others mocked it, throughout the day. 
For Doocy, who is one of the reporters Fox has covering the Democrats, the story is an example of how he and his team have to be creative on the campaign trail, since none of the candidates really seem to want to talk to him.
It is also a story about the tense dance that goes on between Fox News and the Democrats, sometimes needing one another and sometimes disdaining one another.
Doocy's reporting on the 2020 race is just one chapter in the decades-long fraught tale of Fox News and the Democratic Party, one littered with the cable channel's enthusiastic embrace of the story of Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky; and its relentless depiction of the Benghazi embassy attack as a failure of then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton; the segments it aired questioning Barack Obama's birthplace; allowing its commentators to voice conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich; and, of course, there was the time that a then-anchor said she wanted kids to know that Santa was white not black.
All of that rolls down to Doocy, standing in a parking lot in the January cold, waiting to yell a question.
At nearly 6-foot-5, the 32-year-old stands out in what political reporters breezily call a 'gaggle,' the disorganized question-and-answer session that politicians sometimes grant reporters. Doocy's deep baritone carries, too, and sometimes that is enough, he says, to catch a candidate's attention.
Doocy has been assigned to cover the Democratic field writ large, and he was on the road for much of 2019, crisscrossing the country to report on whichever Democratic presidential candidate felt significant in the moment. He will eventually cover the party's nominee in the general election against President Trump.
Doocy's father is the longtime 'Fox - Friends' host Steve Doocy, who is tall and blond like his son. These days, when spotted together, they are sometimes mistaken for brothers. The two are close, and Peter Doocy, who was born in Washington, D.C., and raised in New Jersey, speaks glowingly of his father.
Between 2015 and 2018, Peter Doocy filled in three times for his father on weekends when the show was short-staffed. But since the midterm elections, the younger Doocy has been solely occupied with political reporting for the network. (A Fox spokeswoman says he was a registered Democrat, but currently has no party affiliation because he's covering the campaigns.) 
Peter Doocy has only ever worked at Fox News, and in the canon of Political Media Personalities, Doocy and his father can feel like they are Fox's version of Tim and Luke Russert for the Trump era.
'Where the other networks can count on somebody among the ranks nailing or landing a sit-down interview with these top-tier Democrats, for whatever reason, these candidates have decided they don't want to do sit-downs with Fox,' Doocy said at a campaign event for Democratic candidate Pete Buttigieg in Des Moines, just days before the Iowa caucuses. 
'Sorry to interrupt,' said Doocy's public relations handler, who reminded him of the multiple Fox News town-hall events at which Fox News anchors such as Chris Wallace and Bret Baier have hosted Democratic candidates. 'So it's not like we don't get the candidates.'
Doocy corrected himself: 'I should have said 'some of the candidates.' . . . And so that doesn't mean that we should not try to get them.' If that means figuring out where a candidate's car is waiting for a couple hours outside an event, he'll do that. 
'Our bosses never told me, 'You need to go get Joe Biden or else we're not going to get it.' But if they're going to assign me to the Democratic field and we have the ability to be mobile, why not go try? And so we've had some luck.'


In March 2019, the Democratic National Committee announced it would exclude Fox News Channel from televising any of its candidate debates during the 2019-2020 cycle. DNC Chairman Thomas Perez cited an article in the New Yorker that outlined the network's close ties to Donald Trump as a reason for the decision.
But Fox News hasn't hosted a Democratic primary debate since 2004. The channel lost a planned debate in 2007, after its late co-founder Roger Ailes made a crack about then-Sen. Barack Obama's name, deliberately mixing it up with Osama bin Laden's. 'It is true that Barack Obama is on the move. I don't know if it's true that President Bush called [Pakistani President Pervez] Musharraf and said, 'Why can't we catch this guy?' ' Ailes said in a speech before an industry trade group that year. The DNC canceled that debate, but in 2016 Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders agreed to participate in a town-hall-style debate on Fox News moderated by chief political anchor Bret Baier. (Chris Wallace moderated a general-election presidential debate between Clinton and Trump during the 2016 race, the first time for a Fox News personality.)
In the wake of the DNC decision last year, Fox News injected the network into the primary race through a series of high-profile town hall events that several Democratic candidates agreed to participate in. Some, such as Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris, said they would not be part of a Fox event. Warren called Fox a 'hate-for-profit racket.'
But others, including Sens. Bernie Sanders and Kirsten Gillibrand and former mayors Julián Castro and Pete Buttigieg, have participated in Fox News town halls. Sanders's event was the highest-rated town hall of the cycle, with nearly 2.6-million viewers. According to Nielsen Media Research, Fox News just marked 18-years as the country's top-rated cable news network, and whatever their objections to Fox News programming, some of the candidates want access to that audience.
Lis Smith, Buttigieg's communications director, has said that their decision to engage with Fox News's town halls derives from their belief that 'you have to reach out and go places that are uncomfortable,' in a presidential campaign. When he appeared on 'Fox News Sunday' in late January, Democratic candidate Andrew Yang told Wallace that he thought the DNC's decision not to have a primary debate on Fox News channel was 'a mistake.'
While many Democrats regularly appear on Fox News, it is indeed uncomfortable for some of them. Jennifer Palmieri, who was Hillary Clinton's communications director during her 2016 presidential run, recalled a meeting that she and campaign chair John Podesta had with Fox News executives as part of their tour of the networks to discuss concerns about Clinton coverage.
'I felt that they were still reeling from Trump winning in the primaries and that they were wavering between being dubious about him and doubling down,' she recalled in an interview. Fox News assigned a veteran national security correspondent, Jennifer Griffin, to the Clinton campaign, and Palmieri said she saw that as a 'deliberate move on their part that I welcomed, to show us they were serious.'
But overall, Palmieri said, Griffin's reports were wedged in between other programming that Palmieri said 'was atrocious. They lived off the Clinton Foundation, her emails, and they picked up every utterance Trump made about her health,' long before her bout with pneumonia caused her to collapse during a 9/11 anniversary service. Palmieri, who is currently an MSNBC contributor, said that for years, Clinton was Fox News's 'cash cow,' and that 'they less covered her than programmed her,' meaning that she was an object of derision and entertainment more than she was a news story.
Bret Baier, the host of 'Special Report With Bret Baier' and the channel's chief political anchor, defended Fox's coverage, saying: 'We are in the spotlight and we have always been. Listen, I get it. We are different from the pack, and people paint us with a broad brush, but I speak for the news shows and the election coverage and we bend over backwards to be fair.'
He said he met with Palmieri a number of times to try to get more Clinton surrogates on Fox News and always had a good relationship with her.
When Fox engages with Democrats on air, it often draws the ire of President Trump. After Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) appeared on Fox News to discuss impeachment, Trump tweeted that it was 'really pathetic how @FoxNews is trying to be so politically correct' and noted that 'Dems wouldn't even give Fox their low ratings debates,' and then asked, 'what the hell has happened to @FoxNews. Only I know! Chris Wallace and others should be on Fake News CNN or MSDNC.' Trump wrote that such coverage would be the end of the network.



Doocy got his start in journalism as a college student at Villanova. During the 2008 presidential campaign, John McCain was visiting campus soon after Hillary Clinton had been featured on the front page of the local paper drinking shots with Pennsylvania residents. Doocy took the microphone and asked McCain if he thought Clinton was 'hitting the sauce' because she was so behind in the polls. He then asked McCain if he would take a shot with him. 
Doocy's ability to crack wise and create a viral moment has served him well at Fox News. Early on, Doocy asked Biden how many times he had spoken to his son, Hunter Biden, about his business dealings. Biden shot back that he never discussed them, and then jabbed his finger toward Doocy's face and scolded him to 'ask the right questions.' Trump, not Biden, was the one who should be interrogated, Biden said.
Doocy said he was 'surprised' at Biden's reaction, which was cheered back in campaign headquarters as a sign of Biden's strength and viewed in other quarters as evidence of Doocy hitting a nerve.
'It had been a couple of days since the news had broken that Hunter Biden was somebody President Trump was talking about in the Oval Office with a foreign leader. But nobody had asked Joe Biden about that. I was expecting that he would have a prepared answer when I asked him. . . . Because I know if somebody asked my dad, 'How many times have you spoken to your son about his business dealings?,' he'd probably say 'five times a week.' So I was surprised with how enthusiastic he was. . . . That is the only time that I can remember that a candidate has had his finger in my face.'
More recently, in November, Doocy asked Biden about the child Hunter Biden fathered out of wedlock. Biden responded that it was a private matter and that he had no comment. 'But only you would ask that,' he said, his mouth stretching to a hard smile. 'You're a good man, a good man. Classy.'
While Biden can appear frustrated by the questions, his campaign has never cut off Doocy's access.
'There were people at the beginning who said you are giving this job to him just because he's Steve Doocy's son,' said Baier, 'So that was a hurdle for him, and he went way above that hurdle. He asks pointed questions, and every night, I know he will have a solid piece on the day's big events.'
Fellow correspondents on the trail note how frequently Doocy asks about Hunter Biden or John Bolton or other topics that appear suited to the Fox audience, rather than drilling into policy questions. But he creates viral moments. Doocy said that other reporters are always friendly, though 'there have definitely been times when we've shown up places and seen social gatherings we weren't invited to.' He is entirely untroubled by this.
Cherie Grzech, vice president of Fox News's Washington bureau, said that Doocy asks questions 'everybody wants to ask but is afraid to' and that he 'is very involved in asking the question of the day that will drive the political conversation.'
Because of the early-morning schedule, Steve Doocy was always at home when his son and two daughters got out of school.
'We could wait for him to wake up from his nap and then talk to him about whatever big thing was going on in the news,' Peter Doocy said. He always felt that his dad 'had the best job in the world.'
Would he want to follow his father's path to a seat on the 'Fox - Friends' couch?
'If that's something that they think I would be good at at some point, then that could be a fun thing to do. But right now, I have to worry about what exit Joe Biden is going to go out of!'

Former mayor wants to help Democrats fight Trump in swing states 
Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg has decided to donate significant components of his shuttered presidential campaign to the Democratic Party, a historic bequest that includes an $18 million cash infusion to organize for the general election in swing states.
The decision, which exploits a provision in campaign finance law available only to federal candidates, amounts to a shift in strategy for the billionaire political activist, who had previously promised to personally fund ground staff and offices in six states through an independent expenditure effort.
He now hopes that much of the same operation will be run through the state and national Democratic Party, which would allow for it to directly coordinate with the Democratic nominee, whom he expects to be former vice president Joe Biden. An independent expenditure campaign is barred from such coordination.
""While we considered creating our own independent entity to support the nominee and hold the President accountable, this race is too important to have many competing groups with good intentions but that are not coordinated and united in strategy and execution,"" Bloomberg's campaign wrote in a memo Friday to Democratic Party Chairman Tom Perez.
""Since Mike suspended his campaign and endorsed Joe Biden, the former vice president now controls the race. It is critically important that we all do everything we can to support our eventual nominee and scale the Democratic Party's general election efforts.""
To accomplish the goal, Bloomberg will transfer cash remaining in his presidential campaign account, which he donated, to the Democratic National Committee's Battleground Build-Up 2020 effort for use in the general election. The money will allow the party to hire hundreds of additional organizers, party officials say. Bloomberg also will transfer the long-term leases he has signed on some offices in some swing states to state Democratic parties.
Bloomberg's advisers plan to work with the DNC on shifting staff from his payroll to the party. All personnel would have to reapply for their jobs, and those hired by the party will be paid at DNC salary levels, according to a party official. Bloomberg was previously paying $6,000 a month for organizers, well above the market rates offered for other campaigns.
""Our country is in crisis, and a change in presidential leadership is more important now than ever to protect our families, our communities and our economy,"" Perez said in a statement. ""With this transfer from the Bloomberg campaign, Mayor Bloomberg and his team are making good on their commitment to beating Donald Trump.""
But the transition will be disruptive for hundreds of Bloomberg organizers in swing states. They were previously told their jobs would continue through the general election, but they now find themselves facing the prospect of unemployment amid an economic crisis brought about by the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Organizers received an email Friday saying their jobs would end that day, though they will continue to receive pay through April 7 and health benefits through April 30. 
""As a token of our appreciation, we are offering you the opportunity to keep your laptop and iPhone,"" said one email from the Bloomberg campaign to organizers. The email also noted that the value of the devices, $1,400 or $1,700, depending on the laptop, will be counted as taxable income.
Under normal circumstances, federal rules allow individuals to give a maximum of $355,000 per year to the DNC. The party has set up a Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund, a joint fundraising committee with state parties, that allows wealthy individuals to give $865,000 in one year. Bloomberg has already donated the maximum allowed to this account.
But the new shift of resources means he is able to give more than 20 times the maximum a donor can give to the national party in one year, because of provisions that allow federal candidates to donate unlimited amounts of leftover money to national and state parties as they wind down their campaigns. This has effectively given Bloomberg a super-donor status because he self-funded his White House bid.
Campaign finance experts said such a mass transfer of personal money was uncharted territory.
""This has never, to my knowledge, been an issue before, because anybody other than somebody worth multiple billions would want their money back even if they self-funded,"" said Charlie Spies, a campaign finance lawyer.
If someone mounted a self-funded bid solely to evade the individual contribution limit and donate leftover campaign funds to the party, that would be considered a straw donation scheme, experts said.
But Bloomberg is shuttering a real campaign effort, and his decisions point to a loophole in the federal law that wealthy self-funded candidates can exploit, experts said.
""I think it'd be absolutely wrong to suggest that it's a ploy to get around the limits. . . . But it does suggest you could do that,"" said Beth Kingsley, a campaign finance lawyer. ""It does seem that there ought to be limits the same way there's an individual [contribution] limit.""
Although Bloomberg's plans to establish a new independent expenditure campaign have been put on hold, his advisers continue to look at possible vehicles for a media campaign to support the Democratic nominee later this year. A super PAC he used in 2018 to support House candidates, Independence USA, still exists, and he still has the capability to form a new group.
Since leaving the race earlier this month, Bloomberg has announced a broad range of donations to the larger Democratic cause, including $2 million for black voter registration and $2 million to Swing Left, which is working to elect Democrats to Republican-held seats in 2020.

Senator eager to break Biden's stride in state likely vital in November


DETROIT - Sen. Bernie Sanders's political revolution shifted to emergency footing this weekend, rushing resources and staff to Michigan for a climactic battle against the surprise momentum of former vice president Joe Biden. 
The strategy echoes Biden's all-in bid in South Carolina two weeks ago, a gambit that resurrected his foundering campaign with a decisive win and led to 10 victories in Super Tuesday states.
Michigan, which holds its primary Tuesday, looms as hugely important for the senator from Vermont because of its dual standing, as a state he won in the 2016 primaries and which also is likely to play a decisive role in the general election. 
""We need all hands on deck. We got our backs against the wall,"" Harvard philosopher Cornel West thundered during introductions for Sanders at a rally here Friday, after announcing he had canceled three events in Boston to be there. ""We're coming out swinging.""

Trying to make a final stand against Biden, Sanders canceled a planned speech on race and justice in Mississippi to attend the Detroit event, one of at least five in three days he plans while the former vice president is campaigning elsewhere. Much of his Iowa campaign operation, including his former state director Misty Rebik
, has flown in to organize on the ground, where Sanders boasts a far more extensive network of volunteers and field offices than Biden.

Michigan was one of three traditionally Democratic states - Wisconsin and Pennsylvania were the others - that turned the 2016 election to Donald Trump. Both Sanders and Biden have argued that their primacy in the Upper Midwest would make them more competitive than the alternative against Trump in the fall. Michigan's direction also may foretell the dynamics in a host of other nearby states that vote later in the process, including Ohio and Illinois next week.
For Sanders, there is no certainty that Michigan will provide a repeat of the lift he received in 2016, when he narrowly defeated former secretary of state Hillary Clinton in a similar one-on-one faceoff by attacking her past support for the North American Free Trade Agreement and her vote to authorize the 2003 Iraq War. 
Sanders is now attacking Biden on those same grounds and others, as he tests whether he can turn out a coalition he has promised will remake the Democratic Party and defeat Trump in the fall - but which has shown up in only a limited way so far. The demographics of Michigan, with a large Muslim population, a core of working-class white voters, a significant college-age voting bloc and an African American community with close ties to organized labor, provide a unique backdrop to test Sanders's vision.
""It's not do-or-die mathematically. But I do think it is a chance to show just how outraged voters in swing states can get about Joe Biden's record,"" Sanders campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt said. ""I think Joe is going to have a problem. We are going to try to make sure he has a problem.""

But the former vice president's allies say the state's politics have changed dramatically over the past four years, following the trauma of Clinton's general-election loss and a banner 2018 election that ushered in a new set of moderate Democrats across the state. Those victories were driven by increased turnout for Democrats in college-educated communities around the state, propelling candidates like now-Gov. Gretchen Whitmer to a nine-percentage-point victory. Whitmer endorsed Biden on Thursday and became a co-chair of his campaign.
""Joe Biden is the one who is running on the blueprint that we ran on in 2018,"" Whitmer said in an interview Friday alongside Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II. ""As I look to the fall, Joe Biden's message is one that I know will resonate across the state.""

A high-stakes showdown in Michigan has been forced on the Sanders campaign by Biden's Super Tuesday upsets in states like Texas and Virginia, and by the rapid consolidation in the race. In the past two weeks Biden has been endorsed by three of the candidates who had a shot at winning delegates here: former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.).
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has also dropped out, though she has not yet endorsed another candidate. A February Washington Post/ABC News poll found that while Sanders was ranked higher as a second choice by many Warren voters, a significant chunk favored moderate candidates, including Biden. 
The momentum last week was on Biden's side. Exit polls found that Sanders won no more than 30 percent of late-deciding voters in any state on Super Tuesday, except for his home state of Vermont - and there his overall percentage dropped significantly from 2016. With more than 3 million votes still being counted in California, Biden has won 568 convention delegates, Sanders has 495 and Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii), who is still campaigning, has two. 
A candidate needs 1,991 pledged delegates to win the nomination outright on the first ballot at the Democratic National Convention in July. Sanders has said the nomination should go to the candidate with the most delegates, even if no one reaches 1,991, while Biden has said he would be willing to fight at the convention to overcome a Sanders delegate lead.
At the rally Friday, Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), an early backer of Sanders, told his supporters they had only four days to show the political establishment ""that they underestimate us."" 
In an interview, she said she doubted that Biden's momentum would give him an advantage with voters who said ""electability"" was their top issue.
""I heard the same information when Secretary Clinton was running against Bernie last time,"" Tlaib said, referring to Sanders's upset victory in 2016. ""Bernie was able to create a really inspiring movement. He came, and he toured the community, and he saw firsthand what was happening. People really feel it in Michigan, that he's a once-in-a-lifetime candidate.""

While there was a pep-talk feeling in Detroit - ""We're going to do this!"" one speaker declared - there also was growing anxiety among some Sanders supporters that the race was slipping away.
""I wish I had seen more from the campaign,"" said Susannah Roff, a 71-year-old retiree from Detroit. She moved to the area three years ago from California, where her friends and neighbors were more outwardly political and where elections were big events. In Michigan, she'd been surprised how quiet the run-up to the election had been. ""People talk, and they know who Bernie is, so it's not about that,"" she said. ""But you don't see campaign signs anywhere.""
Like others in the room, she expressed hope that Sanders would pull out a victory here, but she also felt a sense of nervousness, laced with a little bit of conspiracy.
""All along I've wondered if they would really let someone like Bernie win,"" she said, referring to the Democratic establishment. ""They will do anything to do stop him.""
Among those in the room were several who identified themselves as workers who had broken ranks with their labor unions to support Sanders. One group waved giant individual letters spelling out U-N-I-O-N during Sanders's speech, while others stood and waved campaign signs on which they had added, in black marker, ""union member for"" or ""AFT member for"" atop the ""Bernie"" logo.
""It's tough when your union is backing the other candidate,"" said Kevin Mack, a union member from Detroit who declined to say where he worked or to which union he belonged, because it was backing Biden. ""They say they want to play it safe. But where did playing it safe with Hillary get us? It got us Trump.""
Sanders's supporters are hopeful that union ties will help him pick up support among black voters, who have sided overwhelmingly with Biden in Southern state primaries this year where organized labor has less influence. Biden's aides, meanwhile, have argued that his role in the 2009 automobile industry bailout and his long ties to organized labor will insulate him against the Sanders attacks that tarnished Clinton. 
""While the economy is a little bit better, people are economically anxious and I think are wanting less chaos,"" said Jill Alper, a Democratic strategist who supported Clinton in 2016 and worked on Bloomberg's presidential effort. ""And I think that will accrue to benefit vice president Biden because he will be seen as a steady hand."" 
Mack said many union workers he knew were breaking with the leadership to support Sanders - not unlike how Culinary Union members in Nevada went heavily for the senator from Vermont, even as their leaders trashed his Medicare-for-all plan. He suggested the silent union support for Sanders could be enough to help him clinch Michigan.
But although he believed Sanders could win, he was nervous. 
""They are throwing everything at him,"" Mack said, citing criticism of the health-care plan and Biden's argument that he is best positioned to defeat Trump. 

The two campaigns have also taken radically different approaches to organizing the state. Biden's Michigan headquarters is on a side street off Woodward Avenue in Detroit's north end, on the edge of a neighborhood that has been the epicenter of the city's redevelopment renaissance. 
 Once one of Detroit's oldest and grandest neighborhoods, the area had been marred by abandoned buildings and blighted homes. Now it is full of shops and restaurants with a brand-new streetcar line that ferries residents and visitors from the area into a booming downtown - a transformation spurred in part by the Obama administration's help after the city's 2013 bankruptcy. Biden, who will not visit the state until Monday, was the administration's point man on Detroit - a fact he repeatedly touted on the debate stage here last summer, as the political world marveled at the transformation of a city that was once left for dead.
Sanders's office is on the opposite side of town, along Grand River Avenue, which was also once one of Detroit's most storied streets, home to sprawling auto dealerships and thriving middle-class neighborhoods. But Grand River's neighborhoods have not enjoyed the same revitalization.

Sanders's office, which opened Feb. 21, is in an old retail space that has long been vacant. Workers painted a large mural reading ""Bernie"" on the side of the building as a makeshift sign, while a half-dozen campaign signs were propped up in the barred windows. Misspelled hand-lettering on the front door reads ""Gospel House Entranc"" - left behind by the religious bookstore that used to occupy the space.
""Bernie is trying to get people to face the fierce urgency of now,"" said Rick Martin, a black activist and former local UAW president who is supporting Sanders. ""For so many people in these areas, they don't turn out because they feel like their lives are not going to change, no matter who is in office.""
Sanders has also ramped up activity in western Michigan, where he soundly defeated Clinton in 2016. In Grand Rapids, Sanders has had volunteers working on his behalf for the better part of the last four years and recently opened a field office and brought in staff in hopes of scoring another big victory.
But while Sanders still enjoys strong support, he faces tougher competition in Biden for the working-class Democrats and independents he won in 2016. Anyone can vote in Tuesday's Michigan primary, and with no Republican contests, crossover votes from independents and even Republicans disillusioned with Trump could help Biden. 
 Since Trump defeated Clinton in the area, Democrats have seen an uptick in party registration and activity spurred by anti-Trump sentiment. A coalition of suburban women and college-educated white voters elsewhere helped Democrats make gains in the state in the 2018 midterms and is expected to be active in Tuesday's primary. That could be pivotal for Biden, who has won support from similar groups in other early states. Sanders is set to visit Grand Rapids on Sunday, while Biden is coming Monday.
""We are definitely turning bluer,"" said Gary Stark, chairman of the Kent County Democratic Party, which includes Grand Rapids. ""I think Biden will do well here. Whether he will win or not, I don't know, but it won't be an embarrassment.""

President comes off as collegial even as he defends his rhetoric

SCRANTON, Pa. - President Trump jetted into Joe Biden's boyhood hometown days after the former vice president secured front-runner status in the race to challenge Trump in November.
During an hour-long Fox News-hosted town hall here, Trump twice defended his divisive rhetoric as a key to his political success, questioned Biden's mental acuity and predicted a coming together post-election.
Before a friendly audience, Trump faced some pointed, if gently phrased, questions from his own backers. One man who was identified as a Trump supporter asked the president if ""we can deliver your message without the controversial rhetoric.""
A notably subdued Trump twice said that he appreciated the question but defended how he communicates as his way of responding to criticism.
""When they hit us, we have to hit back,"" Trump said. ""I could turn my cheek, but I wouldn't be sitting up here if I turned my cheek.""
Trump later mocked Biden over a series of verbal gaffes, pausing for the audience's laughter, and said, ""there's something going on there."" The president also argued that the House impeachment over his asking a foreign leader to investigate Biden damaged the former vice president more than it did him.
""They aimed at Trump and they took Biden down,"" Trump said.
Trump chose Scranton, his chief rival's birthplace, to hold the event, according to Fox News, which said it has let other presidential candidates select the locations for their town halls.
The presidential motorcade sped by an electronic billboard that read ""Scranton is Joe Biden country,"" and Trump was greeted by dozens of protesters near the Scranton Cultural Center, the venue for the town hall.
But inside, Trump faced a much friendlier welcome, as the audience greeted him with warm applause and repeatedly chanted ""four more years!"" during a commercial break. Kellyanne Conway, the White House counselor, was similarly greeted with applause by supporters before the event began.
If Biden is the Democratic nominee, northeast Pennsylvania will be a hard-fought area. In 2016, Trump held a rally in Scranton the night before Election Day. He overperformed expectations in that region, leading to his surprise victory over Hillary Clinton in the state.
Trump said he'd been prepping for a run against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) but now was resetting his sights on Biden. He blamed Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who suspended her candidacy for the presidential nomination earlier Thursday, for siphoning votes from Sanders by staying in the race beyond Super Tuesday. 
He was echoing a criticism relayed by some liberals upset that their flank of the party did not unite behind a candidate like the moderates did behind Biden shortly before Tuesday's primaries.
""If she's a true progressive, which probably she is, she probably should've dropped out three days ago,"" Trump said. ""Bernie Sanders would've won five, six, seven states, would've won Minnesota. . . . So when you look at it, she did him no favors. That was not a good friendship.""
On the subject of friendship, Trump was asked in a lightning round to name his closest friend in Washington. He demurred, saying there were too many, but that he's close to Vice President Pence and members of Congress, even Democrats.
""We have great people in Washington and great Democrats, too. I speak to the Democrats, too, believe it or not,"" Trump said. ""We have great, great people in Washington. It's going to come together. And it's going to be sooner than you think.""
The president sounded a similar, uncharacteristically collegial note when a woman wearing a sparkling Trump pin told him people in her life don't speak to her because she's a supporter of his. She asked him how he would bring the country together.
Trump reiterated his answer from earlier about how he has to fight back but also said, ""I really believe we are going to win this next election, and when we do, the other side is going to say, 'Okay, that's it, let's get along.' ""
It's similar to a claim often made by Biden that his victory would soften the partisan polarization.
While the town hall touched on issues from health care to immigration to foreign policy, other questions forced the president to offer some personal introspection.
Trump said he missed being able to walk down the street or into a store where he'd be recognized, but he could still do it. 
""I miss that sort of free life, and this is not a free life,"" Trump said. ""But I love what we are doing, because we are accomplishing more than anybody has ever - I view it as we're saving this country, this country was going wrong.""

Voters in Chicago on Tuesday confronted shuttered precincts, missing poll workers and confused officials struggling to administer an election during a public health crisis, a chaotic situation that voting advocates said created barriers for those trying to participate in the state's Democratic presidential primary.
The problems in Illinois appeared to be the most acute examples of issues in three states that voters faced related to the coronavirus outbreak. Arizona, Florida and Illinois chose to proceed with their contests this week, while a fourth state - Ohio - postponed in a controversial, 11th-hour move on Monday night.
The last-minute challenge facing election officials was unprecedented, experts said: making sure people could visit polling locations and cast their ballots safely - even as health officials were issuing dire warnings about the need to stay isolated to stop the spread of covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, advocates say.
In locations around Chicago, voters arrived at polling places to find no election judges to run their precincts, or no hand sanitizer or wipes for voting machines. Some voting locations in Palm Beach County, Fla., where officials said there appeared to be lower than usual voter turnout on Tuesday, had not opened by late morning. And in Arizona, some people were directed to vote at municipal buildings that were otherwise closed to the public, causing confusion.
Even in Ohio, some voters showed up at polling sites on Tuesday morning only to learn that in-person voting was delayed until June 2. In some locations, advocates said, no signs were posted to indicate the change, and a hotline for voters to report problems was flooded with calls.
The challenges Tuesday intensified questions about how subsequent primaries - and the general election - can go on if the pandemic does not subside. Many have called for states to conduct all voting by mail, but there are questions of whether Congress has the votes to pass such a mandate, as well as about states' abilities to implement such a massive new initiative in a matter of months. Only three states - Colorado, Washington and Oregon - currently run elections with mail-in ballots only.
""We've been hearing from countless voters who are unsure about the status of voting today,"" Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the National Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said on a conference call with reporters.
""It's unlike anything we have ever seen before,"" Clarke said of the situation in Ohio, where voters ""went to bed"" on Monday night unsure whether the elections would take place.
Clarke said the problems Tuesday offer a clear warning to state and local officials to better prepare for the coming primary contests and the November general election. She urged them to expand access to voting by mail, including offering postage-paid envelopes, lifting restrictions on who may return ballots for homebound voters, and putting an end to signature-matching procedures that she said amount to ""junk science"" and lead to legitimate ballots being tossed.
""Eighteen states impose restrictions and barriers on voters who seek to cast absentee ballots. Now's a moment for those states to abandon those restrictions,"" Clarke said.
Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez also urged states to adopt vote-by-mail, no-excuse absentee voting and extended polling place hours.
""As our country deals with the uncertainty of COVID-19, it is critical that states provide clarity and not confusion, which could lead to disenfranchising voters,"" Perez said in a statement.
Democrats in the states that went forward with primaries on Tuesday reported a sharp rise in the use of early voting and vote-by-mail options. In Arizona, there were more early votes by Democrats this year than total votes cast in the party's 2016 primary. And in Florida, 141,560 more Democrats voted by mail this year than they did four years ago.
Complaints from voters who went to polls in person raised questions about states' decision to proceed with Tuesday's primaries amid a deepening health crisis. Yet criticism also poured in over Ohio's decision to postpone its primary, a sign of election officials' difficult position.
""Our democracy needs to continue,"" said Lori Lightfoot, the mayor of Chicago. ""But as we have been winnowing the size of gatherings, people are necessarily nervous, and that has affected the availability of polling places, as well as the availability of election judges.""
Lightfoot issued a warning to states with primaries coming up, urging them to begin planning now, and to expand options for voters to participate early and by mail. The city, she said, received an ""unprecedented number of applications to vote by mail.""
Five states have now delayed their contests - Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland and Ohio - with others expected to follow suit in the coming days.
Ohio's handling of its primary served as a cautionary tale.
State officials announced Monday afternoon that they would seek to postpone the election because of the coronavirus. As county officials spread the word that no in-person voting would take place on Tuesday, a judge in Franklin County rejected a delay.
In the end, with the backing of Gov. Mike DeWine (R), the Ohio Department of Health ordered polls closed, citing a ""health emergency."" Election officials said in-person voting would take place on June 2.
Voters and candidates were dismayed by how events unfolded.
Jeffrey A. Sites, a Democrat running in the primary to challenge Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), said that while it was ""crucially important"" to protect people's health, the whiplash from officials ""served Ohioans and the democratic process poorly.""
""I believe we're owed an accounting of how exactly the fiasco of the last 24 hours came about,"" Sites wrote in a statement posted on Facebook.

The confusion created uncertainty for the campaigns of former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who were vying for the 441 delegates that were up for grabs in the remaining three states Tuesday.
Biden had hoped to capitalize on the momentum he built in the past two weeks, with help from older voters who typically vote in large numbers but are vulnerable to the coronavirus. In Florida, some voters received a robo-text from his campaign on Tuesday asking: ""Can you vote safely for Joe?""
Biden's advisers sought to preempt any notion that lower turnout would undermine Tuesday's results.
""While voter turnout on Election Day itself may be lower due to COVID-19 concerns, we believe that, with early vote and vote by mail, overall turnout will be roughly on pace for 2016 in Arizona and Florida and roughly on pace for 2018 in Illinois, and that voter turnout in all three states will reflect the population at large,"" Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield wrote in a memo.
Tuesday's voting problems appeared to be the most widespread in and around Chicago.
At a precinct in Barrington, a northwest suburb, election judges did not show up when doors opened at 6 a.m., frustrating would-be voters. A spokesman for local election officials said replacements were sent ""shortly before 9 a.m.""
By the end of the day, the Cook County Clerk's Office extended voting in 40 suburban precincts by one hour to 8 p.m. because of the extensive issues. Suburban Cook County saw its lowest voter turnout in 12 years: About 202,000 voters came out Tuesday by 8 p.m. Central; in 2008, the total was about 525,000 voters. However, the overall turnout, which includes early voting, totaled 368,503, which was the second-lowest turnout in 12 years; in 2012, total turnout was 329,537. 
When Emily Ioppolo, a theater production artist, and her boyfriend went to vote at 6 a.m. at a church in their Lakeview neighborhood, on the North Side of Chicago, they encountered empty tables. Precinct workers told them that ballots and machines had not yet been delivered.
The couple returned after 7 a.m. and, once again, nothing was there. ""They were trying to call the board of elections but no one was picking up,"" she said.
Eventually, Ioppolo, 27, walked to another voting center open to all residents and cast her ballot for Sanders.
""I understand we're experiencing social distancing right now, but when the governor and the mayor and my alderman say we are still holding elections, it is the board of election's job to run smoothly,"" she said. ""It's not like my polling place was closed down due to a social distancing effort - it was open. That is very frustrating.""
In Palatine, a northwest suburb of Chicago, Kim Inman, 62, said her family urged her not to serve as an election judge this year out of fears of contracting the coronavirus. She decided to go ahead after she received an email from the Cook County Clerk's Office promising that her location would have hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes.
When she showed up at 6 a.m., the supplies weren't there, and they still had not arrived by late morning. Two of the four judges also did not show up, so Inman was left staffing the precinct with only a high school student to help.
""It's very disappointing,"" she said. ""This is so unusual and different - I don't know what's going on.""
As voting continued haltingly through the morning in some areas, election officials sought to reassure dozens of voters who complained on social media.
Those efforts did not quell the anxiety. Timna Axel, communications director for the Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights, said the group has received an unprecedented volume of calls for a primary election, including an entirely new category of complaint: from confused election workers.
""They're brand new, substituting for those who canceled,"" she said. ""We've never gotten those calls before on this number.""
Speaking to reporters Tuesday afternoon, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker (D) said he offered the Chicago Board of Elections ""plainsclothed"" personnel from the National Guard as potential election judges and volunteers ""should they need it.""
""They did not want that. We offered the opportunity,"" he said.
A spokesman for the Chicago Board of Elections did not respond to a request for comment.
In Florida, Palm Beach County had some of the worst disruptions in the state, said Liza McClenaghan of Common Cause Florida: By midmorning, some polling places had not opened, some opened late and some were understaffed.

Warren-Sanders spat and trial duties give Biden, Buttigieg an edge 

INDIANOLA, Iowa "" Amid a high-voltage fight between the presidential campaign's leading liberals, more-moderate candidates are redoubling their efforts here, pouring time and resources into the state while tweaking their closing arguments to emphasize party unity and their electability. 
Joe Biden's campaign is hoping to take advantage of twin developments: the bitter back-and-forth between Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, as well as the impeachment trial in the Senate that will keep them away from Iowa for much of the final two weeks before the Feb. 3 caucuses. Biden has been airing new ads "" one that says he 'can't wait to kick [President Trump] out of the White House' and will 'leave him in the dust' "" and has planned two bus tours around the state.
He also on Saturday pushed back aggressively against Sanders, both for the estimated cost of his Medicare-for-all plan and for not disavowing a video about the former vice president's stance on Social Security that has been deemed false by some fact-checkers. 
'It is simply a lie, that video that's going around. . . . It's a doctored tape,' Biden said. 'I'm looking forward to his campaign coming forward and disowning it. But they haven't done it yet.'
The video does not appear doctored, as Biden claimed, but fact-checkers say it is misleading. It shows Biden lauding Rep. Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.), the former House speaker and Republican vice-presidential nominee, and his proposals to cut Social Security and Medicare. Fact-checkers said Biden was mocking Ryan, and noted that Sanders's campaign trimmed the video before the point where Biden said he would protect Social Security and Medicare.
Sanders's campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, said Saturday night that Biden 'should be honest with voters and stop trying to doctor his own public record of consistently and repeatedly trying to cut Social Security.' 
'He is on tape proudly bragging about it on multiple occasions,' Shakir said.

The other more-moderate front-runner, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, was maintaining a breakneck pace in the first-voting state, staging nine town halls over 36 hours in mostly conservative-leaning areas in western Iowa, targeting voters in counties that voted for Trump. He tried to build on his longtime message of inclusivity by injecting new language about unity across party lines into some of his speeches, casting himself as a generational unifier. 
'I want to mention one other thing that might sound a little strange in this season of division and bleakness,' he said to close out an education forum Saturday in West Des Moines. 'I want to make the case for hope.'
Those renewed efforts "" particularly from Biden and Buttigieg "" have the potential to reshape the race on the ground in Iowa during what is normally the most important stretch of the primary campaign in the state.

Biden's campaign largely has been void of raw inspiration or excitement; he and his surrogates, including a church deacon and a former secretary of state, have tried to make a pragmatic case, that he is the most electable person to face President Trump.
Biden's campaign, and the super PAC supporting him, have flooded the Iowa airwaves. He has also landed the state's most coveted endorsements, sent out-of-state surrogates there to campaign on his behalf, and is planning significant time in the state over the next week.
'I think we definitely felt the tide turn a little bit here in November and December,' said Pete Kavanaugh, the deputy campaign manager. 'We feel like we're on a bit of an upswing. . . . The results have been pretty clear; the energy is picking up, the momentum is picking up.'
The all-in effort has kept Biden in contention, but a state that bedeviled him in his failed 2008 presidential campaign continues to be unpredictable. He remains part of a four-way clutch of candidates at the top of recent polling, which has raised the prospect of victory or embarrassing defeat for him, Buttigieg, Sanders and Warren. Recent polls have shown a majority of Iowans are not set on a candidate.
Biden's campaign organization has been notably less robust than many of his rivals', with county officials around the state still saying they have heard less from his campaign than from others. 
'This race is a gnat's eyelash close,' said Tom Vilsack, the former Iowa governor who endorsed Biden in November. 'There's a gnat's eyelash separating a number of these candidates. Nobody can be confident they are going to win. But Joe Biden can be confident he is competitive in Iowa and all four states . . . and he is probably the only one that can say that.'
Recent polling has shown Biden in a tight race in Iowa and New Hampshire, and with more stable leads in Nevada and South Carolina. 
Biden's new focus on Iowa has paid off at least initially. Where his campaign once struggled to fill small ballrooms, he has lately experienced some standing-room-only crowds. His campaign has remade some of his events, placing less emphasis on his speaking behind a lectern and more on his wandering around a room taking questions. On Saturday, his remarks served to distance him from Trump and, potentially, from his Democratic rivals.
'Our politics today has become so personal, so dirty, so divisive that it's virtually impossible to get anything done,' Biden told an Indianola crowd. 'Unless we start to work together, the system won't work.'
Some of the lukewarm feelings about Biden could be seen through the eyes of likely caucus-goers such as Karen Reese, a 66-year-old accountant from Clive, Iowa, who was sitting in the crowd before a Biden event on Saturday in Indianola. She said she was leaning strongly toward Warren "" and is excited about the possibility of a female president "" but is also resigned to the notion that Biden could be the nominee. 
Asked how she felt about him, she sighed. 'I have nothing against Joe Biden,' she said. 'The bottom line is it's going to come down to electability. If it's him, so be it.'
Sitting a few seats away, local artist Bob Kling was an enthusiastic precinct captain for Biden. 'Ideas aren't going to do anything if you can't get elected,' he said. 'And he's the most electable.'
Biden and Buttigieg were at least publicly ignoring the squabble between Sanders (I-Vt.) and Warren (D-Mass.) "" which centered on her contention that he told her that a female candidate could not defeat Trump. In Tuesday's debate, Sanders denied making the statement.
A few minutes after CNN on Wednesday released audio of their post-debate confrontation over it, Buttigieg took the stage in an echoing warehouse-style building in Mason City, where he explained to an audience of 300 why he is the candidate to bridge divisions. A man in a 'Trump 2020' hat asked about Social Security. A woman delivered greetings from someone with whom Buttigieg served in Afghanistan. No one mentioned what had happened between Sanders and Warren, or the impeachment trial due to start a day later.
'I'll leave it to the pundits to talk about horse-race stuff,' Buttigieg said when asked by reporters how the Sanders-Warren spat affected the race. 'What I'll say is I think we've got a winning message, and this race is very fluid. Which is why we've got to continue getting that message out all the way until the day of the caucuses. I imagine the heated competition will increase, but the values and the message won't change.'
His campaign is running new Facebook ads here, tailored to specific regions. But instead of featuring Buttigieg, the ads are compilations of selfie-style messages from supporters in those regions "" an attempt to emphasize both the personal touch Buttigieg's organizers have tried to make a rule here, and also the broadness of his coalition. 
That coalition-building thrust is increasingly prevalent in Buttigieg's remarks.
At the end of his fifth event of the day Thursday, a town hall in Sioux City, Buttigieg modified his message. Earlier in the day, a 17-year-old girl had asked him what possible rationale anyone could have for separating families at the border, an experience to which she said she could relate because her father left her family when she was young. Buttigieg incorporated her observation into his remarks later in the day, and he used it to explain why politics should be about unity, not division.
'The reason we have politics and elections, in my view, is not the show. It's not who's up or down. It's not who got the best zinger off in the debate or who's fighting with who,' Buttigieg said. 'It's about a way for us to connect our experience "" our hopes, our pain "" with others, and make one another better off.'

IMPEACHMENT DEFENSE BEGINS
Democrats accused of bid to rig November election
Lawyers for President Trump argued Saturday that he had valid reasons for withholding military aid from Ukraine and that House prosecutors overlooked facts that are more favorable to his case, giving a short preview of the aggressive defense they are expected to mount this coming week in the Senate impeachment trial.
In a two-hour presentation that reserved their most provocative attacks for Monday, members of Trump's legal team echoed the president's justifications for his actions toward Ukraine and sought to plant doubts about both the prosecutors' case and its lead advocate, Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.).

Yet, in arguing that the case for Trump's removal was partisan and misleading, lawyers for the president omitted facts, presented claims that lacked context or minimized evidence gathered by House investigators. Their most sweeping arguments did not specifically defend Trump but instead framed impeachment as no more than a politically motivated effort to remove him from the ballot in November.
'They're here to perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in American history,' said White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, who asserted that Trump did 'absolutely nothing wrong.' 
'We can't allow that to happen. It would violate our Constitution. It would violate our history. It would violate our obligations to the future,' Cipollone told the Senate. 'And most importantly, it would violate the sacred trust that the American people have placed in you.'
After three days of arguments from House Democrats in favor of Trump's removal, most Senate Republicans rallied behind the president's defense, predicting acquittal. But a small group of closely watched Republicans largely reserved judgment or declined to comment, leaving open the question of whether the trial will include witnesses. Democrats need four Republicans to join them to secure further testimony or evidence.
Trump faces the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history amid accusations that he withheld military aid and an Oval Office meeting to pressure Ukraine's leaders into announcing investigations of his political rivals, including former vice president Joe Biden, now a presidential candidate. Trump was impeached by the House in December on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress related to these allegations and his directive that his administration not cooperate with the House's investigation. 
His team's opening argument came on a day when more evidence emerged outside the Senate: A video was released showing Trump ordering the firing of Marie Yovanovitch, the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, at a 2018 donor dinner. His order came minutes after Ukrainian American business executive Lev Parnas criticized her as an impediment. 
Yovanovitch was removed more than a year later. Parnas is now under indictment on campaign-finance charges, and the video was released by Parnas's attorney.
At the end of a marathon week of presentations by Democrats before the Senate, Trump's lawyers began speaking at 10-a.m. and ended by noon, allowing senators to return home for a short period before the trial resumes at 1-p.m. Monday. The next session is expected to include full-throated attacks on Biden and his son Hunter, who served on the board of the Ukrainian gas company Burisma while his father was in office and has become a target for criticism by Republicans. The intent is to argue that Trump was justified in seeking investigations into the Bidens despite the Ukrainian government's never accusing them of any wrongdoing.
On Tuesday, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. chastised the House managers and the president's defense team for using overheated rhetoric as they debated ground rules for the trial. But when Trump's lawyers began rebutting the managers' case Saturday, their tone was largely subdued. 
'We are going to be very respectful of your time,' Cipollone said in his opening remarks. 'You heard the House managers speak for nearly 24 hours over three days. We don't anticipate using that much time.' 
The lawyers painted Trump as having sincere concerns about corruption in Ukraine, despite evidence to the contrary, and suggested he was justified in doubting the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia, not Ukraine, interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
In taking this approach, the lawyers landed repeatedly on themes that matter to Trump, including what he has described as his 'perfect' July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's report, and omissions and errors by the FBI in documents submitted to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court during the 2016 investigation of the Trump campaign and Russian interference in the election. 
Because of that case, Trump attorney Jay Sekulow argued, the president had reason not to 'blindly trust some of the advice he was being given' by intelligence officials. 
Taken together, the lawyers' remarks laid the foundation for a defense of Trump's unconventional foreign policy toward Ukraine, led by his personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani; and an attempt to shore up Trump's claim that by seeking investigations of the Bidens, he was working to fight corruption, not undermine a political opponent whom he might face in November. 
Focusing on the July 25 call, Deputy White House Counsel Michael Purpura suggested that witnesses who expressed concerns about it were politically motivated and said Trump's conversation with Zelensky reflected the administration's 'legitimate concerns about corruption' in Ukraine. 
A rough transcript released by the White House shows the president did not mention 'corruption' or a general concern about the issue "" only a theory about Ukrainian influence in the 2016 election that has been discredited and his request that Kyiv scrutinize the Bidens.
Purpura also spent considerable time claiming that Ukraine did not learn about the hold on military aid until late August.
'There can't be a threat without the person knowing he's being threatened,' he said.
While two Trump administration figures "" Pentagon official Laura Cooper and State Department official Catherine Croft "" testified that they believed that Ukrainians knew about the hold before that time, Purpura argued that others' testimony was more credible. 
The second part of the defense's presentation sought to raise doubts about the legal and constitutional validity of the impeachment inquiry. Deputy White House Counsel Patrick Philbin also mentioned the anonymous whistleblower whose report helped launch the impeachment probe, and the House's decision not to investigate the person's motives.
'Motivations, bias, reasons for wanting to bring this complaint could be relevant,' Philbin said. 'But there wasn't any inquiry into that.'
The details of the whistleblower's memo were confirmed by the rough transcript of the July 25 call released by the White House and by the evidence gathered during the House investigation. 
In several instances, Trump's lawyers attacked Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a leader of the impeachment inquiry. 
Philbin noted that Schiff had once mischaracterized his staff's dealings with the whistleblower. Purpura also showed a video clip of Schiff parodying dialogue from the July 25 call during a House hearing, a dramatic embellishment that Trump and his allies say obliterates Schiff's credibility. 
'We can shrug it off and say we were making light or a joke. But that was in a hearing in the United States House of Representatives discussing the removal of the president of the United States from office,' Purpura said. 'There are very few things, if any, that can be as grave and as serious.'
Senators already allied with Trump declared the presentation a slam-dunk. 

'In two hours, the White House counsel entirely shredded the case by the House managers,' Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) told reporters, echoing several other Republicans who used a form of the word shred to characterize the effect of the lawyers' arguments.
But moderate Republican senators "" whose votes will determine whether additional evidence is sought in the trial "" did not share detailed opinions on the presentation or the possible need for witnesses. 
'I think it's very likely I'll be in favor of witnesses, but I haven't made a decision finally yet and I won't until both side's opening arguments are done,' Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) told reporters on Capitol Hill. 
'I thought for the most part, the House managers were effective, and I thought the president's attorneys this morning were very effective,' Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) told CBS News. 
Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) declined to comment when approached by The Washington Post. 
A handful of moderate Democratic senators "" who could prove pivotal if they choose to side with Republicans "" declared witnesses necessary to the process. 
'I thought they did a good job in presenting the defense for the president,' Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) said. '[But] the most important thing I took away from today was they made very clear that there's not one witness that we've heard from . . . that had direct contact with the president.' 
Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.) said he was 'stunned' that Trump's lawyers argued at one point that cross-examination is essential to due process, even as the White House bars witnesses from testifying on Trump's dealings with Ukraine. 
'The American people deserve the truth. They deserve the whole truth,' Jones said. 'We're not getting it.'
The House managers were not permitted to speak during Saturday's session "" though they drew some attention around 9:50 a.m. as part of a procession transferring their 28,578-page trial record across the Capitol to the Senate.
'They don't contest the basic architecture of the scheme,' Schiff said at a news conference after the presentation by Trump's lawyers. 'They do not contest that the president solicited a foreign nation to interfere in our election, to help him cheat. I think they acknowledged by not even contesting this that the facts are overwhelming.'
In his closing, Cipollone shifted the charges facing the president onto Democrats "" a strategy often employed by Trump himself. 
'It would be a completely irresponsible abuse of power to do what they're asking you to do "" to stop an election, to interfere in an election, and to remove the president of the United States from the ballot,' he said. 'Let the people decide for themselves.'

At the start of President Trump's impeachment trial, Democrats pinned their hopes on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), whose reputation as an institutionalist might lead him to back a call for witnesses.
Democrats were sorely disappointed late Thursday night as Alexander, who is retiring at the end of his third term, announced his opposition to such a move "" and offered an explanation they found lacking.
Alexander said the president did use military aid as leverage to pressure Ukraine's leader to investigate a Trump political rival, but he wouldn't join Democrats on calling witnesses.
'I think there's a big gap between this conduct and impeachable conduct; I don't think this is close. I think it's inappropriate,' Alexander said in an interview Friday morning.
Democrats had hoped that Alexander, 79, could build a coalition of Republicans who would at least support calling witnesses such as John Bolton, the former national security adviser whose forthcoming book alleges that Trump's goal in delaying $391 million in security aid to Ukraine was to force that nation to launch damaging political investigations of former vice president and 2020 candidate Joe Biden.
As Friday's debate over witnesses began, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) issued a statement opposing witnesses, eliminating the chance of a 50-50 vote that would have compelled Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. to decide whether to break the tie or let the motion for witnesses die.
Unlike Alexander, Murkowski called the case against Trump 'rushed and flawed' but said that the Senate was incapable of curing 'the shortcomings' and that she would oppose additional witnesses.
'I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate. I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything. It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed,' said Murkowski, who also cited attacks on Roberts as a factor in her decision.
That left Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Mitt Romney (Utah) as the only two Republicans poised to join all 47 members of the Democratic caucus in asking for more witnesses in a vote destined to fail.
Democrats had hoped that Alexander's background as a protector of the Senate's institutional prerogatives would make him a supporter of expanding the trial, especially given his early years as a top aide to then-Sen. Howard Baker (Tenn.), who served as the top Republican on the Senate Watergate Committee, which helped lead to Richard Nixon's resignation in the face of likely impeachment and removal in 1974.
'I was certainly hoping he would have a Howard Baker moment, you know, but it appears he will not,' Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said Friday morning.
Durbin said he was 'disappointed but not really surprised' by Alexander's decision, particularly because the Tennessean has been a close ally of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) since their shared days as Senate staffers.
While even-tempered and pragmatic in working with Democrats on legislation, Alexander has built a solid conservative record far different from those of the few remaining moderate GOP senators, who were closely watched for their votes.
In his own telling, Alexander said that he was never that close to voting for witnesses and that he delayed in stating a position in order to act as a prudent jurist in the trial while leaving open the possibility of wanting to hear more evidence.
To prepare for the trial, he said, he read two books: one by Edmund Ross, the senator from Kansas who cast the decisive vote in 1868 against removing President Andrew Johnson from office, and the other, 'Impeachment: An American History,' a collaborative book published in 2018 about all the cases against presidents.
Alexander read the newer book at his desk during Thursday's question-and-answer session, focusing on the chapter by Jon Meacham on Johnson's trial.
The senator said that 'many presidents have probably done similar things,' citing a talk he had with Jimmy Carter's attorney general, Griffin Bell, in which Bell said Carter had ordered him to indict on civil rights charges a Texas police officer who had received a short sentence in a brutal murder. Bell refused.
Alexander said a similar scenario should have happened when Trump wanted a probe of the Ukrainian energy firm that had Joe Biden's son Hunter on its board. 'If he wants to investigate the Bidens, he should give that information to the attorney general and let him handle it,' said Alexander, who continues to support Trump's reelection as honorary chairman of his Tennessee campaign.
He said that he has not spoken to Trump since a bill-signing ceremony at the White House in mid-December but that he came under fierce pressure from a collection of colleagues, close friends and others who had access to the president.
'I got some very impassioned emails from people who canonize President Trump or people who hate him,' Alexander said.
Three key elements convinced him that it was time to move.
First, with the election already underway and ballots printed in many early primary states, prolonging the trial could blow up that campaign. 'So we're tearing up the ballots and telling people basically, as an election is starting, you can't vote for or against President Trump,' he said.
Second, he said that the Founding Fathers disapproved of party-line impeachments in the House and that the Senate should dismiss those. 'I did not want to create a weapon of perpetual impeachment that the House could use to immobilize the Senate and immobilize the executive,' he said.
Finally, he believes that the House managers documented their case but did not show that it rose to an impeachable offense.
'Did he, at least in part, withhold aid in order to encourage that investigation? I thought the evidence was conclusive that he did,' Alexander said. 'The president might very well say, 'I did it because I cared about corruption,' but I was convinced that at least in part, he did it to encourage the investigation of the Bidens.'
Alexander said he is not sure what defines a 'high crime or misdemeanor' "" which the Constitution sets as the basis for removing a president "" but added that one key requirement is bipartisan support.
'I think you step back and say, is it something about which there is such a consensus that both Republicans and Democrats think the president ought to be removed? I guess the only example we really have of that is President Nixon,' he said.

The U.S. intelligence community long ago produced evidence of Russia's illegal interference in the 2016 presidential election to try to boost Donald Trump's candidacy. Then the special counsel investigating the matter detailed myriad ways President Trump sought to stymie the probe. And then Robert S. Mueller III testified to Congress about Trump's conduct "" and warned of Russia's continued interest in thwarting U.S. elections.
But it is Trump who is trying to have the last word.
Seven months after Mueller's marathon testimony brought finality to the Russia investigation, Trump is actively seeking to rewrite the narrative that had been meticulously documented by federal law enforcement and intelligence officials, both for immediate political gain and for history.
Turbocharged by his acquittal in the Senate's impeachment trial and confident that he has acquired the fealty of nearly every Republican in Congress, Trump is claiming vindication and exoneration not only over his conduct regarding Ukraine "" for which the House voted to impeach him "" but also from the other investigations that have dogged his presidency.

This includes lawsuits filed against Trump by the state of New York over his finances as well as alleged misuse of charity funds by his nonprofit foundation. Trump sought last week to turn the page on these probes, declaring on Twitter ahead of a White House meeting with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) that 'New York must stop all of its unnecessary lawsuits - harrassment.'
Still, Russia is foremost on Trump's mind. Even before he was sworn in as president, Trump viewed the FBI's Russia investigation as a dark cloud over his administration that threatened to delegitimize his claim on the office. And more than three years in, Trump remains haunted by all things Russia, according to advisers and allies, and continues to nurse a profound and unabated sense of persecution.
As his reelection campaign intensifies, Trump is using the powers of his office to manipulate the facts and settle the score. Advisers say the president is determined to protect his associates ensnared in the expansive Russia investigation, punish the prosecutors and investigators he believes betrayed him, and convince the public that the probe was exactly as he sees it: an illegal witch hunt.

'The whole Mueller investigation was a shakedown and a disgrace. It probably should be expunged,' Trump said in an interview last week with radio commentator Geraldo Rivera, a longtime friend.
Referring to Mueller, Trump added: 'I don't call him special counsel because special counsel is not an accurate term. It's a special prosecutor, because what he and his 13-angry Democrats "" all horrible, just horrible people "" what they did to destroy the lives of people that you know, but to destroy the lives of many, Geraldo, should never be forgiven, should never be forgotten, and something has to be done about it.'
Central to this pursuit were Trump's efforts this past week to lessen the government's sentencing recommendation for longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone. Attorney General William P. Barr's extraordinary intervention in the Stone case, as well as Trump's own declaration of his right to meddle in criminal cases whenever he chooses, tested the nation's rule of law and sent chills throughout the Justice Department, which has long shielded its independence from political influences.

The criminal justice system could soon be tested further. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson "" whom Trump targeted and disparaged last week "" is set to decide Stone's sentence on Thursday. The president has indicated he may commute Stone's sentence. Asked last week whether he was open to issuing a pardon, Trump told reporters: 'I don't want to say that yet.'
Last week alone, Trump called the Russia investigation 'tainted,' 'dirty,' 'rotten,' 'illegal,' 'phony,' a 'disgrace,' a 'shakedown,' a 'scam,' 'a fixed hoax' and 'the biggest political crime in American History, by far.'
He argued that the probe into Russian election interference was based on false pretenses, despite a recent report from the Justice Department's inspector general stating the opposite even as it criticized the FBI's surveillance of a former Trump campaign aide. And he claimed, again without evidence, that Mueller, a former FBI director regarded for his precision with facts, lied to Congress "" which happens to be one of the charges Stone was convicted of by a jury last November.

Absent from the president's many public comments about the Russia investigation, however, was a warning to Russia not to interfere in the next election, or even an acknowledgment that U.S. intelligence agencies believe Russian President Vladi mir Putin is seeking to do so.
'As Bob Mueller said "" and the entire intelligence community confirmed "" Russia is still coming at us,' said Chuck Rosenberg, a former U.S. attorney and former counsel to Mueller at the FBI. 'Not only is the president offering a false narrative to the American people about that threat, but there is no leadership from him on this incredibly important issue. We are still being attacked. It is as if the Russians invaded Alaska and the president either said they are not actually there or that they are there but it does not really matter because we have 49-other marvelous states.'
Frank Figliuzzi, a former senior FBI official who also worked for Mueller, said Trump's efforts to spin a new history of the Russia investigation are cause for alarm.
'What Trump is doing is canceling what we all have proven, what the courts have proven, as in Roger Stone, as in Manafort, as in Flynn, in a form of jury nullification at a presidential level,' Figliuzzi said, referring to former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former national security adviser Michael Flynn.
'The president is doing it on steroids because of the power of his office,' Figliuzzi said. 'People have to see the danger in that.'
Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a history professor at New York University and a scholar of authoritarianism, said she sees darker motives in Trump's actions.
'It's all about manipulating information and recasting the narrative to be what you need it to be,' Ben-Ghiat said. 'Even more than censoring, which is old-school, rulers like Trump "" and Putin is the master at this "" manipulate opinion by manipulating information.'

Trump's defenders said the president is wise to try to seize control of the public narrative of the Russia investigation at the start of a campaign year, and they argued that his retelling will find a sympathetic audience.
'Winners write the history books. President Trump is aware of this and realizes that unless he defines the previous three years of witch hunts, then it will in fact be the people who unsuccessfully launched these witch hunts who will define the legacy,' said Jason Miller, a former Trump campaign adviser who co-hosts 'War Room,' a pro-Trump radio show and podcast, with former Trump strategist Stephen K. Bannon.
'Who he's trying to speak to are the people who supported him in 2016, who think it's ridiculous what partisan Democrats and unelected administrative-state bureaucrats have tried to do to him over these past three years, and to put things into proper context as we head into this fall,' Miller added.
In private discussions with advisers and friends, Trump has long groused angrily and obsessively about the Russia investigation. The president believes he and his campaign were unfairly targeted by what he bemoans as a 'deep state' conspiracy "" and he faults former FBI director James B. Comey and deputy director Andrew McCabe, among others.
Trump regularly complains that Comey and McCabe have avoided jail time for what he is convinced is wrongdoing, while Stone, Manafort, Flynn and other Trump associates have been prosecuted.
'They put a man in jail and destroy his life, his family, his wife, his children "" nine years in jail. It's a disgrace,' Trump told reporters last week about Stone, referring to the seven- to nine-year prison sentence initially recommended by federal prosecutors. 'In the meantime, Comey walks around making book deals. The people that launched this scam investigation "" and what they did is a disgrace. And, hopefully, it'll be treated fairly.'

Trump's grievances spill beyond the Russia matter to include his conviction that former vice president Joe Biden has not faced sufficient scrutiny for his son Hunter's dealings in Ukraine.
'The president is obsessed with his view of fairness,' said one Trump adviser, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to candidly describe the president's state of mind. 'Most of these items have arisen because the president doesn't think things are fair. His reaction to Joe Biden's son is mostly not a reaction of trying to harm a political opponent, but it's a reaction of not believing that the treatment of the Bidens is in any way similar to how he's been treated. His reaction to McCabe, Comey, various other enemies of the president is a reaction to what he believes is an unfair result happening to his allies.'
This adviser added: 'Not only is it about fairness, but it's about making sure that when the books are written and the films are being made, that he and his allies come out in the best possible light. All of this relates to perception.'
Ben-Ghiat, the New York University professor, credited Trump for his foresight and skill.
'While Trump is impulsive and there's always the question of, is he a chessmaster or is he just moving blindly out of emotion, this strategy of manipulating information and creating a false narrative are the actions of someone who thinks long term, who thinks about legacy,' Ben-Ghiat said. 'He's a builder. He thinks about the future. And this is a story about someone building an alternate history for the future.'

Several Senate Democrats are privately discussing the possibility of calling Republicans' bluff on witnesses, weighing an unusual trade in President Trump's impeachment trial: the testimony of Hunter Biden for the testimony of a key administration official.
Publicly, most Democrats have scoffed at the growing GOP clamor to hear former vice president Joe Biden's son testify, dismissing him as irrelevant to the charges against Trump and accusing Republicans of trying to distract from the allegations against the president.
But behind closed doors, a small group of Democratic senators and aides has begun to question that logic, sounding out colleagues on whether to back a witness deal that could lead to testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton or other administration officials with possible firsthand knowledge of the Ukraine controversy, according to multiple Democratic officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the private discussions. 
These Democrats said they believe having Hunter "" or possibly Joe Biden "" testify could backfire on Trump and the GOP, giving Biden and the party a platform to strike back and paint Republicans and the White House as obsessed with trying to damage one of Trump's 2020 presidential rivals.
'If you want to give Joe Biden an opportunity to sit in the well of the Senate and answer the question, 'Do you think the president acted appropriately?' go right ahead,' said Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), a Biden supporter who is close with the family. Coons has not discussed the matter with Biden or Democratic leaders but said his longtime friend could hold his own.
'I can't imagine a person more comfortable in the well of the Senate than a man who spent 36 years here as a United States senator,' he said.
Senate Minority Whip Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said Hunter Biden is immaterial to the impeachment charges, but he left the door open to the possibility of having him testify.
'If there are four Republicans who open the conversation about witnesses, then I assume there will be a negotiation that follows "" but I can't tell you where it goes,' he said.
The discussions about the Bidens are being closely held, and the issue is fraught for Democrats, due to the differing levels of support for Biden in a chamber stocked with presidential candidates and the clashing views on impeachment strategy. In private conversations in recent days, there has been much loathing of the Republicans' spotlight on the Bidens among Senate Democrats, but also a fear that unless a witness deal is eventually struck, the trial could proceed without witnesses, according to party officials and Senate aides.
That predicament has led to discussions about whether, down the line, Hunter Biden or Joe Biden should be considered as part of a witness proposal. But there is hesitancy to raise the issue publicly until Senate Democratic leaders signal interest, the officials and aides said.
'Whether I'd make a trade or not, I'd have to think about it, but the question is then: Well, how does that get us more information about the charges that have been put forth?' said Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.), who added that he believed Hunter Biden was irrelevant to Trump's impeachment charges.
The House impeachment charges center on the allegation that Trump withheld military aid and a White House meeting to pressure Ukraine to investigate the Bidens, as well as a discredited theory that Ukraine worked with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 election.
Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma, when his father served as vice president. Trump and his personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani have promoted an unfounded allegation that Biden tried to stop a corruption investigation in Ukraine to protect his son, who is no longer on Burisma's board. Hunter Biden was not accused of wrongdoing.
Inside Biden's 2020 operation, there is little interest in publicly engaging with what Biden's advisers and friends dismiss as 'a stupid Republican talking point,' said a person familiar with the campaign's stance on the issue, who like others involved with the former vice president spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the issue. These people also described Biden as sensitive to how his family is covered in the media and used by political opponents. 
'Biden and his people don't want to give it credibility, so there is a stalemate right now, in terms of doing anything new,' one Biden associate said regarding whether the former vice president or his son would testify. 
A Biden campaign aide sharply criticized Republicans on Tuesday for their emphasis on Hunter Biden amid Trump's impeachment, calling it a 'sad and obvious attempt at diversion.'
'Joe Biden was on the exact same page as Republicans and the rest of the Western world when he helped oust' Ukrainian prosecutor general Viktor Shokin in 2016, the Biden campaign aide said. 'What's more, Hunter Biden's role with Burisma was announced in the spring of 2014 and was well-covered. The GOP didn't say a word about any of this until now, half a decade later.'
The topic appears to also annoy some Senate Democrats who are wary of publicly discussing an issue they contend is political gamesmanship by Republicans and should not be a part of Trump's trial. On Tuesday, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) scolded a reporter who inquired about the matter "" even though he said Sunday on CNN's 'State of the Union' that he was 'fine' with Hunter Biden testifying if it would lead to Trump officials appearing before the Senate. 
'It's a typical Donald Trump-Mitch McConnell distraction that the national media continues to play with and continues to assist them,' he said. 'I rarely criticize the media, but I just, I continue to hear this 'Hunter Biden' stuff like this has anything to do with it. And it all helps [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell just to muddy the waters.'
Brown's comments underscore how Democrats are grappling with whether to horse trade with Republicans on witnesses. If they make a deal and acquiesce to GOP demands on the Bidens, they'd be throwing one of their top 2020 candidates into the messy impeachment battle. But if they refuse to engage "" and are unable to persuade enough Republicans to join them in demanding witnesses "" they may never uncover what Trump said to his top aides about Ukraine.
For now, Senate Democrats are being advised by their leadership to reject the idea of a trade-off out of hand, keeping the focus instead on the GOP's refusal to subpoena key administration officials who may have firsthand knowledge about Trump's actions toward Ukraine. 
'The whole discussion is silly because Hunter Biden is not a witness to this matter. . . . Why not call him as a witness in the O.J. trial?' said Sen. Angus King (I-Maine), who caucuses with Democrats.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) initially floated the idea of a Hunter Biden-for-Bolton trade-off during a private GOP meeting last week. Since then, Hunter Biden's potential testimony has emerged as a potential flash point as it becomes clear that Republicans are determined to either avoid witnesses altogether or seek to trade one witness for another.
Most Democrats see the proposal by Cruz "" which has been echoed by other supporters of the president "" as an obvious gambit to prod Democrats toward a deal that would swing the spotlight away from Trump. 
'Hunter Biden is not accused of withholding $391 million of congressional authorized defense spending for one of our allies who's under attack by Russia,' said Sen. Thomas R. Carper (D-Del.), Biden's home-state colleague in the Senate for many years. 'Donald Trump is. We need to keep that in mind.'
Democrats interested in a possible deal said they would want an assurance from the president that he would not assert executive privilege over Bolton or whichever witness they choose. Most acknowledge that an agreement seems unlikely, even as they insist it isn't off the table. 
One Democrat argued it could be risky for the Biden campaign but said it could also give them a chance to steal the microphone from Trump. Additionally, some Democrats privately say Hunter, with his well-chronicled struggle with addiction, could come across as a sympathetic figure under GOP attacks. 
One idea that has been informally floated, according to two people close to the Biden campaign, is to instead offer testimony from Joe Biden in exchange for testimony from Trump. That would allow Democrats to put the spotlight on Trump's conduct while getting a chance to engage the president directly. Others have suggested that Biden could appear instead of his son, detailing his work fighting corruption in Ukraine and lambasting Republicans for attacking his family, which has been beset by tragedy.
Biden allies worry that allowing him or Hunter to get involved in impeachment would only distract from the former vice president's effort to win the nomination. But Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), a Biden supporter, said the former vice president won't let that happen, predicting that he 'is going stay focused on the issues facing Youngstown, Ohio, and places like it.'
'Joe isn't going to let the Republicans' M.O. "" trying to get Hunter to testify or whatever it is "" distract him,' he said.

In Senate trial, defense clings to argument about corruption in Ukraine
Mounting evidence released amid the ongoing presidential impeachment hearings indicates that the pressure President Trump and his aides put on Ukraine was driven by a focus on his political rivals, even as Trump's defenders say the president was acting out of general concern about corruption in that country.
The White House is emphasizing that argument anew as the defense makes its case in the Senate trial. 
'Asking a foreign leader to get to the bottom of issues of corruption is not a violation of an oath,' Jay Sekulow, an attorney for Trump, told the senators Monday.
But that assertion was dramatically undercut by reports Sunday about a draft book manuscript by former national security adviser John Bolton. In it, he recounts that Trump told him he was holding up military aid to Ukraine until the country's leaders agreed to open investigations into Democrats, including former vice president Joe Biden, according to people familiar with the book.
Trump has denied that account, which was first reported by the New York Times, tweeting Monday, 'I NEVER told John Bolton that the aid to Ukraine was tied to investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens.'
'The transcripts of my calls with President Zelensky are all the proof that is needed,' he added.
But a rough transcript of the July call released by the White House shows that Trump specifically urged the Ukrainian president to pursue two investigations: one into the Bidens and the other into a discredited theory involving an Internet security company that probed the Democratic National Committee hack in 2016. 
He never mentions the word 'corruption,' the transcript shows.
Text messages and congressional testimony also show that, behind the scenes, the president's envoys repeatedly rejected efforts by Ukrainian officials to commit to broadly cracking down on corruption "" insisting instead that their public statements mention the Ukrainian gas company where Biden's son was on the board and allegations about Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
In exchange, the Ukrainians were hoping to secure a coveted meeting at the White House for President Volodymyr Zelensky, which has still not occurred.
Trump's allies have suggested that a president concerned about corruption would be irresponsible to ignore the allegations of wrongdoing about Biden. However, the president only began speaking out about the role of Biden's son on the board of a Ukrainian gas company after the former vice president emerged as a potential 2020 rival.
While Trump has fixated on Biden, he has expressed sympathy for his former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, who pleaded guilty to failing to pay taxes on $30 million he earned in political consulting fees in Ukraine, where he worked with an array of officials around former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych, who fled the country amid corruption accusations.
 Trump has repeatedly said in recent months that he was urging Ukraine to look at corruption broadly.
'I don't care about Biden's campaign, but I do care about corruption,' he told reporters outside the White House in October.
The president reiterated that in recent weeks, telling reporters at his Florida resort on Jan. 1, 'We did nothing wrong,' adding: 'We have to check corruption.'
His Republican allies have echoed that argument.
'A president always has the constitutional authority and in fact, the responsibility to investigate serious evidence of corruption,' Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) said Monday. 

However, the political aim of the Ukraine pressure campaign is underlined in the newest batch of text messages released by the House from Lev Parnas, a onetime associate of Trump's personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani.
The messages show a concerted effort to secure statements regarding Biden from then-Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko and then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuri Lutsenko for U.S. news outlets, just as special counsel Robert S. Mueller III geared up to release his report about Russian interference and Biden prepared to announce his presidential run. 
At one point, Lutsenko wrote to Parnas that he was prepared to 'screw over your opponent,' in an apparent reference to Biden. 
Texts between the two men also show they discussed a clear deal: In exchange for making the damaging statements about Biden, Lutsenko was seeking the ouster of the then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, as well as a visit to the United States to meet Attorney General William P. Barr and other unspecified help for his boss, Poroshenko, who was fighting for his political life in a presidential election he would ultimately lose. 
The messages show that Giuliani became angry when Lutsenko reversed his previous public suggestions of wrongdoing by Biden.
None of the exchanges between the men make mention of U.S. aims to end corruption in Ukraine.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Parnas said that Giuliani emphasized the importance of the Ukrainians singling out Biden in a face-to-face meeting with Zelensky adviser Andriy Yermak in the lobby of a five-star luxury hotel in Madrid in early August.
'They had to include a statement about Burisma and Biden,' said Parnas, who was at the meeting. 
Burisma is a gas company owned by a former Ukrainian government minister accused by authorities and anti-corruption activists there of abusing his office to build his energy fortune. ​Hunter Biden served on the firm's board from 2014 to 2019. 
Parnas's account matches what Giuliani told The Post in September, when he said that he urged Yermak to pursue investigations into Burisma and alleged coordination between Democrats and Ukrainians in 2016.
'Your country owes it to us and to your country to find out what really happened,' Giuliani said he told Yermak during the Madrid meeting. 
Yermak, according to Giuliani, indicated that the Ukrainians were open to pursuing the investigations. The aide reiterated the Ukrainians' plea for a meeting with Trump, a summit that would be an important signal to Russia of Washington's support for Ukraine.
Parnas said Giuliani told Yermak that he planned to follow up with two U.S. diplomats, Kurt Volker and Gordon Sondland, and that the three Americans would discuss the precise wording of Zelensky's statement. 
'They were supposed to work it out,' Parnas said.
After the Madrid meeting, Yermak texted Volker that the Ukrainians would announce probes into Burisma, as well as the 2016 election, according to messages released by House investigators.
'Once we have a date, will call for a press briefing, announcing upcoming visit and outlining vision for the reboot of US-UKRAINE relationship, including among other things Burisma and election meddling in investigations,' he wrote.
'Sounds great!' Volker responded.
But two days later, Yermak sent Volker a draft statement that referred only generally to 'the problem of interference in the political processes of the United States,' text messages show. 
Volker and Sondland consulted with Giuliani on the statement. The president's lawyer did not find it 'convincing,' Volker recalled in his testimony.
'Mr. Giuliani was the one giving the input as to what the president wanted in the statement. He wanted Burisma and 2016 election mentioned in the statement. And I don't believe the Ukrainians were prepared to do that,' Sondland told House investigators.
In a group text with Sondland, Volker sent new language to Yermak that included an 'insert at the end for the 2 key items' "" specific references to Burisma and the 2016 election.
But privately, Volker said, he warned Yermak that releasing the statement 'was not a good idea' and could entangle the Ukrainians in U.S. domestic politics. 
'Because of conversations with Giuliani, I wanted to make sure that I was cautioning the Ukrainians, 'Don't get sucked in,' ' Volker recounted.
​The Ukrainians ultimately did not release the statement "" and Zelensky has still not received an official White House meeting. 
Text messages released by the House show that the pressure on Ukrainian officials to make a statement about Trump's Democratic opponents began in early 2019, before Zelensky's election.
Texts written in Russian show Lutsenko urging Parnas early last year to force out Yovanovitch in exchange for cooperation regarding Biden. At one point, Lutsenko suggested he wouldn't make any helpful public statements unless 'madam' is removed.
The messages show that Lutsenko became frustrated as the ambassador remained in her post for months, and Parnas failed to get him a meeting with Barr and help Poroshenko.
Lutsenko wrote on March 13 that he was 'sick of this,' using an expletive. 'I haven't received a visit,' he added. 'My boss hasn't received jack. I'm prepared to screw over your opponent. But you just want more and more. We're over. I'll deal with you later. This isn't honest.'
After Poroshenko lost, putting Lutsenko's political future in doubt, he gave an interview to Bloomberg News saying there was no evidence of wrongdoing by the Bidens in Ukraine.
Giuliani became incensed, the text messages show. Parnas immediately texted Lutsenko: '911 911 call me.' He demanded to see Lutsenko in person in the middle of the night. 
'Yura tell me where I should come I have to see you urgently,' Parnas wrote in a frenzy, using a nickname for Yuri. 'Yura it is very very very important.'

The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus across the United States put the outbreak on a collision course with the presidential primaries, threatening to disrupt the process at a pivotal moment for Democrats as they select their nominee. 
Louisiana announced Friday that it would delay its White House primaries from April 4 to June 20, becoming the first state to reschedule because of covid-19. Shortly after, the four states set to vote Tuesday said jointly that their contests would proceed as planned, referring to guidance from public health officials who have declared voting safe if best practices are followed. 
But a rush of developments heightened pressure on elections officials already struggling to minimize risks to voters and injected a sense of deep uncertainty about how the 2020 race will unfold amid the growing pandemic. 
By the end of the week, the presidential campaigns had gone virtual: Former vice president Joe Biden invited voters in Illinois to a videoconference town hall Friday, while Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) scheduled daily news conferences from Burlington, Vt., and President Trump temporarily suspended his rallies.
As the president declared a national state of emergency Friday, colleges shuttered and cities across the country banned large gatherings, there was building worry about the outbreak's impact on the voting process. The United States currently has 2,151 coronavirus cases, with 48 deaths.
Fear about exposure was expected to lower in-person turnout for Tuesday's contests in Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio, when 577 delegates are up for grabs - a potential risk for Biden as he seeks to lock up the Democratic nomination. The former vice president has had strong support from older voters, who are more at risk to suffer serious health issues if they contract covid-19.
""We've just never had a situation like this before,"" said Michael McDonald, a political scientist at the University of Florida, who said Biden could suffer if seniors stay home, while Sanders could see his support diminish if students being sent home from college campuses are unable to participate. 
""It's so hard to predict,"" he said. 
The joint statement from the chief elections officials in the four states voting Tuesday came amid worries that fears about the coronavirus would keep people from showing up at the polls. 
The statement noted that voting involves ""people from a nearby community coming into and out of the building for a short duration,"" as opposed to the kinds of large gatherings that are now banned in many jurisdictions. 
Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose said it came about after text conversations between his chief of staff and the top aides to Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, Florida Secretary of State Laurel Lee and Illinois Elections Board Chairman Charles Scholz. 
""My chief of staff was reaching out to the other [top staffers] and saying, 'Hey, listen, we need to push back on this so it doesn't become a disinformation thing or a misinformation thing,'"" LaRose said.
 ""This is about pushing calm, accurate, decisive information out there where there is too much nonsense churning on social media causing people anxiety,"" he added.
 Still, in local jurisdictions, election officials struggled to keep up with an onslaught of calls from concerned residents and the practical demands of obtaining guidance from election, public health and other leaders at every level of government. 
""It is a difficult situation for everyone,"" said Adam Johnson, chief deputy clerk in DuPage County, Ill. ""We are actively reaching out and trying to get the information as quickly as people have it, but we understand that everyone is responding in real time to this situation."" 
Under guidance from state and local health departments, election officials around the country took action this week to increase their personnel and lower health risks, often by moving hundreds of polling places out of nursing homes and stockpiling supplies to disinfect voting equipment. 
In DuPage County, officials announced Friday that volunteers would be paid $200 rather than $130 for Election Day and $15 per hour instead of $10 per hour during early voting.
In Ohio, amid a statewide campaign to recruit poll workers, the state auditor offered employees a paid day off if they sign up. 
And in Maricopa County, Ariz., officials took the unusual step of proactively mailing ballots to eligible voters who were not on the permanent early-voting list, a decision that echoed recommendations from vote-by-mail advocates. 
""There will be some who will say there is no authority to mail ballots to all voters under the law, but there is no prohibition either,"" Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes said in a written statement. ""Considering this unprecedented emergency situation, we need to act to both enfranchise the voters and protect public health."" 
Taking a different approach, Louisiana announced that the best way to protect public health - including the health of its elderly poll workers - was to use a special emergency provision in state law to delay its primaries until the summer. 
Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin said elections were delayed in 2005 and 2008 after hurricanes. He said his thought of postponing the primaries had unanimous support in across leaders in state government, both Democrats and Republicans. 
""We spent most of yesterday working as a team, looking for ways to try to carry out the election. We kept running into barrier after barrier. . . . When I contacted the governor's office, I think that there was some relief in us coming to that decision,"" Ardoin said at a news conference Friday. 
In addition to Louisiana's decision, the Wyoming Democratic Party announced this week that it would do away with the in-person portion of its caucuses, scheduled for April 4, and instead encourage voters to participate by mail, dropping off ballots on March 28 and April 4. 
The Nevada Democratic Party also canceled its county conventions - precursors to the national convention in July - and the state party in Iowa postponed similar gatherings. 
The prospect of a delayed nomination process drew concern from the Democratic campaigns. 
""Our elections can be conducted safely in consultation with public health officials,"" Kate Bedingfield, deputy Biden campaign manager and communications director, said in a written statement. She encouraged people who feel healthy, are not exhibiting symptoms and don't believe they've been exposed to the virus to vote Tuesday. 
""If voters are members of an at-risk population, exhibiting symptoms, or have been exposed to a diagnosed case of COVID-19, we encourage them to explore absentee ballots and vote by mail options,"" Bedingfield said. 

Sanders said that ""rescheduling elections is not something we do lightly or should do lightly."" He said his campaign's decision to cancel in-person events is ""hurting us.""

""This is an issue where the doctors and public health officials are going to have to be weighing the risks,"" Sanders said Friday during a media briefing in Burlington. 
Experts said there was no risk of the general election being postponed. Under federal law, it must take place on the Tuesday following the first Monday in November. The Constitution also mandates that the new Congress be seated on Jan. 3 and presidential terms begin on Jan. 20. 
Marc Elias, a leading Democratic attorney who specializes in voting rights, said he knew of no special powers that would allow Trump to change the date of a general election, even in case of a national emergency. 
""The answer is no,"" Elias said. ""When it comes to federal elections, there's no wiggle room there.""
In states with upcoming primaries, local election officials are now racing to figure out how to mitigate potential health risks of casting a ballot.
In New York, a critical state where voters will weigh in on the presidential nominating contest on April 28, state elections board Co-chairman Douglas A. Kellner said board officials have been coordinating with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's (D) office, as well as with legislative leaders, to discuss alternative voting options. 
A move to delay April's presidential primary is ""possible given the circumstances,"" he said. In the meantime, Kellner said, some local counties were making changes to their absentee voting procedures that exceeded their authority.
""At this time, public health officials are not advising us that's necessary or appropriate,"" he added. ""One has to balance the risk against the priority of a stable democracy.
""Two counties have gone rogue and taken it upon themselves to take emergency actions that aren't authorized by law,"" he said.
Erie County had altered the application form to include the novel coronavirus as an excuse for requesting an absentee ballot, he said. And Dutchess County had signaled plans to mail absentee ballot applications to all eligible voters, according to Kellner, and to vastly reduce the number of polling sites. 
Erik J. Haight, an election commissioner in Dutchess County, said local officials were determined to protect the elderly population and that it is customary to consolidate polling locations. 
Jeremy J. Zellner, an elections commissioner in Erie County, said it was the commissioners' job ""to make sure people are not disenfranchised, and we believe very strongly we do have the authority to do this based on the governor's emergency declaration and the illness provision in state election law.""
In Georgia, which votes March 24, local Democratic leaders were encouraging people with health risks to request absentee ballots ahead of the March 20 deadline. 
""It's a question we're all wrestling with, but until there's official guidance from the state, my reaction today is to encourage people to vote absentee,"" said Wendy Davis, a city commissioner in Rome, Ga., and a member of the Democratic National Committee. 
Frustrations were similar in Florida, where state Democratic Party Executive Director Juan Peñalosa said he was struggling to obtain a list of polling sites at senior centers that have been shut down. A request for comment from the Florida secretary of state's office was not immediately returned. 
Paul Lux, supervisor of elections in the Florida Panhandle's Okaloosa County, said screens, styluses and surfaces will be disinfected throughout the day. Hand sanitizer will be available in most locations - but not necessarily all, he said.
""I have the same supply problem as everyone else,"" Lux said. ""Hand sanitizer is not something I had on the shelf in our warehouse.""
In Wisconsin, where the presidential primaries are scheduled for April 7, election officials were racing to provide voters with absentee ballots while waiting to see if the governor and the state legislature would take more drastic action. 
Reid Magney, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, said state officials have been attending webinars and conference calls with the Department of Homeland Security and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention while also working with the state's Department of Health Services. 
The commission this week suspended plans to dispatch special voting deputies to deliver absentee ballots to nursing homes. They will be placed in the mail instead.

Organized labor could potentially turn the presidential election "" if only it makes up its mind.
Unions are front and center this campaign season, having hosted a dozen or so forums and town hall meetings with the Democratic hopefuls. The candidates' labor platforms, even those of moderates such as Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, include more proposals to strengthen workers' ability to organize than any election cycle in recent memory. And worker strikes have nearly canceled two Democratic debates, after candidates pledged not to cross picketing workers.
Even President Trump is making a pitch to workers a central part of his reelection bid.
But one typical fixture of an election season has been largely absent: union endorsements. The major national and international unions have refrained from endorsing a candidate, treating the political scrum with more circumspection than in previous years.
In 2015, many of the country's largest unions, more often aligned with Democratic candidates than Republican ones, made their picks well before the primary season began.
The Service Employees International Union (about 2-million members), the American Federation of Teachers (about 1.7-million members), and American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (1.4-million members) all made their endorsements of Hillary Clinton by fall 2015, a year before the election. 
But this year, none of those big unions has endorsed a candidate yet, in part because so many drew fire from rank-and-file members who embraced Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) last time around.
'Unions are keeping their powder dry,' said Dane Strother, a Democratic political consultant who splits his time between Washington and California. 'We've never had a primary like this. . . . I think everyone is trying to see how this shakes out.'
While silent on endorsements, a few unions have signaled support in other ways, like Nevada's powerful Culinary Union, which distributed a flier about the candidates' health-care plans that seemed to warn people away from Sanders and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). The flier made waves among Sanders supporters, causing the union to defend its work and issuing a statement on Wednesday saying: 'It's disappointing that Senator Sanders' supporters have viciously attacked the Culinary Union and working families in Nevada simply because our union has provided facts on what certain healthcare proposals might do,' union Secretary-Treasurer Geoconda Argüello-Kline wrote.
However, endorsements from small unions and local chapters of the national unions have been rolling in. This year, Sanders, who just won the New Hampshire primary, leads the pack with more than 15 union endorsements. Nationally, he has been endorsed by the American Postal Workers Union, which has about 200,000 members, National Nurses United, which has about 150,000, the National Union of Healthcare Workers, with about 15,000, and the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America, with about 35,000 members.
Biden has been endorsed by at least seven unions, including the International Association of Fire Fighters, with 320,000 members, the Amalgamated Transit Union with about 200,000, and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, with about 750,000 members. Warren has been endorsed by at least three unions. Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) have not been endorsed by any.
In another sign of a more deliberative approach this year, unions have been doing more outreach among their members, including conducting internal polls on political views. The majority will probably line up behind whichever Democratic candidate emerges from the bruising primary season, union leaders said.
'Any one of the candidates has a better platform and record on labor issues than Donald Trump,' said Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, AFL-CIO, which has not made an endorsement in the race. 
Most of the major candidates tout pro-union platforms. For example, all the front-runners support federal legislation that just passed the House to give workers more power during disputes at work. And they back the repeal of 'right to work' laws that allow workers to opt out of paying union dues. 
Picket lines became crucial stops for Democrats on the campaign trail, with candidates visiting strikes that ranged from General Motors autoworkers in Detroit to teachers in Chicago. And the refusal by candidates to cross picket lines nearly resulted in the cancellation of Democratic debates in Los Angeles, where cafeteria workers were striking for a new contract at Loyola Marymount University and in Ohio, where workers were in a dispute with debate host CNN. In both cases, the companies settled with workers days before the events as pressure escalated.
For workers like Alexandria Cutler, the national attention has been eye-opening. A 23-year-old food service worker in Pennsylvania who has been organizing with the SEIU, Cutler got the chance to host Sanders at her home and then take him to work with her "" on the bus in the rain. She also participated in a roundtable discussion with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and former congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas when they were still in the race.
Cutler said she is realistic about all the attention being given to workers' issues. 
'I only feel like it's being taking more seriously, because we're pushing the issue,' she said. SEIU's eventual endorsement was unlikely to influence her vote, she added. 
Unions are still a powerful constituency "" 15 to 18-percent of voters in 2016 came from households with at least one union member "" but questions remain about how reliably union members will turn out for a Democratic opponent in key swing states, including Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where Trump won by thin margins. Those states have even more union households then the general electorate.
Trump's appeals to disaffected workers were a significant part of his success in 2016, experts say. Clinton beat Trump in union households by only nine percentage points "" half of the 18-point margin Barack Obama won over Mitt Romney in 2012, according to exit poll data. 
That differential was enough to tip the balance in those three states, according to an analysis by Five Thirty Eight.
'White, blue-collar men are disaffected,' said Hank Shein kopf, a veteran Democratic political consultant in New York. 'And the challenge for the unions is whether they can not allow that to happen again.'

When asked what kept him up at night, Ben Wikler, who is responsible for delivering a must-win state in November as chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic Party, used to answer, ""unknown unknowns."" He no longer has to wonder what such a risk might look like. 
Presidential campaigns, parties and state election officials are scrambling to heed health warnings while safeguarding the democratic process against a growing coronavirus epidemic whose scope is difficult to predict.
Their planning has included advising voters not to lick their mail-in ballots, relocating polling places away from senior living communities, and weighing whether to move forward with plans to bring tens of thousands of visitors from around the world to Milwaukee and Charlotte for the planned Democratic and Republican summer conventions, respectively. 
Former vice president Joe Biden's digital staff was envisioning options for virtual campaigning if sweeping changes were necessary. Sen. Bernie Sanders's campaign already has an elaborate streaming operation, which it said it could tap in the event that campaigning is curtailed. Already, both campaigns have been providing hand sanitizer at events.
Over the weekend, the AFL-CIO, the nation's largest federation of unions, canceled a presidential forum scheduled for Thursday in Orlando, where Biden and Sanders (I-Vt.), the leading contenders for the Democratic nomination, had been scheduled to appear. It was the first such cancellation to have been attributed to the coronavirus's spread.
Asked about the wisdom of holding campaign events, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said it ""really depends.""
""If you want to talk about large gatherings in a place where you have community spread, I think that's a judgment call, and if someone decides they want to cancel it I wouldn't publicly criticize them,"" he said during a White House briefing Monday. 
None of the presidential campaigns has made significant changes, even as all emphasize they will follow the recommendations of health experts. President Trump's reelection campaign said it was ""proceeding as normal,"" denying that a ""Women for Trump"" bus tour had been postponed because of the coronavirus, pointing instead to a ""scheduling conflict."" 
Still, the virus, which caused stocks to nose-dive on Monday, suddenly brought every assumption about the unfolding of the 2020 race into question - even the viability of activities as core to campaigning as knocking on doors. It also intensified fears about election interference and disinformation, after social media became host to false claims about last-minute voting changes on Super Tuesday.
""It's an item on the agenda of every meeting,"" Wikler said. ""Everyone involved in politics is deep in scenario planning.""
Most immediately, that meant protecting voters participating in contests Tuesday in six states, including Washington, the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States.
The state votes by mail, lessening concerns about transmission of the virus, apart from the potential issue of saliva on ballots or envelopes. Election officials, pressing voters to use a wet sponge or a cloth as a sealant, launched a public education campaign on social media with the slogan ""Whether healthy or sick, please don't lick!"" State officials were also advising that voters deliver their ballots to election drop boxes in an effort to spare postal workers the health risk. 
Speaking on a panel at the state capitol last month, the director of elections for Washington's most populous county named the coronavirus as one of the obstacles that keeps her ""up at night.""
""I think things like that - those things that we maybe don't have in the contingency plans, like a virus,"" King County Elections Director Julie Wise said at the event, which was hosted in part by the secretary of state's office.
Wise called 2020 a ""doozy of a year"" for election administrators.
""We often don't - or ever - cancel or delay an election, so we're still conducting an election regardless of if there is flooding, regardless of if there is a pandemic, regardless of if there is an earthquake,"" she said.
At least 45 states have laws that anticipate Election Day emergencies such as natural disasters, but these laws vary widely, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In eight states, including Florida, Texas and Virginia, the governor has the statutory power to delay or reschedule an election.
But in most states, officials closest to the ground have little guidance so far beyond what has been publicly released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Meanwhile, messaging from the Trump administration has veered between caution and the president's early assertions that fears of the virus have been overblown. 
In Michigan, which has been a hub of recent campaigning before Tuesday's vote, a spokesman for the Wayne County Health Department pointed to CDC recommendations in explaining how the county, which includes Detroit, was encouraging voters to protect themselves ahead of Tuesday's primary. 

Campaigns, meanwhile, said they were relying on local health departments, while also following state and federal guidance.
""We're a campaign that believes in science, and we will go with what the science tells us,"" said Ari Rabin-Havt, a deputy campaign manager for Sanders. ""If we can't campaign one way, we'll campaign another way.""
Biden, who has been holding shorter events and spending less time greeting supporters on the rope line, was committed to ""complying with reasonable risk mitigations,"" his campaign said in a statement. ""At the same time, we will continue to run an aggressive, national campaign to win the Democratic nomination and defeat Donald Trump."" 
While the Trump reelection campaign uncharacteristically has not advertised a public rally for this week or beyond, Trump has not appeared to alter his schedule of fundraising meet-and-greet events or his practice of greeting supporters who are invited to be on hand when he lands at airports.
Trump attended events with donors on Monday in Florida and greeted a line of supporters on the tarmac in Orlando.
""Reports that the White House has issued formal guidelines to staff instructing them to limit in-person interactions and meetings are completely false,"" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said in a statement.
After this week's voting, the Democratic contest turns to several states that will vote March 17, including Florida, whose voting population includes a substantial portion of retirees and senior citizens.
Already steps were being taken to protect them during voting. Numerous senior living centers that ordinarily serve as precinct locations had moved to relocate voting off their campuses, while others were still examining their options, according to Steve Bahmer, the president and chief executive of LeadingAge Florida, an association representing senior-living facilities. 
""Seniors tend to vote, and obviously there's a lot of interest in the 2020 election,"" Bahmer said. ""Voter disenfranchisement is a key concern, and steps are being taken in advance to make sure that doesn't happen.""
The complications will only deepen when the presidential contest enters the summer months. Right now, the CDC has advised people at higher risk of infection to avoid crowds. If that advice were to become broader, or if the government were to impose the type of travel restrictions introduced in other counties, it could impede the parties' abilities to hold their nominating conventions this summer. 
Committees overseeing both conventions said they were pressing ahead with their plans while monitoring developments. 
""We prioritize the health and safety of attendees and have the utmost confidence in the administration's work and preparations,"" said Blair Ellis, a spokeswoman for the Republican convention, scheduled for August in Charlotte. 
Joe Solmonese, the chief executive of the Democratic convention, set for July in Milwaukee, said in a statement that every convention requires ""developing a number of contingency plans to provide for a variety of scenarios.
""As we prepare to welcome Americans to Milwaukee this summer, the convention team will remain in constant communication with the local, state, and federal authorities responsible for protecting public health and security,"" he said. 
Alex Halderman, a computer scientist at the University of Michigan, said it would be difficult to replicate the social experience of the convention. The balloting process involved in selecting a nominee, however, could probably be transferred to an online system, he said, citing Google software as a possible alternative.
As for voting itself, Halderman said mail-in ballots offer an efficient alternative to in-person participation. But there are barriers, he cautioned, including states that don't offer no-excuse absentee voting. He also pointed to concerns about coercion that arise when large numbers of people are mailing in ballots rather than completing them in the privacy of a voting booth. 
Four states hold all elections entirely by mail, and at least 21 states allow certain elections to be conducted entirely by mail, depending on the circumstances, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
There is little precedent for the waging of a presidential race against the backdrop of an epidemic on this scale. 
The Spanish flu of 1918 was active during that year's midterm campaign and election season. Local news reports from the weeks before and after that election suggested that the virus did impact planning, with some officials ordering voters to wear masks or advising against congregating publicly to hear election results.
""The election of 1918 is the only truly momentous American election ever to take place in the midst of a major pandemic,"" the late professor Alfred W. Crosby wrote in ""America's Forgotten Pandemic: The Influenza of 1918,"" published by Cambridge University Press. ""Spanish influenza certainly affected campaigning: it canceled political meetings; doused that American political perennial, the torchlight parade; and obliged politicians to abandon their plans for last-minute whirlwind speaking tours.""
Crosby cast doubt on whether the flu had depressed voter turnout, noting that while there was a ""sharp drop"" in votes compared with 1916, 1918 was a midterm election, when voter interest is typically lower.

Virginia Republican Scott W. Taylor said Monday that he will end his U.S. Senate campaign against Sen. Mark R. Warner (D) and instead run for his old U.S. House seat representing Virginia Beach.
If Taylor wins a competitive Republican primary, he will face Rep. Elaine Luria, the Democrat who unseated him in a 2018 election amid a wave of anti-Trump sentiment and a scandal over election petitions that embroiled Taylor's campaign. His GOP opponents include Ben Loyola, a retired Navy captain and defense contractor whose family fled communist Cuba when he was 2.
Taylor, a former Navy SEAL, said Luria's support for articles of impeachment against President Trump convinced him to pursue a rematch against her.
In an interview on WAVY TV 10, he accused Luria, a former Navy commander, of 'disgracefully using your military background to justify an empty impeachment which has taken away from the needs of the district and the country.'
Luria is one of seven freshman Democrats, five of them women, who announced their support for an impeachment inquiry in late September in an op-ed in The Washington Post.
'These girls that have national security backgrounds, they came out before there was any bit of evidence whatsoever, and they did so to create political cover for moderates to allow [House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi to move forward,' Taylor said early Monday on radio's 'John Fredericks Show.'
Responding to Taylor, Luria said: 'Yes, I am a girl. I may wear heels now, but I wore steel-toed boots for 20 years in the Navy. It's 2020 "" girls can do anything.'
Taylor also said turnout in a presidential election year could benefit Republicans in a district that voted for Trump by about three percentage points.
Luria on Sunday endorsed former vice president Joe Biden for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Loyola's campaign spokesman, Peter Finocchio, said there's no reason to expect that voters will come back to Taylor.
'Scott Taylor had his chance and failed,' he said. 'The issues that plagued his 2018 campaign will cause him to lose again. He also failed to stand up for conservative principles, often voting with lobbyists and Washington Democrats over the interests of his own constituents.' 




Taylor, who was raised on Maryland's Eastern Shore by a single mother, was deployed to Iraq as a Navy SEAL and served as a state delegate before winning a seat in Congress.
He lost to Luria amid a scandal over fraudulent signatures that his campaign collected to help a potential spoiler candidate get on the ballot. 
In May, a special prosecutor filed two charges of election fraud against a Taylor staff member but did not say whether the former congressman broke any laws. The investigation is ongoing. 
'I was devastated to learn about wrongdoing on the team,' Taylor said Monday in the TV interview. 'But in the end, I'm responsible for it, and I think some voters held me accountable for it.'

The Post reported last month that in late 2018, Trump's personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed replacing the U.S. ambassador to Qatar with Taylor, who visited the country in 2017 and spoke at a Qatari event in Washington the following year.
Virginia Democrats seized on the switch as proof that Taylor couldn't gain traction in the Senate race against Warner.
'Scott Taylor, who was fired by his constituents in the 2018 midterm election, couldn't get his Senate campaign off the ground after failing to get the ambassador job that he wanted,' Virginia Democratic Party spokesman Grant Fox said in a statement.
Luria said Monday that she is looking forward to 'seeing a spirited debate' among the various contestants in the Republican primary
Taylor told Fredericks that he plans to transfer a balance of about $167,000 in his Senate campaign account to his House campaign. Luria had about $1.1-million cash on hand at the end of September, reports show.
When he announced plans to challenge Warner in July, Taylor said that after running in eight contested primary and general elections in about a decade, shifting to the Senate's six-year cycles made sense.
The independent analysts at Cook Political Report consider the Senate seat solidly Democratic. Republicans have not won a statewide seat in Virginia since 2009.

After watching Hillary Clinton's defeat in 2016 and the departure of prominent female candidates from this year's Democratic primary race, women in the party expressed hope Monday that Joe Biden's vow to name a woman as his running mate could spell an end to the starkest gender barrier in American politics. 
Women have been tapped twice before as vice-presidential nominees, but with polls showing Biden leading President Trump in a general election, many see this as the most realistic possibility that a woman could wind up a heartbeat from the presidency.
Biden, 77, has described himself as a ""bridge"" to the next generation of leaders, a comment widely interpreted as a signal that he'd serve just one term, meaning his running mate would be even more of a president-in-waiting than usual. 
""There is this invisible glass ceiling that we just saw play itself out in even the Democratic nomination process,"" said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers and a major player in the party. ""We have to find a way to change this construct of there being this invisible bar to women becoming president or vice president of the United States."" 
A person close to the Biden team who was not authorized to speak publicly, and so spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the campaign will soon announce a running mate vetting operation. 
Biden has told MSNBC that it's ""very important"" to pick someone who's been tested via a presidential campaign, suggesting that the women who ran against him may have an edge. Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) have both endorsed Biden, and Klobuchar in particular has gone out of her way to show her loyalty. 
The senator from Minnesota heavily retooled her own campaign in her home state to support Biden and appeared at two rallies in Michigan on his behalf. She noted on CNN on Monday that Biden then won those two states, which will be crucial in the general election, adding that it's ""a great thing"" that Biden is planning to select a woman. 

Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) has not endorsed Biden, but the two have spoken twice since she dropped out of the race this month. Their most recent conversation included a discussion of her plan to overhaul the country's bankruptcy system, which he adopted this week and touted on the debate stage Sunday. 
The move was widely seen by Warren allies as an olive branch to the Bay State senator, who famously clashed with Biden in the 1990s on bankruptcy laws. A person close to Biden, who was not authorized to discuss campaign strategy, said Biden had been interested in Warren's plan since she unveiled it in early January. 
Biden has previously hinted that he'd be interested in running with Warren, floating the idea of a joint ticket in 2015 as he was considering a challenge to Clinton. In the end he chose not to run. 
The former vice president has ""strongly believed"" for ""some time"" that his running mate should be a woman, according to a Biden adviser who was not authorized to speak publicly about his selection. The adviser added that Biden ""has been eager to make this public once it was appropriate based on his standing in the race.""
The disappointment of many women with the outcome of the Democratic primary contest is palpable, especially after Clinton's devastating loss in 2016. The initial field of more than two dozen hopefuls included several prominent women, including four U.S. senators, but Harris and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) never got traction, and neither Warren nor Klobuchar finished higher than third in any state. 

Biden's move could be a way to reach out to a pivotal voting bloc. His announcement - made Sunday in response to a question during the first Democratic debate since 2004 that did not include a woman - comes at a moment of reckoning for a party that has long touted a commitment to diversity. 
Women have led the opposition to Trump, first by holding massive marches in cities around the globe the day after his inauguration, and then by running for office in record numbers and winning a historic number of seats in Congress, which elevated Nancy Pelosi to be House speaker.
So far, 56 percent of Democratic voters this year have been women, according to a Washington Post analysis of entrance and exit polls. That's in line with 2016, when 58 percent of the Democratic primary electorate was women, and 2008, when women made up 57 percent of the vote. 
During Sunday's debate, Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) were asked how they would select Cabinet members able to advise them on ""issues that affect women's physical and financial health.""
""I'll pick a woman to be vice president,"" said Biden, who was apparently waiting for an opportunity to make this announcement. ""There are a number of women who are qualified to be president tomorrow. I would pick a woman to be my vice president."" 
He also repeated a pledge to appoint the first black woman to the Supreme Court.
Sanders committed to appointing women to at least half the top administration jobs and, when pressed, said he would ""in all likelihood"" select a woman to be his running mate.

On the campaign trail, Biden at various points has mentioned a number of women as suitable running mates, beyond his primary opponents. They include Stacey Abrams, the 2018 Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Georgia; and Sally Yates, the former acting U.S. attorney general who refused to carry out Trump's order to close the U.S. border to people from seven majority-Muslim countries. 
Others in the party have mentioned Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, whose state will be critical in the general election, and Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), a prominent Latina from another important region.
The United States lags far behind other democracies, from Britain to Germany to Israel, in putting a woman in the top job. If Biden wins and a woman becomes vice president, it could acclimate voters to the image of a woman at the pinnacle of power. 
At the same time, the number of women in the primary field, and the strong performance of Warren and others on the debate stage, added pressure on Biden to make his announcement.
""Now that we've seen what a diverse debate stage can look like, it's hard to imagine being satisfied with anything else,"" said Barbara Lee, a Massachusetts-based philanthropist whose foundation focuses on electing women to executive positions. ""I believe that a more inclusive ticket is essential, to energize and mobilize 2020 voters.""
She said the change could be permanent. ""Moving forward, it's hard to imagine a presidential cycle without a woman on the ticket,"" Lee said.
Last week leaders from nearly two dozen women's groups and liberal organizations - including Emily's List, Planned Parenthood Action Fund, UltraViolet and the Sunrise Movement - sent a letter to the Biden and Sanders campaigns, as well as the Democratic National Committee, urging that the ticket include a woman.
""Democratic victory in 2020 will depend on record-breaking participation by women,"" said the letter, which was also signed by dozens of additional female leaders. ""Women are the backbone of the Democratic Party.""
Biden's decision to make his announcement relatively early in the campaign also suggests he thought it was important to send a signal at this juncture. The aim may have been in part to set up a contrast with Trump, who has made various derogatory comments about women.
It also reflects a shift in Democratic politics, where notions of identity and representation have gained power in recent years.
""Until recently, the idea of choosing somebody other than a white man was just not part of the calculus,"" said Joel Goldstein, a law professor at Saint Louis University who wrote a book on the vice presidency. 
When Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale selected then-Rep. Geraldine Ferraro (N.Y.) to be his running mate in 1984, a burgeoning women's movement pushed him to make the move, Goldstein said. ""They were threatening floor fights if they didn't pick a woman,"" he said.
But Mondale made the selection with his back against the wall. The economy was recovering, making his challenge to President Ronald Reagan more difficult, and his advisers wanted to ""reshuffle the deck"" with an unusual pick, Goldstein said.
And 24 years later, when Republican John McCain picked Sarah Palin, he did so after it became clear that his first choice, Sen. Joe Lieberman - a Democrat from Connecticut - would cause a brawl at the convention. At the time McCain trailed Democratic nominee Barack Obama, a historic candidate running an electrifying campaign.
Biden, in contrast, is leading in the polls, so his announcement is hardly a desperation move. And his age means his choice of running mate will get extra scrutiny.
""I think people will look at any pick that Joe Biden makes - because of his age and because of the moment - with an increased sense of responsibility,"" Weingarten said. ""One should always do that about a vice president."" But that's especially true, she said, since Biden, Sanders and Trump ""are all in their 70s.""

Democrats have more optimism about ticket, but uncertainties remain
Former vice president Joe Biden's sudden emergence as the Democratic front-runner and the disruptions caused by the spreading coronavirus are altering calculations about the shape of a general election campaign that only weeks ago many Democrats feared was tipping in the direction of President Trump.
Biden's string of primary victories over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has improved the outlook of many Democratic strategists, who had feared that a Sanders nomination, which looked increasingly possible, would make winning the general election more difficult and could threaten down-ballot candidates as well.
Biden's campaign has begun to shift its focus to the general election even as the nomination contest with Sanders continues. The two Democrats will debate Sunday night on CNN and face another round of primaries on Tuesday. In those four contests - Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio - Biden is heavily favored and likely to add to his growing lead in delegates.
Both the Trump campaign and Democratic strategists have been focused first on the four key states that made Trump president in 2016: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Florida. The campaigns also expect to compete in North Carolina, Arizona, Minnesota and possibly one or two other states in an effort to expand their paths to an electoral majority.
Biden's sizable victory in Michigan on Tuesday, powered by a sharp rise in suburban turnout and strength across the state, has generated a surge of optimism and some cautionary warnings among Democrats about their prospects of winning that crucial state and others who will decide the outcome in November if the former vice president is at the top of the ticket. The turnout gave them hope that the energy behind Democrats' decisive victories during the last midterms could spell trouble this year for Trump. 
""The dynamics in Michigan have not shifted from 2018, and that is bad news for the Republicans,"" said Richard Czuba, an independent Michigan pollster.

The bigger unknown is what political impact the spreading coronavirus could have in November. The massive disruption to daily lives and the meltdown in financial markets are likely to affect voters' views of their own futures and potentially the two candidates as well, but in what ways no one can say.
Judgments on the government's response to the crisis, pro or con, could affect swing voters as they make decisions in the fall, while shocks to the economy and the possibility of a recession could rob the president of the single strongest issue he has had in his bid for a second term. 
""Historically, there are periods in presidential history where people just want calmness after a storm,"" said Susan MacManus, emerita professor of political science at the University of South Florida. ""That would be one of the key things, is to see whether Biden can project calmness and competence after the tumultuous period we've been in.""
If anything, the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus makes planning for the general election more difficult, but also might open the possibility of other states coming into play by later in the year. Campaigns are only now beginning to assess but lack trustworthy data in the middle of the pandemic to be able to make decisions with confidence.
Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, expressed confidence about the president's prospects for winning a second term, asserting that the electoral map looks favorable whether the challenger is Biden or Sanders. 
""Joe Biden will have a problem with union workers all across the upper Midwest because of his support for the job-killing NAFTA and TPP [Trans Pacific Partnership] deals, so this myth of Biden as some kind of blue-collar hero will be destroyed,"" he said in an email message. ""Biden's support for the public option in health care is just another way of crowding our employer-provided health insurance that people know and value."" 

Biden's team is operating on painful lessons Democrats learned from 2016 on what could be the new realities of campaigning in a time of a pandemic. ""It's incredibly important that we start from a standpoint of how wide the landscape could be,"" said a senior Biden campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment of the race. ""It is a detailed belief that I have that you can't take anything for granted. . . . I'm not willing to sit here and say, 'We don't need Florida, and Ohio is dead.' ""
Democrats hope for the increase in turnout, particularly among suburban women, that helped them win the House in 2018 to continue.
Meanwhile, the Trump campaign is counting on increased turnout among voters in exurban and rural areas who sat out 2016 but could make the difference in November. It's also making appeals to Latinos and African Americans.
One Biden campaign official said that because of what the Trump campaign is doing to communicate to voters of color and what likely will be new rules of the road for voter contact and mobilization, the campaign will have to put even greater emphasis than ever in assuring that the party's core voters turn out in November. 
That means greater breadth and depth in trying to reach all potential supporters. ""We're going to have to do the work of persuasion and get out there and make sure people turn out,"" the official said.
Florida appears to be a must-win state for the president. If he successfully replicates his narrow victory of 2016, the three northern states, or equivalent substitutes, become crucial for the Democrats. Of those three, Wisconsin is considered the most difficult.
Democratic strategists see Biden as better positioned than Sanders to reach an electoral college majority, in large part because the senator from Vermont's past and current statements about Cuba and his democratic socialist agenda would cost him significantly among Hispanic voters in Florida. That doesn't mean Sanders would have no path to 270 electoral votes, only that his margin for error would be smaller than for Biden. 
These same strategists say Biden appears able to put together a coalition of African Americans, suburban women and enough working-class white voters to improve on Hillary Clinton's performance in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, which she lost by a combined 77,000 votes. 

But some Democrats are more cautious in their assessments of Biden's prospects. They worry that Trump is working to persuade voters of color either to defect or stay on the sidelines and see a need for the Democratic nominee to engage with those communities as much as they appear to be looking to attract white working-class voters.
The Trump strategy ""is to amp up their base with messages that stoke fear across the electorate and draw defection from the Democratic electorate,"" said Patrick Schuh, Michigan state director for America Votes, a progressive organization. ""Democrats and the progressive coalition are energized right now, but is running against Donald Trump enough to keep that coalition energized? We have to appeal to both white working-class voters and voters of color.""
Florida's primary on Tuesday could offer some clues about the fall campaign, but Clinton routed Sanders there in the 2016 primary and still lost the state to Trump in November. Biden is seen as a stronger candidate in that state than Sanders. 
Trump won Florida by just over a percentage point and won each of the three northern states by less than a percentage point and a combined total of just 77,000 votes. He rates as a very slight favorite to win Florida again. 
Steve Schale, a Florida-based Democratic strategist who is part of the group that formed Unite America, the super PAC helping Biden, said his state has been through so many close elections at the national and state level that we should expect another in November. 
Florida's voting patterns are shifting, but he said the changes have not altered the overall partisan split in the state. ""Democrats are doing wildly better in south Florida than before, and Republicans are seeing huge growth in places like Naples and Fort Myers. They keep balancing each other out."" He predicted that two media markets in the central part of the state - Orlando and Tampa - will determine the outcome.
Some Democrats worry that Trump has been effective in registering voters who would be partial to the president but did not turn out in 2016. Many of these voters live outside of major population centers. ""They have done a good job registered downscale, white voters,"" said Jim Messina, Obama's 2012 campaign manager. Florida is one and Pennsylvania is another, he said.
Another issue that concerns some Democrats is the potential resistance among some Hispanic voters - Cuban Americans and Venezuelan immigrants - to a Democratic nominee. ""It is extremely sensitive territory for members of that community to know that U.S. leaders, especially the president of the United States will stand with them,"" said one Florida Democratic politician speaking privately. ""Biden will have to deal with that directly.""
MacManus identified another potential weakness for Biden in Florida. ""Over a third of our voters are the two youngest generations,"" she said. ""If they can't be encouraged to turn out and vote for Biden, that's a really big problem.""
Of the three crucial northern states, Democrats feel best now about Michigan followed by Pennsylvania and then Wisconsin, which is seen as the tipping-point state for November, meaning the state that could give one candidate or the other the 270th electoral vote.
Trump campaign officials have made clear they will compete hard in Minnesota, which Clinton carried narrowly in 2016. Democrats agree that it is a state they must watch carefully because of its demographics. The Republicans will target other states as well but are not likely to carry them unless the president is winning by bigger margins than in 2016.
Democrats long have seen Arizona and North Carolina as targets and believe with Biden as the nominee both are even more attractive because of his potential ability to build a broad coalition. 
Former president Barack Obama won North Carolina in 2008 before losing it in 2012, and Trump carried it in 2016. Arizona's changing demographics and a costly and competitive Senate race that Democrats are eyeing make it attractive. If Wisconsin proves too difficult for Democrats, Arizona's electoral votes could compensate.
""Democrats are going to wage holy war to put Arizona and North Carolina into play, and recent events have made that more doable,"" Messina said.
Countering that, Trump's team came close enough in Minnesota in 2016 to warrant a serious investment there. New Hampshire, too, was quite close in 2016 and, given the Trump campaign's vast resources, worth going for. Both sides will treat it as a legitimate battleground despite its small size. 
Republicans also have talked about New Mexico as a state Trump could win, but Democrats are skeptical that he can turn the state red. Meanwhile, Biden's team will look seriously at competing in Ohio and even Iowa, even though Trump won both handily four years ago.

Democrats fight over blame
Sanders supporters revive 2016 grievances 

MANCHESTER, N.H. "" Democratic leaders have edged toward the brink of open war with one another in recent days after a series of jarring setbacks that could jeopardize the party's chances against President Trump, who continues to solidify his iron-fisted control over the Republican election apparatus.
The infighting focuses largely on the failed caucus process in Iowa, with state and national Democratic leaders at odds over who deserves blame, as well as an increasingly bitter dispute over the rules governing who gets into future nationally televised candidate debates "" a process that could allow billionaire Mike Bloomberg to make the stage later this month.
In a particularly stark sign, supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have returned to bashing the Democratic National Committee, reviving grievances from the divisive 2016 primary race. In that campaign, Sanders backers said that the system had been stacked against the democratic socialist "" a view later affirmed when WikiLeaks released hacked internal emails "" and supporters of nominee Hillary Clinton blamed Sanders for failing to sufficiently rally his base on Clinton's behalf in the general election.
Sanders's allies are again charging that the DNC is maneuvering to thwart his anti-establishment movement. They say the 
DNC's decision last week to call for a 'recanvass' in Iowa threatened to undercut Sanders's ability to claim momentum from winning the popular vote there, while changing the rules to benefit Bloomberg reflects the desire among the party elite for a savior to deny Sanders the nomination. 

'They can shout unity all they want, but the actions show otherwise,' said Nina Turner, a national co-chairman of the Sanders campaign.
The brew of resentment and anxiety represents a sharp turn for a presidential primary race that began last year with a historically diverse field and intense optimism that Democrats could harness the same energy that helped them win big in 2018.
 

Now party unity is breaking down just as voters express rising concerns that none of the remaining candidates is fully equipped to take on an incumbent president who regularly scoffs at political norms of civility and accuracy. 
Like Iowans, many of whom remained undecided until the last moment before the caucuses, about a third of New Hampshire voters remain undecided, with Sanders and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg appearing to have momentum before the Tuesday primary. 

The longtime national polling leader, Joe Biden, who many Democrats hoped would unify the party and pose the greatest threat to Trump, posted a disappointing finish in Iowa and has been sliding in New Hampshire.
The party's internal strife now looms over the Tuesday vote here as well as additional primaries set for the coming weeks.
Advisers to the two men most responsible for overseeing the disastrous Iowa caucuses, national chairman Tom Perez and Iowa chairman Troy Price, have been privately deflecting blame onto each other, as the relationship between the two has become tense, advisers say. Price has refused to join Perez in calling for a recanvass of voting records in the state, after finding out about Perez's demand from a deputy a few minutes before it was tweeted, people familiar with their communication said. 
Price allies blame Perez for the botched caucus count, pointing to new party rules he implemented around transparency and accessibility that increased the burdens on the state. They also point to confusion over whether a cybersecurity team sent by Perez fully reviewed the technology that failed on caucus night.
'Ultimately this is the national chairman's mess. He is the one who asked us to do it. We tried to do it. We got bushwhacked by a bad system, and now we are trying to clean up,' said former congressman Dave Nagle, who planned the 2020 caucuses with Price and now refers to Perez with the nickname 'Pontius Pilate.' 
In response, aides to Perez, who was not in Iowa for the caucuses, have maintained that the state party was ultimately responsible for administering the caucuses, choosing a technology vendor and making sure the technology worked. The DNC hired experts, they say, to review the cybersecurity of the technology but not the functionality of the software. 
'I am not Troy Price's boss so it is not our role to micromanage every element of the administration of elections,' Perez said in an interview Sunday, when asked about the DNC's responsibility for the Iowa failures. 'Every state party has its own process.' 
Perez did not appear in the spin room after Friday's New Hampshire debate, and he skipped a speaking slot Saturday in Manchester at a state party fundraiser because of a conflicting, and previously scheduled, appointment to meet with governors in Washington, his aides say. 
From the moment he took the job as party chairman, Perez has said he is more focused on beating Trump than expanding 'my holiday card list.' The party he inherited was a skeletal operation, gutted and demoralized after Clinton's 2016 loss and the scandal sparked by leaked internal party emails, which the intelligence community has blamed on the Russian government. 
Perez moved quickly to remake the nominating process, forcing more regulation of states that host caucuses, investing heavily in technology security efforts and eliminating any chance of a decisive vote by party insiders on the first ballot at the nominating convention, a concession to Sanders supporters who wanted the process to more directly reflect the popular vote.
At the start of the campaign, Sanders advisers repeatedly praised Perez, encouraging party leaders who are wary of the enormous funding advantages of the Republican National Committee, which has raised $194 million in the current election cycle compared with $76 million by the DNC, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
But that tone shifted in recent weeks, as Sanders surrogates, supporters and staff have criticized Perez for changing the debate rules and for the appointees he has placed on the various convention committees. 
Perez announced last month that he would allow candidates to make the debate stage in late February if they met either a polling threshold or won national party delegates in Iowa or New Hampshire. Perez dropped a requirement that forced candidates to attract thousands of grass-roots donors, which Bloomberg would not meet since he does not accept donations.
A former New York mayor, Bloomberg gave more than $1.5-million to the national and state parties in the final months of last year, according to federal election records. He so far has collected only one of the four 10-percent polls he needs to qualify for the Las Vegas debate Feb. 19.
Perez said the rule change was not made to benefit any single candidate. 
'Our job at every debate is to identify through the most relevant measures who are the most viable candidates who should be on the debate stage,' he said when asked why he dropped the donor requirement. 'The polling is now more probative because people are paying attention.' 
Sanders has been blunt in his condemnation of the move. 
'I think it is an outrage,' he told reporters Thursday. 'I guess if you're worth $55 billion, you can get the rules changed.'
One top Sanders aide warned that the rule change could hurt party enthusiasm. 
'The question is, are working people going to turn against the Democratic Party because there is a billionaire who is himself able to get on the debate stage because he got special treatment?' Sanders senior adviser Jeff Weaver said.
Biden also has joined in the criticism of Perez for changing the debate qualification rules in a way that could allow Bloomberg onto the stage.
'The rules seem to be changing a little bit,' he said at a Saturday campaign stop, noting that other candidates had tried to change them. 'If I'm Julián Castro or I'm a couple other guys "" they didn't change the rules to allow me to stay on the debate stage. But now the rules get change to put someone else on the debate stage?'
Other Democratic insiders have tried to paint the Sanders complaints as politically expedient. Along with other candidates, they say, the Sanders campaign supported a change to the debate rules in December that would have allowed candidates to qualify with either polling or donors, as part of an effort to allow Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) to join the Jan. 14 debate. That change, which Perez did not accept, would also have cleared the path for Bloomberg. 
The Sanders campaign was also alarmed when Perez decided last month to name his allotted appointments to the standing committees for the party's national nominating convention, set for this summer in Milwaukee. Previous party chairmen have made similar appointments, which make up a minority of the full committee membership. 
'The deck is stacked against fairness,' Turner said of the committee appointments. 'And not only stacked against Senator Sanders, but it's stacked against any candidate who is not entrenched in the elite section of the Democratic Party. And the sad thing about it is Chairman Perez knows this.' 
Weaver has tried to strike a less aggressive tone, saying that the Sanders campaign still believes Perez has tried to be evenhanded. 'Of course, given our experience, we are ever vigilant,' he said. 
Several national committee members were upset earlier this year when word spread that the budget committee had approved transition payments equal to four months' salary for Perez and his top deputies. The funds were intended to assure that Perez and his deputies had time to work with their successor in 2021, or this year if the party nominee calls for new leadership before the election.
'This is not a Tom thing. This is a business thing,' said Dan Halpern, budget committee chairman. 'This is an effort to make sure that the DNC is a going concern.' 
Perez and his team quickly distanced themselves from the effort. 
'One hundred percent of our resources are going toward beating Donald Trump,' said Xochitl Hinojosa, DNC communications director. 'DNC leadership will not accept any extra compensation recommended by the budget committee, which didn't operate at the direction of DNC leadership.'
The next logistical test for Perez will come Feb. 22, when Nevada Democrats hold the second major caucus of the process. The state party has scrapped plans to use a similar app to the one that performed so poorly in Iowa, but a computer system is still expected to be employed to collate early voting results. As in Iowa, the Nevada state party has primary responsibility over the process, Perez said.
'Our goal is we want to make sure that we have a caucus that is as low tech as humanly possible while still being efficient,' Perez said. 'We are working with them and we are coordinating with them.'
Sanders, meanwhile, has put a bit more of an anti-establishment edge on his speeches this weekend, perhaps aimed at the independent voters who can participate in the New Hampshire primary, many of whom are skeptical of Democratic Party leadership and other institutions.
'We're taking on not just the whole Republican political establishment,' Sanders said, 'we're taking on the Democratic establishment.' When Sanders said the Democratic establishment was getting nervous, the applause was louder.
Voters have increasingly brought up complaints about the national party on the campaign trail, especially at Sanders events. After the Iowa caucuses, Jared Saunders, 43, drove from Massachusetts to Derry, N.H., where he raised his anxieties with Sanders directly during a town hall meeting about the recent appointment of standing committee members. 
Sanders encouraged supporters to channel their nervous energy into voting for him. 
'What we can do right now is make sure we have the largest voter turnout in the history of New Hampshire,' he said, drawing applause from the crowd. 'The truth is that the nominee will have enormous power over those committees, okay?'
The candidate's response did not quell Saunders's concerns. 
'The DNC rigged it in 2016 and it's doing it again,' he said after the event.

The Democratic presidential race passed a point of no return Tuesday, with former vice president Joe Biden firmly in control of his party's nomination over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). But politics more broadly entered into the unknown as the spreading coronavirus continued to radically disrupt the political life of the country.
This combination of certainty and uncertainty was highlighted on a day when three states - Arizona, Florida and Illinois - held primaries and another - Ohio - that was scheduled to do so abruptly shut down its polling places for reasons of health safety. Nothing better described a new normal than the rapidly changing face of American politics in the age of a pandemic.
Voter turnout was up compared with 2016 in Florida and Arizona, thanks to lots of early voting, but down in Illinois, which had the lowest level of early voting of the three states - an indication of the impact of the virus on Election Day turnout. Postponements of coming primaries continued to mount, causing the nominating season to be extended into later in June. The final primaries now could come only weeks before the Democratic National Convention is scheduled to convene in Milwaukee - if it is held as planned.
Squabbles among state and local officials, some partisan and some territorial, highlighted the tensions facing all government leaders as they attempt to preserve the sacred process of voting amid fears that the traditional methods of casting ballots now endanger voters and poll workers alike.
Calls for easier access to early voting or voting by mail also mounted on primary day as officials looked ahead not only to scheduled primaries but also to the November election that will be conducted, based on what federal officials have said, without a vaccine in place to help protect people from the virus. Those discussions are only beginning and will intensify, sometimes with partisan overtones.

From the start of the nomination battle, March 17 - the day by which roughly 60 percent of all pledged delegates were to be allocated - was circled on the calendars of many strategists and campaign staffers as the day the contest could be settled and the party would know who its challenger would be to President Trump in November.
That turned out to be accurate. For all practical purposes, the contest between Biden and Sanders is over. Numerically, the former vice president is still well short of a majority of delegates needed to win a first-ballot victory. But the reality is that it would take a radical change in fortunes for Sanders to start winning primaries by the margins he would need to catch up to Biden, let alone overtake him to claim the nomination.
The results on Tuesday underscored for the third straight week that Democrats have consolidated rapidly around Biden's candidacy and that Sanders has struggled to do as well this year as he did against Hillary Clinton in 2016. Biden's victory margins in Florida and Illinois topped those of Clinton's in 2016, in large part because Sanders was getting a smaller share this time than last. The results provided Biden with another big haul of delegates and an ever-widening advantage over Sanders.
This presents Sanders with a decision point he no doubt would rather defer as long as possible. Will he carry on with his candidacy against overwhelming odds or yield to the numbers that both campaigns can calculate and suspend the campaign in the name of party unity and the goal of defeating Trump? 
Pressure will mount quickly for him to end his candidacy and give Biden and the Democratic Party the freedom to shift their entire focus to the general election. But as Sunday's debate illustrated, Sanders isn't ready to give up fighting for the policies he has championed in this campaign and his bid in 2016, and without some assurances, the decision will become all the more difficult.
The decision is complicated as Sanders ponders the impact of continuing or not continuing the movement he has spawned among grass-roots progressives. Sanders long has talked about his candidacy as symbolic of a movement to change the country, and he has energized various groups on the left. He has been the leader of that movement since his 2016 campaign.

Biden will not make demands of Sanders, but neither will he wait for a decision one way or the other from his last remaining serious rival. His campaign already has moved to general-election footing, albeit it under circumstances that bring new challenges to the candidate and his staff. But he is mindful of the need to bring along those Sanders supporters who will be bitterly disappointed that their candidate will not be the Democratic nominee.
Biden spoke to that need when he addressed the country in a live-stream presentation, saying that while he and Sanders might differ on tactics, they shared many of the same goals. ""Senator Sanders and his supporters have brought remarkable passion and tenacity to these issues, and together, they have shifted the fundamental conversation in the country,"" he said. ""And let me say, especially to the young voters who have been inspired by Senator Sanders: I hear you. I know what is at stake. And I know what we have to do.""
Biden entered Sunday's debate against Sanders hoping, if not certain, that the evening would be the beginning of a rapprochement between the two longtime Senate colleagues. Once they moved past a mostly civil discussion about responding to the coronavirus, the tenor of the debate was hardly what the Biden camp had hoped for or expected. Sanders was on the attack. Biden, who does not like being challenged, fought back, at times testily. 
That leaves Biden and his team with a delicate mission. As one campaign official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter candidly, put it, ""We're never going to let somebody distort Joe Biden's record. If [Sanders does so], we're going to push back on that. But the imperative of our campaign is to show Sanders's supporters that they have a home here. They're welcome as part of the Biden movement.""
The backdrop of Biden's speech on Tuesday night was a fresh illustration of how rapidly the pandemic is forcing campaigns to change behavior. Last week, celebrating his victories, he spoke from the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, with staff and some reporters present. On Tuesday night, he spoke from his home in Wilmington, Del., against a stark, darkened backdrop and two American flags.
Biden's speech from home, along with the poll workers wearing protective gloves and governors and mayors looking to change not just the dates of primaries but also the way people will be allowed to cast their ballots, represents the new state of politics that will exist for the foreseeable future. 
With widespread and extraordinary measures being implemented to lessen the deadly impact of the virus, disruptions expand by the day and, as Tuesday showed, into all facets of life. In his remarks, Biden made a reference to twin challenges now confronting the nation: protecting the health and safety of the people and protecting the democratic process at the same time - a test that no one was prepared for when the voting began less than two months ago.

Democrats press states to adopt alternatives to in-person voting
Elections officials and party leaders faced deepening dilemmas on Wednesday about how to carry out the most fundamental democratic exercise - voting - in the face of the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
Additional states delayed contests scheduled for the spring, while Democratic Party leaders stepped up their calls for states to adopt emergency measures to ensure access to the polls as officials pushed to limit the size of public gatherings.
 The Democratic National Committee and the Wisconsin Democratic Party sought a solution in federal court, suing Wisconsin elections commissioners to get an emergency judgment extending Wednesday's deadline to register to vote electronically and by mail and lifting requirements that absentee ballots be received by Election Day.
The national party is confronting vexing questions about its projected timeline for concluding the presidential nominating contest and putting forward a candidate at its July convention. While former vice president Joe Biden extended his dominant lead with wins in Tuesday's three primary races, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) declined to bow out of the race immediately.
The effort to develop voting contingencies took on new urgency as the three contests that unfolded on Tuesday showcased what experts described as unprecedented challenges involved in conducting in-person voting during a public-health emergency. 
The problems were most acute in Illinois, where voters arrived at some polling places to find no election judges to run the process or no hand sanitizer or wipes for use on voting machines. Suburban Cook County saw its lowest voter turnout in 12 years.
""The United States of America failed to live up to our democratic ideals when our primary election process broke down in a myriad of ways across several states,"" said Ken Martin, the chairman of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party as well as a DNC vice chairman and president of the Association of State Democratic Committees.
Martin urged all states to adopt emergency measures to ensure that voters do not lose access to the polls as a result of public-health precautions taken to slow the spread of the virus.
Across the country, state and local officials are wrestling with how to do that.
West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner said Wednesday that his office would ""ramp up"" absentee ballot opportunities for the state's May 12 primary, following an advisory opinion from the state's attorney general that alternative forms of balloting could be expanded during a state of emergency.
In Texas, where local elections are scheduled for May 2, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) suspended a provision of the state's election code to allow local governments to postpone those races. But questions loomed over a runoff contest in a Senate primary set for May 26, as the Texas Democratic Party urged the secretary of state's office to develop contingency plans to conduct the election entirely by mail.
""An all-mail election in which county election officials mail a ballot to every registered voter is the only realistic option that ensures meaningful participation in the elections while also protecting public health,"" the chair of the Texas Democratic Party, Gilberto Hinojosa, wrote Monday in a letter to Secretary of State Ruth R. Hughs. Her office did not respond to a request for comment. 
Texas requires that voters requesting to vote early by mail have an excuse, such as being 65 or older.
In Kansas, the state Democratic Party announced this week that it is automatically sending mail-in ballots to all registered Democrats in the state. Ballots will be mailed March 30 for the May 2 primary, which is run by the party rather than the state.
In Ohio, where Gov. Mike DeWine (R) ordered polling places closed on Tuesday, the state Democratic Party asked the state Supreme Court to intervene to ensure that eligible voters would have an adequate opportunity to cast ballots. The motion argued that Ohio's secretary of state, who envisioned the postponement of in-person voting until June 2, lacked the authority to set a new date for the primary without action by the legislature or a court. 
In addition to Ohio, four states have delayed their presidential primaries - Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana and Maryland - with others possibly following suit in the coming days. Additional states have delayed local, runoff and special elections or have moved to an all-mail system. 
Citing President Trump's warning against public gatherings of more than 10 people, Kay Ivey, Alabama's Republican governor, on Wednesday announced that a runoff Senate election pitting former senator Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) against former Auburn football coach Tommy Tuberville, originally scheduled for March 31, would be delayed to July 14. 
A resolution is moving forward in Puerto Rico to delay the presidential primary, originally scheduled for March 29, to April 26. It is expected to win the governor's signature by the end of the week. 
In Wisconsin, where the presidential primary is scheduled for April 7, the elections commission has been proceeding under the assumption that the date won't change, according to a spokesman, Reid Magney. The date of the primary is inscribed in state law.
The Democratic lawsuit argues that because of mounting coronavirus cases and a statewide ban on gatherings of more than 10 people, eligible voters could be discouraged from registering in person. 
It asks that online and mail-in registration be extended to April 3.
""As Wisconsin citizens continue to distance themselves to ensure their safety, many will be unwilling to risk their safety and the safety of others by waiting in line to register to vote and cast their vote on election day,"" the filing states. 
Magney declined to comment on the complaint. But at a meeting on Wednesday, commissioners said they lacked the authority to change deadlines and make other changes without legislation or intervention by a judge.

democrats spar on unity, electability 
Some in party fear contest pushed too far to the left 

CORALVILLE, Iowa "" Making last-minute pleas to an electorate that has remained widely undecided, the presidential candidates powered toward the end of a year-long Iowa caucuses campaign by focusing Sunday on vows of electability and Democratic Party unity even as they offered sharply different visions of what that meant.
On the final full day of campaigning here before Monday night's precinct caucuses, crowds overflowed school gymnasiums and campaign offices around the state as the candidates kept a brisk pace to make their final appeals. But it was also a day marked by upheaval and signs of discomfort among top party officials over whether Iowa's vote will push the presidential race too far to the left. 
On Sunday, even as Joe Biden's campaign aides worked to play down expectations and allies sought to cast doubt on rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (Vt.), an NBC News reporter overheard one of the former vice president's top surrogates, John F. Kerry, in a hotel lobby speculating over the idea that he would jump into the race. 
While the 2004 nominee later denied that he would run in 2020 "" 'I am absolutely not running for President,' the former secretary of state wrote on Twitter "" he did not directly deny the report that he had speculated about it, with NBC saying he cited as a motivating factor 'the possibility of Bernie Sanders taking down the Democratic Party "" down whole.'
It was, in some ways, a fitting cap to an unusual campaign in which Democrats, after the long campaign here, continue to grapple with which of their many options offers the best chance of defeating President Trump.
The top candidates offered conflicting views of how they would position the party to take on Trump. Biden and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg put forward a more centrist view, Sanders vowed to reshape the party in his liberal image, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.) presented herself as a unity candidate residing in the middle of those two camps.
As they made closing arguments to Iowa's voters, Biden and Buttigieg touted their ability to win voters in Republican-leaning districts as a sign they would have broader appeal in the general election. Buttigieg underscored that by citing at one of his last events his favorite Beatles song: 'Come Together.'
Sanders, whose brand of politics can border on uncompromising, made an overt appeal on Sunday to those who disagree with him and focused on the most unifying force coursing through the party: opposition to Trump. 
'No matter what your politics may be,' he told a crowd in Cedar Rapids, 'I think we all understand that that is not the kind of person who should remain in the White House.'
Strategists suggested that the other front-runners "" Biden, Buttigieg and Warren "" were chasing Sanders. But a Des Moines Register/CNN/Mediacom poll that might have added some clarity with its planned Saturday night release was canceled after technical problems.
Uncertainty and fear undergirded the campaign's final days. Some campaign aides worried that their candidate would be dealt a suffocating blow Monday night. And many voters and even some candidates said they were fearful about the party's divisions at the very moment they hoped Democrats would be energized.
'We better not screw this up,' Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) said Saturday night.
Democratic anxiety has only been enhanced as impeachment proceedings clouded the approach of the caucuses. Trump, who continued to hammer Democratic candidates Sunday on Twitter and in a pre-Super Bowl interview on Fox, is expected to be acquitted by the Senate on Wednesday after debate that begins Monday, further emboldening him with a message from Senate Republicans that they will stand behind him even if he requests political assistance from foreign governments. 
Impeachment has kept the senators who are running for president stuck in Washington for most of the past two weeks. Sanders, Warren and Klobuchar planned to return to the capital Sunday night, and hoped to make it back to Iowa Monday night to address supporters. Sen. Michael F. Bennet (Colo.), who has been campaigning in New Hampshire while most of his competitors were in Iowa, also planned to return to Washington late Sunday.
With a last day of campaigning that was unseasonably warm and sunny, candidates spread out to try to mobilize core supporters and convert as many undecided voters as they could. 
Buttigieg was greeted by a crowd of more than 2,000 in Des Moines. Biden, who can sometimes struggle to fill a room, saw standing-room-only audiences, with 1,100 at one event. Warren's staff had planned for roughly 350 people in Indianola, but more than three times that showed up "" with space so tight that her top campaign advisers were temporarily barred by the fire marshal from entering. 
Warren urged voters not to be afraid to vote for her and her agenda. After three years of the Trump presidency, she acknowledged, fear is prevalent among Democrats. 
'The danger is real,' Warren said to the crowd. 'Our democracy hangs in the balance. And at this moment, you will decide here in Iowa, what do we do? Do we pull back? Do we cower? Do we take the timid approach?' Warren said, drawing an implicit contrast between herself and more-moderate candidates in the race.
'Or do we fight back?' Warren continued. 'Me? I am in this to fight back. That's why I'm here. We fight back. Fighting back is an act of patriotism.'
Sanders skipped across the state, calling for sweeping change.
He framed Monday's caucuses as the start of the 'most consequential election, at least in the modern history of America.' He said his campaign was about beating Trump in November and 'bringing fundamental reform to American society.'
Sanders stopped at campaign offices in three cities, giving abbreviated stump speeches to supporters preparing to canvass for him. It was a change of pace from the large rallies he has held in recent weeks, including a concert that drew an estimated 3,000 people Saturday night. He said the time had ended for simply expressing concerns about income inequality, health care and the environment.
'Now is the time to end the complaining. Now is the time for action. Action is tomorrow night,' Sanders said.
Sanders's efforts to pressure Democrats to coalesce behind him have been made more complicated after some prominent supporters aggressively attacked some Democrats.
In Cedar Rapids on Saturday night, liberal filmmaker Michael Moore, who introduced Sanders at events across Iowa in recent days, took sharp aim at the Democratic National Committee, accusing its leaders of conspiring against Sanders and trying to boost former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg by changing qualifications for future debates.
'They did this because they are so nervous and worried about Bernie,' Moore alleged. A Sanders campaign spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said Moore's assertion was 'totally false.' She added, 'This is a conspiracy theory.'
Buttigieg began the day on a stage where he was introduced by Iowa City Mayor Bruce Teague, who had previously backed Sen. Cory Booker before the New Jersey Democrat dropped out of the race. He made a pointed reference to criticisms of Buttigieg's difficulty attracting nonwhite voters.
'I don't know if you've noticed,' Teague said. 'But I'm black.'
Buttigieg has grown more animated and more emotive of late and his crowds, generally politely supportive, have become more raucous. 
His campaign touted the 27 counties that voted for Barack Obama and Trump as evidence of his effort to reach more than just true-blue Democrats. He suggested that 'a massive American majority' agrees on things like gun background checks or dealing with climate change, and suggested he is the candidate best equipped to activate it. 
Two voters at the Coralville event told him they are Republicans voting for a Democrat for the first time. 
'I'm not trying to trick anybody into thinking I'm more conservative than I am,' Buttigieg said Sunday, in a response to a different voter who asked how he plans to persuade Republicans. 'I can't say that we will agree 100 percent of the time, but I promise we will navigate those differences with respect and that everyone will be heard.'
When a voter told Buttigieg she was planning to vote for a Democrat for the first time and wondered why she should vote for him over Biden, Buttigieg said he was offering 'just a different approach.'
'Every single time my party has won the White House in the last 50 years, we have done it with a candidate who is new in national politics, who is opening a door to a new generation of leadership, and who either doesn't work in Washington or hasn't been there very long,' he said. 'That is how we win.'
Biden began the day courting voters in eastern Iowa, attempting to rally a crowd at a Catholic university by saying he was the candidate with not only the most widespread appeal but the one with the experience to unite a divided nation once in office. 
'We have to unite not only the Democratic Party,' Biden told a standing-room-only crowd in Dubuque. 'We have to unite the country. It's the only way we're going to be able to govern. We have to pull the country together, Democrats, independents, and Republicans. I refuse to accept the notion that we're at war with the Republican Party.' 
That bipartisan appeal, though, was tested later in the day when Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) raised the prospect that Republicans could attempt to impeach Biden because of the work his son did in Ukraine while Biden was vice president. 
'I think this door of impeachable whatever has been opened,' Ernst said in an interview with Bloomberg News. 'Joe Biden should be very careful what he's asking for because, you know, we can have a situation where if it should ever be President Biden, that immediately, people, right the day after he would be elected would be saying, 'Well, we're going to impeach him.' '
Earlier in the day, some of Biden's top advisers sought to play down any results in Iowa, arguing that the impact of a loss for him would be limited and suggesting voters consider the results of the first four states "" not just the first.
'We've never said that we were going to run away with it. We've always said that this would be a fight, this would be a close race,' Symone Sanders, a senior adviser, said during a breakfast with reporters hosted by Bloomberg News. 'We ain't shocked.'
Biden advisers also attempted a difficult task: casting the former vice president, who has led in most national polls throughout the race, as the underdog.
'Since before vice president Biden got into this race "" since before April 25 "" people have been writing our campaign's obituary,' Sanders said, adding that they remained confident. 'Tuesday morning will be no different.'
Former senator Christopher Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who has been campaigning with Biden, also sought to raise alarms about what a Sanders victory would mean to the party's chances. 
'Bernie describes himself as a socialist "" certainly the president will have a field day with that argument,' Dodd said. 'Bernie would have a very difficult time winning the election in November as our national candidate.'
He said Sanders would be unable to campaign with many Democrats and would 'pose a serious threat' to the House majority. 
'I hope no one is offended by that,' Dodd said. 'That's just the reality.'

With polls close, he hopes to woo moderates "" and some Republicans

DES MOINES "" A year ago, then-South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg took his first trip to Iowa as a presidential candidate. He had barely any staff, so he piled in a car with his husband and a couple of early hires to drive the 400 miles west.
Now, with just weeks until the caucuses, Buttigieg's Iowa staff numbers in the hundreds, along with scores of volunteers eager to knock on doors and phone-bank. He regularly draws big crowds. And his fundraising haul has enabled him to blanket the state with TV ads touting him as the candidate who can bring the country together after President Trump.
Still, it is far from clear he will be able to turn his momentum into a win on caucus night. A recent Des Moines Register poll showed Buttigieg in a near-tie with former vice president Joe Biden and Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.). Voters "" even those who like him "" are worried about his inexperience, electability and struggles with black voters.
In this unusually fluid race, with a high number of undecided voters, Buttigieg acknowledges that he needs an Iowa win to prove he can win nationally. Foreign policy has abruptly vaulted to the forefront of voters' concerns, and Buttigieg has less of a clear fallback than some of his rivals should he stumble in the caucuses.
'Iowa is very important because it's our opportunity to demonstrate our strength to a lot of voters I think are very pragmatic "" in places like South Carolina and Nevada "" who above all want to see a candidate who can win,' Buttigieg said Saturday in Las Vegas.
To try to bring home a victory, Buttigieg is sweeping across Iowa this week, making at least 12 town-hall stops, including 10 in counties Trump carried in 2016. The campaign prioritized red and purple counties in two trips through Iowa in late December, too.
It is part of his strategy to pitch himself as a moderate who would not alienate conservatives, even as he argues his proposals would make him the most progressive president in recent memory.
The message he has delivered in Iowa lately makes clear overtures to disgruntled Republicans "" or what he calls 'future former Republicans' "" whom he argues he can attract. He suggests he will be able to build bipartisan consensus. And he, more than any candidate in the field, suggests that Republicans have co-opted faith, arguing that religious Americans can find a like-minded leader in him.
There are signs that moderates are responding to that message. Longtime Iowa Democratic Party activist Terri Hale, who endorsed Buttigieg last summer and calls him 'a realistic progressive,' recently planned a small meet-and-greet for Buttigieg at her home near Des Moines.
She invited only undecided and Republican acquaintances, to try to sell them on her candidate. 'We ended up having to move it to a bigger place because we had about 170 people,' Hale said. 'Not everybody there was an undecided or Republican, but I know a few Republicans for sure who are going to caucus for Democrats because of Pete who were there.'
The campaign is also doubling down on its robust organizing operation in the final weeks before the vote. Though Buttigieg started far behind his Democratic rivals in building a ground game "" waiting until around Labor Day to begin opening field offices "" he has now assembled one of the largest operations in the state.
According to several Democratic county chairs, Buttigieg's operation is second only to Warren's. 'When you see a Warren organizer, a Buttigieg organizer usually isn't far behind,' said one Democratic county chair, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to give a candid assessment of the race.
But that may not be enough. In recent weeks, some county chairs have sensed shifting feelings about Buttigieg.
Voters who had been leaning toward or even committed to him have reported new anxiety, raising questions about his age, his lack of Washington experience and his struggle to win over minority voters.
'I honestly think he peaked a little bit too early, unfortunately, and people are kind of having buyer's remorse,' the Democratic county chair said of Buttigieg. 'The second-guessing is starting. I think a big part of it is foreign policy, which is now becoming a huge issue in this election, which none of us expected. And that does play to Joe Biden's strength, and in many ways they are in the same lane.'
While Buttigieg seemed to benefit in the fall from heavy spending on television, he has lost that advantage. In recent weeks, his ads have been matched almost one-to-one by Biden spots, including a new ad emphasizing Biden's foreign policy experience against the backdrop of recent tensions with Iran.
Interviews with undecided voters at candidate events in recent days suggest there is still a lot of goodwill for Buttigieg and that he remains in consideration. But many still are not convinced.
'He's too young,' said Lynn Muhs, 67, an undecided voter from Newton, Iowa. She spoke after attending a Sanders rally Saturday as part an effort to see all the candidates in person before making a final decision on whom to support.
She praised Buttigieg as a 'good talker, a good speaker,' but she worried about his lack of Washington experience. In the past, she said, she thought an outsider might have been good. But she looks at that question differently considering Trump. Whoever follows Trump, she said, needs to be able to restore order.
'I could imagine him as someone who could win later down the road, but . . . he doesn't have the background and he doesn't have the experience, not in federal government anyway,' Muhs said. 'Being a small-town mayor, I mean, even if he were a large-town mayor, to me that is still not the same thing. You need that experience.'
To combat those worries, Buttigieg and his team are encouraging their volunteers to reach out to their friends and neighbors. The campaign flew its national caucus director, Travis Brock, to conduct some trainings in person. Buttigieg organizers are teaching precinct captains how to build 'empathetic bridges' to supporters of other campaigns in the hopes of bolstering their ranks on caucus night.
At a recent precinct captain training in Ankeny, north of Des Moines, a Buttigieg staffer reminded the 90 people gathered not to take an Iowa win for granted. One slide from a PowerPoint presentation showed a list of polls from this point in the 2004 Democratic election, when Howard Dean was leading. John F. Kerry went on to win Iowa, a surprise comeback that helped him clinch the Democratic presidential nomination.
'They were dating Howard Dean, and they married John Kerry,' Shannon Sankey, a Buttigieg organizer overseeing Ankeny, told the group. The race now, she said, is just as fluid. 'The polls are always lying to us,' she said. 'You never want to believe a poll, because it's always changing.'
Around the room, volunteers, many wearing navy-and-gold Buttigieg campaign pins, grew serious. Their game faces were on.
'We're focusing on persuasion and mobilization,' said Matt McCoy, a former state senator and early Buttigieg endorser who is involved in Buttigieg's Iowa 'kitchen cabinet,' a regular strategy meeting of staffers and other campaign members.
McCoy said the campaign still sees plenty of time to change minds. His preferred candidate agrees.
'What we're seeing is everything from voters who have been coming out to events for a year and are narrowing down their choices to people who are just now tuning in,' Buttigieg said Saturday. 'The message won't change, because my values haven't changed. But you will see us continuing to build toward a closing argument that really brings home why I'm the best nominee to defeat Donald Trump and why I'd be the best president.'

The 2020 presidential campaign began more than a year ago, and it has been a whirlwind of Democratic town halls, kaffeeklatsches, candidate debates, fundraising appeals, Twitter spats and nonstop punditry "" all competing for attention against the overriding presence of President Trump. What still lies ahead could be a political season like none other.
After all the 2019 preliminaries, voters will finally begin to speak in Iowa on Monday night at that state's precinct caucuses. New Hampshire's primary will come eight days later, followed in February by caucuses in Nevada and a primary in South Carolina. 
From there, the contest for the Democratic nomination will immediately fan out across the country in a rapid series of primaries and caucuses that could make clear by the end of March the identity of the likely Democratic nominee "" or foreshadow a potentially wrenching fight among two or more candidates all the way to July's national convention in Milwaukee.
Whenever the Democrats finally settle on their nominee, that person will enter a general-election contest that Trump and his reelection campaign have been waging almost from the time the president took the oath of office three years ago. The Trump machine is likely to be the best-funded in history and, by the assessment of some Democratic strategists, might be the most sophisticated presidential campaign operation they have encountered.
 The Nov. 3 general election is seen by many voters, regardless of their party allegiance or ideology, as the most important in their lifetimes. Trump's presidency has been one of controversy and division from the very beginning, one that has further polarized an already divided country. 
All reelection campaigns are judgments on the incumbent, but this year's stands as one in which strong passions about the president, pro and con, and assessments of what his presidency means for the future override almost everything else "" the economy being one wild card "" in determining how people will vote.
Campaign 2020 is unique in many ways: the number of candidates who have sought the Democratic nomination; the increasing reliance on small-dollar donations from grass-roots activists; a primary calendar that gives no pause for candidates until the end of March; a general election that could have fewer true battlegrounds than ever. What makes this year different, Democratic media strategist Jim Margolis said, is that 'everything is on amphetamines.'
The year also will mark the first time in the nation's history that an impeached president will be seeking reelection, assuming the Senate acquits Trump at the end of the trial now underway. Twice before, presidents have been impeached but not convicted: Andrew Johnson in 1868 and Bill Clinton in 1998. Neither was on the presidential ballot in the subsequent general election. Trump will be the first to try to convert the stain of impeachment into a political asset to win a second term.
Democrats hope that the desire to drive Trump from office will become the salve that repairs any lingering wounds after their nomination contest. Right now, however, there is little time to ponder that, as the candidates and campaigns are almost singularly focused on one another and on winning the nomination.




The early states
Iowa and New Hampshire kick off the year amid recurring controversy over the role those two small and predominantly white states play in the selection of presidential nominees. That debate will continue well beyond this election year. For now, the candidates know that the calendar is fixed and that the results Monday in Iowa and Feb. 11 in New Hampshire will shape everything going forward.
The last four Democratic winners of the Iowa caucuses "" Al Gore in 2000, John F. Kerry in 2004, Barack Obama in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016 "" all went on to win the nomination. Since 1976, there have been only two cases when the Democrat who led at the caucuses did not become the Democratic nominee, the last occurring in 1992 when no one competed against favorite-son Tom Harkin. That is why the record-large field of Democratic candidates has spent so much time, money and organizing effort focused on turning out what will be a fraction of Iowa's population.
The biggest turnout for the Democratic caucuses in Iowa was 240,000 in 2008, when Obama and Clinton (and others) waged an epic battle. Many Democratic strategists believe this year's turnout will eclipse that record. They base that assumption on the number of well-organized campaigns actively working to get people out on caucus night as well as the perceptible enthusiasm and energy among Democrats, who turned out in big numbers in the 2018 midterm elections and have swamped presidential candidate events since early 2019.
New Hampshire's role is equally important. Since the start of the modern primary in 1952, only three candidates of either party have lost the New Hampshire contest and gone on to win the presidency that same year: Bill Clinton in 1992, George W. Bush in 2000 and Obama in 2008. 

William M. Gardner, the longtime secretary of state and the guardian of New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary status, noted that the election there is about more than winning: A weak finish can be crippling. No candidate of either party who has finished below second in New Hampshire has won the presidency that year. And since 1972, no candidate of either party has finished lower than second and ended up as the nominee.

Today there are at least four Democrats who believe they could finish in one of the top two slots in both states. Former vice president Joe Biden, who finished far behind Obama and Clinton in Iowa in 2008, is one. The others are Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who narrowly lost to Clinton in Iowa in 2016 and who ran away with the New Hampshire primary the following week; Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.); and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg.
The Washington Post's average of state polls shows Biden and Sanders virtually tied in Iowa and Sanders leading Biden and the others by a few points in New Hampshire.
In Iowa, each of the four top candidates has led in one or another version of the highly regarded Iowa Poll, conducted by J. Ann Selzer for CNN, the Des Moines Register and Mediacom over the past half-year. The final Iowa Poll will be released Saturday night. 
Biden, Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg aren't the only ones working to gain a foothold in Iowa. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) is looking for a surprise finish to give her candidacy the jolt it needs to go forward. Andrew Yang, the entrepreneur turned candidate, has been stumping the state this month with his own hopes riding on what happens. Investor Tom Steyer is campaigning hard on the issue of climate change. Former congressman John Delaney of Maryland has spent more time in Iowa than other candidates, so far to little impact with voters.
Iowa's caucus rules can skew the support that candidates end up with on caucus night. Candidates who do not reach a 15 percent threshold of support in any precinct get nothing to show for it, their backers freed to shift their votes to someone else. 
The result reported by the Iowa Democratic Party reflects that realignment. In the vernacular of Iowa Democrats, the final results will be percentages of 'state delegate equivalents,' or SDEs.
But the state party also plans to report two other numbers: the percentage of supporters who show up for each candidate and the percentage of supporters for each candidate after the final vote. 
The three-part reporting raises the prospect of a free-for-all in which multiple candidates seek to gain ground by seizing on whichever numbers give them the best talking points.

New Hampshire's rules are straightforward: The candidate with the most votes wins. But the state's substantial cadre of independent voters is free to participate in the Democratic primary, and the makeup of the electorate will be influenced by how many do so. 
Tad Devine, a Democratic strategist who worked for Sanders in 2016 and now is working for Yang, predicted that Sanders victories in the first two states would open an intraparty battle. 'If he wins Iowa and New Hampshire, the lines are going to be drawn between the progressive wing and the establishment,' Devine said. 
The votes by Nevada Democrats on Feb. 22, and by South Carolina Democrats on Feb. 29, will mark the first time nonwhite voters will play substantial roles "" Latinos in the western state and African Americans in the east. The latter vote will take place only three days before the Super Tuesday contests deliver the single biggest haul of delegates.
'I think South Carolina matters so much more than it ever has,' said Jen O'Malley Dillon, who was campaign manager for former congressman Beto O'Rourke of Texas before he dropped out of the race and who was deputy campaign manager for Obama in 2012. 'In part because of this short timeline but also because of the way we've built this cycle with the question of who has the support of the Obama coalition. That carries much more weight than it ever has.'

The second wave
Winning the Democratic nomination on the first ballot in Milwaukee will require amassing 1,991 pledged delegates. A second-ballot fight would open the contest to roughly 771 superdelegates "" party leaders and elected officials "" and the winner would then need a majority of the total pledged and superdelegates, according to Democratic National Committee officials. 
The first four states on the calendar account for 155 pledged delegates, or 4 percent of the total that will be selected through June. Super Tuesday on March 3 will see primaries or caucuses in 14 states, including California and Texas, and other locations. On that single day, candidates will be competing for 1,357 delegates, or 34 percent of the 3,979 pledged delegates at stake.
That means beginning March 3, the campaign will shift from its opening stages, when building momentum is the goal, to the period when accumulating delegates claims overriding importance. 
Sanders's goal is to win Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada, aiming to ride into Super Tuesday as the leading candidate and then to position himself as the front-runner. Faiz Shakir, Sanders's campaign manager, said that, if they're successful in the early states, 'getting into California and Texas and putting ourselves into position to expand our delegate lead would be crucial.' 
Biden's team has said he can afford to lose Iowa and possibly New Hampshire, and recoup in South Carolina, where he continues to enjoy strong support from black voters. 'We knew that the strength of our campaign is the diversity of our support,' said Greg Schultz, Biden's campaign manager. 'No matter what happens in the first two, it's not until Nevada, South Carolina and Super Tuesday that the country as a whole is represented. We have built our campaign for that.'
Buttigieg's team knows he must do exceedingly well in Iowa to demonstrate that a young, gay former mayor of a fairly small city can truly be a competitive candidate for the presidency. 'We really are counting on the mayor doing well in the first two contests,' said Mike Schmuhl, Buttigieg's campaign manager, 'to show that he can beat other people and to buttress our electability argument and also our change argument, that people are looking for something different.'
Like Biden, Warren has signaled she is looking to play a long game, though she cannot afford to fall far behind in the earliest states. Her campaign is betting that the results in the first four states will be enough of a muddle to set up the March primaries as a possible showdown. 'We think Super Tuesday and all the March states as a whole are important,' said Kristen Orthman, Warren's communications director. 'We've allocated resources as such basically throughout the year.' 
She added that the campaign began building operations in Super Tuesday states many months ago and that Warren has visited every state voting March 3, with the exception of Maine and Vermont, both adjacent to Massachusetts, and Arkansas. 'That wasn't by accident,' she said.

Super Tuesday also will be the first day that Mike Bloomberg, the former New York mayor, will be on ballots. Bloomberg is skipping the first four contests, a strategy no successful candidate has pursued in the modern era. He has already dropped more than a quarter of a billion dollars into television ads and organizing in Super Tuesday states and has the capacity to do what no other candidate can afford to do to reach voters.
But Bloomberg's hopes of becoming competitive rest almost entirely on whether, after the first four contests, Biden is doing well or gasping for support, and if any other moderate "" Buttigieg or Klobuchar, for example "" has swept into contention.
'It may be that what we have seen since 1976 largely repeats itself, that these two contests [Iowa and New Hampshire] help pick who will go on and win the nomination,' said Kevin Sheekey, Bloomberg's campaign manager. 'Or this may be a very different kind of year. At least one candidate is running a nominal test of running a national campaign.'
The sprawling nature of the Super Tuesday competition and the lack of time for any campaign besides Bloomberg's to invest broadly will require candidates to make difficult choices about where they spend time and money. 'The whole exercise is targeting resources,' said Robby Mook, who was the 2016 Clinton campaign manager. 'You cannot do everything.'
Past years have given candidates some time to regroup after the first primaries and to campaign in the swath of states that follow. Not this year. There are just three days between the last of the initial four elections and the Super Tuesday contests, meaning the winner of South Carolina will have an edge in media coverage.
 'A win in South Carolina is the last thing people are going to hear before Super Tuesday,' said Lily Adams, who was communications director for the campaign of Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), who dropped out in December. 
The pace doesn't slow after Super Tuesday. The next two Tuesdays will account for an additional 23 percent of the delegates available; the surviving candidates will have to run a gantlet of big states like Michigan, Illinois, Florida, Ohio and Arizona. By the end of March 17, 61 percent of the pledged delegates will have been selected.
'March 3 to March 17 is as brutal a thing as we've seen in presidential politics, with big states, all the time zones and territories,' said David Plouffe, Obama's 2008 campaign manager, who helped guide the 2012 reelection from a perch in the White House. 'I can't describe how different running that race is from the race they're running now.'

The delegate battle
Except in Texas, which apportions party delegates by state Senate district, most delegates are determined proportionally by results in congressional districts, with the remainder awarded to the statewide winner. This arithmetic of allocation means it can be difficult for a candidate to gain a significant advantage "" and even more difficult for a trailing candidate to catch up or overtake the leader. 
That makes delegate hunting a complex matrix that requires campaigns to know the demographics of every district in the country and how they match up with the appeal of their candidate. Most important, it requires decisions about where it's worth competing hard and where it isn't. 
Under the party's proportional rules, some districts award an even number of delegates and others award an odd number. In those with an even number, gaining a split is relatively easy "" while winning an advantage requires blowing away the competition. In odd-number districts, a narrow victory can produce an extra delegate.
Moreover, districts where Democrats get their highest percentages in presidential races have extra delegates to award. Many of these have a high proportion of minority voters, especially African Americans. That was a strength for Clinton against Sanders in 2016 and could be valuable to Biden if he holds on to strong support from black Democratic voters.
Insurgent or inspirational candidates, like Obama in 2008 and Sanders in 2016, took advantage of the many caucuses on the calendar to add to their delegate counts. Caucuses tend to draw more energized party activists, even as they disenfranchise voters who are not able to attend at the time they are held. This year, however, the DNC "" with the assent of Sanders's representatives "" cut the number of states with caucuses from 14 to seven.

'Every campaign will look at what are their strengths demographically and regionally, and try to put together a profile of where they will do well by state and by congressional district,' said Jeff Berman, who helped craft Obama's successful delegate strategy in 2008. 
Berman added that campaigns must look for opportunities to win states 'so their candidate appears on the election night results chart as a winner in multiple states.' Still, the race remains all about winning delegates.
In recent campaigns, the early election night commentary focused on a candidate's wins in premier states, but when the delegates from all the contests that night were counted, a different picture emerged. One night in 2016, for example, Clinton netted far more delegates from her less-noticed win in Mississippi than Sanders did in his high-profile victory in Michigan.
Several candidates are likely to have the resources to continue their campaigns well into the spring and, potentially, all the way to the July convention. The big question is whether there will be a protracted fight, even if one candidate has a clear, if modest, delegate lead by the end of the March contests.
'After the first four [states] and out of Super Tuesday, I think you'll begin to see some clarity emerging in the delegate advantage and other advantages,' said Michael Donilon, one of Biden's senior advisers. 'And I think there will be a force that exerts itself, that voters will want to move toward a resolution and not leave this open-ended for a long time.'
Yet even if there is some clarity about a likely nominee there's no guarantee that the leader will have the 1,991 delegates needed to win on a first ballot wrapped up by the end of the primaries. Would the hundreds of superdelegates who could vote on a second ballot turn to someone other than the delegate leader? That's a particularly pertinent issue for someone like Sanders, whose possible nomination causes angst among the establishment Democrats who dominate that category. 
'That is the path we are trying to avoid,' said his campaign manager, Shakir. 'The goal is to win Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, sweep into Super Tuesday and crush it. That has dictated every spending decision, resource decision of this campaign.'


Trump and the general election

As Democrats wage their contest, Trump's campaign will be operating on a separate track, free from any serious challenge for the nomination and focused on the general election. But he will be in the faces of the Democrats at every opportunity, whether through Twitter commentary on his potential rivals or with state-by-state rallies. 
He will be on the caucus ballot in Iowa the same night the Democrats hold their caucuses, and he held a rally in Des Moines Thursday "" days before the vote. Another rally is set for Manchester the night before the New Hampshire primary.
Trump has challengers for the nomination "" among them former Massachusetts governor Bill Weld and former congressman Joe Walsh of Illinois "" but his grip on the Republican Party is so strong that he is free to ignore them. The GOP is helping to assure that; a number of states have either scrapped their primaries or given more control to state party leaders to allocate convention delegates.
Through the end of last year, the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee raised half a billion dollars, and they began the election year with $200 million in the bank. Collectively, Democrats contributed $1 billion to candidates and organizations through online donations, but whoever becomes the Democratic nominee, with the exception of Bloomberg, is likely to begin the general election cash-strapped by comparison with the president. 

Trump's operation has been building and building, identifying the voters it believes will determine the outcome in November in the states Trump must win to assemble another electoral college majority. 'Time is one of the great advantages the president's reelection campaign has enjoyed, and we have not squandered it,' Tim Murtaugh, the campaign's communications director, said in an email message.
Murtaugh reiterated that the reelection operation will target not only the swing states Trump won narrowly but other states that Democrats captured four years ago, where the president's team hopes to put them on the defensive. Pointing to the financial disparity between Trump's campaign and that of the likely Democratic nominee, he added, 'The Democrats will not be able to match the president in resources or organization.'
In many of those states, there has been minimal to no Democratic presence yet. Bloomberg's hefty advertising campaign is beginning to compensate in some of the most important general-election battlegrounds. The billionaire ex-mayor is setting up field offices in those states and has promised to keep them open until November, even if he isn't the nominee.
'It has become clearer to me how strong Trump is in the . . . swing states and how much work he has done,' said Bloomberg's campaign manager, Sheekey. 'The more time I spend in Wisconsin or Michigan or North Carolina, the more I realize how difficult those states are going to be to win.'
Trump also will start with the advantage of a more sophisticated understanding of which voters he needs beyond his core supporters to win a general election. His campaign already is testing various messages on many issues. 
The Democratic nominee will start well behind on that front, relying instead on any organic Trump opposition to help narrow the margin. Plouffe recalled that after Obama won the nomination in 2008, and after campaigning in every state, it was like starting over to attract a new set of voters. 
'The voters who make the difference don't know you,' he said. 'Yeah, you've got staff and volunteers, but you're not talking to voters who will be front and center in the general election.'
That will be the challenge for whoever becomes the Democratic nominee. But that is at least several months into the future, and only after the biggest field in the history of the Democratic Party is narrowed to the last person standing.

Journalist
on the lousy options for campaign cybersecurity
The tech company Cloudflare announced Jan. 15 that it would now provide cybersecurity resources to political campaigns for free. That news might not seem like it has anything to do with the impeachment drama unfolding on Capitol Hill. Yet both events stem from the same core problem: As president, Donald Trump has failed at his most basic responsibility to protect the 2020 elections from foreign attacks and interference. 
-The desperate need for better campaign cybersecurity should be clear just from the past few weeks, if it wasn't already, after reports that Russian hackers were digging around Ukrainian computer servers, possibly searching for dirt on Joe Biden, and that Pete Buttigieg's chief information security officer "" the only known, dedicated cybersecurity staffer in the entire Democratic field "" had departed, replaced only by an outside contractor.-
And yet, even with growing evidence of systemic vulnerabilities to foreign interference four years after Russia's unprecedented, expensive and expansive attack on the 2016 election, we're still relying on a patchwork of nonprofit and private companies to pitch in and protect us. Despite lots of words from well-meaning officials at the Department of Homeland Security, the Justice Department and the FBI, election security remains woefully undermanned and underfunded; former homeland security secretary Kirstjen Nielsen was reportedly told not to bring up the issue with the president, on the advice of acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who allegedly told her that it 'wasn't a great subject.'-
In the face of such high-level inaction and willful blindness, the fact that we need companies like Cloudflare to help defend candidates is a failure. Protecting our democracy shouldn't be the responsibility of civic-minded businesses. We strictly limit corporate involvement in other areas of campaigns: We wouldn't allow Blackwater to 'donate' protective details to candidates, nor would we let Chase 'donate' banking services. Boeing,-Lockheed Martin and Chevrolet aren't allowed to donate special planes, helicopters or armored vehicles to help keep candidates safe as they move about the country. 
But after lobbying, the Federal Election Commission changed its rules last year to permit campaigns and candidates to accept discounted cybersecurity services. And no one seems troubled that cybersecurity companies will be able to develop special relationships with campaigns, as candidates entrust their biggest secrets to private firms with policy interests in how the winners will govern.
None of this is meant to slight Cloudflare or to impugn its motives; it's a great company and a critical part of the Internet ecosystem, and I'm friends with some of the firm's leaders. But the fact is that Cloudflare and other companies, including Microsoft, Wickr, Area 1 and Cybrary, needed to step up, and the FEC had to create special rules, because the U.S. government and the political parties are refusing "" and don't know how "" to do what's necessary to protect candidates and campaigns.-

Easy solutions are rarely as simple as they seem. Some suggest that the Secret Service "" which, thanks to its mission of fighting financial crimes, has amazing expertise in cybersecurity "" should protect presidential campaigns from hackers, just as it safeguards the top candidates themselves. But the Trump administration's extreme politicization of the Department of Homeland Security surely would make Democratic campaigns wary of accepting such help and granting the deep, unfettered access to email and networks that the Secret Service would need to provide digital protection. And it's not clear how wide a net the perennially underfunded and overworked agency could or should throw around a campaign: Does it protect only the candidate, only an inner circle, or should every Iowa volunteer be surrounded by a digital security blanket?-
On Capitol Hill, where the sergeants-at-arms of the House and the Senate are responsible for protecting the IT networks of lawmakers, well-meaning campaign finance rules legally prevent those officials from helping members of Congress secure their personal cellphones, email accounts or campaign networks "" even though such accounts are probably the most valuable targets for hackers. Those same rules require legislators to maintain separate phones and email for official business and campaign business, all but guaranteeing that sensitive conversations occur on nonofficial accounts. When he was in the House, Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) included his Gmail address on his business cards, and it was, after all, John Podesta's personal Gmail account, not a campaign account, that was targeted by Russia in 2016. 
The Democratic and Republican national committees, or their respective House and Senate campaign arms, could offer centralized cybersecurity resources. But recent Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee policy changes aim to limit primary challengers' access to such resources, meaning someone like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who challenged a Democratic incumbent, would have been cut off until at least after winning a primary contest, potentially leaving campaigns on their own until weeks before the general election. Advanced hackers often spend weeks or even months probing a system "" and it can take an expert adversary like Russia just 19 minutes to break in. So that security would almost certainly come too late.-
Leaving cybersecurity choices to individual candidates and campaigns, which are often technically unsophisticated and strapped for cash, doesn't seem like the best answer when we're trying to protect the cornerstones of our elections from well-resourced threats by nation-state adversaries. Besides, many candidates don't really understand the threats or the necessary defenses. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), in a New York Times interview published this month, made clear he's not a typical digital citizen of the 21st century; he said he doesn't have any apps on his phone and didn't appear to know what two-factor authentication is. Instead, as he explained, he relies entirely on a woman in his office named Melissa to know what to do security-wise. Is his campaign prepared to deal with Russian incursions?-
The best security exists at the beginning and continues forever, but most campaigns "" particularly new ones "" start on a shoestring. It's hard to imagine using scarce dollars to fund bulletproof cybersecurity when candidates might not make it far enough for the investment to pay off. Similarly, campaign infrastructure mostly disappears after Election Day, yet the threat remains just as real; documents stolen from email accounts or file servers in odd-numbered years can be held and released closer to elections. And as 'digital natives' begin to run for office, people who have lived their entire adult lives with the same Facebook account, the same Gmail account, the same iCloud account may find that those are treasure troves for hackers seeking blackmail or embarrassment. (Former congresswoman Katie Hill will surely not be the last officeholder to face a 'revenge porn' scandal, either from a formerly trusted partner or a nation-state hacker.)-

These individual complications and competing agendas make clear that the best cybersecurity isn't done campaign by campaign, but instead is focused on overall deterrence. We need the federal government, starting with the president, to take the strongest possible stance "" in the strongest possible language "" to make clear to all adversaries that U.S. elections, candidates and campaigns are off-limits. The Trump administration has failed to do this. And in fact, Trump has done the opposite. A key factor in the impeachment proceedings is his call, on the White House lawn last year, for Ukraine and China to investigate Joe and Hunter Biden "" making clear that he's fine with foreign governments meddling in domestic politics. 
If Ukraine, Russia or China helped dig up dirt on his opponents, Trump would love it. Such foreign interference seems to be an important part of his reelection strategy. This active betrayal of democracy should chill Democrats and Republicans alike. As I've argued in the past, the GOP's willingness to tolerate Trump's inaction is confounding, in part because there's no guarantee that the next nation to attack our democracy will side with Trump or the Republicans. In light of the president's policy toward Iran, for instance, it seems likely that the Islamic republic's accomplished hackers might prefer to help his opponent win. Similarly, China's Ministry of State Security is surely considering that one easy path out of the trade war Trump started would be for a Democrat to win in November. 
We can't allow our elections to become proxy battlegrounds, with the Russian GRU aiding the GOP as Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps seeks revenge for Trump's killing of Qasem Soleimani by helping elect Elizabeth Warren or Joe Biden. Trump's refusal to acknowledge these stakes is the biggest indictment of his failure to protect our country. And that willful blindness underscores the historic necessity of his impeachment trial. 
As the senators sit on the jury, they should all be wondering: What's the most embarrassing secret lurking in their email accounts or their camera rolls "" and who's looking for it right now?-

Every four years, presidential candidates show up in Iowa and act like your neediest Tinder match.

Hey, girl. You're gorgeous. I'm not from here, but I know what you need. Meet me for coffee Sunday morning? Or I'll be at a high school gym later that afternoon. Oh, you'd prefer not to leave your house? I'll come over and tell you about myself.

Iowa responds with months of keeping it casual before finally picking one to be the answer to all its problems "" only to see them leave town and set their sights somewhere else.
Behind the scenes of this great American courtship ritual, it's fitting that campaign staffers are also looking for that special someone. In the nerdy, stressful version of adult summer camp that is the presidential race, driven and idealistic young people bond while knocking on voters' doors during the day and kicking back over cheap beers late at night "" so it's no wonder they fall for one another. And yes, make some passionate mistakes they'd rather forget.
Among the lasting love stories: A 2004 John F. Kerry staffer who picked up a Howard Dean staffer in a Des Moines karaoke bar by saying: 'My dad has a hot tub.' (They're married with three kids now.) A New Hampshire staffer for Al Gore's 2000 campaign who nursed a secret crush on a co-worker, until he clumsily blurted out to her: 'I'm feeling something here and just needed to tell you.' (They're married with a kid, and he's now a top aide on Biden's 2020 campaign.) A 2000 George W. Bush campaign adviser who met a fellow Bush adviser who later ran for president himself. (That's Heidi and Ted Cruz.)
Fooling around might actually be important. In her book about the 2016 election, Democratic Party honcho Donna Brazile notes an old campaign rule from former congressman Tony Coelho, who believed that if a staff is hooking up, it's a sign a campaign is strong: 'Are they having sex? Are they having fun?' Coelho asked her. 'If not, let's create something to get that going, or otherwise we're not going to win.'
Many campaign couples meet as field organizers or while doing advance work, as both jobs are typically held by recent college grads working in small offices in remote towns they've never been before. It gets lonely, fast. In 2008, organizers all around Iowa would drive to Des Moines to find other campaign staffers who could relate. Now, Tinder or Bumble can find them someone nearby.
This past fall, Claire Goldberg was one of those isolated and exhausted organizers, desperate to meet someone her own age. For months, the 22-year-old had been in southeastern Iowa, calling and meeting with voters mostly in their 60s and beyond, trying to persuade them to caucus for Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.). On Bumble, Goldberg matched with someone she recognized from campaign events: a 29-year-old organizer for former vice president Joe Biden.
But when Goldberg and her date met at a bar in Fort Madison, he greeted her without a handshake or a hug, then recited his life story for 30 minutes before badgering her about how long Harris might remain in the race. He then spent the rest of the date trying to persuade the bartender to caucus for Biden. 'Joe Biden is a much better man than this guy will ever be,' she says.
The locals also get in on the action, as their state suddenly becomes saturated with young, unattached newbies. Catie Wiltanger, a politically curious 20-year-old student at Drake University in Des Moines, has attended campaign events for nearly every Democrat in the race and often spies cute staffers but can't tell whether they're single or whether they date women "" until she sees them on Tinder or Bumble.
In the fall, Wiltanger went out with a Harris staffer whom she found 'kind of pretentious.' During the date, he joked that he could pull out one of his commit-to-caucus cards for her to sign. But politics has disrupted her love life: Once she started volunteering for Harris, he said he couldn't date her anymore because it was against the rules. Now she's volunteering for the campaign of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.); when she matched with a Warren staffer, he told her the same thing. They settled for following each other on Twitter.
Des Moines singles say campaign workers tend not to advertise their occupation or post candidate selfies on their dating app profiles because that would be a dead giveaway that they'll be around only till February. But a lack of photos set in Iowa usually gives it away.
Of course, if staffers from different campaigns are canoodling, there are concerns they could share campaign strategy or data with one another. Grant Woodard, a deputy field director for Hillary Clinton's 2008 bid, recalls how the campaign had to fire an Iowa field organizer for, among other reasons, sleeping with an Obama organizer and sharing the Clinton plan for the region.
But with so many candidates this cycle, it's hard to avoid dating someone attached to another campaign. Early this month, Rep. Abby Finkenauer (D-Iowa) endorsed Biden for president; she also happens to be engaged to Warren's Iowa political director, Daniel Wasta. (Her office didn't respond to a request for comment.)
Vanessa Valdivia, 31, who held a communications role on the now-defunct campaign of Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), says a cross-campaign relationship has been easier than expected. Her boyfriend of four years, Chris Meagher, 37, is Pete Buttigieg's press secretary. Of course, there were things they couldn't share with each other, and they spent a lot of time apart, but they understand each other. 'This work is really, really difficult,' Valdivia says. 'It's a certain kind of person who gets it.' The day Booker dropped out, Meagher tweeted that he was 'so bummed' by the news, adding how proud he was of Valdivia. 'I've been in relationships with people who don't work in politics, and it's really hard to feel the same support,' Valdivia added.
Booker is also in a long-distance relationship (with actor Rosario Dawson), and Valdivia says he has asked for tips on how to feel close. Valdivia recommended watching a TV show together while on FaceTime, as she and Meagher have done with 'Ozark' and 'Big Little Lies.'
For some split-campaign couples, spending time 'together' means they're making voter calls at the same time "" one person in the bedroom while the other is downstairs. This was the case for Brent and Kristie Welder, who met when Brent was working for Kerry and Kristie was on the Dean campaign. 'Back then, it was more controversial to date someone on a rival campaign than it was to date a Republican,' Kristie recalls. After the Iowa caucuses, Brent was dispatched to Michigan "" and though they'd only been dating a short while, they set off together and have been a couple ever since.
In the moment, it's hard to tell where a flirtation might lead. Being deep in the trenches with someone 'can trick you into thinking you have a connection that you don't,' says Zaina Javaid, 32, who worked on President Barack Obama's 2012 reelection campaign. Javaid is now engaged to her campaign fling, but she's seen enough connections fizzle to know that she and her fiance are among the lucky ones.
Working on a presidential campaign 'gives you this elevated sense of self,' Javaid says, which can be very attractive. 'You're doing something huge and you have this self-confidence . . . that you may not have in your everyday life.'
When Goldberg saw that elevated sense of self in her Biden-loving Bumble date, it was a turnoff. Some of her friends are dating people they met through Democratic campaigns, but in Goldberg's opinion, 'campaigns do more damage to relationships than they do good.' When she started on the Harris campaign, she had a boyfriend in Philadelphia "" soon, the distance plus her long hours pushed them to break up.
But just having similar views and translating them into action can bring couples closer. When Ryan Bruner met his now-girlfriend on Hinge (the dating app where Buttigieg met his husband, Chasten), he noticed her profile had 'this sexy photo of herself getting kicked out of a Trump rally.' Bruner, 30, was supporting Bernie Sanders in 2016, but now he and his girlfriend are both volunteering for Warren "" though he's in Des Moines and she's in Iowa City. 'When I'm canvassing or when I'm volunteering, I feel closer to her because we're doing the same [thing],' Bruner recalled in a downtown Des Moines coffee shop. If she's knocked on more doors than he has, he feels inspired to get back out there and keep up.
That coffee shop is not far from Carl's Place, a dive bar where many bleary-eyed campaigners have fumbled their way into each other's arms. The drinks are inexpensive, and college banners cover holes in the ceiling. The jukebox plays campaign walk-up songs on repeat: If Dolly Parton's '9 to 5' is blaring, there are probably Warren folks around. The bar's walls are covered in your typical 'Whitney + Travis' scrawls, but also a reference to Buttigieg's fundraisers in 'wine caves,' and ' 'Nothing will fundamentally change' "" Joe Biden.'
A couple who met during Clinton's 2016 campaign are here on a recent Thursday night "" they used to work for Harris together and now one works for Warren. The next night, a local preschool teacher says she dated a man on the Booker campaign. She liked him, even though he could rarely meet up before 9 or 10 p.m. and, shhh, her politics lean more toward Buttigieg. After Booker dropped out, he texted to say that he was on to Chicago for a job interview.
But it's hard to spot those first sparks flying in person. Sanders's staffers are known to frequent a dark, worn-in martini bar downtown called the Lift, but not on a Saturday night in mid-January. (Bartenders say they tip well but not as well as the Yang Gang.) At Carl's a couple of nights earlier, when asked about their love lives, a few former Harris and Booker staffers' anguished faces hint that, yes, they have past hookups and heartbreaks, but they're not gabbing about them. Warren organizers making calls at a cafe one afternoon wouldn't talk without their press team's permission. According to Bruner, the Warren staffers are likely to be in bed early so they can knock on doors the next morning. A barista at a hipster coffee shop downtown says: Oh yeah, campaign staffers are always in there, asking for her number. 'They're so horny!' she adds.
After 1 a.m. Saturday at the Beechwood Lounge, with the scent of cigarette smoke thick in the air, a 30-something Biden volunteer in town from South Carolina wonders aloud why so many millennials are single and lonely. Why can't we figure this out, he asks, eyebrow arched in bewilderment.
For the same reason there are 12 candidates still in the race, Chris. The electorate likes aspects of each, but isn't excited enough about one to go all in. They want perfection and don't want to settle. And this isn't even for a lifetime together "" just four to eight years.

The Cybersecurity 202
JOSEPH MARKS
Democratic presidential candidates are doing a pretty good job protecting their campaigns against hacking by Russia and other adversaries, according to a report out Thursday from the cybersecurity company SecurityScorecard.
Those results are a positive sign they'll be able to fend off the sort of digital attacks that upended Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016. But the election is still a long way off and hacking threats are likely to grow more sophisticated and dangerous as the election nears.
'They're seemingly all taking [cybersecurity] seriously,' said Paul Gagliardi, SecurityScorecard's head of threat intelligence. 'We didn't really find any low-hanging fruit. But security changes every single day . . . As the election comes closer, we could get some very targeted attacks by sophisticated actors.'
And another hack and leak campaign like the one that targeted Clinton could not only severely damage the Democratic nominee's prospects, it might compromise faith in the electoral process. 'You don't want a foreign power impacting or modifying the sanctity of our elections,' Gagliardi said.-
All the Democratic candidates still in the race earned an A or a B using the company's grading system, which is based on information available on the Internet, such as whether campaign websites are patched against computer bugs and whether they're taking basic precautions to guard against phishing emails. Campaigns with high marks are five times less likely to be breached than those earning Cs or lower, the company said, based on its customer base of more than a million organizations.-
Campaigns for top-polling candidates such as former vice president Joe Biden, former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Mass.) say they're taking basic measures such as mandating cybersecurity training for staff and requiring that staff use extra security precautions before accessing smartphones and websites. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) have declined to answer security questions.-
High security scores mean the campaigns are more secure than many major businesses and even better secured than the Democratic National Committee when the company performed a similar test in May. They're almost certainly more secure than Clinton's campaign, which fell prey to a basic phishing attack "" a phony email that managed to snare campaign chairman John Podesta's password.-
But those protections may not be enough to protect against a highly trained army of nation-state hackers, and officials are growing increasingly concerned about sophisticated efforts to undermine the contest "" not just from Russia but also from China, Iran and North Korea.
'It's hard to ever say that you feel comfortable defending your network against the likes of Russia or China,' Gagliardi said.-
The only major problem, the company found, was numerous vulnerabilities in an app used by supporters of Andrew Yang, a tech entrepreneur who has since dropped out of the race. The app was not used by the campaign itself, SecurityScorecard said.-
The report comes as top U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies are sounding an alarm about efforts to undermine the 2020 contest through hacking or disinformation and 'working directly with campaigns and candidates to educate them about ways to help keep their networks secure,' according to a USA Today op-ed published Wednesday. 
The op-ed was written by Attorney General William P. Barr, FBI Director Christopher A. Wray, acting Department of Homeland Security chief Chad Wolf, acting director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire and the leader of DHS's cybersecurity division, Chris Krebs.-
Those officials haven't identified any foreign hacking efforts aimed at preventing or changing votes during the first few primaries and caucuses of 2020.-But they warn that adversaries are eager to 'undermine our trust and confidence in each other, our democratic society-and democracy itself.'
They're also calling on the public to join in a 'whole-of-society approach' to prevent election interference by ensuring they're double-checking anything that might be misinformation and going to trusted sources for election information such as times and polling locations.-
'As leaders of our government, we are committed to defending our democracy, but we need your help, too,' the op-ed states.-
They also 'encourage candidates, election officials, technology companies-and others involved in elections to report suspicious cyber activity' to the FBI and DHS.-
'We cannot prevent all disinformation, foreign propaganda-or cyberattacks on our infrastructure,' the officials write. 'However, together, we can all help to mitigate these threats by exercising care when we share information and by maintaining good cyber hygiene to reduce the risks that malicious cyberattacks will succeed.'-

Senator walks a fine line criticizing rival's record while pledging party unity

DETROIT - The first thing Bernie Sanders wants you to know about Joe Biden is that ""he is my friend."" 
And ""a decent man."" 
But Sanders wants you to know some other things about Biden, too - that he once supported cuts to Social Security, cast a vote to prohibit federal funding of abortions, and used to favor a ban on openly gay people serving in the military.
In recent speeches, Sanders has cautiously tested new and forceful attacks on Biden's record on gay rights and women's issues, potent critiques aimed at two key bases of the Democratic Party.
At the same time, Sanders is increasingly assuring crowds - at the beginning, middle and end of speeches - that ""I will support Joe Biden"" if he becomes the Democratic presidential nominee.
Those two messages highlight the challenge facing Sanders as he campaigns in the Midwest ahead of a crucial primary in Michigan on Tuesday. 
To become the nominee, Sanders must beat Biden. But at a time when tensions between liberal and moderate Democrats have become heated, Sanders is facing increasing pressure to make sure the party unifies before November, whether he's the nominee or not.
For much of the campaign, Sanders has focused on economics and inequality, attacking his opponents for accepting donations from the wealthy and opposing Medicare-for-all. But in recent days, Sanders has also begun to challenge Biden's record on LGBT rights and women's reproductive health.
He repeatedly knocked Biden for, until recently, supporting the Hyde amendment, which banned Medicaid funds from being used to cover abortions. 
He has criticized the former vice president for supporting ""don't ask, don't tell"" in the 1990s, a policy that prevented openly gay people from serving in the military. And he has stressed Biden's 1996 vote for the Defense of Marriage Act, a federal law that barred legal recognition of same-sex marriages. 
""Joe Biden in the past has voted for what is called the Hyde Amendment, that said that women could not use Medicaid dollars in order to protect their reproductive rights and get an abortion,"" Sanders told a crowd of 15,000 supporters Saturday at a rally in Chicago, echoing comments he also made in Phoenix, Detroit and Flint, Mich. 
""I am proud to tell you that I have a 100 percent pro-choice voting record throughout my entire life,"" he added. ""I believed then, and I believe now, that it is women who have a right to control their own bodies, not the government.""
The new line of attack comes at a crucial moment for the Sanders campaign, which is struggling to gain momentum ahead of Tuesday's votes in six states. Though Sanders racked up wins in some early states, Biden won most of the nominating contests on Super Tuesday amid a consolidation of moderate support and now holds a lead in delegates. 
On the stump, Sanders has framed these new comments as a way to emphasize his own liberal record, noting that he supported gay rights when it was far more difficult to do so - unlike Biden. The supercharged contrast on social issues, Sanders said repeatedly in recent days, is crucial to give voters a clear picture of who has ""the vision"" to lead. 
""The point here is not just to look back 20 years ago, not just to look at consistency, it is to look at which candidate had the guts to cast difficult votes because they were the right votes,"" he said Friday during a news conference. ""All I can tell you is, whether it was Iraq, whether it was DOMA, whether it was 'don't ask, don't tell,' those were difficult votes. I was there, on the right side of history, and my friend Joe Biden was not."" 

The Biden campaign did not return a request for comment about the new attacks from Sanders. In recent days, Biden has largely avoided taking on Sanders directly, instead pitching himself as a ""unity candidate.""

Sanders has at times looked uncomfortable making these statements. Absent during these sections of his speech are his typical gesticulations and booming crescendo; instead, he has read carefully from his notes, looking down intently, often taking several rhetorical heaves to wind up to his point. 
And the attacks always come with a bookend of careful caveats: ""Let me once again say, Joe Biden is a friend of mine,"" he said Friday, during a news conference in Phoenix when asked whether he was worried that the criticism might dampen liberal enthusiasm for Biden if he is the nominee in November. ""I think we are the stronger campaign to defeat Donald Trump. You have not heard me say that I think that Biden will not defeat Trump.""
The senator's strategy comes with risks. 
Already, there are fears that Biden may not be able to energize Sanders's base if he wins the nomination. Many Sanders supporters have expressed uncertainty about whether they will cast ballots in November for anyone else. 
Jerome Palmer, 45, said during a rally in Phoenix on Thursday that he identifies as a ""progressive"" and was until recently a ""Democrat with reservations."" He said he has struggled with the idea of voting for Biden in November if he is the nominee. 
Palmer said he does not want Trump to be reelected, and he knows that he may have to make an uncomfortable political compromise to prevent it. But he cannot shake the ""sour taste in my mouth"" after casting a ballot for Hillary Clinton in 2016. 
The fact that she lost, he said, added insult to injury.
He now identifies as a political independent after a lifetime voting for Democrats.
""The past four or five years, I've had an awakening. The Democrat Party, they're not the good guys. They're bad news in my opinion,"" he said, noting that he had always voted for Democrats before. ""Democrats, it's literally two parties within one party. I think the moderates are just conservative-lite. It's the progressives who want to see change."" 
Sanders has never been afraid to go after his Democratic rivals on policy or their posture toward wealth. During the highly contentious 2016 primary fight, Sanders hammered Clinton over the paid speeches she delivered to financial institutions, which netted her tens of millions of dollars. 
But he has hesitated to pivot to matters of culture and character. In 2016, he promised publicly never to criticize Clinton over her ""damn emails,"" neutralizing a potent political attack used by her critics concerning her use of a private computer server as secretary of state.
In this cycle, as he has escalated his attacks against Biden, Sanders has sought rhetorical cover by pointing out that the eventual nominee will have to be able to withstand the president's bellicose campaign style. He has stressed that Trump ""will be a very formidable opponent for a lot of reasons.""
Democrats have carefully studied the campaign Trump ran in 2016, which regularly featured highly personal attacks. As the Republican primary field began to narrow in March, Trump amplified denigrating comments made on Twitter about Heidi Cruz, the wife of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.).
At one point, he seemed to threaten to release opposition research about her previous battle with depression.
He often called Cruz ""Lyin' Ted!"" or Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) ""Lil' Marco!"" 
That behavior set the tone for the election, and Trump's rivals in time began to return the barbs, like when Rubio began making jokes about the size of Trump's hands. 
Unlike when he is talking about Biden, Sanders's comments on Trump are scathingly personal. He calls him a ""pathological liar,"" a ""fraud,"" a ""racist"" and an ""autocrat."" He regularly accuses the president of never having read the Constitution.

Winning Michigan like in 2016 will be vital for him. It also might be harder to do this time.

Joe Biden's stunning turnaround in the past week has put pressure on Bernie Sanders to blunt or reverse the former vice president's momentum. It won't take long to determine whether the senator is up to the challenge.
After the events of the past week, the one-on-one competition between Biden and Sanders is just beginning, but already the calendar says their battle is at an advanced and potentially decisive stage. Assumptions that Democrats are headed toward a genuinely contested convention might well be wrong.
Sanders has been here before. Four years ago, the senator from Vermont lost South Carolina to Hillary Clinton, lost the majority of states on Super Tuesday and fell behind in the delegate race. But he won in enough places on Super Tuesday to give him the incentive to keep going - and he had a plan for regaining momentum in Michigan that included early television ads and a focus on trade in a state sensitive to the issue.
The pre-primary polls showed Clinton with a substantial lead, but on primary night, Sanders won. The margin was narrow - less than two percentage points - but the value of the upset was enormous. The victory revived his campaign, and he took his fight all the way to the convention in Philadelphia, to the dismay of Clinton forces. 

That history makes Michigan the most crucial of the six states with contests this Tuesday, but Sanders could struggle to repeat his performance of four years ago. He won't be able to sneak up on Biden as he did with Clinton. 
Biden has done well with some of the kinds of Michigan voters Sanders relied on for success in 2016, whether those in small towns and rural areas or those without college degrees. Sanders still has strength in areas with colleges and universities, but by his own acknowledgment, he is not getting the turnout he needs from young voters. Meanwhile, in Michigan districts with large concentrations of African Americans, Sanders lost big in 2016, and Biden has been winning black voters by huge margins this year.
Sanders has other potential problems Tuesday. Three of the six states with contests held caucuses four years ago; Sanders got 78 percent of the vote in Idaho, 73 percent in Washington and 64 percent in North Dakota. He netted 68 more delegates than Clinton in those three contests. This year, Washington and Idaho have shifted to primaries. Even if he wins all three again, and polling in Washington shows a close race, Sanders won't get nearly as many delegates.
Overall, between now and April 7, Sanders and Biden will compete in 16 states and Puerto Rico. Four years ago, Clinton won nine of 17, and Sanders won eight, six of them caucuses. Of the 11 that were primaries, Clinton lost only Michigan and Wisconsin. From those 17 states, she emerged with about 100 more delegates than Sanders.

Those numbers set the stage for what is about to unfold in the Democratic campaign, with the prospect that Sanders could come out of the contests between now and the Wisconsin primary further behind Biden in delegates and with no realistic path to make up the difference. 
Sanders faces a big defeat Tuesday in Mississippi, a replication of 2016. He was competitive with Clinton in Missouri, but this year he has to break Biden's momentum to avoid losing ground there. The following week, he can expect a big loss in Florida: Four years ago, Clinton beat him by a margin of 30 points. His praise for Fidel Castro's literacy program adds to his problems there this year.
A week after that, on March 24, there is a stand-alone primary in Georgia. Clinton crushed Sanders there in 2016, winning more than twice as many delegates. Because there is no other event that day, a big Biden victory will feed a story line of the former vice president's strength among the party's most loyal constituency. Five days later, there will be the Puerto Rico primary, which Sanders lost against Clinton.

Sanders could find some relief on April 4 when four states hold events, three of which he won in 2016. But shifts from caucuses to party-run primaries in two states might hold down any delegate margin.
The one potential bright spot for Sanders comes on April 7 in Wisconsin. Four years ago, he won the Badger State by double digits. A loss in Wisconsin this year would be a huge setback. But even a victory of near-double digits would almost certainly still leave Sanders behind Biden in delegates. After Wisconsin, Sanders will be looking at primaries in several states that don't allow independents - generally a Sanders constituency - to vote.
As this indicates, almost any back-of-the-envelope calculation of a two-person race gives Biden the advantage today. The latest model from Nate Silver's FiveThirtyEight says Sanders has only a ""small window"" to win the nomination, while Biden has an 88 percent chance of winning a majority of pledged delegates and a 94 percent chance of winning a plurality.
As Silver put it, ""Sanders has to come back quickly when the momentum is currently against him in a bunch of states that are not very good for him - or it will be too late. It's not impossible. But the chances are low."" 
Sanders has said that whoever has the most delegates, even if it is just a plurality, should become the nominee. When he first said that, he was confident he would be the person with a plurality by the time the primaries end. That statement could come back on him sooner than he thinks, possibly in the days after April 7.

No one anticipated the Democratic race would turn as quickly as it did. No one figured Biden would sweep as many states on Super Tuesday and grab a narrow lead in delegates. No one assumed the field would consolidate so quickly and decisively around Biden. Biden could stumble badly in the March 15 debate in Arizona or do something else to give supporters pause.
Realistically, however, it is Sanders who has potential soul-searching ahead. Four years ago, he resisted calls to endorse Clinton immediately after she won the June primary in California. He took his campaign into the convention hall in Philadelphia and pressed his demands on the Clinton campaign. For Clinton, it was an annoyance, but no one assumed it would be costly in the general election.
This year, Democrats will need every day possible to prepare for the general election against President Trump. The Trump reelection campaign has been running its general election operation for many months, raising huge amounts of money, building organizations in states, modeling the electorate and, most important, communicating with the voters they believe will determine the outcome of the election.
Early this year, David Plouffe, who was Barack Obama's 2008 campaign manager and a guiding hand from the White House in the president's 2012 reelection, said he believes Democrats must effectively wrap up their nomination contest this spring, rather than early summer, to avoid putting their general election chances at risk. 
By early April, Democrats should know definitively whether Biden will be their nominee or whether Sanders still has a chance of winning. If Sanders does not have a chance of winning, will he take his candidacy all the way to Democratic convention again or choose a different path than he did in 2016?

In the first weekend of 2020, seven Democratic presidential candidates blew through Iowa like a snow squall. Elizabeth Warren appeared in Manchester, Maquoketa, Davenport and Dubuque. Bernie Sanders also stopped by Dubuque, in addition to Grundy Center, Mason City and Boone. Joe Biden logged significant miles around the Hawkeye State as well, visiting Waterloo, Davenport, Grinnell, Vinton and Des Moines. 
I landed in the state capital at the same time as John Delaney's Sunday event in Sheldon and checked into my room while Biden was speaking in Davenport. If I had unpacked a little faster, I could have caught the tail end of Tom Steyer's talk in Newton. But after the flight, I just wanted a drink, without the politicking.
Over the next few weeks, all eyes will bore into Iowa, the first state in the country to hold caucuses or a primary. The Democratic candidates "" 12 at the time of publishing, 14 during my visit "" are blanketing the Midwestern state, jockeying for supporters before the Feb. 3 caucuses. (A few Republicans challenging President Trump, such as Bill Weld and Joe Walsh, are also popping up in Iowa.) The politically minded will focus on the policies, positions and personalities of the POTUS hopefuls, but I was more interested in the datelines "" the destinations and attractions that will be here long after the politicians have moved on to another state, another election. While the candidates come to Iowa for votes, I came to Iowa for Iowa.
For three out of every four years, Iowa is relegated to flyover status. So, you can't blame the state of corn, Hawkeyes and Herbert Hoover for basking in the spotlight while it can. 
As a D.C. resident, my ears have been rubbed raw by political talk. But in Iowa, the topic seemed refreshing and new. Like the time I spotted my college professor on a beach in Rhode Island. I found her more compelling in a different environment. 

Businesses around the state are capitalizing on this moment. Sock Spot, a vendor in the NewBo City Market in Cedar Rapids, carries election-themed sport socks with candidates' names (Mayor Pete [Buttigieg], Warren), public service announcements ('Do the right thing 2020') and unifying slogans ('I vote for snacks'). The store's owner, who was wearing chihuahua-print socks, said the Bernie Sanders and Trump styles with unruly hair (comb included, to tame the locks) were doing well. But if votes were based on sales, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes would become the next president.
Raygun, a printing, clothing and novelty retailer with several locations around the state, slaps a crooked smile on the straight face of such serious subjects as politics, social causes and Iowa stereotypes. The company, which leans left, has created islands of candidate-related merchandise within its stores. Here, you can pick up books by Warren, Sanders and Biden, among others; T-shirts ('Give Pete a chance!'); and laser-cut ornaments (Warren hanging with Lizzo and a gun-toting cat). If you have lost track of which candidates have dropped out of the race, check the discounted rack: The 'Iowa for Beto' shirts are on sale.

On weekends, diners, including many Drake University students nursing hangovers, stand in line for breakfast at Waveland Cafe in Des Moines. The place is packed; the clamoring for hash browns loud. But on a Monday morning, I had many seating choices: counter or booth, by the photo montage of regulars or the wall of signatures by journalists and politicians. Two bites into my rye toast, I noticed a familiar face with a Ned Flanders mustache and a Hawaiian shirt. I dropped my slice to say hello to Waveland owner David Stone. I asked him how the cafe had become a campaign and press stop during the caucuses. He said it gained national attention in 2000, when Tom Brokaw reported live from the 54-seat diner. This year, CNN wanted to set up operations inside, but Stone declined: feeding frenzy before media frenzy. 
'They can't take over the restaurant on a weekend,' he said. 'We are extremely busy, and I can't have cameras getting in the way of my customers.' 
Not even Aquaman could move the mountain of eggs and potatoes. When Jason Momoa, a native Iowan, wanted to hold a family reunion at the diner last year, Stone agreed, but only if his party arrived at 7 a.m. and cleaned their plates before the official opening hour of 8. 'He complied,' Stone said of the herculean actor. 

Since 2004, the Hamburg Inn No. 2 in Iowa City has held the Coffee Bean Caucus. The process is much easier than the actual Iowa caucuses. At the front counter, guests take a bean from a jar and drop it into a smaller container (a paper-clip holder?) embellished with the name of their preferred candidate. At the end of the day, the staff transfers the beans to the larger Mason jars lined up on a shelf near the front door. The policy is one person/one vote, but everyone can participate, including non-natives (often called 'captives' in Iowa-speak), children and foreigners.
'This gives us a really good sense of what the consensus in Iowa City is,' said Elise Prendergast, the front house manager, adding that Sanders won in 2016. 
On the Tuesday morning I stopped by, Buttigieg and Sanders were bean-to-bean, and Mike Bloomberg's canister was empty. However, Elise said the numbers are always in flux. After the December debate, Amy Klobuchar's bean count rose. 

The restaurant is lined with press clippings, and toward the back, you can genuflect before a shrine to past candidates and ex-presidents. In 1992, three years after leaving office, Ronald Reagan visited the Hamburg Inn and sat at what is now the Presidential Table. According to the menu from his visit, he ordered meatloaf, french fries, green beans, a roll with butter and apple pie a la mode, which he ate first. 
Of course, tastes and diets have changed since the Reagan years, so I asked Elise for her menu picks. She recommended the hamburgers and pie shakes, a blend of vanilla ice cream and pie "" America in a glass.
At Eatery A in Des Moines, I ordered a Moscow mule and chatted with the mustachioed bartender about the restaurant's former occupants, first a Blockbuster Video store and later Barack Obama's caucus headquarters. I had read that a few campaign offices were nearby "" Delaney's is a few blocks away "" and wondered whether he had a Spidey sense about the diners' identities. With the excitement of a wildlife enthusiast on safari, I asked him whether he could point to any campaign workers. 
'They wear buttons,' he answered, scanning the establishment.
We didn't see any lapel accessories, but he did notice a man and woman of distinction in the booth behind me.
'Are you guys with the Well Pennies?' he gushed to the Des Moines-based folk-pop band. 'I love your song, 'Ooh La La.' '
That night at the hotel, I fell asleep to the duo's music and not the news headlines. 

In Pella, a Dutch-accented town about an hour east of Des Moines, the woman in the white bonnet didn't want to talk politics. She had more pressing matters to discuss: pastries. 
Bakeries all over town post signs in their windows for Dutch letter cookies. However, the employee at Jaarsma Bakery explained that the S-shaped sweets are traditionally baked for Sinterklaasavond, or Dutch Santa Claus Day, on Dec. 6. For more seasonally correct snacking, she suggested an almond banket, which is similar to a letter cookie but with more almond paste and shaped like a flagpole.
Jaarsma Bakery opened in 1898, about 50 years after the Dutch immigrants arrived in Iowa seeking religious freedom. The Old World traditions still run deep. Since 1935, the town has held Tulip Time, a springtime festival celebrating the Netherlands' flower power. The Vermeer Windmill, the tallest working mill in North America, soars nearly 125 feet high, its 82-foot-long blades whirring like a lazy fan. Five times a day, the Klokkenspel stirs to life with chiming bells and lively characters. There's Dominie Hendrik Pieter Scholte, who led the 800 newcomers to the City of Refuge, and his wife, Maria, who is in tears after all but one of her good dishes shattered during the crossing. (She is also upset about her new digs, a log cabin.) Wyatt Earp earned a spot on the musical clock because the gunslinger grew up here. His childhood home is part the Historical Village, a collection of 22 buildings including the Werkplaats, where wooden shoes are made, and the Delft House, which contains vintage pieces of the famous pottery.

Continuing east, I left Pella's self-described 'Touch of Holland,' for the Willkommen mat of the Amana Colonies, a National Historic Landmark. Starting in 1855, German immigrants fleeing religious persecution (see Pella, with a Deutschland twist) established seven villages on 26,000 acres of land in central Iowa. They lived communally until the Great Change of 1932, when they split the shared nest for a more independent lifestyle. Today, about 1,600 people reside in the colonies, including 300 adherents of the Amana church, a breakaway sect of the Lutheran Church.
During the winter months, the historical buildings keep limited hours, but Jon M. Childers, executive director of the Amana Heritage Society, held the keys to the colonies. We visited the communal kitchen and the church in Middle Amana, and toured the exhibits at the heritage museum, which included the world's first microwave and (empty) buckets of lard and barrels of pickled German cut beans from the subsistence days. Jon drove me by the 163-year-old Amana Woolen Mill, Iowa's oldest and only working woolen mill, the site of a new boutique hotel that is scheduled to open in the fall. In between stops, he told me how as a Boy Scout, he provided 'security' for Ted Kennedy, who visited during his 1979-80 run for president. (The boys encircled the former Massachusetts senator.) More recently, Obama and Hillary Clinton spoke at the Festhalle Barn about a month apart in 2007; a year later, Bill Clinton stumped for his wife at the Amana RV Park. He also picked up a blanket from a shop Jon had set up in the registration office, for those chilly nights in Chappaqua, N.Y. I asked Jon what could politicians learn from the Amana colonists.
'Amana is inclusive,' he said. 'People sit and listen. It feels like a big family.' 
In the fantasy baseball movie 'Field of Dreams,' the voice said, 'If you build it, he will come.' Meanwhile, the voice in my head said: 'If you offer a house tour that doesn't involve standing outside in freezing cold, she will come.' Someone clearly heard me.
I recognized the two-story clapboard farmhouse in Dyersville from a corn field away. It sat above the baseball field, which looked smaller in person. I buzzed the doorbell and a guide ushered me inside. After putting on protective booties, I followed her through the kitchen, where a photo of Ray and Annie Kinsella, the fictional field-builders, sat on the counter. In the living room, the 1989 film played on a boxy TV, the sound off to prevent the tour guides from going mad. 
I learned all sorts of movie trivia, such as the actor who played the 'voice' remains a mystery (maybe Ray Liotta or Ed Harris, the husband of Amy 'Annie' Madigan?) and the corn grew so high, thanks to human intervention, that Kevin 'Ray' Costner had to stand on a 12-inch platform. I stared out the bay window, a renovation care of Universal Studios, but didn't see any ghost players emerge. Maybe they are waiting for Major League Baseball to finish building its regulation field adjacent to the FOD. On Aug. 13, the New York Yankees and White Sox will compete in Iowa's first regular-season game to a crowd of 8,000. On this January morning, I had zero fans to cheer me. But I did have the voice in my head reminding me that the sooner I rounded those bases, the quicker I could return to my heated car. 
Winter is prime time for viewing bald eagles in the Midwest. The birds of prey, which start arriving in September, hunt for food along Iowa's major rivers. I started my search for the country's emblem in the cafeteria of the National Mississippi River Museum - Aquarium in Dubuque. The restaurant overlooks Ice Harbor, a man-made offshoot of the Upper Mississippi. No luck on the birds, but even better, I found Jared McGovern, the museum's curator of conservation programs, eating a chicken sandwich. Jared told me to look by the lock-and-dam systems along the Mississippi River, where eagles often feast on the fish uprooted by the rushing water. Plan B: Check the fields, in the off chance a farmer tossed a dead pig. Like many Americans, eagles prefer fast food to a labor-intensive meal made from scratch.

I followed Jared's instructions, driving out to Lock and Dam No. 11 (nothing) and Eagle Point Park (maybe something) in Dubuque. Standing on the lip of the park above the Mississippi, I caught a glimpse of two dark-feathered birds (juveniles?) and a third with a white head (mom or dad?). I tried to snap a photo to send to Jared for confirmation but couldn't free my hand from my mitten in time. Back in the car, I continued south on the Great River Road National Scenic Byway to Bellevue (Lock and Dam No. 12 and Bellevue State Park), Green Island and Sabula, the state's only island city. In Davenport, seagulls circled Lock and Dam No. 13 and Canada geese pecked at the frozen banks.

The next day, I had moved on from the bald eagles; I now only cared about blankets. I had returned to Amana and was walking down the street when a mother exclaimed to her son, 'Bald eagle,' and pointed at the sky. The little boy and I both looked up and watched the bird soar toward the setting sun. Tinted in golden light, the bald eagle looked regal and proud, even if he was just going to freeload in a farmer's field.
I also spotted my button. A few hours before my flight back to Washington, I was drinking coffee at the Scenic Route Bakery in Des Moines when Jackson Boaz walked in wearing a 'Students for Warren' pin on his wool jacket. The 15-year-old high school freshman from Northern California started every morning at the cafe with a cup of oatmeal. Iowa in January, he said, was 'too cold for parfait.' The young campaign volunteer shared his impressions of the state with me.
'I love the energy here in Des Moines and in Iowa as a whole,' he said. 'They have this sacred role as the first in the country. It's like the political Super Bowl.' Anything else? 'The food has been pretty dang good.' 
Jackson was leaving in mid-January but hoped to return to Iowa for the caucuses "" and maybe the oatmeal, too.

Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren pledged Wednesday that her campaign would not share falsehoods or promote fraudulent accounts on social media, part of a new plan to battle disinformation and hold Facebook, Google and Twitter 'responsible' for its spread.
Four years after Russian agents weaponized those services in a bid to undermine the 2016 election, Warren expressed fresh alarm that Silicon Valley's efforts only 'nibble around the edges,' failing to fully combat online threats that mislead voters or stoke conflict, including among Democrats competing for the White House in 2020.
'Anyone who seeks to challenge and defeat Donald Trump in the 2020 election must be fully prepared to take on the full array of disinformation that foreign actors and people in and around the Trump campaign will use to divide Democrats, suppress Democratic votes and erode the standing of the Democratic nominee,' said Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts. 'And anyone who seeks to be the Democratic nominee must condemn the use of disinformation and pledge not to knowingly use it to benefit their own candidacy or damage others.'
One of her Democratic rivals, former vice president Joe Biden, issued a similar pledge in the summer, saying he would not 'fabricate, use or spread data or materials that were falsified, fabricated, doxed or stolen' and would not use doctored visuals, including deepfakes, or 'bot networks to disseminate messages.'
But the party as a whole has not set guidelines. State Democratic chairs last year backed a resolution on election integrity urging the Democratic National Committee to establish a 'framework which would discourage and prevent . . . illicit campaign tactics.' But the proposal never came up for a vote before national party leaders.
Still, the DNC has stepped up its efforts to protect campaigns and state parties from deceptive online attacks, including issuing recommendations in December on combating disinformation. The advice for campaigns included tasking a digital staffer with monitoring social media traffic and being more active in pushing back against false narratives online. The party has its own team that uses online monitoring tools to track the spread of falsehoods, providing information to individual campaigns.
Along with her personal commitment, Warren said Wednesday, her presidency would push for civil and criminal penalties for those who seek to mislead people online about when, where and how to vote. She also said she would seek sanctions against countries, including Russia, that attempt to undermine U.S. elections with online propaganda.
In the meantime, Warren called on Facebook, Google, Twitter and other tech giants to take immediate steps to bolster their disinformation defenses, including notifying users who have interacted with fake accounts or the manipulated content they share.
Warren's call to action "" issued days before Iowans are set to cast the first votes of the presidential election "" reflects a growing trepidation among Democrats about the digital landscape in 2020.
In October, Facebook acknowledged fresh efforts by agents tied to the Russian government to seed posts, photos and videos designed to exacerbate tensions between Democratic candidates and their supporters. Along with new foreign threats, Democrats also have struggled to contend with repeated broadsides from President Trump's campaign, which has purchased numerous ads on Facebook that contain false claims about his Democratic foes.
Seedy Twitter accounts spread a duplicitously edited video of Biden earlier this year. Warren's opponents similarly tried to rile black voters against her candidacy using a highly doctored photo. And backers for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and his 2020 bid have been some of the most aggressive online, weaponizing features on Facebook to share viral, hostile memes about his fellow Democratic contenders.
Top Democrats publicly have blasted Facebook, Google and Twitter for failing to take aggressive action against disinformation. Each company in recent years has hired more content reviewers and, with the aid of artificial intelligence, acted more aggressively to thwart what Facebook calls 'coordinated inauthentic behavior.'

At the start of President Trump's impeachment trial, Democrats pinned their hopes on Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), whose reputation as an institutionalist might lead him to back a call for witnesses.
Democrats were sorely disappointed late Thursday night as Alexander, who is retiring at the end of his third term, announced his opposition to such a move "" and offered an explanation they found lacking.
Alexander said the president did use military aid as leverage to pressure Ukraine's leader to investigate a Trump political rival, but he wouldn't join Democrats on calling witnesses.
'I think there's a big gap between this conduct and impeachable conduct; I don't think this is close. I think it's inappropriate,' Alexander said in an interview Friday morning.
Democrats had hoped that Alexander, 79, could build a coalition of Republicans who would at least support calling witnesses such as John Bolton, the former national security adviser whose forthcoming book alleges that Trump's goal in delaying $391 million in security aid to Ukraine was to force that nation to launch damaging political investigations of former vice president and 2020 candidate Joe Biden.
As Friday's debate over witnesses began, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) issued a statement opposing witnesses, eliminating the chance of a 50-50 vote that would have compelled Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. to decide whether to break the tie or let the motion for witnesses die.
Unlike Alexander, Murkowski called the case against Trump 'rushed and flawed' but said that the Senate was incapable of curing 'the shortcomings' and that she would oppose additional witnesses.
'I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate. I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything. It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed,' said Murkowski, who also cited attacks on Roberts as a factor in her decision.
That left Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Mitt Romney (Utah) as the only two Republicans poised to join all 47 members of the Democratic caucus in asking for more witnesses in a vote destined to fail.
Democrats had hoped that Alexander's background as a protector of the Senate's institutional prerogatives would make him a supporter of expanding the trial, especially given his early years as a top aide to then-Sen. Howard Baker (Tenn.), who served as the top Republican on the Senate Watergate Committee, which helped lead to Richard Nixon's resignation in the face of likely impeachment and removal in 1974.
'I was certainly hoping he would have a Howard Baker moment, you know, but it appears he will not,' Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said Friday morning.
Durbin said he was 'disappointed but not really surprised' by Alexander's decision, particularly because the Tennessean has been a close ally of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) since their shared days as Senate staffers.
While even-tempered and pragmatic in working with Democrats on legislation, Alexander has built a solid conservative record far different from those of the few remaining moderate GOP senators, who were closely watched for their votes.
In his own telling, Alexander said that he was never that close to voting for witnesses and that he delayed in stating a position in order to act as a prudent jurist in the trial while leaving open the possibility of wanting to hear more evidence.
To prepare for the trial, he said, he read two books: one by Edmund Ross, the senator from Kansas who cast the decisive vote in 1868 against removing President Andrew Johnson from office, and the other, 'Impeachment: An American History,' a collaborative book published in 2018 about all the cases against presidents.
Alexander read the newer book at his desk during Thursday's question-and-answer session, focusing on the chapter by Jon Meacham on Johnson's trial.
The senator said that 'many presidents have probably done similar things,' citing a talk he had with Jimmy Carter's attorney general, Griffin Bell, in which Bell said Carter had ordered him to indict on civil rights charges a Texas police officer who had received a short sentence in a brutal murder. Bell refused.
Alexander said a similar scenario should have happened when Trump wanted a probe of the Ukrainian energy firm that had Joe Biden's son Hunter on its board. 'If he wants to investigate the Bidens, he should give that information to the attorney general and let him handle it,' said Alexander, who continues to support Trump's reelection as honorary chairman of his Tennessee campaign.
He said that he has not spoken to Trump since a bill-signing ceremony at the White House in mid-December but that he came under fierce pressure from a collection of colleagues, close friends and others who had access to the president.
'I got some very impassioned emails from people who canonize President Trump or people who hate him,' Alexander said.
Three key elements convinced him that it was time to move.
First, with the election already underway and ballots printed in many early primary states, prolonging the trial could blow up that campaign. 'So we're tearing up the ballots and telling people basically, as an election is starting, you can't vote for or against President Trump,' he said.
Second, he said that the Founding Fathers disapproved of party-line impeachments in the House and that the Senate should dismiss those. 'I did not want to create a weapon of perpetual impeachment that the House could use to immobilize the Senate and immobilize the executive,' he said.
Finally, he believes that the House managers documented their case but did not show that it rose to an impeachable offense.
'Did he, at least in part, withhold aid in order to encourage that investigation? I thought the evidence was conclusive that he did,' Alexander said. 'The president might very well say, 'I did it because I cared about corruption,' but I was convinced that at least in part, he did it to encourage the investigation of the Bidens.'
Alexander said he is not sure what defines a 'high crime or misdemeanor' "" which the Constitution sets as the basis for removing a president "" but added that one key requirement is bipartisan support.
'I think you step back and say, is it something about which there is such a consensus that both Republicans and Democrats think the president ought to be removed? I guess the only example we really have of that is President Nixon,' he said.

Former astronaut Mark Kelly, the Democratic Party's hope for flipping a U.S. Senate seat in Arizona, tried to do no harm this month when he was asked about Sen. Bernie Sanders. 'I will ultimately support who the nominee is of the Democratic Party,' he said. 
That was enough for Kelly's Republican rival, Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), who is trailing him in early polls, to go on the attack. The television spot she debuted days later spent nearly as much time talking about plans by the democratic socialist from Vermont to raise taxes and award new benefits to undocumented immigrants as it did about Kelly.
As Sanders builds what could eventually be an insurmountable delegate lead, many Democratic House and Senate candidates are approaching a dramatic shift in their campaigns, as they recalibrate to include praise of capitalism and distance themselves from the national party. Top campaign strategists from both parties view Sanders's success as a potentially tectonic event, which could narrow the party's already slim hopes of retaking the Senate majority and fuel GOP dreams of reclaiming the House, which it lost amid a Democratic romp in 2018. 
'I can tell you that there are a lot of down-ballot jitters based on my conversations with my former colleagues,' said former Rep. Steve Israel (D-N.Y.), a longtime confidant of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi who led congressional election efforts from 2011 to 2015. 
'Donald Trump is going to offer the American people this choice: Do you want to continue building the economy or do you want to lurch toward socialism? And that is a real powerful argument in the Democratic districts that Trump won in 2016.'
With an emphatic victory in Saturday's Nevada caucuses, Sanders has won two of the first three contests, and lost the third "" the Iowa caucuses "" in a squeaker. He also holds leads in polls in many of the Super Tuesday states that vote March 3 "" a point by which nearly 4 in 10 delegates nationally will have been chosen.
Internal polling and analytics completed last week by former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg's campaign projected that Sanders may be the only presidential candidate to win delegates in every state and district on March 3, delivering him a lead of 350 to 400 out of 1,357 delegates set to be awarded unless race dynamics change, according to a person familiar with the data who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to speak publicly. 
Because of Democratic rules that give no delegates to candidates who scores less than 15-percent of the vote in a state or congressional district, Sanders could build a delegate lead far greater than his advantage in the popular vote. 

If Democrats are awakening to a recognition that Sanders could pull away from the rest of the field, there is far less consensus about whether his nomination will help President Trump win reelection. Sanders's power to turn out young and blue-collar voters or suburbanites is not fully tested, the ceiling of Trump's support is poorly defined in a two-way race and the senator from Vermont has not yet been subjected to a negative paid advertising effort. 
'Our data shows that all of our potential nominees, including Sanders, have a pathway to victory, but it isn't guaranteed,' said Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC that has polled heavily in the key presidential swing states. 'This election will be close regardless of who we nominate.' 
But there is far less flexibility for candidates in smaller districts. That has prompted Republicans to celebrate as they look to reclaim ground they lost in 2018 when largely affluent suburbs rebelled against the GOP in a protest of Trump. 
'The Democrats' embrace of socialism is going to cost them their majority "" I mean, it's as simple as that,' said Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. 'Bernie is about as good a contrast as we could have ever hoped for.'
Democrats, particularly those representing swing districts, agree.
'We flipped those seats [in 2018] because of Donald Trump,' said one House Democrat who represents a suburban district, speaking on the condition of anonymity to reflect internal discussions. 'And if Democrats want to hand most of those back, put Bernie at the top of the ticket. And that's how many of us feel.'
The House member added: 'Our overarching priority [is] to replace the president, but to do so with someone who is going to be equally divisive does not serve the country's interests, and I think that's at the core of what is making so many so uncomfortable.'

Several of Sanders's rivals have begun to warn about a potential down-ballot rout. They have raised particular concern about Sanders's support for a Medicare-for-all plan, which would effectively eliminate private health insurance in the United States. 
The leading Democratic candidates running for the four most vulnerable Republican Senate seats "" in Arizona, North Carolina, Maine and Colorado "" have all come out against Sanders's signature health care plan, as have many House candidates.
 'I believe the only way to truly deliver any of the progressive changes we care about is to be a nominee who actually gives a damn about the effect you are having, from the top of the ticket, on those crucial, front-line House and Senate Democrats running to win, who we need to win, to make sure our agenda is more than just words on a page,' former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg said Saturday in Las Vegas. 

The issue is likely to move to the forefront of the presidential race in the coming days. At a Las Vegas middle school Friday night, swing-district Rep. Steven Horsford (D-Nev.) took a jab at Sanders by suggesting that any candidate other than former vice president Joe Biden would put the House majority at risk.
'The greatest thing about Joe Biden, fighting for Nevada families, is he knows it's going to take a team,' Horsford told hundreds of Biden supporters. 'He is the best candidate positioned to help us keep the Democratic majority in the House and win the U.S. Senate.'
The moderate think tank Third Way has urged the presidential candidates to train their fire on Sanders at Tuesday's South Carolina debate, issuing a memo that cites a recent Gallup survey that found 51 percent of independents would not vote for a self-described socialist for president. 
'The suburbs are not looking for a revolution,' said Matt Bennett, co-founder of Third Way. 'They want change, for sure. Many of them loathe Trump with a burning passion, but they do not want somebody who is proposing to double the size of the federal government. They do not want somebody who is proposing to take away the health care of 180 million people.'
A Washington Post-ABC News Poll last week found that Sanders had the worst standing against Trump among college-educated white women, the group most responsible for powering Democrats to their 2018 House majority. Sanders had a statistically insignificant two percentage-point edge over Trump among white women voters with college degrees in the poll, compared with Buttigieg, Biden, Bloomberg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), who all beat Trump by 10 points or more among that the same group.
Bennett said the past few weeks have seen an explosion of private conversations about how to reckon with "" and potentially mitigate "" a Sanders nomination. On Capitol Hill, Democrats have been circulating an unflattering private poll paid for by a rival presidential candidate that tests negative messages against Sanders among voters in six presidential swing states.
'Bernie Sanders is a socialist who supports un-American, big government plans that will spend trillions of dollars, lead to higher taxes, and destroy our way of life,' reads one line of the polling test. The poll does not test Sanders's rebuttal to such an attack. 
Dan Conston, executive director of the Congressional Leadership Fund, the largest GOP super PAC focused on House races, said Sanders's presence lends instant credibility to the GOP's long-standing efforts to tie any Democrat to the far left. Republicans frequently accused Democrats of being socialist in 2018, but the effect was muted in a field dominated by moderate candidates.
'Part of making a message effective is that it has to be believable,' Conston said. 'You not only have now a series of actual votes and actual positions among members of Congress "" not just candidates "" you add on top of that, a presidential candidate whom we don't just accuse of being a socialist, he openly says he is. That creates a completely different reality for a voter than before.'

Down-ballot candidates will not be able to simply spurn Sanders if he is the nominee, prominent Democrats warn, lest they risk the ire of his base. Former Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), who presided over efforts to win the Senate back for Democrats in 2006 and expanded that majority to a filibuster-proof margin two years later, said in an interview Thursday that as the nominee, Sanders would have to personally assure Senate candidates like Arizona's Kelly and former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper that they have a free hand to run their campaigns on their own terms "" and distance themselves without fearing blowback.
'He cannot be a distant leader of the party,' Reid said, discussing the possibility of a Sanders nomination. 'He's going to have to be personally involved with it, so they feel comfortable. If not, there's going to be a problem.'
Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a co-chairman of the Sanders campaign, said the senator is 'not going to have an iron fist' should he win the nomination.
'He's going to build a coalition through persuasion and a grass-roots movement, and he's going to  give people the ability to depart on issues if they are representing their districts,' said Khanna, who represents Silicon Valley and does not share some Sanders positions critical of the tech industry. 'You know how I know this? He's given me the ability to depart on issues as a co-chair where I may disagree with him. He's a person who recognizes the value of intellectual dissent.'
Sanders's backers "" and some other Democratic Party strategists "" believe the risk to down-ballot candidates is overstated, especially since so many of the Democratic candidates in competitive races are raising more money than their GOP opponents. In a polarized political atmosphere, they argue, the specifics of a presidential candidate's platform will ultimately matter little "" leaving down-ballot candidates more room to forge their own identities.
Ian Russell, a former national political director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee who is now consulting for multiple Democratic congressional campaigns, said that any challenges for swing-district Democrats will not be unique to Sanders.
'If you are seen as simply a rubber stamp for your party, then you have problems,' Russell said. 'You need to already be working in your district to show that you're focused on solutions.'
Khanna said Sanders's leftist economic platform can have appeal in the suburbs "" if packaged appropriately.
'You can talk about these issues in a way that is pro-economic growth. You can talk about these policies in a way that is pro-business,' he said. 'What I believe is that he is going to get extraordinary turnout for our party at the top of the ticket. He is going to connect with working-class voters who Trump took from us last time, and then every candidate can tailor their message to their districts.'
Yet Republican strategists, who have often tried unsuccessfully to separate down-ballot candidates from their own unpopular president, say that task has become increasingly difficult in recent years. 
'It feels like we are moving to almost a parliamentary system where voters are voting straight ticket,' said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, who has found in recent polling that Trump is significantly more popular than Sanders in competitive House races. 'Sitting back and watching the Democrats and their primary is an extraordinary experience, and I am glad it's not us.'

DES MOINES "" The opening of the political year has collided with the end of the impeachment of President Trump. The coincidence of timing, unplanned perhaps but symbolic nonetheless, points directly to what is at stake when Americans vote in November. For now, healing is not on the agenda.
Impeachment is an infrequently used tool to restrain a runaway or corrupt president. On Wednesday, Trump will become the third president to be acquitted after being impeached. No president has ever been impeached and convicted, though, of course, Richard M. Nixon resigned and left town to avoid such a fate.
Trump will never escape the fact of having been impeached, but he will, no doubt, see acquittal as a victory. His supporters will share in that conclusion, offended that it ever came to this. Half of the country, however, that portion of the population that has said in polls they believe Trump should be removed from office for abusing his powers, will be at a minimum disappointed. Many of them will be genuinely angry.
That is the pretext for this election year. For both sides, November will offer the only avenue to resolve the question of how long Trump remains in office and what boundaries the American people choose to set on a presidency. There is no more significant question facing voters, and they are sharply divided in their views.

On Tuesday night, on the eve of the Senate's scheduled acquittal vote, the president will deliver his State of the Union address before an evermore divided House chamber. No matter what he says, no matter the claims he makes about himself and his accomplishments, the real state of this union at the beginning of 2020 is fraught: sour despite a good economy; distrustful of the opposition; despondent over seemingly permanent divisions; anxious about the future of democracy at this point in the country's history. Impeachment has only intensified those feelings.
The Senate trial has done nothing to help restore public confidence. On Friday, by 51 to 49, the Senate voted against calling witnesses to testify, preferring to push ahead to final votes. For a time, the outcome of that vote seemed in the balance. By the time it came, only two Republicans were prepared to buck their leadership and the president.
The vote blocked an appearance by former national security adviser John Bolton "" or anyone else with potentially relevant knowledge of what the president said and did in withholding military aid to Ukraine in an effort to get that country to announce investigations into former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter. Bolton has made clear he is willing to testify. Leaks of what he has written in his forthcoming book have been tantalizing, if not dispositive.

All senators swore to weigh impartial justice during the trial. In the end, the GOP showed what it means to be a member of what used to be called the Republican Party but now is simply the Party of Trump. This is not a new observation: Over the past four years, the president has remade the party into a wholly owned subsidiary of Trump Inc.
Friday's vote showed the value of that remaking, and the explanations provided by two Republicans "" Sens. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, whose votes ultimately blocked witnesses "" are telling examples of how distorted the process became.
Murkowski concluded that the impeachment process was a failure and there was no reason to continue it. 'Given the partisan nature of this impeachment from the very beginning and throughout, I have come to the conclusion that there will be no fair trial in the Senate,' she said. 'I don't believe the continuation of this process will change anything. It is sad for me to admit that, as an institution, the Congress has failed.'

Alexander offered a different rationale for his vote. He waited until he was faced with the decision on whether to allow testimony to express real misgivings about what the president did. He concluded that the House managers had proved their case, that the president's actions were inappropriate but that what Trump did was not enough to warrant removal from office.
'The Constitution does not give the Senate the power to remove the president from office and ban him from this year's ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate,' he said. 'The question then is not whether the president did it, but whether the United States Senate or the American people should decide what to do about what he did. I believe that the Constitution provides that the people should make that decision in the presidential election that begins in Iowa on Monday.'
Most Republican senators have been unwilling even to describe what the president did as inappropriate. Instead, they have preferred to criticize House Democrats for what they say was a rushed and partisan impeachment process. By blocking witnesses, those senators have chosen to deny voters, in whose judgment they claim to be entrusting so much, additional and relevant information that might inform their decisions about whether the president deserves a second term in office.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) resisted impeachment for months and months, despite facing pressure from her liberal block. When the details of the president's pressure campaign against Ukraine in pursuit of his own political interests became public last fall, she changed her position, and her troops rushed to finish, pushing against an arbitrary, year-end deadline. In the end, the vote to impeach failed the test Pelosi had set out earlier, which is that, for impeachment to be successful, it should be bipartisan.
The Senate took a page from the House, deciding that a rushed process was in their interest and certainly the interest of the president, despite strong support from the public for testimony from witnesses who had relevant information and not yet been heard. They have ended up drawing no lines on presidential behavior. Trump, whose view of presidential power is extravagant, will interpret the result as he pleases.
That leaves the issue of Trump's future "" and questions about presidential powers, presidential behavior and the parameters of the Constitution "" back where it always was destined to be, with the voters.
The impeachment process has left many Democrats frustrated or worse. The votes in the Senate were stacked against them. That is not the case for the election that will be held in November.
Trump starts with advantages, the normal benefits of incumbency as well as the strength of the economy. He also starts, however, with almost half the people in the country saying they definitely will vote against him.
On Monday night, Iowa Democrats will trigger the process by which the party selects a nominee to challenge the president. Despite a year of campaigning, that choice has left countless people who want nothing more than to defeat the president almost frozen in indecision as they evaluate a field of candidates, none of whom appear to be a sure winner in November.
The impeachment process will soon be over, but its impact and meaning will remain to shape the choice in this election year. Because Trump is no ordinary president, this was never to be an ordinary reelection campaign. It was always destined to be one of the most significant in voters' lifetimes. After impeachment, the choices for voters are all the more fundamental "" and the outcome all the more consequential for the future of the country.

Elizabeth Warren's biggest applause line at Tuesday night's Democratic debate had all the road-tested messaging appeal of a pink-pussyhatted women's march. Gesturing to the male candidates on the stage, she whipped out some math: 'Collectively [the men] have lost 10 elections. The only people who have won every election . . . are the women!' 
The audience ate it up. The future is female! Nasty women! Nevertheless she persisted, and so did Amy Klobuchar!

Surely the moment was planned. Memorizing each of your opponents' loss records could be read as petty, but it got the job done. It dispensed with the sexism question the way we like to see the sexism question dispensed with onstage: breezily, and with a girl-power flourish.
Many female candidates have a go-to line, something capable and Annie Oakleyish that they can pull out for such an occasion; Klobuchar likes to say that of course a woman can beat Donald Trump, 'Nancy Pelosi does it every day.' What else are the candidates supposed to do? In debate after debate, moderators wedge sexism somewhere between Medicare-for-all and the Iran nuclear deal, then set their timers. I
n 45 seconds or less: Is America ready for a female president?
As if that question could be answered in 45 seconds, or 75 seconds. As if we haven't been trying to answer it for years.
The hook this time around was a Rashomon-like conversation that took place between Warren and Bernie Sanders more than a year ago as both were considering White House runs, and which CNN had revealed on Monday. Warren says Sanders told her that a woman couldn't win in 2020, and 'I disagreed.'
In the debate, Sanders denied he'd ever said such a thing, highlighting his track record for supporting female politicians, including Warren herself. Earlier that day, his campaign had outlined his version of the conversation in a statement: 'What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could.' 
Pundits had 


teed this up as a conflict, as if one of the candidates were lying. In 45 seconds or less: how quickly can
 you throw your longtime friend and colleague under the bus?

It's entirely possible that both of them were telling the truth, though. It's possible Sanders believed he was merely warning Warren that the race would be even harder for her, and it's possible Warren believed he was saying something more forceful: that President Trump's skill with weaponizing misogyny made Sanders doubt a female candidate's viability.
It's possible we still prefer our discussions of sexism in politics to be peppy, upbeat one-liners, because the alternative is for them to be messy rehashings of 'whether a woman can be president.' That question isn't ever about the woman but about her potential voters and the moral fantasies we spin about ourselves.

Presumably, whatever Bernie Sanders said or didn't say, he wasn't trying to imply that a woman wasn't good enough to win "" which would be a judgment about women "" but rather that any woman running for president would face a country that wasn't good enough to vote for her. Which is a judgment about society.
In that case, Sanders wasn't saying anything that worried Democrats, including many women, haven't said for months "" the 'electability' argument via which hordes of voters apparently plan to vote for Joe Biden not because they like Joe Biden but because they think their neighbors do. That argument says: I'm not sexist, but in order to defeat Donald Trump, we have to live in the real world, which is.
That argument is reasonable, sort of. If your primary goal is putting out a fire, then your instinct is to hand the hose to the firefighter wearing the most flame-retardant gear. In this case: the candidate protected by his age, sexual orientation and XY chromosomes. That argument is also utterly exhausting. Because it's also saying: I'm not sexist, but my position is that we should capitulate to the sexists by nominating only male candidates until the problem miraculously fixes itself. I'm not sexist, but rather than trying to make the world better, I think we should meet the world where it is, which is to say, in hell.
When is someone acknowledging sexism, and when is someone just being sexist?
That's actually the conversation that should have happened on the debate stage. 
Not Elizabeth Warren firing up a women-take-care-of-business sound bite, but Elizabeth Warren admitting that, yeah, it's actually heartbreaking to have even your good friends tell you that the country won't believe in you enough to vote for you. Yeah, you worry that if you lose, people are going to say it's because you're a woman, and the loss will unfairly impact female candidates for years to come.
Not Bernie Sanders denying that he'd ever even thought such a thing but Bernie Sanders admitting that of course he'd thought such a thing, just like many voters had. He worried that the country would eviscerate a female candidate, as had happened many times before, and he was trying to balance that fear against his very real desire for gender equality in politics.
Not two candidates trying to convince the country that it isn't sexist "" Look at how many times you've voted for ladies! "" but two candidates talking frankly about sexism and our fears surrounding it. 
That's what America needs if it's going to stop enacting the same hackneyed psychodrama over and over. Something like: The only sexism we have to fear is the fear of sexism itself.
Which might be too clunky to work as a rah-rah T-shirt slogan, but it does fit into 45 seconds.

The four men are gathered around a table cluttered with glasses inside an exclusive Parisian cigar bar, beaming as they each offer an ebullient thumbs-up for the camera.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, President Trump's personal attorney, is flanked by Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, two Soviet-born emigres who were helping him hunt for damaging information about Democrats in Ukraine and who now face federal campaign finance charges. At the center of the photo is a new character in the Trump-Ukraine drama: an executive at a company owned by Dmytro Firtash, a Ukrainian gas tycoon who has been allied with pro-Russia interests and is currently fighting extradition to the United States to face bribery charges.
Photos of the May cigar bar huddle provided to The Washington Post capture a new moment in Giuliani's operation to procure information from Ukrainian sources to bolster his presidential client. That effort, which played out in various European cities last spring and summer, led Giuliani to seek information from Firtash's network and other controversial figures with much to gain from helping Trump's private lawyer.
The previously untold story of how Giuliani and his associates reached out to the Ukrainian tycoon "" whom the former New York mayor had previously blasted publicly for alleged ties to organized crime "" shows the lengths Giuliani went to in his campaign to defend Trump in the Russia investigation and undermine former vice president Joe Biden. And it highlights how details about his activities are still coming to light, even after weeks of testimony in the House impeachment proceedings.
The Firtash executive who met with Giuliani in Paris was an aspiring Ukrainian politician named Dmitry Torner, later accused by Ukrainian authorities of escaping incarceration in Moldova and living under a new name. The following month, Giuliani sat down in London with other Firtash representatives, according to Otto Dietrich, an attorney for Firtash. Later that summer, Firtash's attorneys filed a court document that Giuliani touted publicly as support for his claims about Biden.
In a statement, Giuliani said he did not remember meeting Torner or details of his meetings in Paris and London and had limited interest in Firtash. 'I never met him. I never did business with him,' he said of Firtash. He did not respond to follow-up questions after The Post obtained photos of the Paris gathering.
On Tuesday, in advance of the Senate trial to consider the articles of impeachment against Trump, House leaders released a cache of text messages and documents turned over by Parnas that contain new revelations of how the president's lawyer sought to extract information from Ukrainian sources.

Among them: handwritten notes Parnas took during a conversation with Giuliani, according to his attorney, that refer to discussions about Firtash as part of the Ukraine pressure campaign.
Parnas's attorney, Joseph A. Bondy, also provided The Post with photos of the Paris meeting. They were not included in the trove of materials released by the House, indicating that there is still more to be gleaned from Parnas's records.
In the past year, Giuliani and his associates sought information from an assortment of Ukrainians with checkered reputations, including several current and former prosecutors.
None were more high-profile than Firtash, a backer of pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine who has been accused by U.S. prosecutors of having ties to organized crime. Firtash, who has been living in Vienna under travel restrictions since U.S. federal bribery charges were unsealed against him in 2014, has denied such connections and the allegations against him.

Giuliani has acknowledged that he sought information from Firtash associates but downplayed his efforts, saying that he quickly learned the wealthy Ukrainian had no useful material and moved on. In an interview in October, he said that while he had never met Firtash himself, he 'met with people who knew him.'
In a statement this week, Giuliani said he spoke with a Chicago-based attorney who is handling Firtash's federal case to see if he had 'evidence of corruption in Ukraine in 2016' to bolster his defense of Trump.
'I asked some questions about him because I thought he might have some relevant information,' Giuliani told The Post. 'I determined that he didn't.'
He said that Parnas urged him to keep reaching out to Firtash associates, but that he rejected the idea because he did not believe the tycoon had any pertinent information.
But Bondy, who has been urging Congress to call his client as a witness, said Parnas would be prepared to describe Giuliani's outreach to Firtash.
'If called upon to testify, Mr. Parnas would say that Mr. Giuliani never rejected efforts to establish a line of communication with Mr. Firtash, and that, to the contrary, he did everything possible to secure that channel,' Bondy said.
A member of Firtash's legal team has said the Ukrainian energy mogul played no role in Giuliani's efforts to obtain material on Democrats.
A powerful Russian ally

In interviews, Giuliani has said he cast a wide net as he sought information to bolster his claims that Ukrainians worked with Democrats in the 2016 campaign and about Biden and his son, who served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma.
With the help of Parnas and Fruman, he coordinated with sources such as Yuri Lutsenko, then Ukraine's top prosecutor, as well as his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, to gather material to support his theories and seek public statements by Ukrainian officials that would damage Biden. U.S. officials have criticized both former prosecutors for allowing corruption to fester.

Firtash, however, was a far more fraught source to cultivate "" particularly for the personal attorney to the U.S. president.
His fortune was largely derived from his ownership of a company that distributed gas from Russia's state energy giant in Ukraine. He used his resources to fund pro-Russian political and media interests in Ukraine.
The role required him to maintain close ties to the Kremlin and in Ukraine, where he was a close ally of Ukraine's Russia-leaning president at the time, Viktor Yanukovych.
The U.S. case alleges that Firtash helped orchestrate a scheme to bribe Indian officials for licenses to mine titanium intended for sale to a U.S. company. In a 2017 court filing, prosecutors argued to a judge that Firtash had ties to the 'upper echelons' of Russian organized crime.
In March, Giuliani used the allegations about Firtash to take a swipe at Lanny Davis, a longtime friend of Bill and Hillary Clinton who then served as a lawyer for both the Ukrainian gas mogul and Trump's former personal counsel Michael Cohen.
'Lanny Davis represents a gentleman named Firtash,' Giuliani told the Hill at the time. 'He is considered to be one of the close associates of [Semion] Mogilevich, who is the head of Russian organized crime, who is [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's best friend.'
Firtash was 'considered to be one of the high-level Russian organized crime members or associates,' added Giuliani, a former U.S. attorney who has cast himself as an enemy of corruption and mobsters.
Nicknamed the 'boss of bosses,' Mogilevich was indicted in Pennsylvania in 2003 on more than 40 counts of racketeering, fraud and money laundering. The FBI named him to its 'most wanted' list, with an agent declaring that law enforcement believed he had been involved with 'weapons trafficking, contract murders, extortion, drug trafficking, and prostitution on an international scale.' Born in Ukraine, Mogilevich is now believed to be living in Moscow.
Firtash has said he has no ties to Russian organized crime and did not do business with Mogilevich. 'Half the country knows him. So what?' Firtash told Time magazine in 2017. 'Knowing him doesn't mean answering for him.'
Victoria Toensing, an attorney for Firtash, called the claims that Firtash has ties to organized crime 'false.' She and other members of his legal team have complained that the Justice Department has not presented evidence to support the allegation.

While Giuliani expressed distaste for Firtash, the energy tycoon was a potentially valuable connection for his two associates, Parnas and Fruman, who at the time were seeking to secure deals in the gas sector, according to people familiar with their efforts, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.
In 2018, they incorporated a new company in Delaware called Global Energy Producers, public records show. By March 2019, the two were seeking a deal with the Ukrainian state-owned gas company, which has done billions in business with Firtash but has recently been locked in a financial dispute with him, the people said.
Giuliani's introduction to Firtash's network began in May. That's when Fruman told a person familiar with his account that he happened to run into a friend in the lobby of a Kyiv hotel who could get to Firtash.
Torner worked as the head of the analytics department at an electricity and gas distribution company in Ukraine owned by Firtash, according to public records and information he later provided election officials in Ukraine when he launched a bid for the parliament as part of a pro-Russian political party.
Representatives of Firtash declined to comment on Torner's role.
On the eve of parliamentary elections in July, Ukrainian authorities announced that Torner had been disqualified because officials had discovered that he held multiple fraudulent Ukrainian passports under various names.
According to Ukraine's Security Service, Torner is a citizen of Moldova named Dmitry Nekrasov who was wanted for escaping incarceration in his home country and changed his name to start a new life in Ukraine.
The Moldovan Ministry of Internal Affairs did not respond to requests for information.
Torner could not be reached for comment.
Andrei Tsygankov, an attorney for Torner, said he does not have any information indicating that Torner is facing prosecution in Ukraine or any restrictions on his movement in and out of the country. He declined to comment on matters beyond Ukrainian legal issues. In a statement, Ukraine's Security Service said there is no wanted notice for Torner in that country.
Torner's wife, Olga, who has worked as an anchor for a Ukrainian news channel, said in a series of text messages that the accusations leveled by Ukraine's election commission and intelligence agency ahead of the country's parliamentary election in July were 'completely fabricated' to keep him off the ballot.
She said he changed his name legally and is not wanted for any crimes in any country. She sent an image of what she said was a certificate from Moldova vouching for his clean record.
'How is it even possible to escape prison?' she wrote.
A string of meetings

In late May, a few weeks after Fruman told an associate that he encountered Torner in Kyiv, Giuliani met with the Firtash executive in the private cigar bar of the luxury hotel Le Royal Monceau Raffles Paris, according to people familiar with the encounter.
Photos show the president's attorney clasping Torner in a firm handshake and the Firtash executive beaming as his hand rests on Giuliani's shoulder.
In a text message, Giuliani said he did not remember Torner's name and had no notes from his Paris meeting. 'Don't recollect him. He didn't make an impression,' he wrote, adding that if Torner has any information that could assist his investigations, 'I wouldn't mind hearing it.'
In June, a few weeks after the Torner meeting, Fruman and Parnas secured a meeting with Firtash himself, traveling to Vienna to discuss whether the powerful Ukrainian could assist Giuliani, a person familiar with the meeting said.
Firtash told the New York Times last fall that a mutual acquaintance had vouched for the two Americans, but he declined to name that person. People familiar with the meeting identified Torner as the acquaintance to whom Firtash was referring.
Looming over Firtash at the time was the prospect of extradition to the United States. During the meeting, he told the duo that he was considering replacing Davis as his attorney in the United States and asked about engaging Toensing and her husband, Joe diGenova, two longtime Giuliani allies, as The Post previously reported. Parnas vouched for the couple, who had provided informal advice to Trump's legal team, and urged Firtash to hire them.
Firtash told the Times that Parnas and Fruman assured him they could help him find 'good lawyers in D.C.' who could make his case to the Justice Department.
Giuliani said in a statement to The Post earlier this week that he did not recommend that Firtash retain Toensing and diGenova.
'I have no knowledge who Mr. Firtash considered hiring as his lawyer,' he said.
The cache of documents released by the House on Tuesday included handwritten notes Parnas scribbled on stationery from Vienna's Ritz-Carlton Hotel in which he appears to describe the effort to persuade Firtash to replace Davis with Toensing and diGenova.
According to Bondy, Parnas wrote the notes in his Vienna hotel room while speaking by telephone to Giuliani during a June visit to the Austrian capital.
'Get rid of Lenny Davis (nicely!),' Parnas wrote. He added, 'Victoria/Joe retained' and '$100,000-month.' He also wrote, 'Firtash toxic,' a possible reference to allegations against the tycoon.
On another sheet, Parnas referred to the effort to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to announce investigations related to Biden, writing: 'get Zalenksy to Annouce that the Biden case will be Investigated.'

Later in June, Giuliani was in London for a whirlwind trip: He was photographed attending a special overseas Yankees baseball game with Parnas and a fundraiser for a charity that assists Ukrainian Jews displaced by the conflict with Russia-backed rebels in Ukraine's east.
He also met with an Austrian lawyer for Firtash who is representing the mogul in the extradition proceedings. The lawyer, Dietrich, said the two met in a conference room of a London hotel, but he declined to offer further details.
People familiar with their encounter said it was also attended by Denis Gorbunenko, a former Ukrainian banker close to Firtash. Gorbunenko did not respond to requests for comment.
At the meeting, Giuliani inquired whether Firtash had information about his investigations into whether the Ukrainians had interfered in the 2016 election, as well as the Bidens and Burisma, according to the people.
'I have no recollection of any meeting with the Dmitry Firtash legal team in London or anywhere regarding asking for information about Joe Biden,' Giuliani said in his statement to The Post.
Five days after the London meeting, Parnas sent Giuliani a text message, according to the materials released by the House: 'Going to Vienna.'
'Wow!' Giuliani responded.
Just a few weeks later, on July 23, Davis, who had been registered as a foreign agent to represent Firtash, filed paperwork indicating that his engagement had been terminated. In a statement at the time, he said he had been replaced by Toensing and diGenova.
Firtash told the Times that he agreed to pay the couple $1.2-million over four months. The legal duo then hired Parnas as a translator, paying him $200,000 for the same period, prosecutors have said.

Parnas and Fruman soon told friends that Firtash was paying for their highflying lifestyle, including private plane rides and luxury hotel stays. They also said they were pursuing a multimillion-dollar gas deal with Firtash. Firtash told the Times that he paid for the pair's expenses for a period as they explored a possible side project to sell gas to Ukraine.
Meanwhile, Toensing and diGenova secured a meeting in late August with Attorney General William P. Barr to argue that Firtash had been unjustly pursued by the Justice Department.
Around the same time, Firtash's lawyers found a new piece of evidence to argue that his 2014 arrest on the request of the Americans had been politically motivated and that the Austrians therefore should block his extradition.
It was a 12-page sworn affidavit from Shokin, the former Ukrainian prosecutor, that speculated that Biden had engineered Firtash's arrest to prevent him from interfering with U.S. policy in Ukraine.
In the middle of the document, the affidavit included an unrelated claim from Shokin "" that as vice president, Biden had engineered his ouster as Ukraine's top prosecutor in 2016 because he was investigating Burisma, the gas company that placed Hunter Biden on its board.
It was the same claim Shokin had made months earlier to Giuliani, which Trump had cited in his request to the Ukrainian president for an investigation into the Bidens. Other Ukrainian and U.S. officials have said the Burisma investigation appeared stalled when Biden and other Western officials urged Shokin's removal.
The Burisma claim was not directly related to Firtash's case. But as part of Shokin's affidavit, it was signed and notarized on Sept.-4 and filed under seal in the Austrian court case.
Not long after, an Austrian court announced it was reviewing the material and put Firtash's extradition on hold. Three weeks later, it was obtained by conservative columnist John Solomon and published in the Hill.
Giuliani cited the affidavit from Shokin to bolster his claims about Biden, holding up a copy of the document during a September television appearance and accusing the media of overlooking its significance.
After Parnas and Fruman were arrested in October on charges of funneling foreign money into U.S. elections, federal prosecutors in New York said they discovered 'suspicious' financial links between Parnas and a lawyer for Firtash. (Parnas and Fruman have pleaded not guilty.)
The lawyer, Ralph Oswald Isenegger, sent five wire transfers of $200,000 to Parnas's wife in September, prosecutors said in court. In a statement, Isenegger said the funds were his personal money he had lent to Parnas and his wife and that Firtash was not aware of the arrangement.
Toensing and diGenova said in a statement that they had been unaware of the financial arrangement.
In early October, they were informed that their appeal to Barr on Firtash's behalf had failed. The attorney general declined to intercede in the case, and the Justice Department released a statement indicating that the case against Firtash 'has the support of department leadership.'

Acquittal, economy, Iowa flop feed angst over odds of fall Democratic victory




Anxiety is coursing through the Democratic Party as President Trump emerges from his impeachment proceedings as a potent threat for reelection, with party leaders and activists uncertain about how to beat the incumbent and worried about a nominating race that remains crowded and is growing more acrimonious.
While Democrats see Trump as a corrosive figure and a threat to the nation, they also see the president and his well-funded campaign tailoring a reelection bid around the strong economy and visceral appeals to his ardent supporters.
Trump's robust political standing came into view this past week, as he claimed vindication from his acquittal in his Senate trial despite damaging House testimony about his conduct with Ukraine "" and set off on a path of retribution by ousting some officials who were witnesses. At the same time, his Gallup approval rating ticked up to 49 percent, its highest point yet.
The developments have generated convulsions of angst among Democrats, who watched their first-in-the-nation Iowa presidential caucuses conclude in a chaotic fiasco and deliver an inconclusive result. Many in the party are now sounding the alarm that denying Trump a second term could be far more difficult than they had calculated.

'We have a president who isn't merely unconventional or challenging institutions and elites, or coloring outside the lines. He's unmoored,' Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.) said. Yet, Coons added, he is 'very aware' that Trump could win reelection 'with these economic numbers at his back, all as millions of Americans grow numb to his behavior.'
Since Democratic presidential hopefuls began running through the starting gates a year ago, party activists have been consumed with the question of electability "" specifically, which of the roughly two dozen initial candidates could best stack up against Trump. The result so far has been a form of paralysis, with no presumptive favorite in the race and each leading contender struggling to overcome vulnerabilities and erase doubts.
'The obsession with concocting the Frankenstein to take on Trump has confined us all,' said Jennifer Palmieri, a longtime party strategist who advised Hillary Clinton in 2016 and is not aligned with any candidate this time. 

Palmieri spent the past couple of weeks on the ground in Iowa and New Hampshire observing the candidates up close, including the president, who staged a large rally in Des Moines before the caucuses. She came away deeply concerned about her party as it grapples with how to counter a norm-shattering executive who relishes political combat.
'We are letting Trump drive our process and getting ourselves all tangled up in who might be the best person to foil him,' Palmieri said. 'That became really clear to me just being in Iowa. The voters were so lost. They didn't have any orientation, no grounding. . . . They felt paralyzed by this choice.'



Former Ohio governor Ted Strickland, a supporter of former vice president Joe Biden, agreed: 'The party is torn. It's polarized about what it wants to do. There is a world of difference between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden and no one really knows which way it's going to go "" and you have Pete Buttigieg, a talent, in the mix, and Mike Bloomberg rearing his head here before Super Tuesday.'
Many Democrats lament that they feel stuck in a cycle controlled by the president, with Trump shaping the contours of the race just as he did in 2016 with a blizzard of incendiary statements, lies and provocations "" and, this time, a loyal Republican Party that cheers him at every turn.
'We spend too much time chasing whatever foolishness Trump throws out there, and he's masterful at it,' said Cornell Belcher, a veteran Democratic pollster. 'This has got to be an election fundamentally about Democrats' vision for bringing the country together and solving the big problems that confront us. And if a Democrat can do that, a Democrat can have a good chance of cobbling back together and even expanding the Obama coalition "" and that will beat Trump.'

In his State of the Union address last Tuesday, Trump laid out what he sees as his road map to reelection. 
Trump boasted of his stewardship of the economy under the theme a 'great American comeback.' He threw red meat to his base, in the form of hard-line rhetoric on illegal immigration and policies on religious liberty, guns and charter schools. He made direct appeals to black voters who had shunned him in 2016 by touting his work on criminal justice reform and other issues. 
Trump also orchestrated dazzling reality-show reveals, such as first lady Melania Trump awarding talk-radio icon Rush Limbaugh the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And the president's speech featured his customary litany of false statements that outrage Democrats, such as casting himself as a guardian of health coverage for those with preexisting conditions, despite his administration's repeated efforts to repeal and gut former president Barack Obama's health-care law "" all but daring the fact-checkers to blow their whistles.

Trump's speech at the Capitol "" and an hour-plus event Thursday in the East Room of the White House where he bragged and demeaned his opponents "" has created more urgency than ever among some Democrats about calling out Trump or else risk having him define the terms of debate. 
'We've got to be a little more dramatic about exposing him,' Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) said. 'You can't just be anti-Trump alone. You've got to go at the truth.'
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has tried to play umpire, standing over the president's shoulder at the conclusion of his State of the Union and ripping printed pages of his prepared text because, as she later told reporters, she considered it 'a manifesto of mistruths.'

Many Democratic lawmakers celebrated Pelosi, their party's de facto leader until a presumptive presidential nominee emerges, seeing her as a forceful guide at a turbulent crossroads.
'One of Trump's real skills is that he's a fighter, and if someone is going to punch you, punch back 10 times harder,' Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-Pa.), a Pelosi ally, said. 'I like a fighter and how she stands up to him. We've worked with him on a number of issues, but you can't back down to a bully.'
Still, Trump's address was a sobering moment for Democrats.
'The last 24 hours have been a big wake-up call for Democrats. The Iowa caucus was a debacle. Then Donald Trump produced a very strong, clinical speech that shows exactly what he thinks he needs to do to win,' Van Jones, chief executive of Reform Alliance and a former Obama adviser, wrote Wednesday in an op-ed on CNN's website.
Trump is making a deliberate effort to court minority voters. During last weekend's Super Bowl, the president's reelection campaign aired an ad during the game's broadcast spotlighting the criminal justice law. The ad showed Alice Marie Johnson, a 64-year-old black woman from Mississippi who was freed after Trump commuted her prison sentence for a nonviolent drug offense. She is seen in the ad hugging her family and friends, thanking Trump and declaring, 'Hallelujah!'
Trump and his campaign team are banking that this kind of messaging helps him overcome his history of making racist comments and questioning Obama's love of country and credentials. He has a difficult road ahead. A recent Washington Post-Ipsos poll of black voters showed that more than 8 in 10 say they believe Trump is 'a racist,' and 9 in 10 say they disapprove of the president's performance in office. 

Republicans are eager to echo Trump as they try to chip into Democratic strongholds throughout the South and Midwest. Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.), a Trump ally who is running for reelection this year, said Trump's emphasis on criminal justice reform and stoking economic opportunity for minority communities 'sure does' help his own Senate campaign in a state where black and Latino voters are pivotal.
'We've got [historically black colleges and universities], we've got criminal justice reform, we've got the economy going,' Perdue said, arguing that Trump has been the best president for the black community since Abraham Lincoln in the 1860s "" a claim that, like many of Trump's, infuriates Democrats. 
Some Democratic leaders believe their party stands the best chance of defeating Trump with a nominee who can inspire a movement of new voters to register and cast ballots in November's general election, as opposed to one focused on mobilizing existing voters. 
'The other side will try to purge the heck out of existing voters, but if you flood the zone with new voters and arm them with information, they will come out,' said Maria Teresa Kumar, president of Voto Latino. 'If I were selling Nikes, I would not go into saturated markets, because how many people will buy that fifth pair of Nikes? I'd rather go into new markets where people might say, 'Hey, I'd like to buy a pair of Nikes.''
There are tensions, however, about who is best positioned to expand the party's reach: a grass-roots liberal favorite like Sanders (I-Vt.) or Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.); a new face like Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind.; or a self-funder building a massive political machine like Bloomberg, the former New York mayor. 
Biden's weak performance in Iowa has caused particular concern among many of the party's older donors and establishment figures since they have long thought the former vice president could stitch much of the Obama coalition back together and serve as a uniting force in a party divided between left and center.
Democrats believe they retook the House majority in 2018 by focusing on health care and other pocketbook issues in suburban districts, and Pelosi has tried to keep her party following that playbook. She tweeted last week that the three most important issues to Americans are '1) Health care, 2) Health care, 3) Health care.'

But there are sharp differences of opinion on that strategy within the party. Former Texas congressman Beto O'Rourke, who withdrew from the presidential race last fall, said in an interview that Democrats should not stray from speaking in stark terms about Trump's conduct and the stakes for the nation, even if polling suggests they concentrate on other issues.
'There is a school of thought that you shouldn't talk about impeachment and instead talk about infrastructure and health care, as if they're mutually exclusive,' O'Rourke said. 'You can't shy away from the most obvious threat to this country, and if you do, you accept Donald Trump, and then we become complicit in it and we won't win the next election.'
O'Rourke added: 'Many are tempted to despair right now with the president being acquitted or this freak show of a presidency and the cult of personality that the Republican Party has become. But if you give into that, it's over.'
Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), a party stalwart who has been involved with presidential campaigns in her state for decades, said Democrats must keep in mind that political dynamics can quickly change.
'I remember the 1992 campaign at this point when everybody was throwing up their hands, worried that we had 'the seven dwarfs' running against George H.W. Bush,' Shaheen recalled, nodding toward the then-incumbent president's high approval ratings following the Gulf War.
'And then we won,' she said, when Bill Clinton beat Bush later that year.
Shaheen demurred when asked who is 2020's version of Bill Clinton. 
'We'll just have to find out,' she said.

COLUMBIA, S.C. - Former vice president Joe Biden decisively won the South Carolina primary Saturday, as the first Southern primary contest reshaped the race and dealt a blow to the surging candidacy of Sen. Bernie Sanders.
The win pumped new life into Biden's struggling campaign, as he became the first candidate to score a clear-cut victory against Sanders this year, boosting his efforts to become the major alternative to the liberal senator. Still, Sanders (I-Vt.) is polling strongly in several of the Super Tuesday states that vote this week, and it could yet prove difficult for any of his competitors to catch up.
At a minimum, Democrats now face the most unsettled contest in decades, with several candidates showing a potential to win delegates after the winnowing process of the first four primary states. The Democratic race goes national Tuesday, when 14 states and one territory will vote to award 34 percent of the convention delegates. 
What's not clear is whether Biden's triumph in a state supporters have long called his ""firewall,"" where African American voters had a significant say for the first time, will provide only a momentary lift, result in a two-person race between Biden and Sanders - or result in a long slog to the convention.
Still, it was a major win for a figure who has been in public life for 45 years, and his first primary victory in his three presidential runs. Cheers went up at 7 p.m. at a Biden election-night rally in Columbia when MSNBC called the race, and again at 7:04, when the channel was switched to CNN. Biden cast the win as the first of many number of dominoes that will now fall his way, noting that some were counting him out just days ago.
""Now, thanks to all of you - the heart of the Democratic Party - we just won and we won big . . . and we are very much alive,"" Biden said in a victory speech that was pointed directly at Sanders. 
""We have the option of winning big or losing big. That's our choice,"" Biden told a raucous crowd in Columbia. ""We have to beat Donald Trump and the Republican Party, but here's the deal: We can't become like them. . . . We can't have a never-ending war."" 
The Biden campaign hopes to use Saturday's win to consolidate support from many of his rivals, hoping that several drop out - which one of them, businessman Tom Steyer, did shortly after the polls closed. ""Honestly, I can't see a path where I can win the presidency,"" Steyer said in announcing his decision.
Biden also plans a series of high-profile endorsements over the coming days. Rep. Robert C. ""Bobby"" Scott (D-Va.) and former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe announced shortly after Biden's win that they were backing the former vice president.

Nearly half of South Carolina voters said Rep. James E. Clyburn's (D-S.C.) final-week endorsement of Biden was an important factor in their vote, according to exit poll results from Edison Research. 
Sanders, speaking in Virginia Beach on Saturday night, sought to put the results in perspective, ticking off his previous strong performances in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.
""But you cannot win 'em all . . . and tonight we did not win in South Carolina,"" Sanders said. ""And that will not be the only defeat. There are a lot of states in this country, and nobody wins them all.""
After congratulating Biden, he proclaimed, ""And now we enter Super Tuesday - and Virginia!"" 
For all the candidates but Sanders, a further winnowing of the field is crucial to winning the nomination. Sanders is broadly expected to come out of Tuesday with a substantial delegate lead in the race, anchored in his huge polling advantage in California. Under party rules, such leads can be difficult to overcome as the race moves on. 
With most precincts reporting, Biden was poised to win about half the vote, giving him a symbolic victory over Sanders, who did not win more than 34 percent of the vote in any of the first three states. Under party rules, nominees need to secure more than 50 percent of delegates to win the nomination at the convention in Milwaukee in July. 
But the continued viability of so many candidates has increased the likelihood that no candidate will be able to secure such a victory with initial pledged delegates alone, setting up the potential for either a brokered convention or a pre-convention horse trading of delegates by the candidates. 
Complicating the hunt for the nomination is former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, who has spent hundreds of millions of dollars advertising his candidacy to the Super Tuesday states, after deciding not to compete in the first four contests. 
Although his rise in polls had slowed since his first debate performance, Bloomberg still appears positioned to win delegates in many early states, as he continues to swamp his rivals in spending. 
His advisers vowed Saturday night that Bloomberg will stay in the race at least through Super Tuesday, when he will appear on the ballot for the first time. They cited internal campaign data showing that if Bloomberg dropped out it would strengthen Sanders, whose left-leaning policies the former mayor abhors.
""Mike Bloomberg has not been on the ballot yet,"" said Bloomberg campaign manager Kevin Sheekey. ""Our campaign is focused on organizing Democrats and building infrastructure in states all around the country."" 
His campaign announced Saturday that he will buy three minutes of commercial airtime nationally at 8:30 p.m. Sunday night to present his vision for managing the current coronavirus outbreak, which claimed its first American life this past week in Washington state.
After Saturday's outcome became clear, President Trump tweeted, ""Sleepy Joe Biden's victory in the South Carolina Democratic primary should be the end of Mini Mike Bloomberg's Joke of a campaign.""
Biden's support among black voters, who made up most of the electorate in South Carolina, appeared ready to lift a campaign that has struggled to find its footing for more than a year. Biden, a national polling leader in 2019, finished in fourth place in Iowa, fifth place in New Hampshire and second place in Nevada.
African American voters are a crucial pillar of the Democratic coalition, and Biden, along with other Sanders critics, have argued that it will be hard for the Democratic nominee to defeat Trump if he does not have enthusiastic support from the black community. Sanders has replied that he alone among the Democratic contenders has shown the ability to electrify voters and draw big crowds from a broad portion of the electorate.
Before polls closed, Clyburn, who has promised to campaign for Biden in North Carolina next, voiced strong criticism of the operation he was joining. 
""If we are successful tonight in this campaign, if he has a relaunch,"" he told CNN, ""I think we will have to sit down and get serious about how we retool this campaign, how we retool the fundraising, how we do the [Get Out The Vote]. And at that point in time, many of us around the country will be able to join with him and help him get it right.""
Steyer had invested heavily in South Carolina, spending $23.6 million on advertising out of the $36 million spent by all of the candidates, according to the tracking firm Advertising Analytics. But the results showed he did not get a big return on his money.
Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg, who came in first in Iowa and second in New Hampshire, left South Carolina long before voting results came in, a tacit admission of his campaign's low expectations in the state.
His inability to build trust among black voters, despite his early momentum, proved damaging in the state, where he regularly appeared at events designed to appeal to black voters but failed to draw many attendees. 
His campaign staff has shifted to a more target-specific strategy for Super Tuesday, advertising heavily in specific parts of the country, like the Sanders stronghold of Vermont and Norfolk, to boost his delegate haul. The campaign, advisers say, is focused on getting to the 15 percent margin threshold required by party rules to win delegates in as many places as possible. 
""I think there is going to be after Super Tuesday a real focus on narrowing the field,"" Michael Halle, a strategist for the Buttigieg campaign, said in a call with reporters Saturday. ""The candidate or candidates who are closest to the margin are going to be able to stay in.""
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), once seen as among the strongest candidates, had another disappointing showing, after finishing third in Iowa, fourth in New Hampshire and fourth in Nevada. But her campaign has been encouraged by a recent increase in fundraising following two solid debate performances, and she has been helped by an outside group spending millions of dollars in states that vote Tuesday to help her campaign.
Warren also won the endorsement Saturday of Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. Weingarten was acting in her personal capacity - her union decided to support Biden and Sanders as well as Warren - but as a major figure in the labor and education worlds, her backing could carry weight. 
The other player in the race is Sen. Amy Klobuchar, whose home state of Minnesota will vote Tuesday. She also has an aggressive travel schedule over the coming days and has been competing on television in several states, both from her campaign and a supportive outside group.
The South Carolina primary provided sharply different guidance for the party than the previous three contests. But the bigger role of black voters, along with broader concerns about Sanders's effect on Democratic prospects in a general election, up and down the ballot, appeared to have given Biden a second chance.
""Look, I'm very optimistic about today, and I'm very optimistic about the process,"" Biden told reporters at a polling place in Greenville earlier in the day. 
He said his campaign had been bringing in ""about a million dollars a day over the last week or so, and if we win solidly here I think it's going to raise a lot of money as well.""
""The bigger the win, the bigger the bump,"" he said.

DEARBORN HEIGHTS, Mich. - Former vice president Joe Biden seized control of the Democratic presidential contest Tuesday with three victories, including a decisive win in Michigan that struck a devastating blow to Bernie Sanders's ambitions after the senator from Vermont committed his campaign to winning the key Midwestern swing state. 
Biden also scored resounding wins in Mississippi and Missouri, while three other states that cast ballots Tuesday - Idaho, North Dakota and Washington - continued to count ballots. 
""It's more than a comeback. . . . It's a comeback for the soul of this nation,"" Biden said at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia as he made explicit efforts to reach out to all parts of the party. ""This campaign is taking off, and I believe that we are going to do well from this point on."" 
The results showed further evidence of the powerful coalition that Biden has assembled to fuel his remarkable turnaround in the past few weeks, particularly black voters who form the backbone of the Democratic Party and the suburban women who helped drive record turnout for Democrats in the 2018 elections. Biden has also been winning white Democratic voters without a college degree, an important constituency that Donald Trump successfully courted in 2016. The former vice president even outperformed Sanders in some of the state's college communities. 
Democratic voters have demonstrated over the past week, in exit polls and at the ballot box, that they want to avoid the protracted primary battle of 2016 and quickly coalesce behind a nominee who can begin focusing on trying to defeat President Trump. 
A drumbeat has come from party operatives and officials that Biden is the putative nominee and that the fight for the nomination is concluding. 
It was unclear on Tuesday night how fierce that fight would be going forward, with Sanders deciding not to make any public remarks following his disappointing finish.
In his address, Biden said his campaign was ""regenerating the Democratic Party,"" and he reached out to Sanders supporters, thanking them ""for their tireless energy and their passion."" 
""We share a common goal, and together we'll defeat Donald Trump,"" he said.
On a night when he was the only candidate speaking, Biden also made appeals to Republicans and independents.
""Tonight we are a step closer to restoring decency, dignity and honor to the White House,"" he said. ""At this moment, there's so much fear in the country. There's so much fear across the world. We need presidential leadership that's honest, trustworthy, truthful and steady."" 
The wins for Biden come at a time when the presidential race is facing major disruption from the repercussions of the spread of the novel coronavirus. As voters streamed to the polls Tuesday, election workers used hand sanitizer and regularly disinfected voting equipment and in some places supplied medical-grade disposable gloves for voters to use with touch-screen consoles.
The outbreak also affected candidate schedules, with Biden and Sanders canceling their planned rallies in Cleveland on Tuesday night, forgoing a major election night spectacle that campaigns use to communicate with voters and make small-dollar fundraising appeals. While Biden traveled to Philadelphia, where he gave his post-election remarks to staffers who came from the campaign's nearby headquarters, Sanders went home to Burlington, Vt. 

The rally cancellations came after Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine declared a state of emergency and requested that indoor athletic events in the state take place without spectators. Ohio is due to vote on March 17.
""We will continue to consult with public health officials and public health guidance and make announcements about future events in the coming days,"" Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said in a statement. 
The Biden campaign announced shortly afterward that it was canceling a Thursday event in Tampa. Instead, the campaign said, Biden will give an address on the coronavirus response from his hometown of Wilmington, Del.
In 2016, Sanders beat former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in all but two of the states voting Tuesday - Mississippi and Missouri. But Idaho and Washington held caucuses that year, with lower turnouts that benefited Sanders. Those contests were converted to statewide primaries for this year, in part at the urging of Sanders supporters who wanted to increase participation. North Dakota changed its caucus procedures to allow Democrats to participate throughout the day. 
The key test for both candidates Tuesday was Michigan, because it provides an important barometer for how they would do in one of the typically Democratic, industrial Midwestern states that Trump won. The state's voting coalition, with large blocs of students, working-class whites, union-affiliated African Americans and a major Muslim population, was cited by Sanders advisers as a potential showcase for the coalition he hoped to build. 
Over the weekend, Sanders canceled events outside of Michigan and rushed his campaign team into the state, staging an all-out blitz for voters while Biden campaigned across a span of Tuesday-voting states. But earlier on Tuesday, Sanders stopped short of predicting a repeat victory in the state. 
""Let's not say what you have to win,"" Sanders told reporters outside a voting location in Dearborn Heights, Mich. ""We've got a whole lot of delegates to go.""
Michigan voters faced long lines near college campuses, prompting Sanders to release a statement.
""This is an outrage. Election officials must address these problems immediately, and if necessary keep polling places open longer,"" Sanders said.
Preliminary exit polls of Michigan voters casting ballots Tuesday did show that Sanders supporters were far more likely to say they are enthusiastic about his candidacy than Biden backers. Over 8 in 10 voters who supported Sanders said they would be enthusiastic if he wins the nomination, compared with less than 6 in 10 voters who supported Biden who held a similar view about their candidate. 
The share of black voters was on track to be about the same as last cycle, making up 1 in 5 voters. In 2016, Sanders won among white voters, while Hillary Clinton won 68 percent of black voters. 
In one sign that most of the party is prepared to unify behind whichever candidate emerges, about 9 in 10 of Biden's supporters said they would support the party's nominee, according to early exit polls in Michigan, Missouri and Washington. Across those three states, at least 8 in 10 Sanders voters said they would vote for the Democratic nominee in the general election.
Black voters in Mississippi made up almost two-thirds of the electorate, with more than 8 in 10 going for Biden, similar to the 9 out of 10 that Clinton won in 2016. Fueling Biden further was two-thirds support among white voters, a group more typically aligned with Sanders. 
In Missouri, Biden won 3 out of 4 black voters, and voters who made up their mind in the past few days or earlier in March voted almost 2 to 1 in favor of Biden. Roughly two-thirds of Missouri Democratic primary voters said they attend religious services at least occasionally, according to preliminary exit polls. Biden won roughly 7 in 10 of those voters. 
There are few game-changing opportunities left for Sanders. The candidates are scheduled to face off in a two-hour debate on Sunday night in Phoenix, perhaps the last chance for a shift. Next Tuesday, four more states will vote: Illinois, Ohio and Arizona and delegate-rich Florida. 
A spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee said Tuesday there were no plans to cancel the Arizona debate, though organizers continue to speak daily with local health officials. The DNC did alter the format, however, by banning the live audience that has attended each of the previous debates. 
The only candidate remaining aside from Sanders and Biden is Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii). She has collected delegates in only one contest, the caucuses held last week in American Samoa, and did not qualify for the debate. Entering the contests Tuesday, Biden enjoyed a lead in the delegate race. 
Biden has been boosted in recent weeks by the Democratic Party closing ranks behind his candidacy. He has received endorsements of many of his major opponents in the primary fight, including Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Tex.), Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg. 
Another former rival, businessman Andrew Yang, who supported Sanders in 2016, endorsed Biden on Tuesday after the early results. 
""The math shows Joe is our prohibitive nominee,"" Yang said on CNN. ""We need to bring the party together. We need to start working on defeating Donald Trump in the fall."" 
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who dropped out last week, has not endorsed either Biden or Sanders. 
In a sign of further consolidation, Priorities USA, the largest Democratic super PAC focused on the presidential race, announced Tuesday that it would prepare advertising to defend Biden against Republican attacks over the coming months, as his campaign continues to compete in the primaries. The group said the support was a result of his standing in the race and not an endorsement of his campaign. 
""I think there is a recognition that we cannot win the election in the next few months, but we can lose it,"" Priorities Chairman Guy Cecil said in an interview Tuesday. ""We are not going to hold back just because the primary is ongoing.""
American Bridge, another group working to defeat Trump, also promised on Tuesday night to shift its efforts to support Biden. ""Tonight the voices of Democratic voters are loud and clear: They want Joe Biden to be our standard-bearer,"" said Bradley Beychok, the president of American Bridge.
Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-S.C.), a top Biden ally, called on the Democratic National Committee to halt further primaries and any additional debates if Sanders failed to carry any states on Tuesday.
""If the night ends the way it has begun, I think it is time for us to shut this primary down, it is time for us to cancel the rest of these debates,"" he told NPR. ""because you don't do anything but get yourself in trouble if you continue in this contest when it's obvious that the numbers will not shake out for you.""
There remains significant Democratic concern about Biden's ability to rapidly scale up his campaign in the coming months to face Trump.
On Tuesday morning, Biden let out an expletive when challenged by a member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers union over his gun control plans. 
The man told Biden that he was trying to ""end our Second Amendment rights.""
After cursing, Biden added: ""I'm not taking your gun away. I did not say that.""
As Biden and the man went back and forth, union members and campaign staffers tried to intervene, saying there were other people trying to greet the former vice president.
When Sanders campaign manager Faiz Shakir shared a Republican video of the encounter, other Democrats pounced, suggesting that the Sanders campaign was simply parroting GOP talking points.
Shakir later deleted the tweet.

DES MOINES "" Three years after Donald Trump dashed Democratic hopes of electing the country's first female president, a fierce debate has erupted in the party's presidential race about whether a woman can defeat him in November.
As a result, long-simmering questions about gender and sexism have been thrust to the forefront of the primary race just weeks before the first nominating contest on Feb. 3.
Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) acknowledged for the first time this week that they discussed the fraught topic privately more than a year ago. They presented conflicting accounts of their conversation at a debate Tuesday night, with Warren saying Sanders disagreed with her view that a woman could win. Sanders contends that he merely outlined what he said would be Trump's efforts to defeat another female candidate, and in the debate, he said, 'Of course a woman can win.'
Warren took a different approach. Making her most direct appeal yet on the basis of gender, she urged voters not to overlook the added hurdle that female candidates face. But it's one she can clear and make history, she argued, drawing parallels to barriers that Presidents John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama broke.


'Look, don't deny that the question is there,' Warren said. 'Back in the 1960s, people asked, 'Could a Catholic win?' Back in 2008, people asked if an African American could win. In both times, the Democratic Party stepped up and said yes.'


The clash between Sanders and Warren, both personal and public, has abruptly amplified a difficult conversation that has been underway at Democratic gatherings across the country ever since Trump's election. And it cast a spotlight on shifting attitudes in the party toward women running for office in the Trump era.
Hillary Clinton's 2016 loss shocked Democrats and prompted many to wonder whether the country was ready for a female president. But it also pushed women to become more politically involved, leading to a record number of Democratic women in Congress; the return of the first female House speaker, Nancy Pelosi; and a new generation of women joining the presidential contest.
But now, less than three weeks before the Iowa caucuses, two men "" Sanders and former vice president Joe Biden "" have ascended to the top of the polls, joined in some of them by former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Butti gieg. Warren has faded since the fall. And once-promising campaigns by women such as Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) have ended.
'We keep getting stuck in the 'Yeah, but, can a woman beat Trump?' ' said Stephanie Schriock, the president of Emily's List, a group focused on electing Democratic women who support abortion rights. 'We've been, for 12 months, looking at electability in a really narrow way, and it's caused a huge amount of problems in this primary.'
But for many voters, supporting a woman for president is not an easy decision. With Democrats so eager to defeat a president they see as a racist, sexist bully, many say they wonder whether the safest bet to defeat him is a man.
'Because I'm a woman, I suppose I should be wanting [Warren], but I'm not voting for her because she's a woman,' said Marilyn Kean, 78, a Sanders supporter from Wilton, Iowa. 'Too many men that don't want women in there.'
Biden elliptically referred to that calculation earlier this month, when he noted that Clinton faced 'unfair' sexism during her campaign.
'That's not going to happen with me,' Biden said.
Reports about the conversation between Sanders and Warren caught Trump's attention. 'I don't believe that Bernie said that,' the president said Tuesday night at a rally in Milwaukee.
The row between Sanders and Warren brought the debate over gender rushing to the surface in a race that, until recently, had been more cordial than many past campaigns.





It started Monday when CNN first reported on the 2018 one-on-one meeting, in which Sanders allegedly told Warren that a woman couldn't beat Trump. The Sanders campaign vehemently denied the report, with a top aide calling it a 'lie' "" but, in a sign that the issue was not likely to subside, Warren then confirmed it.
The dispute continued at Tuesday night's debate, hosted by CNN and the Des Moines Register, where Warren and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) joined four men on the stage.


'Well, as a matter of fact, I didn't say it,' Sanders said. He said he didn't want to spend much time on the topic, arguing that it would play into Trump's hands, but he added that anyone who knows him would agree that it is 'incomprehensible that I would think a woman cannot be president.'
Sanders said Clinton besting Trump in the popular vote in 2016 was clear evidence that a woman can win. He also said he held back in deciding to run that year before Warren made up her mind about the race.
Warren did not back down from her claim that Sanders told her a woman couldn't defeat Trump. Asked what she thought of his comment, she replied, 'I disagreed.' And she said it was time to attack the subject 'head on.'
'Can a woman beat Donald Trump? Look at the men on this stage "" collectively they have lost 10 elections,' she said, prompting gasps and cheers from the crowd. 'The only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in are the women.' She said she was the only one who had defeated an incumbent Republican in the past 30 years.
Sanders took issue with her comment, saying he defeated a Republican incumbent running for Congress in 1990. Warren responded by pausing to make an exaggerated show of doing the math in her head, before shooting back, 'Wasn't that 30 years ago?' Sanders eventually backed down, saying it was not the major issue of the day.


Klobuchar joined the fray, saying the power of female candidates was evident in recent wins by women in gubernatorial races in Michigan and Kansas. 'You have to be competent to win, and you have to know what you're doing,' she said.
Tensions appeared to remain high immediately after the conclusion of the debate, when Warren and Sanders were caught on video holding a brief yet animated discussion after Warren declined to shake Sanders's hand.




The clash played on the still-raw wounds of the 2016 campaign and continued consternation by some sympathetic to Clinton who saw Sanders and his backers as insufficiently supportive of her in that contest.
The revelations could draw new scrutiny to Sanders, who faced criticism in 2016 for a campaign that many saw as too white and too male. He has taken steps to address that perception, hiring a more diverse staff and securing the support of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) and other women of color.
The sharp break in recollections by Sanders and Warren was particularly unnerving for the liberal wing of the party, fearful that divisions between the two most leftward candidates would usher in a moderate nominee.
'Too much is at stake right now for mutual destruction,' said Rebecca Katz, a liberal strategist who plans to vote for Warren but also likes Sanders. 'Our eyes need to be on the prize.'

A statement from an influential union said as much.
'We can't afford distractions. The only way any candidate can beat either Sanders or Warren is by dividing them. This looks like a desperate attempt to fracture a coalition of the candidates that represent the most popular ideas among working people,' said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants.
The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which backs Warren, said in its own statement that 'a back-and-forth about this private meeting is counter-productive for progressives. In this pivotal moment of the campaign, progressives must work together to defeat Donald Trump and prevent a less-electable establishment candidate like Joe Biden from getting the nomination.'
Others underscored the personal impact of the disputed words.
'Yes, many people have told me a woman can't win in 2020,' tweeted author and columnist Connie Schultz, who is married to Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), who considered a presidential run. 'This is fear speaking, - it has sparked meaningful conversations. But a woman hears this differently when she is the one who is running. It feels personal because it is. Can we please not lose sight of this difference?'
The Gillibrand campaign, which ran on gender issues and gained little traction, conducted research on sexism she faced and found that voters frequently would say that gender didn't matter. But there was a hitch, according to a person familiar with the campaign.
'Voters said they would have no issues with a woman, but they worried that other people might have issues,' said the person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive campaign material. 'That's classic research which shows deflection and actually is more of what that individual thinks.'
In September, a Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 23-percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said a man would be more likely to defeat Trump than a woman; 7 percent said a woman would be more likely to win, while a 69 percent majority said the gender of a candidate didn't matter.
Warren has been putting more emphasis on her gender, seeking to re-energize the anti-Trump passion that gave rise to women's marches and a high turnout of female voters in 2018.
Dan Pfeiffer, a former aide to Obama, compared the current situation with what Obama faced as a black candidate in 2008.
'I would say the challenge now is even more difficult,' he said, adding that in the 2008 campaign, Democrats widely believed that they would defeat the Republican nominee after eight years of George W. Bush. 'The questions of electability were more in the background than they are today.'
He added, 'All of the what I believe to be incorrect racial and gender stereotypes around electability are so much more damaging now.'

Sharp attacks replace wonky policy contrasts ahead of N.H. vote

MANCHESTER, N.H. ""
The Democratic campaign entered a more combustible phase Friday as the party's candidates attacked each other on a debate stage with blistering policy critiques and arguments over who was best positioned to beat President Trump in November.
With no clear front-runner and four days to go before the New Hampshire primary, seven of the party's leading candidates abandoned the wonky policy contrasts and opaque tonal critiques that had filled the race before Monday's caucuses in Iowa. The debate stage became a free-fire zone instead, the candidates seizing the moment to call each other out. 
They harped on age and political records, flashed anger and indignation, and warned their rivals' policy prescriptions would fail. Multiple candidates cautioned that the polling leader, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), would not be electable given his identification as a democratic socialist. 
In a sign of the reordering of the Democratic primary race, it was Sanders and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg who often took control of the stage, engaging in impassioned monologues "" and seeing their records scrutinized "" while rivals raised their hands in the hopes of being called on next.
Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) entered the evening looking to break out of their sudden second-tier status, as billionaire former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg, while not on the ballot or on the debate stage here, continues to increase his campaign spending in the hopes of upsetting the race when he begins appearing on ballots next month.
In one of the most pointed parries, Buttigieg, 38, attacked Biden's longevity in politics, suggesting the party should not 'fall back on the familiar' and urging voters to 'finally allow us to leave the politics of the past in the past.' 
'The politics of the past were not all that bad!' Biden, 77, interjected, pointing toward measures on violence against women, arms control and other legislation he shepherded over the course of more than four decades as a U.S. senator and vice president. 
'I don't know what about the past of Barack Obama and Joe Biden that were so bad,' he said.
Buttigieg also turned toward Sanders, saying a nominee can't be someone 'dividing people with a politics that says if you don't go all the way to the edge, it doesn't count. A politics that says it's my way or the highway.
'Politics should be one of addition and inclusion and belonging,' he said, 'not one that beats people over the head and says they shouldn't even be on our side if we don't agree 100 percent of the time.' Asked if he was referring to Sanders, Buttigieg said yes. 
'I've never said that,' Sanders, 78, responded. 'But let me tell you what I do say. The way you bring people together is by presenting an agenda that works for the working people of this country, not for the billionaire class.' 
Although absent, Bloomberg came under unified condemnation from the stage.
'It's a funny thing,' Sanders said. 'There are millions of people who can desire to run for office. But I guess if you're worth $60-billion and you can spend several hundred million dollars on commercials, you have a slight advantage. That is nonsense.' 
Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) agreed: 'I don't think people look at the guy in the White House and say 'We need someone richer.' '
Biden was more pointed with his rivals than in past debates but seemed to struggle at times to get his message across, while Warren kept her answers focused on the campaign messages she has been delivering for months. Klobuchar, 59, had her strongest debate showing so far, making a direct appeal to a New Hampshire electorate filled with moderates.
'I do not have the biggest name up on this stage. I don't have the biggest bank account. I'm not a political newcomer with no record,' she said. 'But I have a record of fighting for people.'
Klobuchar went up against both Sanders and "" in another chapter in an ongoing dispute "" Buttigieg. She reminded Buttigieg of a line he used regularly in Iowa during the impeachment trial in which he called the proceedings 'exhausting' enough to make him want to change the channel and watch cartoons instead.
After a lively and rambunctious start, however, the candidates also tried to show some form of unity. Buttigieg defended Biden, saying Democrats should not worry about Republican threats to investigate Biden and his son Hunter. 
'We're not going to let them change the subject. This is not about Hunter Biden or vice president Biden or any Biden,' he said. 'This is about abuse of power by the president. The vice president and all of us are competing, but we've got to draw the line somewhere.' 
Biden went over to hug Sanders at one point, both of them displaying wide grins. Warren, 70, tried to cast herself as a unifying candidate and generally refrained from some of the intraparty squabbling. 
'Bernie and I've been friends for a long time,' she said. 'We have a lot of things in common. We have a lot of things that we differ on.'




The sudden shift of dynamics after Monday's Iowa caucuses has raised concern among party leaders that there will be no quick conclusion to the nominating process, potentially forcing a drawn-out contest that deepens party divisions and leads to a weakened nominee. 
'I don't think there's any question, after this week, that Donald Trump can get reelected,' business executive Tom Steyer said, repeatedly returning to the anxiety coursing through the party. 'We have got to win or we are in deep trouble.' 
Even Sanders, who won more popular votes in the Iowa caucuses than any other candidate, admitted that the turnout in the state did not reach the levels of the 2008 election. 'That's a disappointment,' Sanders said. 'And I think all of us probably could have done a better job turning out our supporters.'
Parts of the party are worried about Buttigieg's limited experience and Sanders's democratic socialist identity. At the same time, Biden's claim on electability was undercut by his fourth-place finish in Iowa, and Warren, overshadowed with her third-place finish, has been trying to avoid an embarrassing result Tuesday next door to her home state of Massachusetts.
Biden took critical time away from the campaign trail this week to spend two days at home in Wilmington, Del., as he prepared for the debate, met with advisers and restructured his campaign.
'I took a hit in Iowa and I will probably take a hit here,' Biden said in his first answer of the evening.

Buttigieg challenged Biden's assertion that the party needs to nominate a safe bet "" which Biden defines as himself "" arguing that the bigger risk would be to nominate someone who represents the old ways of doing things.
'The perspective I'm bringing is from somebody whose life has been shaped by the decisions made in those big white buildings [in Washington],' Buttigieg said. 'We need a perspective . . . that will allow us to leave the politics of the past in the past.' 
His opponents cast him as naive. 
'We have a newcomer in the White House right now and look where it got us,' Klobuchar said.


Business executive Andrew Yang, who has run a cheerful campaign and drawn outsized crowds to his economy-infused message, has limited time left to make an impact. 
'Let me say, America, it's great to be back on the debate stage,' Yang, who is 44, said, referring to missing the qualifications for the previous debate. 'I'm so excited.'
More than they have in past debates, the candidates took issue with each other's records. Biden said Sanders should be held accountable for his votes against gun-control legislation "" and that it's not enough for him to claim that he was just representing constituents in a hunting-friendly state. 
'Bernie, while you were representing your constituency, an awful lot of people . . . in California, New York, Pennsylvania, they're getting killed by the thousands during the same period,' Biden said. 
Sanders said he has evolved on the issue. 'The world has changed and my views have changed,' he said.
The group of mostly white candidates had one of its most extended discussions on race and criminal justice issues. The candidates squabbled over their past records, and comments from surrogates, with a focus on the black electorate that will dominate South Carolina's Feb. 29 primary. 
Steyer, 70, twice pressed Biden to apologize for what he and some supporters considered to be racist comments made by one of Biden's top supporters in South Carolina. (Biden said the supporter, state senator Dick Harpootlian, was sorry.) Biden then urged Sanders to answer for comments made in a South Carolina newspaper by one of his supporters made about his history on matters of race. ('Joe Biden is a friend of mine and I'm not here to attack him,' Sanders said).
Buttigieg, who has struggled for support among minority voters, was asked about racial disparities in the criminal justice system in South Bend during his tenure "" in particular, the increase in arrests of black citizens for marijuana possession.
'We adopted a strategy that said drug enforcement would be targeted in cases where there was a connection to the most violent group or gang connected to a murder. These things are all connected, but that's the point,' he said.
Warren was then asked whether Buttigieg's answer was substantial enough.
'No,' she said. 'You have to own up to the facts.'

Sen. Mitt Romney sealed a place in history Wednesday by voting to convict President Trump of abuse of power, becoming a lone voice of dissent in a Republican Party that otherwise has marched in lockstep with the president throughout the impeachment proceedings.
Romney voted against the second article of impeachment, which accused the president of obstruction of Congress. But on the first article, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee said that he found the evidence against Trump overwhelming and the arguments by the president's defense ultimately unconvincing. 
Romney's decision, announced in a deeply personal speech on the Senate floor, where he spoke of his faith and constitutional duty, sparked an immediate and intense outcry among Trump's supporters "" fury that Romney acknowledged is unlikely to fade.
Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, called for Romney to be 'expelled' from the GOP, while many of Trump's congressional allies cast him as a bitter and irrelevant relic of a Republican establishment that has all but crumbled before Trump in recent years.
The senator from Utah stood by his decision as Republican criticism mounted Wednesday, maintaining that Trump abused his office by pressuring Ukraine to investigate a political rival.
'I will tell my children and their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability, believing that my country expected it of me,' Romney said in his floor remarks, calling Trump's conduct 'grievously wrong.'
Romney added, 'We're all footnotes at best in the annals of history. But in the most powerful nation on Earth, the nation conceived in liberty and justice, that is distinction enough for any citizen.'
Romney's vote "" coming after other centrist GOP senators such as Lamar Alexander (Tenn.) decided to acquit Trump even as they scolded him for acting inappropriately "" was hailed by many Democrats as an example of unflinching political courage from a Republican they have long battled.
Following Romney's speech, Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), walked off the Senate floor in tears and remained speechless for several seconds.
'He literally restored my faith in the institution,' Schatz said.
Presidential historian Jon Meacham said Romney is an 'emblem of what so many of us feared was an entirely vanished kind of moderate voice that is guided by reason and not passion. What he did was in the tradition of Dwight Eisenhower, his own father, and George H.W. Bush and Gerald Ford.'
'There's no question that the president asked a foreign power to investigate his political foe,' Romney said in an interview with The Washington Post ahead of his floor statement. 'That he did so for a political purpose, and that he pressured Ukraine to get them to help or to lead in this effort. My own view is that there's not much I can think of that would be a more egregious assault on our Constitution than trying to corrupt an election to maintain power. And that's what the president did.'
The crux of the case against Trump was the allegation that he withheld military aid and a White House meeting to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden and his son. Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company, while his father was vice president.
Romney was one of two Republican senators who supported the effort to summon witnesses and documents. He was the only Republican who crossed party lines Wednesday to join Democrats in voting to convict Trump on the first charge, abuse of power, while voting to acquit on the second, obstruction of Congress.
Inside the Senate GOP cloakroom, Romney's decision was greeted with disappointment but little surprise. Ever since Romney was elected to the Senate in 2018, the 72-year-old senator has parted ways with his party at times and has occasionally criticized Trump "" an approach that has won him few allies in a chamber where Trump's political capital and favor is a prized commodity.
'He's made it very clear from the beginning, even on the witness vote, that he was going to go his own way,' Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) said. 'This is one of those historical votes where everybody has to do what they think is the right thing.'
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) appeared ready to move on from the trial and did not threaten Romney. 
'I was surprised and disappointed, but we have much work to do for the American people, and I think Senator Romney has been largely supportive of most everything we've tried to accomplish,' McConnell said.
For Romney, breaking with Trump carried not just political consequences in a party he once led as its standard-bearer, but also an issue of family dynamics. Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel, the daughter of Romney's older brother, is one of the president's loyalists "" and she firmly stood by Trump on Wednesday.
'This is not the first time I have disagreed with Mitt, and I imagine it will not be the last,' McDaniel tweeted. 
The RNC also sent an email to reporters Wednesday taking aim at Romney, under the subject line, 'Mitt Romney turns his back on Utah.'
Other Trump allies were far harsher in their response to Romney. 'He's now officially a member of the resistance - should be expelled' from the party, Trump Jr. tweeted.
Romney knew his vote to remove the president from office would bring consequences. Already, there is a bill in the Utah legislature that would allow voters to remove a sitting senator. Last week, the Conservative Political Action Conference disinvited Romney to its annual event. He expects worse in the days ahead. 
When Romney was in Florida last weekend, a person at the airport called him a traitor, and someone else later told him to 'get with the team,' followed by an epithet.
 'It's going to be there a long, long, long time,' he said in the interview. 'And you know, the president's going to, you know, use me in rallies. I mean, he likes theater, and I can be part of that. So it's going to be tough.'
Recently appointed Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), facing a tough intraparty primary fight from Rep. Douglas A. Collins, has already used Romney as a foil, attacking him last week for supporting the call for witnesses.
Romney said his decision to vote to convict the president was 'the hardest decision' he has ever had to make and one that he hoped he would never have to make. 'When [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi indicated we're now going to pursue impeachment, my heart sank in dread,' he said. 
For a time, he thought "" or at least hoped "" that Trump's request to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for an investigation into the Bidens during a July 25 phone call represented little more than a throwaway line. As more information came out, Romney came to a different and more worrisome conclusion: that the president had committed a potentially impeachable act.
'He's the leader of my party,' Romney said of Trump. 'He's the president of the United States. I voted with him 80 percent of the time. I agree with his economic policies and a lot of other policies. And yet he did something which was grievously wrong. And to say, well, you know, because I'm on his team and I agree with him most of the time, that I should then assent to a political motive, would be a real stain on our constitutional democracy.'
Romney said he hoped the president's defense team would present evidence during the trial that would exonerate the president. 
He said he even contacted the White House counsel's office, through a fellow senator, asking if it would provide affidavits from officials such as former national security adviser John Bolton or acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, but to no avail.
Romney dismissed arguments that a president could be impeached only if there were a statutory crime, calling that 'absurd on its face,' and saying he could not think of 'a more egregious assault on our constitutional system than corrupting an election and getting a foreign power to do it for you.' What Trump tried to do, he said, is 'what autocrats do in tinhorn countries.'
He also dismissed the arguments that the president was justified in asking Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. He said the former vice president might have been guilty of a conflict of interest but added that a conflict of interest is 'a matter of judgment, but it's not a crime.' As for Hunter Biden, he said, 'He got a lot of money for his father's name. That's unsavory. But again, it's not a crime.'
Some of Romney's Republican colleagues have suggested the issue should be left to the voters in this year's election, rather than having the Senate render judgment. Romney said his reading of the Constitution and the Federalist Papers led him to conclude that the Senate must make the decision.
'The Constitution doesn't say that if the president did something terribly wrong, let the people decide in the next election what should happen,' he said. 'It says if the president does something terribly wrong, the Senate shall try him. And so the Constitution is plain.'

Voter suppression came to mind for some, but the reality was complicated
The lines stretched in the dark across the plaza at Texas Southern University, as hundreds of would-be voters stood for hours Tuesday to cast ballots in the Democratic presidential primary. 
As they waited, students shared phone chargers, activists sent in pizza and exhausted voters resorted to sitting on the ground.
The voting center at the historically black university in Houston was one of a number of such locations around Texas that were plagued by long delays on Super Tuesday, raising questions about the readiness of local election officials and spurring outrage among voting rights advocates. Many cited as a factor the closing of hundreds precincts around the state after a pivotal Supreme Court decision in 2013.
One of the remaining Democrats in the presidential field - Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) - seized on the episode, tweeting that it revealed a ""crisis of voter suppression."" 
However, interviews with election officials, activists and voters pointed to a number of complicated factors that combined to produce the massive lines in Harris County. 
""There was actually a failure in the system at multiple junctures,"" said Beth Stevens, the voting rights program director with the Texas Civil Rights Project, in an interview.
""The effect is that you have black and brown people on college campuses standing in line for two hours, four hours, seven hours to vote,"" she said. 
Harris County Clerk Diane Trautman, a Democrat elected in 2018, tweeted a message of thanks to voters Wednesday morning, saying: ""There is no such thing as a perfect election, but I am committed to always improving the voting process and increasing access to the polls."" 
Election officials noted that Tuesday was the county's first primary using a countywide polling system, which allows residents to cast ballots at any polling center, regardless of where they live. 
In addition to that change, the primary was shaped by the decisions of the local political parties, which were responsible for major issues such as where polling places were to be located, officials said. 
""The Democratic and Republican Party need to agree on everything,"" said Roxanne Werner, the director of community relations for the Harris County Clerk's Office, in an interview. ""All of the polling locations were negotiated by the Democratic and Republican Party with our assistance."" 
Compounding the issue: Turnout was higher than expected, and because Tuesday was a primary, fewer polling locations were open than will be in November. 
Werner said Harris County plans to have all of its polling locations open for the general election in November - about 750 polling places compared with 401 on Tuesday. She said the unusual role of political parties in Texas primaries makes it difficult to compare Super Tuesday to the November vote, which will be run entirely by professional election administrators. 
""Primary elections are different. People don't always realize the full scope of how they're different,"" Werner said. 
Other factors contributed to the long wait times. Texas's Harris County - which includes Houston and is the third most populous county in the country - relies on paperless voting machines that were introduced in 2002. They can be difficult to use and are prone to breaking down, according to election security experts. Several people said in interviews that the machines at TSU did not function consistently throughout the day Tuesday. 
The voting exercise was also complicated by the Harris County Republican Party's decision not to hold a primary jointly with the Democratic Party, officials said. This meant that each party had designated voting machines and that voters from the other party - even if they were waiting in long lines - could not cross over to use the other side's machines. 
Trautman noted in a tweet that she had proposed a joint primary but said ""one party agreed while the other did not."" 
Lillie Schechter, the chair of the Harris County Democrats, said that ""a joint primary would have allowed us to use all the machines at each location for every voter that came in.""
""So when we had machines go down at TSU for a brief period of time, it wouldn't have mattered, because voters would have been able to use all the machines,"" she added.
Genevieve Carter, the communications director at the Harris County Republican Party, argued that a joint primary would not have prevented the long lines. She said that GOP's decision to decline a joint primary reflected a lack of confidence in county election administrators.
""What this comes down to is the county clerk's incompetence and even arrogance,"" Carter said in an interview. ""They have chosen to point fingers rather than fix the way that they went about elections.""
To some advocates, the lines were a sign of the long-term effects of the Supreme Court's 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder. The ruling blocked federal oversight of certain regions of the country that historically had sought to limit the voting rights of minorities. 
To restore the oversight, Congress must approve a new formula to determine which regions merit scrutiny. The Democratic-led House passed legislation last year, but the Republican-led Senate has not taken it up. 
That has left large parts of the country without the robust federal protection of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
""What we saw at TSU yesterday is really voter suppression in 2020,"" said Vanita Gupta, the president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, in an interview. 
""In a lot of ways, I think the American public thinks it's just conspiracy theory when we talk about this. But when you see images like yesterday and hear directly from impacted people who were standing in line . . . I think that the events of last night speak for themselves."" 
In a study released last year, the Leadership Conference found that Harris County eliminated 52 polling places between 2012 and 2018, the fourth-highest number by a county in areas affected by the Shelby decision. At the state level, Texas led the way with 750 polling places closed. 
Gupta pointed to this finding and to reports of the voting machines at TSU breaking down on Tuesday as ""proof points that cry out for change."" 
Trautman vowed after taking office in February 2019 to ""fully comply with the requirements of the Voting Rights Act to protect all of the people of Harris County from the denial of their right to vote . . . particularly concerning the rights of people of color, members of language groups and persons with disabilities."" 
On the TSU campus, freshman Marleta Haynes, 19, said she originally went to vote around 4 p.m. The line seemed long, so she figured she would come back later when it had shortened. 
By when she returned, she said, she was shocked to see that the line now snaked across the campus. She waited for more than five hours, from 6:50 p.m. until midnight. 
""On my feet the whole time,"" she said. ""I had to set an example for others, like my younger brother.""
After four hours of waiting, she finally stepped into the building where the voting machines were and saw that the line zigzagged farther inside.
""I was like, 'Okay, I don't think I can do this. I do not think I can do this,' "" Haynes said. ""But I started texting my friends, and they were like, 'You've been waiting in line for too long; you cannot give up now.' "" 
Haynes said that by the time she left, she had missed the last shuttle to her off-campus student housing. Her phone was dying, so she had a friend call an Uber ride to take her home. It was not the first-time voting experience she had expected, but she said she will not be deterred. She'll vote again in November, she said. 
""But much earlier,"" Haynes said. ""When they tell us there is early voting going on, I will most definitely do that."" 
TSU freshman Kim Rivers, 19, said she got in line when her class let out at 3 p.m. and waited for two hours to vote for former vice president Joe Biden. 
Rivers thought it was unreasonable that there seemed to be the same number of voting machines for Democrats and Republicans. 
""Being in an all-black community, you know there's not many Republicans coming to vote,"" Rivers said. ""Especially on campus at an HBCU. So why do y'all have a whole five voting machines and only five for the Democrats?""

Russian military spies have hacked a Ukrainian gas company that is at the heart of an impeachment trial of President Trump, who sought last year to pressure Ukraine to investigate the company and its links to Joe Biden's son, according to a cybersecurity firm.
Beginning in early November, the Russian spy agency known as the GRU launched a cyber 'phishing' campaign against Burisma Holdings to trick unsuspecting employees into giving up their email credentials so the hackers could gain access to their email accounts "" once again entangling Moscow in domestic U.S. politics, according to Area 1 Security, a Redwood City, Calif., company.
The operation's launch coincided with a congressional impeachment inquiry into Trump and whether he abused his office by seeking to press Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky into announcing a probe of Burisma and Hunter Biden "" an action that conceivably would aid Trump's reelection bid.
The GRU was active in the 2016 presidential campaign, hacking the servers of the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman and releasing their emails that summer and fall. The disclosures disrupted the Democratic convention and undermined Clinton's campaign in the critical final weeks, and the U.S. intelligence community concluded that with such actions Moscow aimed to help Trump and hurt Clinton.
Trump has publicly downplayed the intelligence agencies' conclusions and has suggested that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that interfered in the 2016 election. He and his personal attorney, Rudolph W. Giuliani, have promoted an unfounded theory that Joe Biden, while vice president, tried to quash a corruption investigation of Burisma to protect his son. Hunter Biden is no longer on Burisma's board.
The GRU succeeded in breaching the servers of Burisma Holdings and several subsidiaries and partners, said Oren Falkowitz, Area 1 Security's chief executive.
'The timing of the GRU's campaign in relation to the 2020 U.S. elections raises the specter that this is an early warning of what we have anticipated since the successful cyberattacks undertaken during the 2016 U.S. elections,' Falkowitz said.
Area 1 discovered the breach on New Year's Eve, he said. It was not known what material the GRU gained access to, and if any of it will be released. 
Phishing is the most common technique used by hackers to gain access to victims' systems. Hackers send emails impersonating employees or people trusted by the targets, who are then tricked into clicking on links that contain malware or lead to malware-laced sites, enabling the hackers to obtain the victim's email credentials.
'The success of phishing relies on authenticity,' Area 1 said in a report on the incident released Monday. 'The GRU has applied verisimilitude in extensive masquerading of common business tools . . . to steal account credentials, gain access to internal systems and data, impersonate employees through the unauthorized use of their accounts.'
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence in the fall produced a classified 'national intelligence estimate' that assessed that the Russians would seek to interfere in the 2020 election.

Facebook on Thursday defied public calls to adopt significant new limits on political advertising ahead of the 2020 presidential election, opting instead to introduce minor changes that it said would give users a measure of control over the ads they see.
The company's new rules continue to permit politicians to make false claims in their posts "" including ones they pay Facebook to promote "" and preserve the powerful yet controversial tools that have long helped Democrats and Republicans deliver messaging to narrowly segmented audiences on the social networking site.
Pressure on Facebook to rethink its approach to political ads came from a wide array of federal regulators, digital experts and privacy advocates, as well as some of the company's own employees. They argued that its policies coarsened American political debate and exposed users to serious risks, including viral disinformation, which malicious actors could pay to promote on the site.
But Facebook ultimately sided with President Trump's reelection campaign and other political strategists, both Democrats and Republicans, who had fought fiercely behind the scenes to keep the digital tools that have helped them find new supporters, solicit donations and mobilize voters on Election Day.
The decision sparked a series of rebukes, however: Ellen L. Weintraub, who serves on the Federal Election Commission, sharply criticized the tech giant's approach as 'weak' and motivated by a desire to boost its profits.
Top Democratic presidential candidates, including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), also pilloried the company, expressing concern that Facebook had essentially paved the way for Trump to lie to its users with impunity. And on Capitol Hill, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) accused Facebook of trying to 'fool people with fig leaves instead of taking real action.'
Under its new policies, Facebook said it would give users a choice to see fewer ads about political candidates and social issues, using a tool under development that it plans to roll out in the summer. Users can also select to stop seeing ads from particular campaigns and other entities, including businesses, that target them using custom lists of data, such as their email addresses. And the company announced it would provide more information in its public archive about the total number of people targeted in an ad campaign.
In a blog post announcing the changes, Rob Leathern, Facebook's director of product management for ads, wrote that the company is 'not deaf' to criticism about its rules around political ads. But he maintained that the changes would 'increase the level of transparency it provides for people and [give] them more control over the ads they see.'
Computer scientists who have studied Facebook's ad tools cast doubt on that conclusion.
'Of course giving users choice is a step in the right direction, but an opt-out option probably won't make much of a difference because most users stick to the default,' said Piotr Sapiezynski, a research scientist at Northeastern University.
Thursday's announcement marked the latest instance when Facebook "" under fire for a wide range of its business practices "" sought to wait out a controversy before ultimately offering only modest changes that failed to satisfy skeptical government officials. 
On Tuesday, for example, the company issued a new policy on video manipulation, or deepfakes, that still allows an infamous altered clip of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appearing drunk to remain on the site. The move came months after the clip went viral, sparking bipartisan scorn.
With its affirmation that it will not curtail targeting, Facebook set itself apart from Google and Twitter, each of which introduced major reforms last year in response to a prolonged outcry over the capacity to narrowly tailor messages to voters on social media. Trump's reelection campaign helped catalyze the changes, after his team ran false ads about 2020 Democratic hopeful Joe Biden. Facebook and Google refused to take down the ads about the former vice president, sparking a widespread outcry.
Twitter's approach was bluntest, banning all advertisements about candidates, elections and political issues such as abortion and immigration. The ability to reach voters online should be 'earned, not bought,' the company's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, said in announcing the move, which drew sharp rebukes from the Trump camp.
Google opted to preserve political advertising, including certain targeting capabilities, but the company limited some of the most precise tools for reaching specific users, prompting bipartisan backlash from political outfits that have grown accustomed to such powerful technologies. In doing so, it also preserved its own policy against fact-checking political ads on its services, including YouTube.
Facebook, however, said it sought to take a different approach. 'While Twitter has chosen to block political ads and Google has chosen to limit the targeting of political ads, we are choosing to expand transparency and give more controls to people when it comes to political ads,' Leathern wrote.
Generally, Facebook's advertising tools allow tailoring messages to lists of individual voters or to small groups based on characteristics such as age, education, Zip code, income, relationship status, interests or political leanings. Most powerfully, Facebook also allows the creation of 'custom audiences' based on lists of individuals who, for example, donate to a cause or visit a web page that Facebook tracks. The result can be a torrent of different messages to different voters; Trump's 2016 campaign, for instance, used tens of thousands of different ads each day.
Internal discussions about limiting political microtargeting began in 2017, as Facebook reeled from revelations about how Russian operatives used the platform to manipulate U.S. voters in the presidential election a year earlier. The idea did not immediately catch on, but interest surged last year as critics sought reforms at Facebook ahead of the 2020 presidential election.
In considering reforms, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg remained steadfast in his view that his company should not serve as an 'arbiter of truth,' vetting what politicians can say. Instead, Facebook had considered a wide menu of other changes "" including limiting the size of an audience that could be targeted with an ad and labeling paid political media to indicate it had not been fact-checked, The Post first reported.
But Facebook was pressured last fall by the Trump campaign not to restrict advertising opportunities. Gary Coby, the campaign's digital director, argued that reining in targeting would be 'dangerous' and a 'huge blow to speech.'
On Thursday, Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh described Facebook's reforms as 'much better' than what Google and Twitter had done, saying the lack of limits on Facebook 'encourages more Americans to be involved in the process.'
He insisted 'our ads are always accurate' despite evidence to the contrary. The president's campaign ran online ads in 2019 that included inaccuracies about Biden and his ties to Ukraine, according to fact-checkers, a move that triggered the debate over falsehoods on Facebook in the first place. Additional falsehoods promoted by the campaign have touched on issues such as the Russia investigation and immigration.
Democrats also warned Facebook about instituting major changes: They said they relied on targeting tools to raise money and mobilize supporters "" critical in matching Trump's enormous audience on Twitter.
Many in the party, however, urged Facebook to fact-check political figures, fearing their foes might pay to spread falsehoods on the social networking site. On Thursday, Priorities USA, a leading Democratic super PAC, said the changes came up short.
'These changes read to us mostly as a cover for not making the change that is most vital: ensuring politicians are not allowed to use Facebook as a tool to lie to and manipulate voters,' said Madeline Kriger, the group's integrated media director, who oversees in-house digital ads.
The Democratic Party's 2020 contenders echoed that view: Warren, who once intentionally ran a Facebook ad with a falsehood to call attention to the issue, said the company should be held accountable so that 'democracy isn't held hostage to their desire to make money.' A spokesman for Biden, Bill Russo, said it served as 'window dressing around their decision to allow paid misinformation.'
Facebook employees had called on the company in October to adopt sweeping changes to its ad rules. Researchers, meanwhile, warned about the dangers of ads focused on narrow communities of users.
'Microtargeting is what's driving privacy abuses because it's furthering the desire to grab as much information about people as possible from all possible sources,' said Aleksandra Korolova, a computer scientist at the University of Southern California. 'It doesn't serve the individual's interest.'

Anyone who thought that former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) were ready to begin to make peace in their competition for the Democratic presidential nomination got a big surprise on Sunday night. Their debate quickly shifted from talk of pandemics to arguments over past records and future visions.
For much of the two-hour debate, it seemed like business as usual, and yet both candidates and their campaigns know that everything is changing because of the spreading coronavirus. The backdrop to the 2020 election now is one of disruptions to the daily lives of tens of millions of Americans, economic shocks that continue to rattle financial markets and frighten investors and questions about the leadership offered by President Trump.
The setting alone spoke to the extraordinary changes that the coronavirus is forcing on everyone. The debate was scheduled to be held in Phoenix before a live audience. Instead, Sanders and Biden met each other at the CNN studios in the District, with three moderators but no audience. It was a throwback to the first presidential debate of the modern era, when John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon met in the fall of 1960 at a CBS studio in Chicago with no audience.
The ground has shifted dramatically since the last Democratic debate on Feb. 25 in South Carolina. The pandemic has roared into public consciousness, dominating news coverage and altering lives. But the ground also has shifted away from Sanders, and this debate was possibly his last opportunity to slow the momentum Biden has built over the past three weeks.
That created a dual dynamic with the two united in their criticism of the president's leadership and opposing one another on almost everything else. Sanders in particular used every minute available to draw a contrast with the former vice president. He challenged Biden on a host of issues, cast himself as more visionary than Biden and more consistent in his progressive views.
Early in the debate, he offered a turn-the-other cheek posture. ""This is a national crisis,"" he said. ""I don't want to get this into a back and forth in terms of our politics here."" 
Later, the television audience saw a more indignant Biden, sharply responding to Sanders's attacks and launching his own.
The debate began on predictable terms, with the two candidates focused on the issue of the moment, the spreading coronavirus pandemic and what they would be doing if they were in the White House rather than Trump. Their policy prescriptions hardly differed and they were generally respectful toward one another. But the discussion of the threats posed by the virus offered a look at the strategies the two candidates were pursuing at the start of the evening.
Sanders used the crisis as a pretext to push the agenda that is at the heart of his candidacy - a sweeping Medicare-for-all plan to fundamentally change the health-care system and attacks on major corporations and their executives. The pandemic only underscored the weakness of America's health-care system, he argued, and should lead to the kinds of changes for which he has long advocated. Economic assistance should be aimed more at workers than corporations.
Biden was not ready to be drawn into that argument at that point. He focused on the moment, speaking of what he would do now, assuring people that no one should worry about the cost of being treated for covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. ""You don't have to pay for a thing,"" he said. ""That has nothing to do with whether or not you have an insurance policy. This is a crisis. We're at war with the virus.""
But once past the issue that now grips the entire nation, it was a rerun of previous encounters over many months of campaigning. They argued, at times testily, over Social Security, the bank bailout during the 2008 financial crisis, campaign money, a bankruptcy bill, abortion, a Green New Deal, gun-control legislation, immigration and, as always, whether Medicare-for-all or adding a public option to the Affordable Care Act would be better for the country.
It is still shocking how quickly fortunes have changed for Biden and Sanders. The last time the Democrats held a debate, there were seven candidates on the stage and Sanders was widely seen as the front-runner for the nomination. Biden was still seeking his first victory of the year after a fourth-place finish in Iowa, a fifth-place finish in New Hampshire and a second-place finish in Nevada. 
Then, with a runaway Biden victory in the South Carolina primary four days later, the race was turned upside down. Biden followed up three days later with wins on Super Tuesday, which turned him from a candidate on the brink to the party's front-runner. Last week's primaries moved the outcome of the nomination decisively in his direction, leaving Sanders with the hope that Sunday's debate might somehow reverse fortunes.
Biden is still well short of the 1,991 delegates needed for a first-ballot victory, but with last week's victories, Biden began to build a lead in delegates that his rival will find nearly impossible to overcome. In two days, he expects to add to that advantage, with primaries in Arizona, Illinois, Florida and Ohio. Four years ago, Sanders lost all four to Hillary Clinton. Given the consolidation around Biden's candidacy, it would hardly be surprising to see margins of those sizes again.
Then what? The calendar called for a primary in Georgia on March 24, but the state has pushed the date back to May 19 because of the coronavirus. Louisiana was supposed to vote on April 4 but has delayed its contest until June 20. Wyoming, also scheduled for April 4, will hold no in-person voting. Other states are making modifications or considering delays. 
The extension of the primary season well into June raises a critical question: Will the postponements in the calendar prompt Sanders to continue his candidacy further into the spring or cause him to decide to shorten his campaigning in the interest of uniting the party and helping the Democrats prepare for the general election? 
No group is more eager to know the answer to that than Biden's team, which last week began to shift its focus increasingly to general-election planning. In normal times, that would mean starting the spade work of staffing up in battleground states, beginning an intensive round of fundraising, assigning priorities and developing as many paths as possible to the 270 electoral votes needed for the nomination.
That's an enormous task in any presidential election, particularly for a challenger facing an incumbent who has a months-long head start. But almost every aspect of this planning will have to be done with no prior experience for the conditions that now exist.
None of that was addressed during Sunday's debate, but it is the context for where campaign 2020 is now headed.

Hundreds of campaign staffers to be rehired for effort to unseat Trump
Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg has decided to form an independent expenditure campaign that will absorb hundreds of his presidential campaign staffers in six swing states to work to elect the Democratic nominee this fall.
The group, with a name that is still undisclosed because its trademark application is in process, would also be a vehicle for Bloomberg to spend money on advertising to attack President Trump and support the Democratic nominee, according to a person familiar with the discussions, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reveal internal deliberations. 
The moves come as Bloomberg has continued to taunt Trump on social media, releasing a video Thursday on Twitter that cut together a number of clips in a way meant to mock Trump's claims that he would win the White House, hold the Senate and take back the U.S. House. 
""We are not going anywhere. We will haunt your dreams. We are in your head,"" the video declares in spliced-together clips from movies, television shows and music videos. ""Starting today, and every day after that, every morning, every night, we will be here watching you, always watching, making sure everyone knows what a disaster you are.""
The new group, operating with the same potentially limitless bankroll that funded Bloomberg's campaign, could play a major role in shaping the race this fall.
Bloomberg, who is worth more than $50 billion, also has not ruled out using the group to spend money to support former vice president Joe Biden during his primary fight against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Bloomberg dropped out of the race Wednesday. 
""I've always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it,"" Bloomberg said Wednesday after his disappointing showing in the Super Tuesday primaries. ""After yesterday's vote, it is clear that candidate is my friend and a great American, Joe Biden.""
The promise of help has been welcomed by Biden, but advisers to Sanders have said they do not want any general-election assistance from Bloomberg if their candidate wins the nomination. 
Bloomberg's advisers have identified Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Florida and North Carolina as the six states that will decide the electoral college winner this year. Staffers in each of those states have signed contracts through November to work on the effort. 
The new group also could serve as a vehicle for Bloomberg to support Democratic candidates for the House and Senate. In 2018, Bloomberg gave $20 million to Senate Majority PAC to support Democratic senatorial candidates. A separate group he founded, Independence USA, spent $38 million to help Democrats retake the U.S. House. 
Some of the seats Democrats won in 2018 will have to be defended in 2020 in states, such as Pennsylvania and Michigan, where Bloomberg plans to have organizing teams through the fall. Democrats also see Senate pickup opportunities in Arizona and North Carolina, while Sen. Gary Peters (D) faces a potentially competitive reelection campaign in Michigan.
The Bloomberg operation could provide a major backstop to efforts by the Democratic National Committee and the remaining presidential campaigns, which have dramatically trailed the Republican National Committee and the Trump reelection campaign in fundraising as well as in preparing for a general election.
The Trump campaign reported $93 million in cash on hand at the end of January vs. $7 million reported by Biden and $17 million reported by Sanders.
Bloomberg also will continue to fund Hawkfish, a data effort to support Democratic campaigns. That operation is structured as a separate for-profit campaign vendor to Bloomberg's campaign, the person familiar with the discussions said, so there is no need to reorganize its structure to allow it to work with the new group.
 Hawkfish has signed a long-term lease in the same building in New York's Times Square that houses Bloomberg's presidential campaign. The campaign, by contrast, plans to wind down its lease at the property. 
The Bloomberg campaign offices and staffs that remain in other states - he has 12 offices open in Ohio, for example - will be closed in the coming weeks. Staffers will be offered the chance to apply to do field work in the targeted general-election states.
Because of campaign finance rules, Bloomberg's aides have concluded that they cannot simply tell campaign employees to work directly for Biden. ""The folks in those states have been told that they can apply for spots in the battleground,"" said the person familiar with the plans.
 At its peak, Bloomberg's campaign boasted a staff of more than 2,100, including about 1,800 in state offices away from his New York headquarters. Since announcing his campaign in late November, he spent $558 million on advertising, according to the ad tracking firm Advertising Analytics.
""Today I am clear-eyed about our ultimate objective, and that is victory in November,"" Bloomberg said Wednesday during a speech in New York City. ""I will not be our party's nominee, but I will not walk away from the most important political fight of my life.""

DES MOINES "" Pete Buttigieg's top advisers realized something was happening when an editor in CNN's green room showed them the spike in the network's social media tracking. 
On the second Sunday in March, the long-shot presidential candidate, who was then a 37-year-old mayor of a city of about 100,000 people, had taken the stage for a cable news town hall as little more than a curiosity without a suit coat. He left as a contender.
'It was like night and day,' Lis Smith, his senior adviser, said of what happened next. 
Invitations soon flooded in for more fundraisers and television appearances, even on shows such as Ellen DeGeneres's, where he hadn't gotten booked. Heavy hitters from the Democratic fundraising world signed up with his campaign on the spot.
' 'Did you see that?' ' David Jacobson, a former ambassador to Canada and a bundler for President Barack Obama, remembers asking his wife that night. 'Because it wasn't just good. It was magnificent.'
When Buttigieg met a few weeks later with the men who would become his television consultants, veterans of Obama's 2008 victory, they came bearing an outlandish prediction.
'The first thing I said to him was, 'You are going to win Iowa,'-' recalls John Del Cecato, one of those admakers.
The outcome would be far messier than anyone expected, mired in chaos and uncertainty in the wake of the state party's counting meltdown "" so much so that Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez on Thursday called on the state party to begin a 'recanvass' of the caucus results. 
But by the time most of the results had been tabulated, it was clear that the young former small-city mayor was the biggest surprise of the Iowa campaign "" outpacing a pack of far more established and seasoned politicians.

The youngest candidate in the race joined the oldest, 78-year-old Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, at the top of the heap, with both men declaring victory as results were still being counted. With 100 percent of precincts reporting Thursday night, Buttigieg held a narrow lead of 26.2 percent in state delegate equivalents, the traditional metric by which an Iowa winner has been determined. Sanders had 26.1 percent and held a slight lead in the popular vote. And both men won bragging rights, as they are expected to draw roughly the same number of Iowa delegates to the national nominating convention.
'Who inches ahead in the end is meaningless,' Sanders said Thursday in New Hampshire. 


Despite the embarrassing end to its 2020 caucuses, Iowa nonetheless provided an unexpected "" and potentially transformative "" twist to what has been a consistently unpredictable Democratic nomination fight. More than two dozen candidates, including a former vice president, seven senators and a businessman who boasted of being 'an Asian guy good at math,' had thrown themselves for months before a traumatized and nervous Democratic Party. 
They stood on countertops, braved snowstorms and paraded meat on a stick, all in the hope of wooing a small fraction of Iowa's voters "" probably fewer than 200,000 out of more than 2 million voters "" to huddle in groups in conference rooms and high school gymnasiums.
By the end, former vice president Joe Biden, the leader in national polling, found himself humbled in fourth place by a process that exposed his campaign's dysfunctional organizing and muted grass-roots energy "" a 'gut punch,' as he put it this week. 
And Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), the third-place finisher in the state, who branded herself the 'I have a plan for that' candidate, found her hopes diminished by an inability to settle on a health-care plan that satisfied both sides of her coalition.
This account of the tumultuous year of campaigning that culminated this week in Iowa is based on interviews with more than 25-advisers to the top four campaigns. Some spoke on the condition of anonymity to be more frank about internal deliberations and struggles. 
Each of the top four contenders held a polling lead at one point in the state, where uncertainty and a desire to defeat President Trump were the dominant feelings among caucus-goers. 
The outcome came down to organization, timing, luck and one unexpected misfortune.

'Bernie needs us'
Sanders didn't like to speak from a chair. That was the first sign of trouble.
'I'm going to sit down here,' he said onstage at a Las Vegas restaurant in early October. 'It's been a long day.' 
Minutes later in a car, his staff asked what was wrong. He said he was feeling a little sick. Not pain, exactly, just a tightness in his chest. The nearest urgent care center popped up on Google Maps, but the 78-year-old senator who made public health care for all his signature demand was turned away because there were too many other patients.
Another clinic put him in an ambulance to a hospital, where Sanders handed off his wedding ring before a surgeon placed two stents in his artery. The campaign suspended its ads from the Iowa airwaves and stopped emailing supporters for money. Some staff members worried that they would need to close up shop. 
Nobody predicted what happened next. 
A few days after the heart attack, before it was clear that Sanders would recover, Pete D'Alessandro, his Iowa director, found something unusual at a regional office in Des Moines near his home. The candidate was hospitalized, but the number of volunteers working the phones had roughly doubled. 
That weekend, Rep. Ro Khanna (Calif.), a Sanders campaign co-chairman, discovered a similar scene when he flew to the state "" big crowds, even without the candidate, many with stories about their own health scares. 'Solidarity,' Khanna concluded.
Others soon noticed a deeper shift among Sanders supporters. 'You start talking to people and generally the demeanor was, 'We have got to pick it up for him now,' ' D'Alessandro said. 'It was almost like what it would have felt like if you were working for Robert Kennedy and somebody had tackled Sirhan Sirhan.'
Far from Iowa, among the sprawling community of liberal activists and leaders, a shift was taking place. Those who had spent much of the year torn between Sanders and Warren, the two liberal lions of the campaign, began to add a new calculation to their considerations. 
'Just like when we get close to losing a loved one or when you do lose a loved one,' said Evan Weber, the political director of the Sunrise Movement, which would eventually endorse Sanders by a margin of more than 4 to 1. 'It makes you stop and really value the things you had.'
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), the public face of a new generation of activists, had been meeting with both senators privately as they sought her endorsement "" Warren over a lunch in Washington to talk policy and Sanders in Burlington for dinner and brunch to discuss what the movement might be. 
When she heard he was in the hospital, she moved fast to endorse, a decisive moment, rival campaign strategists said, with her freshman colleagues Ilhan Omar (Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (Mich.). Sanders had stopped answering all his calls in the hospital, so an adviser had to patch Ocasio-Cortez through to his bedside two days after the surgery.
'Bernie needs us, and needs us now,' she told an aide at the time. 

Up until then, the campaign had been plodding along. Sanders's decision to run had never been a sure thing. He entered the race in March, with crowded events in Brooklyn and Chicago where he received rock star receptions. But from there, the campaign sputtered, not quite sure how to recapture the magic of 2016 in a bigger and more fluid field. In late April, Biden joined the race, giving Sanders a new problem.
During a private conversation in May, Jeff Weaver, a senior adviser who had managed Sanders's 2016 effort, successfully pleaded with the candidate to restart his polling program, which had been dormant in the opening months of the campaign, save for some general election data it released publicly. 
Fresh rounds commenced in the summer, and the new numbers informed the campaign's aggressive ad strategy and sharpened focus on economic issues, said two people with knowledge of the situation. 
By October, with Sanders still recovering, his team was working on something that could be even more consequential: a rally with Ocasio-Cortez in New York's Queensbridge Park "" a sprawling patch of green in the shadow of the Queensboro Bridge. He and his aides had written a new line, which would become a staple of her remarks.
'Find someone you don't know "" maybe somebody who doesn't look like you,' Sanders told the crowd of about 20,000. 'My question now for you is: Are you willing to fight for that person as hard as you fight for yourself?'
That was the core of the Sanders strategy. In Iowa, his team leaned heavily on a smartphone app that allowed supporters to share information about everyone they knew, to help build the campaign's voter file and improve its targeting.
'You now have a way to look up people who you know, in your precinct, in your Zip code. You can sort it by age, you can sort it by a variety of things. You can also look up individuals,' a Sanders organizer told supporters in Des Moines's East Village in December. 'When we mark our friends or family members, our neighbors as Bernie's supporters or otherwise, that is super valuable information.'
The internal numbers started moving as fall turned to winter. In early November, in Council Bluffs, D'Alessandro watched as voters carrying Sanders signs started streaming out of the venue after Ocasio-Cortez's introduction. It didn't matter that the senator was still speaking. They had come to see her. 
'All of a sudden, we started that expansion of our universe,' he said.
'Extreme derision' 

The dynamics of the Iowa campaign that Buttigieg and Sanders would exploit could be traced back months before anyone publicly declared their intention to run, as would-be candidates and their aides tried to decipher how the nation "" and the Democratic Party "" had changed since Trump's shocking win over Hillary Clinton.
In the final months of 2018, Biden gathered regularly with his inner circle in the basement office of his $4-million rented home along the Potomac River to put him through the paces. 
Some proposed that he come out of the gate with a 'more aggressively left-leaning posture,' said one aide who attended the meeting. They warned him that Medicare-for-all had become the flavor of the year in Democratic policy circles. They explained the dangerous vicissitudes of Twitter and its hold on the political press. 
'We were very clear-eyed in those conversations that we were going to be met with extreme derision,' said Kate Bedingfield, who would go on to become his deputy campaign manager. 
From the beginning, Biden and his top aides rejected the idea that Sanders's vision had legs. That wasn't the party he knew or the country he had helped lead. He didn't believe the rise of Trump had changed either. 
Ultimately, they argued, the campaign would turn on issues more fundamental than political ideology or populism. The country needed healing and a hug from a man who had been through more than most and understood.
'We have a candidate who knows who he is,' campaign manager Greg Schultz said. 'The country wants to come together.'
A campaign that began amid complaints by women who said that Biden's physical manner made them uncomfortable closed out the year with an impeachment scandal sparked by Trump's desire to highlight his son Hunter Biden's work in Ukraine. Yet his polling was resilient.
'Democrats love Joe Biden,' said one pollster, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was talking about another campaign. 'No one is rooting for him to fail.' 
The script that Biden's brain trust crafted leaned heavily on a legacy that much of the country already knew "" words such as 'malarkey,' verbal tics such as 'seriously, folks' and mottos about rebuilding the backbone of the nation that had been prepped for a potential 2016 presidential campaign he never ran.
But the team ultimately decided to break away from the old formula. 

Mark Putnam, a prominent Democratic Party admaker, was brought in to create an introductory spot for Biden anchored in-his oft-told story about his working-class upbringing, shooting footage of the former vice president as he visited his childhood home in Scranton, Pa. The video, which was not released, was shelved by Mike Donilon, Biden's top strategist, to make way for the new rationale.
If Biden was the healer, they would call out the disease. The campaign would start with the heart of the matter: Trump's equivocating response to the march of white nationalists in Charlottesville in August 2017. 
Warren has approached the same question from the opposite direction. The disease, she thought, was not Trump, but decades of policy choices in Washington that had made voters look to a demagogic politician like him in the first place. 
By the time Warren went public with her presidential ambition in the final hours of 2018, she had been an elected official in Washington for less than six years, and had been urged to run for president for most of that time. 
Liberal activists had pleaded with her after the 2012 election. Joe Rospars, the Obama campaign's digital strategist who would become her chief strategist, wrote an unsolicited memo predicting that she would raise $100-million in the first months of a primary run against Clinton. 
Said Zephyr Teachout, an organizer on Howard Dean's 2004 presidential campaign who met with Warren in person: 'I practiced and practiced this speech to convince her. My pitch was, 'There is a sleeping giant awakening in America.'-'
Warren was sold on the thesis but not her next move, until after Trump won the White House. Two days after the 2016 election, Warren delivered a speech signaling her change of heart. She chastised her party for not addressing the country's economic pain.
'President-elect Trump spoke to these issues,' she said, placing herself in the middle of the debate. '. . . The time for ignoring the American people is over.'

But the 2016 election had changed more than just the occupant in the White House. Once a congressional gadfly, Sanders had earned a solid claim on the liberal populist crown. Even Teachout, by the end of 2019, would endorse him. 
Warren placed a bet anyway that she could win his supporters, even as some of her advisers doubted his determination to run again. She would broaden the coalition to include the college-educated part of the Democratic Party. She called herself a capitalist, not a democratic socialist. She promised 'big structural change,' not a revolution. 
Warren would have to compete for two sets of voters at once, and she planned to out-hustle everyone. 
A couple of days before New Year's Day 2019, as her exploratory committee prepared to announce her bid, top staff members huddled in Boston to finalize a plan to immediately call or text anyone from the first four states to hold nominating contests who signed up on the website or donated after her video went live. 
By the time Warren landed in Iowa five days later, strangers who had become volunteers were directing traffic in the parking lot of a Council Bluffs bowling alley.
She chose not to hire a campaign pollster and television ad consultant, and told a pair of top fundraisers that she would no longer ask the wealthy for money. The Iowa field operation she built quickly became known as the gold standard, with staff members setting up shop early in far-flung parts of the state, including deeply red rural areas. 
By the end of the summer, there was a growing consensus that she was in a strong position to win Iowa. Biden's campaign operation in the state was widely considered to be in disarray. Buttigieg had only just begun to announce plans to open offices and introduce himself to voters. And there were doubts that Sanders, the 2016 runner-up, could recapture the magic of his last run. 
New realities

Before the CNN town hall gathering, Buttigieg's team was not sure whether he would even get the 65,000 donors he needed to qualify for the first candidate debate. Less than three months later, he would report nearly $25-million in donations, more than anyone else in the field in the second quarter. 
The pivot also brought veteran talent to a campaign that until then had been almost entirely run by people younger than 40. If Warren was trying to reinvent campaigns by eschewing polling and television consultants, Buttigieg embraced the old ways. 
He hired Obama's former polling firm, Obama's former television ad team and a suite of other Obama veterans. Unlike Obama, who had three years to plan a national campaign after his 2004 Democratic National Convention speech thrust him onto the national political stage when he was still a Senate candidate, Buttigieg would try to put it together in four months. 
Because so few voters knew Buttigieg, the campaign's leaders invested in research about how the Democratic Party was feeling about politics and the country. What they found gave them hope, both for Buttigieg's path in Iowa and New Hampshire, and for bringing down Warren. 
A portion of the party had been electrified by Sanders, but of the rest, there was an exhaustion at the vitriol. It was a message that echoed in Biden's research. 
More important, they found that among those who wanted Medicare-for-all, many could live with a policy plan that got you part of the way there. The reverse was not true among opponents, who reacted strongly to the idea of losing their private insurance.
With suddenly deep pockets, Buttigieg committed himself entirely to the state. His team tried to make the biggest shows of force at each of the major organizing events, went up early and big with television ads, and opened more offices in the state than any of his competitors. 
Democrats in the state began to take him seriously when his staff mistakenly scheduled a rally on Oct. 12 at Roosevelt High School in Des Moines, at the same time as a major Iowa Hawkeyes football game. During the big game in bad weather, more than 700 people showed up and stood for hours in freezing temperatures and drizzle to see him speak. 

As Buttigieg moved in the summer to restart his campaign, the strains of Warren's big-tent strategy were showing. She had begun the race calling Medicare-for-all an end goal, without committing to a specific path to get there. 
In the spring, liberal groups and activists had been privately expressing frustration about her public position. To quiet those concerns, she shocked many in the party by shifting positions in Miami at the first candidate debate. 
'I'm with Bernie,' she said. 
Before long, the consequences of that decision began popping up on door knocks around Iowa, said a person familiar with internal campaign responses in the state. Many with private health insurance were worried. 
Warren's campaign had delayed coming out with a health-care plan, and now the candidate who campaigned on her policy expertise could not answer basic questions about whether her version of Medicare-for-all would raise taxes on the middle class. 
Her rivals Biden, Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) accused her of acting like a typical politician and not being direct with voters. Her reputation for competency and authenticity, which had been the bedrock of her rise through the polls, had been damaged. Her polling began to slouch in Iowa.
Biden, meanwhile, was quickly discovering that there was a difference between winning public opinion and winning party energy. The Iowa caucuses, which demanded the devotion to leave home for hours on a Monday night, required the latter.
That reality hit home for campaign staff members at the Liberty and Justice dinner in early November, the biggest single organizing event before the caucuses. At a half-full predinner rally, Biden staff could be seen holding thick handfuls of tickets that they were struggling to give away. Inside the arena, at the last minute, they removed boxes of inflatable noisemakers that read 'Beat Him Like a Drum' from the four sections of seats they had reserved but were unable to fill. 
The campaign tried to fill the seats with groups that had been bused in. One bus was filled with kids from a Baptist church who Karen Sievers, vice chair of the Guthrie County Democratic Party, said didn't appear to 'even know why they are there.' 
'I remember being on the floor of the arena and looking around,' another Iowa Democratic activist said. 'To have that kind of showing for a beloved former vice president, his own campaign failed him. And he had to know it.'

Later that month, a group of Biden supporters appealed to the campaign and even the candidate himself, urging him to pursue a more robust schedule of smaller, more personal events that would allow him to connect with state Democrats and put to rest questions about the 77-year-old's age and agility.
'I wouldn't call it a 'come to Jesus' moment, but that's what it was,' one longtime Iowa supporter said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to anger the campaign. 
Former Iowa governor Tom Vilsack (D) was one who had been arguing since the spring that Biden needed to truly commit to the state, especially in rural areas. A few weeks later, he would endorse Biden, joining his wife, Christie, former senator John F. Kerry (Mass.), and congresswomen Abby Finkenauer and Cindy Axne, both Iowa Democrats.
A super PAC the Biden campaign had blessed in October provided the air cover his own coffers could not afford, pushing back against the $10-million in anti-Biden spending that the Trump campaign had approved nationally to tar Biden and defend against impeachment.
Biden even imported Democrats of color from other parts of the country who traveled across the state as part of a 'We Know Joe' bus tour to woo undecided Iowans, who have been especially outspoken about how their choice in the caucus might play in battleground states.
But holes in the campaign remained in the final months. When Biden's wife, Jill Biden, toured western Iowa in mid-January, less than a month before the caucuses, she was introduced in Audubon by an organizer who said it was his first week on the job. 
In Dubuque, where the candidate's sister Valerie Biden Owens held a private meeting with a group of undecided voters last week, one attendee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as not to embarrass the local Biden organizers, said she was still undecided in the race in part because of questions she had about Biden's ground game.
During the summer, the woman said, she had offered to volunteer and make phone calls on Biden's behalf. 
'When I finally found the organizer, he said he would get back to me, but I never heard a thing,' she said. 'It made me wonder how committed Joe and his campaign were.'
As the caucuses began across the state, it became clear that she was not alone.
Dueling victory declarations

The year of campaigning came down to the final night. Television networks carried live images of caucus meetings, but as the night wore on, it became increasingly clear that something unusual was happening. 
Unlike a typical election, where ballot choices are secret, the various campaigns received real-time reports of turnout and preference from the state's 1,681 precincts. The numbers they reported back to Buttigieg in his suite at a downtown Des Moines Marriott cheered everyone in the room. But the state party was unable to collate the results.
The political wordsmith with degrees from Oxford and Harvard needed a win in Iowa to propel his campaign forward, so he decided to play a word game: He would declare himself 'victorious' without defining what victory meant. His staff uniformly agreed, even though they knew he still might not finish first in the delegate count.
'It means victorious over a lot of things "" victorious because a year ago, it was just four staffers, victorious in terms of overperforming the expectations, and victorious in that we beat a crop of senators and a former vice president,' said one of the advisers in the room.
A few moments later, Buttigieg appeared onstage, a 38-year-old openly gay former mayor from a small city in Indiana trying to convince the country it was really happening.
'Tonight an impossible hope became an undeniable reality,' he declared. 
The final result, however, was still anything but certain. 
'When 6,000 more people come out for you in an election than your nearest opponent,' Sanders said three days later in New Hampshire, 'we here in northern New England call that a victory.'

Faith in fair elections is eroding, says political scientist

When the polls closed on Nov. 5, 2019, the initial count showed the governor of Kentucky, Republican Matt Bevin, losing to his Democratic challenger, Andy Beshear. But rather than concede that he fell short in what should have been an easy reelection, Bevin claimed that 'irregularities' had muddled the result "" though he produced no evidence to support his accusations. At first, some Kentucky legislative leaders appeared to back him, and some pointed to the legislature's power to resolve an election dispute and choose the governor regardless of the vote. But Bevin was not popular even within his own party, and eventually, he had to concede when the local GOP did not go along with him. 
We could imagine a similar scenario this November: What would happen if President Trump had an early lead that evaporated as votes were counted, and then he refused to concede? The idea isn't too far-fetched; Trump has raised it himself. Before the 2016 election, he wouldn't agree to accept the results if he lost. After winning in the electoral college but losing the popular count by about 3 million votes, Trump claimed "" with no evidence whatsoever "" that at least 3 million fraudulent votes had been cast for his opponent, Hillary Clinton. He set up an 'election integrity' commission headed by then-Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach to try to prove that 'voter fraud' is a major problem. But after the commission faced attacks from the left and the right for demanding state voter records with an apparent plan to use them to call for stricter registration rules, Trump disbanded it, with no work accomplished. In 2018, the president criticized elections in Florida and California, where late-counted votes shifted toward Democrats, suggesting without evidence that there was foul play.
It's not just Trump who might not accept election results. Imagine that he wins in the electoral college, this time thanks to what Democrats believe is voter suppression in Florida. The Florida legislature and governor have already sought to stymie Amendment 4, a 2018 ballot initiative to restore voting rights to formerly incarcerated felons. When the state Supreme Court agreed that felons could not register to vote until paying all their outstanding fines, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) praised the ruling and called voting a 'privilege,' rather than a right. Some Democrats have called the new rules a 'poll tax,' and a Florida public TV station concluded that 'the implications of the bill passed by a majority-Republican legislature preventing former felons from voting could work to ensure Trump wins the 2020 presidential election.' During Trump's impeachment trial this past week, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said that 'we cannot be assured that the vote will be fairly won' in November because of the allegations that Trump was trying to 'cheat' by pressuring Ukraine to announce an investigation into Joe Biden and his family.
External forces could cause an election meltdown, too. A recent NPR-News Hour-Marist poll found that 'almost 4 in 10 Americans . . . believe it is likely another country will tamper with the votes cast in 2020 in order to change the result.' What if Russians hack into Detroit's power grid and knock out electricity on Election Day, seriously depressing turnout "" and Trump wins the electoral college because he carries Michigan? Most states do not have a Plan B to deal with a terrorist attack or natural disaster affecting part of a presidential election.
The vote this year is particularly vulnerable to a crisis of legitimacy because Americans' trust in elections is already low; that NPR poll found that only 62 percent of Americans think our elections are fair. A number of factors are contributing to this worrisome trend. 
Republicans have passed laws and procedures aimed at suppressing the votes of Democrats, based on unsupported claims of voter fraud. Under Kobach's watch, for example, Kansas passed a law requiring people registering to vote to produce proof of citizenship, such as a birth or naturalization certificate. About 30,000 people had their registrations suspended or canceled for failure to show their papers until a federal court put the program on hold. Kobach defended the law in court in 2018, citing a handful of cases of noncitizen voting as the 'tip of the iceberg' and claiming that the law would deter many more. But at trial in a suit brought by the ACLU, U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson concluded there was no iceberg, merely an 'icicle.' Kobach's presentation of evidence was so faulty and deceptive that he was sanctioned twice by the courts. 
Time and again, courts and scholars have debunked the myth of widespread voter fraud "" but such claims still lead Republicans to believe that Democrats are cheating, and they prompt GOP-backed laws that lead Democrats, in turn, to believe that Republicans are cheating.
Yes, a few election administrators are incompetent, and in very close races, when procedures are put under a microscope during recounts and challenges, attention is focused on these weak links. Think of Brenda Snipes, the Democratic former election supervisor in Broward County, Fla., who presided over a series of mishaps during her tenure. In 2004, her office failed to deliver 58,000 ballots to absentee voters who had requested them. In 2012, election workers discovered almost 1,000 uncounted absentee ballots in county offices a week after the vote. In 2016, Snipes's office left a voter initiative on medical marijuana completely off some ballots. In the recount in the 2018 Senate race between Sen. Bill Nelson (D) and Gov. Rick Scott (R), Snipes's office missed "" by two minutes "" a key deadline because county officials did not know how to submit the vote totals to the state online. This error came after a faulty ballot design apparently caused many Broward voters to skip voting in the Senate contest entirely.
Snipes is not alone. Then-Georgia Secretary of State (and now governor) Brian Kemp engaged in one of the most despicable moments in modern American politics in 2018, when he wrongly accused Democrats of hacking into state voter registration databases (and posted the charges on the front page of the official secretary of state website the weekend before the election) to cover up his own failure to secure voters' private data.
Incompetent administrators come from both parties, but election problems tend to get the most notice in big cities, where there are more voters and more media attention "" and more votes for Democrats. Big blunders sometimes lead to Republican charges of intentional vote tampering. It is no surprise that Trump called out Snipes during the 2018 recount, accusing her, again without evidence, of cheating to help fellow Democrats. 
Recent elections have also seen both high-tech and old-fashioned dirty tricks used with uncomfortable frequency. In the 2017 U.S. Senate special election in Alabama, left-leaning groups backing Democrat Doug Jones (but working independently) used social media ma nipu la tion "" based on Russian tactics from 2016 "" to target Republican Roy Moore. One of these efforts, 'Dry Alabama,' involved inventing a pro-Moore Baptist group that supported a statewide ban on alcohol. One of the people behind the fake group told the New York Times that he hoped Dry Alabama's hardcore anti-alcohol message would depress turnout among moderate Republicans. 
The 2018 race in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District saw straight-up ballot tampering: Evidence of improper tactics by consultant Leslie McCrae Dowless to support the Republican candidate, Mark Harris, was so overwhelming that the bipartisan North Carolina Board of Elections voted unanimously to order a new election unmarred by fraud. Trump, who speaks nonstop about nonexistent Democratic voter fraud, has remained mostly silent about North Carolina.
Finally, we have seen a rise in incendiary rhetoric about stolen elections. At an October 2016 campaign rally in Ambridge, Pa., Trump told an enthusiastic, mostly white crowd that it is 'so important that you watch other communities, because we don't want this election stolen from us.'
In 2018, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) claimed that if Democrat Stacey Abrams lost the Georgia governor's race, it would be because Kemp 'stole' it. It is true that Kemp was an incompetent and malevolent secretary of state who was supervising the election in which he was running. But there was no good evidence that his actions changed the outcome of the election, which he won. Abrams nonetheless has refused repeatedly to call Kemp the 'legitimate' governor of Georgia.
The combination of these four factors "" Republican voter suppression, pockets of incompetence, dirty tricks and increasingly outrageous language about stolen elections "" creates a volatile mix in our hyperpolarized era. 
Unfortunately, we don't have any good short-term fixes available between now and November. It's not clear that we can rely on responsible leaders of both parties to assure democratic transitions and acceptance of election results. Republican responses to the impeachment hearings' evidence that Trump encouraged foreign interference in the 2020 elections are not encouraging. Many contested elections wind up in the courts: According to figures I've compiled for my new book, 'Election Meltdown,' election litigation has nearly tripled since 2000, with the highest number of cases occurring in the most recent national elections, in 2018. But the Supreme Court itself is polarized, and it is not certain that Democrats would accept a decision by a Republican-majority court handing yet another presidency to a Republican. 
There are about nine months until Election Day. Some concrete steps could help minimize the chances of a meltdown, since we can't do much to fix problems after they occur. For example, journalists could be more careful not to 'call' states for presidential candidates until they are absolutely sure enough votes have been counted that the outcome is clear. Social media companies could ban 'deep fake' videos that are not labeled as manipulated. Government cybersecurity experts do more to thwart unusual ways of disrupting the voting process, such as attacks on the power grid. And election officials need to have a Plan B in the event of attacks on registration or voting systems. External and internal forces that seek to foment discord are not resting. We can't, either.

Many of the most endangered Republicans have concluded that fully embracing President Trump is their only credible path to victory in November, rallying to his side in the final days of the Senate impeachment fight and indulging his most controversial actions and statements.
At-risk Republicans "" including those in battlegrounds such as Arizona, Colorado and Georgia "" are calculating that a strong economy and an energized pro-Trump base will be enough to carry the party as it works to retain the White House and its Senate majority in 2020, according to interviews and private discussions with more than a dozen Republican senators, Senate aides and veteran strategists and officials.
More broadly, most Republicans have also largely jettisoned plans to break ranks with Trump to woo independents and suburban women, who turned on the party in 2018 and helped hand the House to the Democrats. This political positioning is driven in part by their view that Democrats are again poised to nominate a uniquely vulnerable presidential standard-bearer weighed down with ideological or establishment baggage.
'There's nothing in the middle of the road other than dead possums and yellow lines,' said Will Ritter, co-founder of Poolhouse, a center-right ad agency. 'Like no other president before, Republican voters want you to wrap yourself around Trump. There is no upside to doing any distancing.'

Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) has concentrated in recent weeks on rallying base Republicans rather than appealing to moderates for her tough reelection fight, pushing for a swift acquittal in Trump's impeachment trial while raising money off a feud with a CNN reporter she called 'a liberal hack.' Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who is running for reelection in a state Hillary Clinton won by five points in 2016, came under attack by his likely Democratic opponent, former governor John Hickenlooper, after deciding against calling for impeachment witnesses and evidence this week.
And Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), facing a tough intraparty primary fight from Rep. Douglas A. Collins (R-Ga.), has gone all-in on supporting Trump in a state that Democrats are targeting for its growing diversity and booming Atlanta suburbs, including an attack this week on fellow Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) for supporting the call for witnesses.
Loeffler, who has been personally friendly with Romney and who has donated to him in the past, accused him in a tweet of trying to 'appease the left' and concluded: 'The circus is over. It's time to move on!'
Trump's uncontested grip over his party came into focus again Friday as two key Republican senators "" Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is retiring, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who is not up for reelection "" supported the president by blocking Democratic attempts to extend the trial, couching their positions as driven by frustrations with Democrats. It will mark the first time in U.S. history that no witnesses will be called in a Senate impeachment proceeding.
'There is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the United States Constitution's high bar for an impeachable offense,' Alexander said in a statement, arguing that while Trump had taken 'actions that are inappropriate,' they did not merit his removal from office.

It was the most significant political move made by Senate Republicans this week: Their refusal to join Democrats in calling for additional evidence or witnesses in Trump's impeachment trial, ensuring that it could wrap up in the coming days.
At the center of the calculation was Trump himself, and just how much Republicans feel they can distance themselves from a president who, in just over three years, has traveled from troublesome outsider to Republican Party standard-bearer.
Ritter said some vulnerable Republicans running in swing states and House districts may be able to differentiate themselves from Trump and appeal to the center on specific policy issues, but on something hyper-politicized like impeachment, they cannot afford to cross the president.
'On Trump, it's binary,' Ritter said. 'You're either a treacherous Democrat or you're with the president.'
The 2018 midterm elections did provide a flashing alarm for Republicans about the risks of being inextricably bound with Trump. Democrats retook the House majority after toppling Republican incumbents in many suburban districts and in state and local races "" a takeover that laid the groundwork for impeachment.
Former Republican senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania said challenges in suburbs, such as those surrounding Philadelphia, remain troubling for the party. But he said opposing Trump on impeachment is seen by most at-risk Republicans as the 'wrong way to try to win over those voters.'
'You won't get seen as playing to the suburbs,' Santorum said. 'You'll be seen as playing to the angry leftists who hate the president.'
Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who as the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee worked to keep the probe of Russian election interference as bipartisan as possible, said he fully supports Trump and is surprised that anyone might be surprised.
'He's a Republican, he's president and we support his agenda,' Burr said. 'The media, of course, tries to drive a wedge and wonder, but every poll today shows the president actually stronger today than he was four years ago.'
For Trump, Republican unity on impeachment is the fruit of the ultimate pressure campaign in a short political career defined by them. The president has upended so many norms that he has simply become the norm, with everyone else in the party scrambling to adjust.
That doesn't mean Republicans all personally like Trump or cheer his conduct, either on foreign policy or other matters "" in fact, many Republican lawmakers still complain loudly about him behind closed doors, sometimes mocking him as incompetent and undisciplined.

But many also privately acknowledge that Trump dominates the party in a potent and visceral way and say they are operating out of the partisan reality of an intensely divided nation.
Democrats, they add, should stop expecting a Republican establishment to stand up and block Trump, since Trump himself is now the establishment.
'I regularly talk to five or six Republicans who I feel some closeness to,' said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). 'I've heard for months that they know the president lies a lot. . . . They worry about his character. But they aren't willing to come forward and say that publicly. That's one of the tragedies of this era.'
Former Republican Georgia congressman Jack Kingston said he once had reservations about Trump but has since become an ardent admirer and booster. He explained his transformation with a shrug, saying his party and Washington 'needed a shake-up.'
'I accept it,' he said.
The Georgia primary fight brewing between Loeffler and Collins is a classic Trump-era standoff, he added.
'Any GOP candidate is going to want to show he or she is close to Trump,' Kingston said. 'If you think about the Republican Party, he's the center of the orbit. You don't want him to say something bad about you.'
The impulse for Republicans to link themselves tightly to the president spans the country, and includes some lawmakers not even currently up for reelection. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who doesn't face reelection for four years, released a 30-second ad in Iowa that sided with Trump and attacked former vice president Joe Biden and other Democrats.
'I'd like to thank the Democrats for badly botching this impeachment charade and for spending so much time in a coverup for Joe Biden,' says Scott, who introduces himself as a juror in the Senate trial. 'The real story here is the corruption Joe Biden got away with.'
The ad goes on to levy a series of factually problematic charges against Biden and his son Hunter, but its mere existence is sure to delight Trump "" and sparked speculation that Scott is eyeing a 2024 presidential bid, seeking to cast himself as the torchbearer of Trump's brand.
Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general under Trump who is now running to retake the Alabama Senate seat he vacated to join the administration, is also pushing to prove his fealty to the president "" despite the fact that Trump, furious at Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, publicly and privately berated and humiliated his attorney general for the majority of his tenure.
Nonetheless, on Wednesday, Sessions touted his loyalty to Trump in a trio of tweets focused on former national security adviser John Bolton, whose forthcoming book directly ties Trump to the Ukraine decision at the heart of his impeachment trial. Sessions emphasized that he never publicly criticized the president and dismissed Bolton's memoir as 'an act of disloyalty.'

Former senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he understands if Republicans poke holes in the Democrats' case against Trump and vote for acquittal but cannot accept Republicans insisting that Trump did nothing wrong. Those who do the latter, he said, are willfully taking a position they know is false.
'That's the difference. Vote to acquit? Okay. You can make that argument. But to say this wasn't an egregious abuse of his presidential duty? That's where this party has problems,' Flake said. 'To suggest otherwise signals complete subservience to the president.'

But Scott Reed, senior strategist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, pointed to Trump's 'unprecedented high approval ratings with the GOP rank and file.'
'It's Trump's party now "" there's no way around that,' Reed said. 'You may not agree with the boxes, but he's checking all the boxes.'
Democrats, meanwhile, have had their own challenges holding their ranks together as Trump voters in red states have made clear to Democratic senators that they will pay a price for opposing the president.
Two centrists who won election last year "" Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) "" as well as Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), who will face voters this year after a long-shot win in a special election in 2017, have been coy about how they will vote on acquittal, giving hope to Trump's allies that the president could win bipartisan support.
Many Republicans also believe that Trump stands a strong chance of reelection against a flawed Democratic opponent, whether a nominee from the left like Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), or a longtime politician like Biden.
Dick Wadhams, a longtime Republican strategist based in Colorado, said the specific choice between Trump and the eventual Democratic nominee will help Republicans who have tacked to the right to appease the party's base win over moderates, as well.
'It's going to be a choice on the ballot and not a referendum in 2020, and that's what makes this very different than 2018,' Wadhams said. He added that he was a begrudging Trump voter in 2016 but now is fully supportive. He pointed to Trump accomplishments like passing a tax cut and appointing conservative judicial nominees, as well as his concern about where the Democrats would take the country.
'I still have concerns about the way he behaves, his tweets drive me nuts, and a lot of Republicans feel that way, but at the same time "" Medicare-for-all, Green New Deal, killing fracking "" spare me,' he said, rattling off a list of liberal proposals. 'Democrats are driving people who might want to vote for them back to Trump.'

Senator to press Biden at debate on embracing his movement's policies 
Bernie Sanders faced a dilemma: Should he end his sputtering presidential campaign, as several rivals have done, and bring a once-powerful movement to a painful finish? Or should he charge full speed ahead in search of a turnaround that looks increasingly unlikely, as he did four years ago?
On Wednesday, he did neither. 
In an extraordinary 10-minute appearance in his hometown after faring poorly in another set of primaries, the U.S. senator from Vermont conceded that he was losing the nominating contest to former vice president Joe Biden and had failed to persuade Democrats that he was more electable, sounding the notes of a candidate who had come to terms with his shortcomings and was ready to accept defeat. 
But he also made clear that he was staying in the race, at least for a few more days, determined to meet Biden in a one-on-one debate Sunday that he said would expose important distinctions between their records. He even listed a number of challenges he said he would issue to Biden, including how he would fight poverty and how he would handle health care. 
And he issued a warning to party leaders not to take lightly the resonance of his sweeping liberal ideas or his dominance among younger voters - showing how it is in his and the party's interest to forge the common ground that eluded Democrats after his loss to Hillary Clinton four years ago. 
""Today I say to the Democratic establishment, in order to win in the future, you need to win the voters who represent the future of our country, and you must speak to the issues of concern to them,"" Sanders said. ""You cannot simply be satisfied by winning the votes of older people."" 
In effect, Sanders was signaling that although Biden's advantage in the race might prove too difficult to overcome - he notably did not pledge to run against him through all 50 state contests as he did against Hillary Clinton in 2016 - he intends to pressure Biden to adopt more liberal positions and has no intention of quietly stepping aside before getting a chance to take him on directly. 
""Bernie Sanders won so much support on the left because of his vision, and today he offered Joe Biden a blueprint of things he needs to do to bring over part of the Sanders coalition,"" said Rebecca Katz, a liberal strategist. ""He's basically telling Biden what the olive branch should be."" 
Sanders's statement was a wide-ranging recitation of priorities rather than a bill of policy particulars, but it suggested that he could be open to bringing his passionate liberal supporters into the Democratic fold and setting the stage for a highly unusual debate Sunday that might unfold more like a public negotiation. 
That presents Biden, a centrist who has rejected many of Sanders's left-leaning policy ideas, with the delicate challenge of appearing open to the proposals while staying true to his own principles. That conundrum will be on vivid display Sunday because Biden has not shown himself to be a nuanced speaker or nimble debater. 
At the same time, Sanders's eagerness for a renewed fight against Biden threatens to complicate Democratic hopes of fostering unity after a bruising stretch. With the once-sprawling field culling quickly in recent weeks and Biden emerging as the likely nominee in the minds of many Democrats, some are hoping that the former vice president's critics are ready to lay down their arms now and join the fight against President Trump.
Not so fast, say some Sanders supporters. 
""That's a huge mistake to think that basically he's just not in it to win it,"" said RoseAnn DeMoro, a longtime Sanders friend and former union head, who said this is an ""extremely volatile"" time in politics. 
The senator spoke Wednesday from a hotel ballroom in Burlington, Vt., where he had been hunkering down since scuttling a planned rally in Cleveland on Tuesday over concerns about the spread of the novel coronavirus. After making brief remarks to reporters, Sanders left without taking questions. He was to appear on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon"" later in the day. 
Less than 24 hours earlier, Biden had extended his lead over Sanders in the all-important race for delegates to the Democrats' July nominating convention, notching big wins in Michigan, Missouri, Mississippi and Idaho. Sanders won North Dakota, while Washington state remained too close to call. 
Sanders, delivering his first public comments since the losses, didn't try to sugarcoat his humbling defeats. 
""Last night was obviously not a good night for our campaign from a delegate point of view,"" he said. But he cited a silver lining: his dominance among young voters and the popularity of his policy ideas. 
Although Sanders has been the most popular candidate among young voters, he has been losing badly among older Americans, and they have turned out in larger numbers. And his promises to reshape the electorate with legions of new young voters have not been fulfilled. 
Exit polls have not included many questions measuring policy support, making it difficult to determine with precision how Democrats casting ballots in the primary race feel about Sanders's ideas. But the polls have shown that Democratic majorities in most states support the idea of replacing private health insurance with a government plan. 
Sanders has long advocated such a system, making his Medicare-for-all proposal a cornerstone of his platform. Biden favors an incremental approach: expanding the Affordable Care Act, created during the Obama presidency, to include an optional public insurance program. 
But among the broader electorate, there appears to be less support for Sanders's plan, with polls showing the public overall opposes it. By a similar margin, independents are also against it, polling shows. 
Indeed, one of Sanders's most glaring weaknesses is his inability to convince Democrats that his ambitious agenda is the best recipe for defeating Trump. Biden, by contrast, has been much more effective in that regard, convincing voters that practicality is a better bet. 
Sanders admitted as much on Wednesday. 
""While our campaign has won the ideological debate, we are losing the debate over electability,"" Sanders said. He added that his campaign had come across many people who liked his ideas but have concluded, ""I'm going to vote for Joe Biden because I think Joe is the best candidate to defeat Donald Trump."" Sanders made it clear he disagrees with that assessment.
In hopes of reversing those trends, Sanders aides are closely eyeing the debate in Arizona on Sunday, hopeful that the first one-on-one showdown of the primary season - the initial debate included 20 candidates over two nights - will work in their candidate's favor and expose what they consider Biden's weaknesses. 
Their hope is that the debate, which will include no live audience because of escalating concerns about the coronavirus, will create a seismic shift in the race that will swing the momentum back in their direction. 
But some Sanders allies privately admitted that is a long-shot scenario. And even if the debate does persuade some voters to join Sanders, his path ahead is daunting. To have any chance of winning the nomination, Sanders will have to score sweeping wins in states whose demographics appear far more favorable to Biden.
In addition to having to face the former vice president in the Upper Midwest battlegrounds of Illinois and Ohio next Tuesday, where Biden is expected to do well, judging by his performance in similar states, Florida is also on the ballot. Sanders's socialist identity and his praise of Fidel Castro's social programs have hurt his popularity there, polls show. 
As the Sanders campaign looked to put new pressure on his rival, Biden's campaign sought to turn the page from its fights with Sanders and signal a focus on the general election. Asked to respond to Sanders's comments, a Biden campaign statement did not even mention him. 
""Last night, Joe Biden expanded his coalition and continues to demonstrate he is the candidate who can unite the Democratic Party,"" the statement said. ""Our campaign is focused on the task at hand: defeating Donald Trump so we can make real, lasting progressive change in this country and in people's lives.""
But Sanders's message Wednesday was clear: Before you can take on Trump, you're going to have to deal with me. 
""Donald Trump must be defeated. And I will do everything in my power to make that happen,"" Sanders said. ""On Sunday night, in the first one-on-one debate of this campaign, the American people will have the opportunity to see which candidate is best positioned to accomplish that goal.""

It was an extremely eventful year.

We are using 'eventful' in the sense of 'bad.'
It was a year so eventful that every time another asteroid whizzed past the Earth, barely avoiding a collision that would have destroyed human civilization, we were not 100 percent certain it was good news.
We could not keep up with all the eventfulness. Every day, we'd wake up to learn that some new shocking alleged thing had allegedly happened, and before we had time to think about it, the political-media complex, always in Outrage Condition Red, would explode in righteous fury, with Side A and Side B hurling increasingly nasty accusations at each other and devoting immense energy to thinking up ways to totally DESTROY the other side on Twitter, a medium that has the magical power to transform everything it touches, no matter how stupid it is, into something even stupider.
Fact: This year O.J. Simpson got a Twitter account, and the reaction of nearly a million people was: 'What? The attention-seeking psychopath who got away with murdering two innocent people wants followers? Count me in!'
Speaking of attention-seeking psychopaths: The epicenter of the year's eventfulness was of course Washington, D.C., an endlessly erupting scandal volcano, belching out dense swirling smoke plumes of spin, rumor, innuendo, misdirection and lies emitted by both sides, A and B "" or, if you prefer, B and A "" filling the air with vicious rhetoric, always delivered with the pious insistence that OUR side, unlike the OTHER side, is motivated not by ego, power-lust, greed or hatred, but by a selfless desire to Work for the American People.
Meanwhile, from out beyond the Capital Beltway, the actual American people warily watched the perpetual tantrum that was supposed to be their government. And more and more their reaction, whatever side they considered themselves to be on, was: Nah.
Which is pretty much how we feel about 2019 in general. And not just because of politics. There was a continued general decline of human intelligence, as epitomized by the popularity of increasingly elaborate 'gender reveal' events. Originally these involved simply cutting open a cake that had been dyed with food coloring, but they have escalated to the point where this year they resulted in "" we are not making this up "" a fatal explosion and a plane crash. It is only a matter of time before a major city is leveled by a pink or blue mushroom cloud.
Can we say anything good about 2019? Was there any positive news, a silver lining, a reason to feel hopeful about the future "" to believe that we, as Americans, can recognize our common interests, overcome our differences and work together to build a better tomorrow, for ourselves, for our children and for the world?
Nah.
Anyway, before we shove 2019 down the garbage disposal of history, let's take one look back and remind ourselves why we want to forget this train wreck of a year, starting with …
JANUARY

… which begins with the federal government once again in the throes (whatever a 'throe' is) of a partial shutdown, which threatens to seriously disrupt the lives of all Americans who receive paychecks from the federal government. At issue is the situation at the Mexican border, which either is or is not a Crisis depending on which cable news network you prefer. President Trump wants a high concrete wall, but at the moment there is only enough money for a sternly worded south-facing billboard.
Finally the president and Congress reach a temporary budget agreement that will not address the border situation but will enable them to resume spending insane amounts of money that the nation does not have until such time as they are able to reach a permanent budget agreement enabling them to continue spending insane amounts of money that the nation does not have, this being the primary function of our federal leadership.
Meanwhile in the Robert Mueller investigation, which feels like it began during the French and Indian War, a grand jury indicts longtime Trump confidante and professional lunatic Roger Stone on a number of charges, including that he threatened to kidnap another witness's therapy dog, Bianca (really). This news elates the courageous guerrilla fighters of the Resistance, who since 2016 have been evading the fascist authorities by hiding out underground, constantly on the move from CNN panel to CNN panel. The Resisters see the Stone indictment as a sure sign that Mueller is getting ready to release his much-anticipated report, which will prove, at last, that Trump colluded with the Russians and then, at last, it will be IMPEACHMENT TIME, BABY.
Abroad, Britain is in turmoil over 'Brexit,' which is a very important thing we should all endeavor to learn about.
In sports, the Los Angeles Rams win the National Football Conference championship game after the referees, on a critical play, fail to notice when a Rams defensive back attacks a New Orleans Saints receiver with a chain saw. Responding to the ensuing outrage, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell says he will 'conduct a thorough review of league policy regarding power tools,' adding that 'New England is scheduled to win the Super Bowl anyway.'
In other sports news, the Clemson football team defeats Alabama to win the college national championship and is rewarded with an invite to the White House for a classy shindig. 'I served them massive amounts of Fast Food (I paid), over 1000 hamberders,' tweets the president, who by his own admission has a genius-level IQ.
Speaking of intelligence: The burning question of whether the nation is capable of producing a social media craze even stupider than last year's Tide Pod Challenge "" in which YouTube dimwits sought to impress other YouTube dimwits by eating compressed laundry detergent "" is answered in the affirmative ('yes') when Netflix is forced to issue a cautionary tweet to people who are inspired by the movie 'Birdbox' to take the Birdbox Challenge, in which YouTube dimwits engage in everyday activities "" including driving "" while blindfolded. Meanwhile, as a polar vortex grips the nation, other YouTube dimwits are injuring themselves attempting to demonstrate that it is cold outside by flinging pots of boiling water into the air.
From somewhere beyond our solar system hostile aliens are monitoring all this and concluding that they need not waste energy exterminating humanity, as we're doing fine on our own.

… President Trump, despite suffering from bone spurs, goes to Vietnam for a second summit with North Korea's Kim Jong Un. After a one-on-one closed-room meeting, the two leaders agree via hand gestures that next time they should definitely bring interpreters.
In domestic politics, Virginia is rocked by a series of scandals involving elected Democratic state officials, originating with the publication of a 1984 photo from Gov. Ralph Northam's medical-school yearbook showing a man in blackface. Northam initially says he is 'deeply sorry' for appearing in the photo; the next day, however, he calls a news conference to declare that he does not believe he is in the photo, although he does recall one time that he was in blackface, that being when he entered a dance contest dressed as Michael Jackson and did the moonwalk. Northam further asserts that he won the contest, and at the request of a reporter appears to be on the verge of demonstrating to the press corps that he can still moonwalk, only to be stopped by his wife. We are not making any of this up.
As pressure builds on Northam to resign, Virginia Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax prepares to succeed him, only to become embroiled in a scandal of his own when he is accused of sexual assault. The third person in line is Attorney General Mark Herring, who, several days after calling on Northam to resign for wearing blackface, issues a statement admitting that as a college student he wore blackface when he went to a party as rapper Kurtis Blow. We are still not making this up.
At this point Virginia's political leaders realize that if they keep moving down the chain of succession they're going to wind up with a Labrador retriever as governor or, worse, a Republican. And just like that the Great Virginia Scandals Scandal of 2019 goes 'poof.'
Winter storms blast the Midwest, causing havoc in Iowa as snowdrifts close major highways and strand hundreds of Democratic presidential contenders in rural communities with limited supplies of voters. In one harrowing incident, a farmer and his family are trapped inside their home for six hours while Cory Booker pounds on the front door, demanding to be let in so he can outline his plan to reduce income inequality. 'We tried to escape by the back door,' the farmer later tells reporters, 'but Amy Klobuchar was waiting out there with a seven-point program to rebuild America's infrastructure.'
In business news, Amazon (whose CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns The Washington Post) cancels plans to build a huge corporate campus in New York City, citing local political opposition and the fact that Amazon's vice president for business development, during a visit to the site in Queens, was carried off by what a company spokesperson described as 'a rat the size of a Volkswagen Jetta.'
Abroad, 'Brexit' continues to be a very important thing with many significant developments.
In sports, the New England Patriots, led by 63-year-old Tom Brady, defeat the Los Angeles Rams, 13-3, in a Super Bowl featuring one touchdown and 14 punts. During the national anthem, TV cameras clearly capture Patriots coach Bill Belichick pouring liquid from a bottle labeled 'SEDATIVES' into the Rams' Gatorade, but the NFL referee crew fails to notice. Asked about this after the game, Commissioner Roger Goodell says, 'To be honest, I was watching Netflix.'
Several weeks after the Super Bowl, Patriots owner Robert Kraft is charged in connection with a police sting operation in Florida at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa (motto: 'Where Your 'Day' Lasts About 90 Seconds'). Kraft will ultimately avoid jail time after his lawyers convince a judge that he is in the line of succession for the governorship of Virginia.
At the 91st Academy Awards, the Oscar for best picture is awarded to 'Goodfellas,' which came out in 1990 but never should have lost to 'Dances With Wolves.'

… Robert Mueller finally delivers his report to Attorney General William Barr, who promises to release it to the public 'as soon as we have blacked out the sex parts.' The cable news networks prepare for the release by bringing in panels of distinguished legal authorities to declare that the report means exactly the opposite of whatever the distinguished legal panels on the enemy networks are declaring it means.
In other political developments, President Trump, faced with mounting hostility from congressional Democrats, spends several days vigorously attacking ... John McCain. For the record, McCain (A) was a Republican and (B) died in 2018. Nobody can say for certain whether the president (A) is playing some kind of four-dimensional political chess or (B) has the reasoning skills of a Chihuahua on meth.
The Iowa state legislature considers a bill that would fund construction of a border wall around the state to stop the influx of Democratic presidential hopefuls, now estimated at several dozen a day. 'It's a humanitarian crisis,' says one legislator, his voice rising in alarm. 'They're swarming all over the state, barging into pancake breakfasts. Many of them die within days from pancake bloat, but THEY JUST KEEP COMING.'
Abroad, 'Brexit' continues to be a matter of grave concern, and for good reason.
The higher education community is rocked by scandal when federal prosecutors charge 50 people, including test administrators, wealthy parents and college coaches, in connection with a widespread bribery and fraud scheme to get students admitted to some of the nation's most prestigious universities. In one particularly egregious case, Yale admitted Trevor Buncombe-Plotzner IV, who supposedly was recruited to play varsity badminton, despite the facts that (A) Yale does not have a varsity badminton team and (B) Trevor is a cat.
In an official statement, the Association of College Admissions Officers says: 'Bribing coaches to get unqualified applicants admitted is completely unacceptable. The correct way is to give a large sum of money directly to the college.'
In a controversial legal development, actor Jussie Smollett, who was indicted by a grand jury for allegedly faking a hate crime against himself, has all charges dropped by Chicago prosecutors following a review of the evidence by an NFL officiating crew.

… Attorney General Barr finally releases the Mueller report, which accomplishes two things:

l It finally settles, to everyone's satisfaction, all of the controversies surrounding the 2016 presidential election.

l It proves that oysters speak German and can play the trombone.
Just kidding! In fact the Mueller report does neither of these things, although it comes closer to the second accomplishment than the first. The pro-Trump people say the report proves there was no collusion; the anti-Trump people say it proves Trump obstructed justice, which means that it is, at last, IMPEACHMENT TIME, BABY. Both sides emit thousands of impassioned tweets, which go unread by the American public, which long ago moved on to 'Game of Thrones.'
In other political news, Joe Biden launches his estimated 17th presidential campaign, with the slogan: 'Let Uncle Joe Give You a Great Big Hug.' Biden immediately becomes the leader of the crowded Democratic field based on the fact that his name sounds vaguely familiar.
As millions of people around the world watch in shock and disbelief, the iconic Notre Dame cathedral in Paris is ravaged by flames after being struck, in what appears to be a deliberate act of provocation, by a North Korean missile.
Elsewhere abroad, 'Brexit' continues to be a vitally important thing.
In science news, some astronomers at a party, after several rounds of tequila shots, take a blurry snapshot of a flaming gas-stove burner and release it to the news media, claiming that it's the first-ever photograph of a black hole. The photo instantly becomes worldwide news, much to the delight of the astro-pranksters, who begin work on a plan to pass off a dental X-ray as the Loch Ness Monster.
In golf, Tiger Woods wins his fifth Masters tournament, catching and passing leader Francesco Molinari after two of Molinari's shots "" on the 12th hole and then again on the 15th "" hit NFL referee crews that have strayed onto the fairway.

… Robert Mueller resigns as special counsel, saying that he plans to return to private life and 'whimper in the fetal position.' In his final statement, he clears up any lingering confusion about his investigation by noting that the Justice Department cannot charge the president with a federal crime, adding, 'not that I am, or am not, saying, or not saying, that the president did, or did not, do anything that was, or was not, illegal. Or, not.'
Congressional Democrats, firm in their belief that the American public wants nothing more than to continue refighting the 2016 election until the Earth crashes into the sun, take Mueller's statement as a call for IMPEACHMENT TIME, BABY.
For his part, Trump emits a tweet stating, quote: 'Russia, Russia, Russia! That's all you heard at the beginning of this Witch Hunt Hoax…And now Russia has disappeared because I had nothing to do with Russia helping me to get elected.' This wording seems to suggest that the president thinks Russia helped him to get elected, so a short while later he clarifies his position by telling reporters, 'No, Russia did not help me get elected.' And thus the matter is finally laid to rest.
As far as we are aware, none of this has anything to do with 'Brexit.'
On the domestic political front, disgraced former New York Congresscreep Anthony Weiner is released from a halfway house and, in a sincere display of remorse, announces that he is running for president.
Just kidding! In fact Weiner is one of the estimated four Democrats not running for president. Among those entering the race is New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who, having solved all of his city's problems, announces that he is running under the campaign slogan 'This Slogan Is Currently Out of Order.' De Blasio heads for Iowa, where he quickly surges to 13,357th in the Des Moines Register/CNN poll, just behind swine dysentery.

… tensions in the Mideast, which have been escalating for over 3,000 years, escalate still further when Iran attacks two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman, then shoots down a U.S. spy drone. In retaliation, President Trump orders a military strike against Iran, only to call it off at the last minute when he is advised that it could result in serious damage to a golf course.
In other presidential action, Trump travels to England, where, in his role as leader of the United States on an official visit to America's greatest ally at a critical time, he attacks ... Bette Midler. In a tweet emitted at 1:30 a.m. London time, the president describes Ms. Midler as a 'Washed up psycho.' Fox News confirms this.
Later in the month Trump becomes the first sitting U.S. president to set foot in North Korea, where he and Kim Jong Un engage in denuclearization talks, capped off with a ceremonial Prisoner Shoot.
This seems like a good place to mention 'Brexit.'
Meanwhile as the 2020 U.S. presidential race heats up, several hundred Democratic presidential contenders gather in Miami for the first major debates. The front-runner is Joe Biden, but he suffers a setback when Sen. Kamala Harris, in what is clearly a planned attack, points out that Biden is wearing his pants backward. Biden's staff hastily releases a statement explaining that the former vice president 'thought it was Friday.' Also getting a lot of attention is Marianne Williamson, who qualifies for the debates based on the number of campaign donations she received from other dimensions.
For his part, President Trump launches his 2020 reelection bid with a rally in Orlando attended by 246 million people, as confirmed by Fox News.
In entertainment news, James Holzhauer's record-breaking victory streak on 'Jeopardy!' finally comes to an end when, in the Final Jeopardy round, he is flagged for a face mask violation by an NFL officiating crew.
San Francisco, always on the forefront, becomes the first U.S. city to ban exhaling, which according to scientists is a leading cause of carbon dioxide. Meanwhile the city of Riviera Beach, Fla., pays nearly $600,000 in bitcoin to hackers who paralyzed the city's computer system by attacking it with 'ransomware,' which is sort of like a Windows update except that at least there's somebody who knows how to fix it.

… President Trump, having dealt with the existential threat to the nation that is Bette Midler, turns his attention to four Democratic first-term members of Congress known as 'The Squad,' tweeting that if they hate America so much they should 'go back' to where they come from. Critics note that three of the four were born in the very same nation as Trump, not to mention the fact that the 'go back' thing is an old racist taunt, leaving the president with no decent course of action but to issue an apology. So of course that is not what he does. What he does is tweet additional criticisms of The Squad, along with the assertion that 'I don't have a Racist bone in my body!' (The exclamation mark proves it's true!)
The president also finds time in his busy July schedule to issue tweets attacking "" among other targets "" Baltimore, the Federal Reserve, the mayor of San Juan, CNN, the mayor of London, Paul Ryan, Fox News (!) and Sweden, but if we're going to go into detail on every single one of the president's Twitter beefs we will never get through this year. Suffice it to say that the Resistance is so frantically busy refuting Trump tweets "" this being the activity that consumes 99.9 percent of the Resistance's time and mental energy "" that toward the end of the month prominent Democrats find themselves reflexively defending the integrity and moral righteousness of Al Sharpton.
In other political news, an exhausted-looking Robert Mueller makes his 237th appearance before the House Kabuki Theater Committee, and the entire nation tunes in, except for those parts of the nation located outside of Washington, D.C. Mueller says little that is new, generally limiting his answers to 'yes,' 'no' and, when an aide pokes him awake, 'ouch.' Under questioning, Mueller seems surprisingly unfamiliar with his own team's report, at one point stating, in response to a question, that he had never heard of any 'Vladimir Putin.'
Trump declares that the hearing proves the whole investigation was a WITCH HUNT! Congressional Democrats say it proves that it is IMPEACHMENT TIME, BABY. Bears continue to poop in the woods.
In the second round of Democratic debates, front-runner Joe Biden is still the main target of the other candidates, but he does a better job of defending himself, delivering several well-crafted retorts written in Sharpie on his forearms.
In federal action, White House and congressional negotiators set side their mutual loathing long enough to agree on a bipartisan budget deal that will enable the government to continue spending insane amounts of money that it does not have. Thus the pesky problem of uncontrolled federal spending is disposed of until after the 2020 election, freeing our leaders to focus on more pressing issues, and of course tweet about them.
Abroad, a person named 'Boris,' who apparently styles his hair with a commercial leaf blower, becomes prime minister of England, a development that very likely could have something to do with 'Brexit.'
On the escalating Middle East tension front, the United States says it shot down an Iranian drone in the Strait of Hormuz. In response, Iran's ambassador to the United Nations claims he will produce documentation proving that 'Strait of Hormuz' can be rearranged to spell 'Him Fart Zoo Rust.'
In sports, the superb U.S. women's national soccer team, following years of hard work and sacrifice, wins its fourth World Cup and a first prize of $4 million, or about $200,000 per player. Later in the month, a 16-year-old high school student named Kyle Giersdorf wins a Fortnite video-game tournament. His prize "" really "" is $3 million. 'I'm so happy,' says Kyle. 'Everything I've done in the grind has all paid off and it's just insane.'
It is, Kyle. It really is.

This goes on for several days, after which the shootings drift out of the news until it's time for the next Serious National Conversation.
Conspiracy theories swirl in the wake of the death of millionaire pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who allegedly committed suicide in a New York City federal prison cell despite supposedly being under the close supervision of an NFL officiating crew.
In financial news, the Dow Jones industrial average flits up and down like a butterfly on meth as investors try to figure out what President Trump's mood is at any given minute regarding the trade war with China, which is caused by China unfairly forcing U.S. consumers to buy low-cost Chinese-made electronics instead of traditional American brands such as Philco. The president's main strategy in fighting this war is to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, which means U.S. consumers have to pay more for them. Take THAT, China!
Another bee buzzing around in the presidential bonnet during August is Greenland, which Trump decides the United States should try to purchase, since it has a strategic location and is potentially the source of more than 70 percent of the world's supply of frostbite. It turns out, however, that Greenland belongs to Denmark, which for some reason wants to keep it. 'We're not for sale,' states Greenland's minister of education, culture, church and foreign affairs, whose name "" we are not making this up "" is Ane Lone Bagger.
It is not immediately clear where Ane Lone Bagger stands on 'Brexit.'
Meanwhile the American Midwest faces an unprecedented humanitarian crisis as Nebraska, Wisconsin and Minnesota struggle to absorb waves of Iowans fleeing the worsening disaster in their home state, which is overrun with Democratic presidential contenders demonstrating their likability by eating fried things on sticks. Joe Biden remains the front-runner in Iowa despite the fact that, to judge from his remarks at campaign events, he believes he is in Belgium.
In other August news, Popeyes introduces a chicken sandwich to compete with Chick-fil-A's chicken sandwich. Also there are massive pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and the Amazon rainforest is burning, but the Battle of the Chicken Sandwiches definitely generates more excitement.
Speaking of excitement …
september

… begins with President Trump facing a major crisis involving the crucial issue of whether Alabama was, or was not, ever actually threatened by Hurricane Dorian. The crisis erupts on Sept. 1, when, with Dorian moving toward the U.S. mainland, the president tweets that Alabama is among the states that will 'most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated.' Minutes later the National Weather Service in Birmingham responds with a statement that 'Alabama will NOT see any impacts from #Dorian.'
At this point the president acknowledges that he made a minor mistake, thus laying the issue to rest and freeing everyone to focus on more important matters.

Ha-ha! That would never happen. Donald Trump did not get where he is by allowing himself to be corrected about the weather by any so-called 'National Weather Service.' The president mounts an intensive, multi-day, multi-tweet offensive on the Alabama issue, highlighted by an Oval Office meeting with reporters during which he displays a week-old National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration map proving conclusively that Alabama was in fact threatened by a black line that was obviously added to the map by an inept amateur with a Sharpie.
The crisis continues for several more days, with the president refusing to back down or drop the subject, very much the way Winston Churchill, in the darkest hours of World War II, stood firm when England, alone, faced the menacing forces of the National Weather Service.
Speaking of dire threats: CNN's special seven-hour 'town hall' broadcast on the global climate crisis attracts a nationwide audience estimated at nearly 30 viewers, counting household pets. Ten Democratic presidential candidates present their plans for saving the planet, which include strictly regulating or banning fossil fuels, nuclear power, red meat, plastic straws, fracking, white meat, cars, lightbulbs, barbecues, capitalism, farting, grayish meat, babies and airplane flights that are not transporting Democratic presidential candidates. The highlight of the night comes when Joe Biden develops a weird red eyeball as a result of being hit by a tranquilizer dart fired by his staff to prevent him from suddenly hugging a CNN moderator. This debate is followed by another debate later in the month. Or maybe it was the same debate, and we all fell asleep for a while in the middle. There is no way to tell.
Bill de Blasio drops out of the Democratic presidential race, bitterly disappointing the residents of New York when they learn that Bill plans to resume mayoring them.
In international news (we are counting Canada as a foreign country) Canadian Premier Justin Trudeau is embarrassed by the publication of yet another photograph "" this is the third time "" of him wearing blackface. The good news for Justin is that this moves him up to fourth in the line of succession for the governorship of Virginia.
Meanwhile in Great Britain, 'Brexit' continues to cause everybody over there to be quite agitated, for British people.

As September draws to a close, President Trump finds himself facing what could prove to be his biggest single crisis of the entire month when a whistleblower accuses him of improperly pressuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in a July phone call to investigate Joe Biden and Joe's son Hunter's connections with a Ukrainian energy company, which at one point was paying Hunter $50,000 a month, apparently for his expertise in the field of receiving large sums of money.
In a surprise move, Trump orders the release of a rough transcript of the call, which proves conclusively whatever you want it to prove depending on whether you are on Side A or Side B. Congressional Democrats declare that it is a Smoking Gun, which means that, at last, it is IMPEACHMENT TIME, BABY, AND THIS TIME WE REALLY MEAN IT. Trump declares that this is just another WITCH HUNT and emits an unusually high volume of tweets in which he sounds increasingly like a derelict arguing with himself in an alley next to a convenience store, but not as coherent.
While all this is happening the U.S. budget deficit approaches $1 trillion, but everybody in Washington is way too excited about the Impeachment Drama to even think about it.
The excitement continues in …
october

... when Washington whips itself into a frenzy the likes of which it experiences only once every two or three weeks as a consensus begins to develop among the courageous Resisters of the Resistance that it really is DEFINITELY ALMOST NEARLY IMPEACHMENT TIME AND WE ARE REALLY NOT FOOLING AROUND ANYMORE. The Democrats, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, a man who "" this is merely an observation, not a criticism "" would not look out of place popping up from a prairie-dog hole, accuse Trump of breaking the law in the Ukraine phone call, while Trump defenders insist that
technically 
there was no quid pro quo, in the same sense that, in 'The Godfather,' the severed horse's head in the movie producer's bed was
technically 
not a threat.

The president's defense strategy is to tweet several times per hour, sometimes with most of the words correctly spelled, that the call was PERFECT and everyone should READ THE TRANSCRIPT! Apparently he is unaware that everyone already did. Along the way the president reaches a historic milestone, sending out his 11,000th tweet as president, eclipsing the record held by Grover Cleveland.
For the Democrats, there is good news and bad news. The good news is that Trump's poll numbers are down. The bad news is that the Democrats are ... the Democrats. Their front-runner, Joe Biden, continues to struggle on the campaign trail, as exemplified by an appearance at a 7-Eleven store in Waterloo, Iowa, during which he addresses the Slurpee machine as 'your excellency.'
Poised to eclipse Biden is Elizabeth Warren (campaign slogan: 'She Is MUCH Smarter Than You') with her Medicare-for-all plan, which she says will cost $20.5 trillion, with the '.5' proving that she has this thing figured out right down to the penny. Warren says her plan will not raise taxes on the middle class because all the money will come from greedy corporations, greedy billionaires, greedy gold-pooping unicorns and various cost efficiencies, which of course is what the federal government is famous for.
In foreign affairs, Trump surprises everybody, possibly including himself, by suddenly pulling U.S. troops out of Syria, thus throwing the region into even more turmoil than usual, which is a lot of turmoil. During the confusion, U.S. forces conduct a daring raid that results in the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, thus removing him from the line of succession for the governorship of Virginia. And of course no discussion of foreign affairs would be complete without some mention of 'Brexit.'
Meanwhile California, plagued by out-of-control wildfires, widespread power blackouts, spiraling housing costs, decaying infrastructure and a worsening homelessness epidemic, becomes the first state to enact a law banning the sale of fur products.
In sports, Simone Biles becomes the first gymnast to perform a floor routine that requires clearance from the Federal Aviation Administration. In another 'feel good' sports story, the New York Yankees, with by far the highest payroll in baseball, complete an entire decade without even getting into the World Series. Meanwhile concern mounts over the state of NFL officiating after a Lions-Packers game in which, late in the fourth quarter, the teams play two consecutive downs without a single penalty being called. 'It won't happen again,' vows Commissioner Goodell.
Speaking of mounting concern, in …
november

… it is finally IMPEACHMENT TIME FOR REAL, ALMOST, as the House Committee on Endless Squabbling holds a classic congressional hearingpalooza featuring Bombshell Testimony, Gaveling, Points of Order, Yielding of Time, False Civility, Really Long Questions That Are Not Actually Questions and all the other elements that would make for riveting drama if everybody on the planet didn't already know the outcome, specifically that the Democrats would conclude that the president committed impeachable offenses, and the Republicans would conclude that he didn't. When it's all over, the public remains divided exactly as it was between the people who loathe Trump and the people who loathe the people who loathe Trump. Meanwhile bears continue to etc.
There is one positive impeachment-related development, which occurs when Rep. Eric Swalwell, appearing on MSNBC, makes the following statement: 'So far the evidence is uncontradicted that the president used taxpayer dollars to help him cheat [GIANT FART S
OUND] an election.' This results in several days of spirited debate on Twitter concerning the issue of whether Swalwell cut the cheese (he denies it) with people of all political persuasions weighing in on #fartgate in the closest thing we have had to a genuinely open-minded national conversation in years.

Conan, a Belgian Malinois who was injured in the Delta Force raid that resulted in the death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is invited to the White House, where President Trump, in recognition of the heroic dog's service to the nation, appoints him secretary of the Navy.
In other political news, Mike Bloomberg joins the Democratic presidential field, declaring that 'what America needs, now more than ever, is a rich, aging, white male New Yorker with a huge ego.'
On the economic front, Popeyes resumes production of chicken sandwiches, and consumers resume assaulting one another over them, because if a $3.99 wad of heavily breaded chicken on a bun is not worth getting injured or even killed over, then what is?
Tesla CEO Elon Musk introduces an all-electric 'Cybertruck' featuring sophisticated technology and a striking resemblance to a doorstop. The best feature, Musk notes, is that 'when you're sitting inside it, you can't see it.'
Abroad, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is indicted on charges including bribery and fraud; if convicted, he would move up to sixth in the line of succession for governorship of Virginia.
Also still happening abroad, to the best of our knowledge, is 'Brexit.'
The month draws to a close with the Thanksgiving holiday, a time when families gather to argue about politics, according to helpful guides written on this topic each year by people from other planets, as opposed to Earth, where families gather to argue about pass interference and burp. At the White House, Trump, carrying on a lighthearted holiday tradition, 'pardons' two turkeys, named Bread and Butter. Within seconds they are eaten by Secretary of the Navy Conan.
The capital carnage intensifies in ...
december

... when House Democrats decide that IT REALLY, REALLY IS IMPEACHMENT TIME SERIOUSLY, PEOPLE, THIS IS NOT A DRILL. This sets the stage for a historic trial in the Senate, after which (spoiler alert!) the Democrats will vote to convict and the Republicans will vote to acquit and we will be back to exactly where we started with no minds changed and Sides A and B hating each other more than ever.

So this is a very exciting time in Washington, although to the rest of the nation, which is getting into holiday mode, the heated rhetoric emanating from the capital is an unwelcome annoyance, like the shouting of the couple in the next-door apartment who never seem to stop arguing ('WHAT ABOUT THE JULY 25TH PHONE CALL?' 'OH YEAH? WHAT ABOUT HUNTER BIDEN?' 'OH YEAH? WHAT ABOUT ...'). Each morning the nation wakes up, hears the angry noise coming through the walls, then plugs a pair of Apple AirPods into its national ears and cranks up Johnny Mathis singing 'Winter Wonderland.'
In other political news, Joe Biden, seeking to add some 'zing' to his presidential campaign, tours Iowa in a bus sporting, in big letters, his new slogan: 'No Malarkey!' ('Malarkey' is an ancient Gaelic word meaning 'clue.') This slogan was selected after being tested on a focus group of voters, half of whom were senior citizens and the other half of whom were dead. The runner-up slogans were 'You're Darned Tooting He Can Cut the Mustard!' and 'Stay Off His Lawn!'
Kamala Harris drops out of the race, reducing the number of leading Democratic contenders to 58, an estimated one-third of whom are billionaires. Meanwhile Hillary Clinton continues to hint that she may run again at the urging of many highly respected voices that only she can hear. In Iowa voter polling, the front-runner remains Pete 'Pete' Buttigieg, followed closely by a surging Baby Yoda.
In foreign affairs, President Trump attends a meeting of NATO leaders in London, where, using his unique diplomatic skills, he is able to unite America's crucial European allies in the belief that he is a buffoon.
And let's not forget about 'Brexit.'
In entertainment news, millions of Netflix users are watching Martin Scorsese's film 'The Irishman,' a sweeping epic that begins in the 1950s and ends at some point after you fall asleep on the sofa, because the running time is longer than veterinary school. Nobody, including Scorsese, has ever actually made it to the end of 'The Irishman,' which takes place in the distant future and is rumored to feature an intergalactic battle between alien space Teamsters.
In other TV-related news, people are outraged about a Peloton ad, because in this day and age people need things to be outraged about.
Finally, mercifully, this highly eventful year draws to a close. As New Year's Eve approaches, the nation pauses to look back on 2019 and throw up a little bit in its national mouth. But then the nation looks forward to 2020, and it feels faint stirrings of hope in its national heart. Because America has been bitterly divided before. There was the Civil War, for example, and that time we could not agree on the color of that dress on the Internet. If we got through those troubles, we can get through the current ones. Because in the end, despite our political differences, we're all Americans, and we care about each other and want the best possible future for everyone. Right?
Nah.
But happy new year anyway.

Poor showings with traditional Democrats, black voters loom large

BURLINGTON, Vt. - Tuesday night was the 39th anniversary of Bernie Sanders's narrow victory to become the mayor of this liberal lakeside city, the race that launched the career of one of the country's most prominent left-wing politicians.
But what could have been a triumphant homecoming for a political revolutionary seemingly on course to become the Democratic presidential nominee instead morphed quickly into a moment of reckoning - a sign that the political movement he has built may not be enough to get him to the White House.
By Wednesday, Sanders sought to regain his footing from primary election defeats in several key states as his campaign advisers looked to address his glaring inability to win African Americans and traditional Democrats.
Hours after Joe Biden racked up wins in at least 10 of the 14 Super Tuesday states, Sanders took sharp aim at the former vice president's record, a sign of what aides said would be a more confrontational posture in the coming weeks. Sanders also unveiled a pair of television commercials critical of Biden's record on Social Security and trade in states voting later this month.
""Joe and I have a very different vision for the future of this country, and Joe and I are running very different campaigns,"" Sanders said. ""My hope is that in the coming months, we will be able to debate and discuss the very significant differences that we have.""
Sanders's reset attempt, coming less than a week before another critical set of primaries, reflected a divide among some of his supporters about how to proceed.
In some parts of the Sanders orbit, there have been private discussions about how to reassure Democrats that Sanders - a democratic socialist who frequently lambastes the party establishment - is an ally of the party.
The campaign released an ad featuring an audio clip of former president Barack Obama praising Sanders, a clear attempt to undercut the benefit that has accrued to Biden, particularly among black voters, as the loyal lieutenant to the country's first African American president.
The flurry of activity amounted to the clearest acknowledgment yet that the coalition Sanders has built - which is composed largely of young people, liberals, working-class voters and Latino voters - has failed to expand since Sanders's upstart 2016 bid, all as the rest of the party has coalesced behind Biden.
The Tuesday results, in which Sanders led in California while winning Colorado, Utah and Vermont, offered a reminder that he retains a forceful position in the party - win or lose the nomination - with support from a quarter to a third of the base.
But much of his team's focus Wednesday was on the need for improvement.

Exit polls showed that the struggles Sanders experienced among black voters four years ago against Clinton were largely unchanged. Black voters boosted Biden across Southern states on Super Tuesday, with exit polling showing that he won the votes of roughly 7 in 10 black voters in Virginia and Alabama, and did nearly as well in North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas, getting roughly 60 percent of the black vote.
Sanders's push to broaden the electorate with scores of new voters rallying behind him hasn't been realized. And he has struggled to persuade voters that a leftist political revolution is the best way to beat President Trump.
Now, Sanders is confronting a radically different political landscape from 11 days ago, when he was flying high after a decisive win in Nevada seemed to put him in the driver's seat in the Democratic race. Divisions in the moderate wing of the party that enabled him to succeed with a limited, if loyal, base have been resolved.
On Wednesday, Sanders appeared frustrated by the decision by former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg - who ended his campaign after a disappointing showing - and others to end their campaigns and line up behind Biden.
""How do we stop Bernie Sanders?"" the senator from Vermont said. ""What you do is you get candidates out of the race to rally around Joe Biden.""
Sanders campaign officials were hopeful that as more votes were tallied in California - Tuesday's biggest prize - the delegate advantage Biden had built would shrink or disappear entirely. Even if it does, though, the path ahead for Sanders is a treacherous one, with some states that present opportunities but many others that seem more favorable to Biden.
Campaign officials are also eyeing Michigan, a populous state where Sanders defeated Clinton in 2016. But Florida, another delegate-rich state where many Democrats were angered by Sanders's recent comments praising Fidel Castro, is likely to be much tougher.
Mississippi, which holds its primary next week, could be another difficult contest for Sanders due to the state's high concentration of black voters.
Sanders planned to travel Friday to Jackson, Miss., to deliver a speech at a civil rights museum, although his aides declined to say what he would talk about.
His struggles were apparent in the closing days of the South Carolina primary, when he drew mostly white crowds.
Chokwe Lumumba, the African American mayor of Jackson, Miss., where Sanders will be Friday, spent time in South Carolina campaigning for Sanders last week. He recalled meeting a young African American man who told him, ""My student loans are killing me.""
""I asked who he was voting for, and he said Joe Biden,"" recalled Lumumba. ""I said, 'I don't know what his policy is around your student loans, but I know where Bernie Sanders is.' ""
Some close Sanders allies believe the distance between the Sanders movement and the party have caused broader issues, especially when Biden is portraying himself as a unifier. Now, some are trying to bridge that gap in hopes of mending old wounds and preventing new ones.
""Our campaign is deeply proud of the Democratic Party and contributions to America,"" said Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign. ""We are open to listening and earning the trust of every Democrat from every ideological spectrum to earn the right to lead this extraordinary party.""
Some Sanders allies believe the problem is deeper than party identity.
As Sanders spoke in Vermont on Wednesday afternoon, a handful of his prominent supporters quietly connected by phone and text message, according to three Democrats familiar with those discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private deliberations.
In these discussions, some debated whether Sanders's anti-establishment message was enough. ""We've got to be ready for when the party gets cold feet on Biden and looks to us,"" one of the Democrats said. ""We can't just keep running the same playbook again and again.""
A second Democrat involved said there are plans to reach out to supporters of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) in key states, should she drop out, but those efforts are not being directed by Sanders's inner circle since they are busy with primary contests, ads and travel.
The second Democrat added that there are some leading liberals in Sanders's orbit who would like to see ""less Michael Moore and the Squad"" on the campaign trail.
Warren's intentions were not clear on Wednesday, and her continued presence in the race is hurting Sanders, some of his allies privately acknowledged. As the senator from Massachusetts hunkered down to consider her future after failing to gain traction anywhere on Tuesday, she and Sanders spoke, according to the senator from Vermont.
Sanders said it was important to ""respect the time and the space that she needs to make her decision.""
One bright spot for Sanders on Tuesday was California, where he was leading and performed well among Latino voters.
Analilia Mejia, Sanders's political director, said the campaign sought to capitalize early on what it saw as a chance to make inroads with Latino voters by immersing itself in Hispanic communities through intimate meetings, the hiring of staff who knew local areas best and by encouraging young Latinos to persuade their parents to consider supporting Sanders.
""What people see outwardly,"" Mejia said, is ""a rally at a particular location or state or city. What isn't always apparent is we build clutches with leaders and communities before and after those rallies.""

White House lawyers are gearing up for a scorched-earth defense of President Trump in the impeachment trial, mounting a politically charged case aimed more at swaying American voters than GOP senators "" and damaging Trump's possible 2020 opponent, Joe Biden.
 Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, and Jay Sekulow, Trump's personal attorney, plan to use their time in the trial to target the former vice president and his son Hunter, according to multiple GOP officials familiar with the strategy. Trump's allies believe that if they can argue that the president had a plausible reason for requesting the Biden investigation in Ukraine, they can both defend him against the impeachment charges and gain the added bonus of undercutting a political adversary. 
The strategy "" aimed squarely at muddying the waters surrounding the two impeachment articles of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress "" carries potential risk. Some congressional Republicans have encouraged the White House to prioritize a line-by-line rebuttal of the Democrats' case, ensuring that wary moderates are provided enough cover to vote for Trump's acquittal. It is unclear whether going after a former colleague will sway that core constituency, protecting moderates from possible political blowback at home "" though a senior administration official made clear that Trump's legal team would try to do both.
The official, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter frankly.
The Biden campaign condemned the strategy.
'Donald Trump is so terrified of facing Joe Biden that he became the only president in American history to attempt to coerce a foreign nation into lying about a political rival,' spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement. 'Even members of his own administration "" including his former top envoy to Ukraine "" have refuted the conspiracy theory that he tried to force Ukraine to spread to bail out his struggling reelection campaign.' 
The offensive will mark the first time lawmakers or the public have heard a full-throated White House defense. The president's attorneys rejected the House invitation to participate in the last phase of the impeachment inquiry, making their presentation "" expected Saturday and Monday "" the team's first major turn in the spotlight. 
Until now, the White House has struggled to address why Trump froze military aid to Ukraine and repeatedly postponed a promised White House meeting with newly elected President Volodymyr Zelensky while pressing for investigations of the Bidens and an unfounded conspiracy theory about Ukraine interfering in the 2016 election. The White House also has had difficulty explaining why Trump's personal attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani was the point person on policy toward the Eastern European nation. 
In October, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney openly admitted that a quid pro quo occurred, telling reporters to 'get over it' "" though he later walked back the comments. 
Trump is eager for his team to take the stage and has been trying to strategically time it to maximize TV viewership. He has told allies that while he's fine with the defense beginning its presentation Saturday for a few hours starting at 10 a.m. "" in part because he hopes it will drive discussions on Sunday morning talk shows "" he prefers the bulk of their arguments to happen Monday when more Americans will be watching television, according to White House officials who were not authorized to speak publicly. 
'After having been treated unbelievably unfairly in the House, and then having to endure hour after hour of lies, fraud - deception by Shifty Schiff, Cryin' Chuck Schumer - their crew, looks like my lawyers will be forced to start on Saturday, which is called Death Valley in T.V.,' Trump tweeted Friday morning. 
The emerging strategy comes as the White House has heard conflicting advice from Republicans eager to share their opinion on the best rebuttal. In recent weeks, there has been a quiet, behind-the-scenes lobbying campaign by both GOP senators and Trump's House allies on his defense team, creating confusion among Republicans about which strategy the White House will adopt.
The deliberations occasionally have been marked by intense discussions, including debates about whether to push a process-focused case against Democrats or to take on each of their points and accusations individually, according to senators and congressional aides familiar with the talks. Over the past 24 hours, the debate has focused more on how much time should be dedicated to going after the Bidens. 
Those divergent views were on full display in the Capitol this week. Rep. Lee Zeldin, a New York Republican advising Trump's defense team, told reporters that Trump's lawyers needed to re-litigate what is considered a debunked conspiracy theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 election to help Hillary Clinton "" and, therefore, justified Trump pushing Ukraine to investigate the matter. But some Senate Republicans, including No. 2 leader John Thune (S.D.), want the White House to avoid what they consider a baseless conspiracy theory. 
'I think the intelligence community has very conclusively determined that it was Russia "" and not Ukraine "" that interfered in the 2016 election, so . . . I guess that's not a direction I would have them go,' Thune said.
Other Senate Republicans, including Trump ally Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), have publicly pushed back on a key White House legal team talking point: that the charges against the president do not constitute a crime and therefore his actions are not impeachable. 
Trump himself actively recruited lawyer and TV commentator Alan Dershowitz at a Mar-a-Lago buffet to make that very argument "" then sought out Dershowitz's wife to help persuade him to do it. 'He wants me to make the argument that the case does not meet the grounds for impeachment,' said Dershowitz. 'He knows that I feel very strongly about constitutional issues.'
Democrats, meanwhile, have been bracing for this moment, anxious about the Trump team getting 24 hours without any interruptions and pushback from impeachment managers. That concern only grew after Trump's lawyers uttered several inaccuracies on the Senate floor Tuesday, including a claim that House Republicans were not allowed to question witnesses during closed-door depositions. They could, and they did.
Democrats want to ensure that the Trump team doesn't get the last word, in part by using some of the allotted 16 hours of questions and answers to correct any misstatements. 
'I'm concerned about their deceptive and misleading statements,' said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), promising that Democrats would 'ask questions that are, in effect, an invitation to set the record straight.'
Democrats have been anticipating that the defense would shift attention from Trump's alleged misconduct to focus on the Bidens. That, in part, is what drove House managers to devote a considerable portion of their Thursday presentation to a preemptive rebuttal on those points, arguing that several Republicans and Europeans had supported Biden's efforts to push out corrupt former Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin. 
Trump and Republicans have accused Biden "" without evidence "" of ousting Shokin because the prosecutor was investigating Burisma, a Ukrainian energy company that employed Hunter Biden on its board while the elder Biden was vice president. But former U.S. and Ukrainian officials have said the prosecutor's investigation of Burisma had been dormant, and many had hoped that the change in prosecutors backed by Biden and others would lead to more aggressive anti-corruption investigations. Republicans also have pointed to concerns about the appearance of a conflict of interest, which were expressed by some of the Democrats' top witnesses in the impeachment inquiry.
'The House managers sort of drove a knife through the heart of those false arguments ahead of time . . . and I think that will help make the case,' Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters Thursday. 
Not all Republicans are eager about a singular focus on the former vice president. In an unusual role-reversal, Trump's most aggressive House allies have urged the legal team to focus on trying to undercut the Democrats' timeline and arguments.
'You can't talk about corruption broadly without talking about Burisma and Hunter Biden's involvement,' said Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), who also is assisting the defense team. 'That being said, I think the vast majority of this emphasis is on what were the components that led the president to ultimately release the aid.' 
Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and his top attorney on the House Oversight Committee, Steve Castor, both of whom participated in the House investigation, have been working with the Trump team to try to highlight what they see as weak spots in the impeachment case.
As the impeachment managers showed clips of Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland confirming a quid pro quo, Jordan has pushed for the team to counter by highlighting Sondland's changing statements as well as his own admission that he never heard such a directive from Trump.
'Remember, Sondland is the guy who had to amend his testimony, the guy who had to clarify his testimony, is the guy they rely on the most?' Jordan said.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) has been on the other side of the argument, working closely with the White House and meeting with Trump's legal team as recently as Thursday evening to encourage them to go hard on Hunter Biden's Burisma position. 
'Focus on what matters, which is the substance,' he said on Hugh Hewitt's radio show Friday morning, summarizing his advice to Trump's team. 'And I told them, 'Look, nothing matters more than the facts on Burisma.' . . . Lay out substantive, factual reasons why investigating Burisma, the president had a responsibility to do so.'
Senate Republicans said they have been eager to hear what Trump's team has to say "" in part because they don't know what line of attack it will take. Privately, some Republican senators have groused in recent days that the Trump team is 'everywhere but nowhere,' as one described the dynamic, speaking on the condition anonymity to give a frank assessment.
'They are on TV and at the Capitol yelling at the Democrats, but I'm not really sure what the whole range of the argument is. Are you?' the GOP senator asked, adding that the frustration was shared by other Republicans.

Issue-driven race turns personal
Democrats spar over gender, race, finances

INDIANOLA, Iowa "" The race for the Democratic nomination burst into a multifront flurry of attacks and counterattacks on Sunday, as the largely issue-driven contest veered personal just two weeks before the first vote.
The aggression came from multiple candidates on multiple fronts, with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and former vice president Joe Biden sparring about Social Security while Sanders aides excoriated Biden for his record on race. 
Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) criticized Mike Bloomberg for postponing the release of his financial disclosure statements, saying that the billionaire and former New York mayor is 'trying to skip the 'democracy' part of the election' and that voters won't know of potential financial entanglements until after Super Tuesday.
It is all unfolding in the midst of a confrontation between Sanders and Warren over gender and electability, which continued to play out Sunday, when Sanders said he believed gender is an obstacle for any female presidential candidate. 
The pent-up feuds are unspooling at an unpredictable moment, with a quartet of candidates essentially tied in Iowa and trying to mobilize two of the most energized portions of the Democratic electorate: suburban women and black voters.
These dynamics are playing out in multiple early-voting states, including in Iowa, where some 60 percent of likely caucus-goers are still undecided, and South Carolina, with its heavily black population and a Feb. 29 primary, in which polls show Biden out ahead.

'There's still such a large group of undecideds, and everyone's goal is to sway the undecideds into their camp,' said Tameika Isaac Devine, the influential mayor pro tem of Columbia, S.C. 'I don't think anybody would necessarily think it's desperation time yet, but there's a strong sense of urgency.' 
It's unclear how these aggressive attacks will play in a contest where candidates who launch negative attacks are often penalized in the polls. 
One of the most fraught areas of debate has been over the role that gender should play as voters consider who would be best-positioned to defeat President Trump. Warren has said Sanders told her in a private meeting in 2018 that a woman could not win, a charge that Sanders denied. 
Asked on Sunday if he thought gender was an obstacle for female candidates, Sanders replied, 'The answer is yes.'
'But I think everybody has their own sets of problems,' he said in an interview with New Hampshire Public Radio. 'I'm 78 years of age. That's a problem. . . . If you're looking at Buttigieg, he's a young guy, people will say, 'Well, he's too young to be president. You look at this one, she's a woman.' So everybody, you know, brings some negatives.'
'I would just hope very much that the American people look at the totality of a candidate,' he said. 'Not at their gender, not at their sexuality, not at their age. But at everything. Nobody is perfect. There ain't no perfect candidate out there.'
Warren declined to engage in any further debate on the subject. When asked in Des Moines whether being a woman is a political obstacle she said, 'I have no further comment on this.'
'I have been friends with Bernie for a long time,' she said. 'We work together on many, many issues. And that's all I'm going to say on this.'
Compared with the 2016 Republican primary, when Trump mocked the appearance of his opponents and their wives and was ridiculed about the size of his hands, this most recent Democratic contest has been mild. Much of the discussion so far has focused on health-care policy, troop levels in the Middle East and immigration. 
But underlying most of the debate of late is a question of how Trump would use his politics of personal destruction against the eventual nominee, and which Democrat is most equipped to handle that. Sanders has said Trump would launch sexist attacks that could prove effective against Warren. He has also said that Biden has too much 'baggage' that the president could weaponize. 
Biden, meanwhile, has said that the positions held by Sanders, a democratic socialist, would be used by Trump to defeat him as presidential nominee and could also hurt Democrats in down-ballot races. 
Biden has grown increasingly agitated over the tone Sanders had taken with him recently, and had been simmering over a video his rival's campaign was pushing that suggested Biden wanted to cut Social Security. 
In an indication that the attacks were resonating, a voter here on Saturday pressed Biden about his position. Biden initially hesitated to name Sanders, saying that his campaign advisers would probably urge him not to challenge his rival over a video that his campaign had been circulating online. 
'It's simply a lie,' Biden said of a video that showed him lauding Paul D. Ryan for wanting to cut Social Security. 'This is a doctored tape. And I think it's beneath [Sanders]. And I'm looking for his campaign to come forward and disown it. But they haven't done it yet.'
The video did not appear to have been 'doctored' "" which Biden twice claimed "" but it had taken his comments out of context. Biden's campaign has said that he was mocking, not lauding, Ryan's position. 
Still, there are other videos of Biden that show him expressing an openness to considering changes to entitlement programs. 
When Biden was asked during his 2008 presidential campaign whether he would consider changing the cost-of-living increases or the age of eligibility for Medicare and Social Security, he said 'absolutely.'
'You have to,' he said on NBC News's Meet the Press. 'It's "" one of the things that my, you know, the political advisers say to me is, 'Whoa, don't touch that third [rail]' "" look, the American people aren't stupid. It's a real simple proposition. . . . You've got to put all of it on the table.'
Sanders on Sunday acknowledged that the video one of his aides promoted should have shown fuller context of Biden's remarks, but he insisted Biden's record deserves to be scrutinized.
'I think anyone who looks at the vice president's record understands that time after time after time, Joe has talked about the need to cut Social Security,' Sanders said in response to a question from The Washington Post as he left a radio interview in New Hampshire. 'I don't think that that is disputable.'
Asked to respond, Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates called Biden 'a champion of Social Security' and pointed to legislative scorecards when Biden was a senator from Delaware. One group, the Alliance for Retired Americans, listed him as having a 96 percent lifetime score for issues that impact retirees in 2008, his last year as a senator.

Warren has been more subtle, not mentioning her campaign rivals directly. But over the weekend, she also emphasized her proposal to increase Social Security payments.
Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) have generally avoided squabbles even amid the escalating intensity among the other candidates. 
'Now's the time for a closing argument,' Buttigieg told reporters over the weekend in Harlan, Iowa. 'Mine is going to be about not why I think I have the best policy, but why I'll be the right nominee to take on and defeat Donald Trump "" and why I've focused on bringing together not just our party, but our country when the time comes.'
The growing friction played out as the leading candidates descended on South Carolina for church services and speeches that will be delivered on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, part of a frenetic battle for the support of black voters.
Buttigieg spent Saturday scrambling to place the King holiday event on his schedule, and he faced some blunt criticism about why it wasn't on his calendar in the first place. 
Nina Turner, a national co-chair of the Sanders campaign, has tried to poke holes in the argument that Biden is the best option for African Americans. 
In an op-ed in the State newspaper in Columbia, Turner, who is black, excoriated Biden's legislative record, saying he'd buddied up to segregationist senators, worked with right-wing Republicans to pass legislation detrimental to black communities and spread the black-woman-welfare-queen stereotype. 
'Will our community side with former vice president Joe Biden, who has repeatedly betrayed black voters to side with Republican lawmakers and undermine our progress?' Turner wrote. 'Or will we stand with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and a movement that has been fighting for racial and economic justice since the civil rights era?' 
The op-ed sparked a backlash both from Biden supporters and from those who worry that intraparty stone-throwing gives Trump an easier path to reelection. 
Bernice Scott, the influential former councilwoman from Richland County, S.C., who originally endorsed Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and then, after Harris's departure, Biden, defended the former vice president in her own editorial in the State. It was headlined 'African Americans trust and support Joe Biden "" and Bernie Sanders' dirty tactics won't change that.' 
'I'm disappointed to see that Sen. Bernie Sanders and his campaign have taken their eyes off the ball,' Scott wrote. 'Instead of taking the fight to President Donald Trump, they have turned to tearing down their own.'

As Joe Biden racked up a string of unexpected victories in Super Tuesday primaries, he began to stitch together the kind of political coalition that had eluded his candidacy for months: a broad assembly of voters with the collective power to potentially defeat President Trump in November.
Biden's strong showing among African Americans, suburbanites and moderate white voters - spanning geographical regions and drawing from a surge in turnout - boosted confidence among Democrats that the former vice president could soon win a Democratic race that voters have turned into a contest over which candidate is best positioned to beat Trump.
Biden, who won primaries in Texas, Virginia and eight other states Tuesday, alluded to his burgeoning coalition during his victory speech Tuesday night in Los Angeles.
""Our campaign reflects the diversity of this party and this nation, and that's how it should be,"" he told supporters. ""Because we need to bring everybody along, everybody. We want a nominee who will beat Donald Trump, but also keep Nancy Pelosi the speaker of the House, and win back the United States Senate.""
His surprise overnight elevation to delegate leader pleased moderate Democrats and unnerved some Republicans who had expected Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to come out in front after 14 states voted on Super Tuesday.
The results also harked back to the 2018 midterm elections, in which Democrats won back the House and prevailed in several competitive gubernatorial races by capitalizing on disdain for Trump among moderate and suburban voters, combined with high turnout among members of the Democratic base.
Rep. Joe Cunningham (D-S.C.), who flipped a Republican congressional seat in 2018, said Biden's string of victories was reminiscent of his win in a district containing the suburbs of Charleston.
""A lot of folks who came out and supported us are the same ones who came out and supported him,"" said Cunningham, who endorsed Biden.
In a campaign where electability has been a major theme, Biden has taken to calling himself an ""Obama-Biden"" Democrat and pledging to rebuild the kind of diverse electorate that helped former president Barack Obama secure two terms.
But with Sanders capitalizing on energetic crowds and support from many young voters, Obama's coalition has not fully rallied behind Biden, said Amy Walter, national editor of the Cook Political Report. While Biden has trailed Sanders among young people and Hispanic voters, he has quickly put together an emerging coalition that capitalizes on the strong anti-Trump sentiment among black voters and suburban women, she said.
""Every campaign should have its own coalition that is organic for the candidate and is the right coalition for the moment,"" Walter said. ""These suburban voters who in years past would split their votes more evenly between Democrats and Republicans are now coming out overwhelmingly against Trump.""
Virginia, where voters showed up in record numbers for Tuesday's primary, is a case in point.

Roughly 1.3 million Virginia voters cast ballots, about 21 percent of the electorate, according to unofficial results. That's up from the previous record of about 986,000 votes and 18 percent of the electorate in 2008, when Obama was challenging Hillary Clinton for the party's nomination.
""The interest . . . in defeating Donald Trump is so intense that it's almost unprecedented,"" Richmond political scientist Bob Holsworth said.
Biden was the beneficiary of the Virginia groundswell, easily beating Sanders and three other candidates.
""It's just extraordinary. In the commonwealth of Virginia, folks are fired up. They want to beat Trump,"" former governor Terry McAuliffe (D) said in an interview. He pointed to massive jumps in turnout in the once-purple D.C. suburbs, which he said reflected ""the intensity of the anti-Trump feeling in Northern Virginia.""
Cities with large African American populations also registered strong gains, with black voters accounting for a quarter of all ballots cast.
Biden also prevailed in Minnesota, Massachusetts and across the South, building on a swift-moving series of events in which two of his main moderate challengers dropped out of the race and endorsed him before Tuesday.
The endorsements by former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, combined with Biden's resounding win Saturday in South Carolina, had an impact. Voters who decided late heavily backed Biden, according to exit poll results.
While Biden came away from Tuesday's primaries with the most delegates, the contests revealed some of the challenges he faces as he tries to secure the nomination and pull together a fractured party.
He was trailing Sanders in the country's most populous state, California, as votes were still being counted, and he continues to lag with Hispanics and younger voters. It's also not clear how Biden would win over the liberal wing of the party, which has supported Sanders's agenda advocating more sweeping changes.
But Biden's victories also brought into sharper relief Sanders's failure to deliver on his pledge to drive a surge in turnout among young people and disaffected voters he contended would power his campaign to a revolution-style victory.
Sanders on Tuesday acknowledged he was disappointed in the turnout figures.
""I will be honest with you, we have not done as well in bringing young people into the political process,"" he told reporters in Burlington, Vt. ""It is not easy.""

According to exit polls, about 13 percent of voters in Super Tuesday states were 18-to-29-year-olds, compared with 3 in 10 who were 65 or older.
Republicans were quick to point out that Biden entered the race last year as a presumed leader, only to falter because of uneven performances on the campaign trail and lackluster fundraising.
""Just a few days ago, Democrats had left Joe Biden for dead because they realized he was a terrible candidate. Nothing has changed,"" said Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh. ""He's still a terrible candidate, and we still don't know if he'll be President Trump's opponent.""
Trump and his campaign have sought to interfere with the Democrats' primaries, openly pushing for a protracted fight between the party's liberal and moderate wings that could last through the nominating convention in July.
Sanders said Tuesday that he planned to move forward with his campaign and attacked Biden as a member of the ""establishment"" who has voted for bad trade deals.
A drawn-out Democratic battle over delegates and party rules would allow Trump to continue his attempts to build his coalition ahead of the general election. Trump, who spoke to the Latino Coalition Legislative Summit on Wednesday, has been making a public appeal to minority voters to back his campaign.
Some younger Latino voters, who have backed Sanders overwhelmingly, distrust Biden because of the high number of deportations that took place during the Obama administration, said Stephen Nuño-Perez of Latino Decisions, a nonpartisan polling firm that focuses on Latino political and social attitudes and that has done work for Democratic organizations.
Exit polling suggested that Biden won the votes of roughly 70 percent of black voters in Virginia and Alabama and did nearly as well in North Carolina and Texas, getting roughly 60 percent of the vote. Biden also won in Tennessee, Oklahoma and Arkansas.
Darren Peters, who worked on the presidential campaigns of Bill and Hillary Clinton, said Biden's strong showing with black voters in Southern states could help him if he becomes the party's nominee.
""It shows an ability to galvanize the kinds of constituencies that are going to be needed to win in a general election,"" Peters said, highlighting the importance of the black vote in key swing states like Pennsylvania and Michigan.
While some Democrats have wondered if Biden, a familiar face with a long track record, would lose in the same way as Hillary Clinton, Biden drew broader support in North Carolina and Virginia than Clinton did in 2016. Clinton won 86 percent of Virginia precincts and 65 percent of North Carolina precincts in 2016. Biden won 93 percent of precincts in both states.
Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who ended his presidential bid last year, said Trump should be nervous about Biden's ability to ""connect with the Whole Foods moms and the suburban women"" who may have voted Republican in the past but have been turned off by the president's divisiveness.
""I think there's a silent majority of people who want Donald Trump out of office,"" Ryan said. ""They don't want to have heated discussions with people about it. They don't want to get in fights with people about it. They don't want to be on social media about it, but they're appalled at his behavior.""

Insider influence, fear of backlash shaped company action on misinformation
Facebook created 'Project P' "" for propaganda "" in the hectic weeks after the 2016 presidential election and quickly found dozens of pages that had peddled false news reports ahead of Donald Trump's surprise victory. Nearly all were based overseas, had financial motives and displayed a clear rightward bent.
In a world of perfect neutrality, which Facebook espouses as its goal, the political tilt of the pages shouldn't have mattered. But in a videoconference between Facebook's Washington office and its Silicon Valley headquarters in December 2016, the company's most senior Republican, Joel Kaplan, voiced concerns that would become familiar to those within the company.
'We can't remove all of it because it will disproportionately affect conservatives,' said Kaplan, a former George W. Bush White House official and now the head of Facebook's Washington office, according to people familiar with the meeting who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect professional relationships.
When another Facebook staff member pushed for the entire list to be taken down on the grounds that the accounts fueled the 'fake news' that had roiled the election, Kaplan warned of the backlash from conservatives.
'They don't believe it to be fake news,' he said, arguing for time to develop guidelines that could be defended to the company's critics, including on the right.
The debate over 'Project P,' which resulted in a few of the worst pages quickly being removed while most others remained on the platform, exemplified the political dynamics that have reigned within Facebook since Trump emerged as the Republican Party's presumptive nominee to the White House in 2016. A company led mainly by Democrats in the liberal bastion of Northern California repeatedly has tilted rightward to deliver policies, hiring decisions and public gestures sought by Republicans, according to current and former employees and others who have worked closely with the company.
Trump and other party leaders have pressured Facebook by making unproven claims of bias against conservatives amid rising signs of government action on the issue, including investigations by Congress and the Justice Department. Republicans also have leveraged Facebook's fears of alienating conservative Americans to win concessions from a company whose most widely shared news content typically includes stories from Fox News and other right-leaning sources.
These sensitivities "" in conjunction with the company's long-standing resistance to acting as 'an arbiter of truth' "" have affected Facebook's responses to a range of major issues, from how to address fake news and Russian manipulation of American voters on the platform to, more recently, the advertising policies that have set the political ground rules for the 2020 election, say people privy to internal debates.
Such factors have helped shape a platform that gives politicians license to lie and that remains awash in misinformation, vulnerable to a repeat of many of the problems that marred the 2016 presidential election.
Facebook, unlike Google and Twitter, also has refused calls to restrict politicians' access to powerful ad-targeting tools "" which Trump used with particular relish four years ago "" that allow messages to be tailored to individual voters, based on characteristics Facebook has gleaned over years of tracking user behavior.
'I think Facebook is looking at their political advertising policies in explicitly partisan terms, and they're afraid of angering Republicans,' said Alex Stamos, head of the Stanford Internet Observatory, a research group, and a former Facebook chief security officer. 'The Republicans in the D.C. office see themselves as a bulwark against the liberals in California.' 
The company says its decisions are guided not by political calculations but by global policy goals of expanding connections among users and protecting them from government overreach, in line with chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's commitment to allowing speech on the social media platform to remain as unrestricted as possible.
'After 2016, we made massive investments in new teams and technology to make our products safer and to secure elections,' said company spokesman Andy Stone. 'People on both sides of the aisle continue to criticize us, but we remain committed to seeking outside perspectives and building a platform for all ideas.' 
Kaplan declined to comment for this article.
But critics "" both outside Facebook and within its ranks "" see something more akin to corporate realpolitik, a willingness to accede to political demands in an era when Republicans control most levers of power in Washington.
'Facebook does not speak Republican,' said a former employee of Facebook's Integrity Team, which was created to ensure safety and trust on the platform, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak freely about a former employer. 'This is what they know about Republicans: Tell them 'yes' or they will hurt us.' 
In the 16 years since its birth as a website to connect students at Harvard, Facebook has emerged as perhaps the world's most far-reaching source of news and information, especially since it added the potent subsidiaries Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, creating a stable of globe-spanning communication tools with billions of users. Facebook's technology played a role in fomenting democratic revolutions across the Arab world and helping to rally domestic political movements such as Black Lives Matter. But the platform also was used to help fuel a genocide in Myanmar, a U.N. report concluded, and has been used to live-stream violence, including video of a massacre at a New Zealand mosque.
Facebook's power is coveted by American politicians, who know that the vast majority of U.S. voters have accounts. Trump already has spent more than $32 million on the platform for his reelection effort, while Democratic candidates, collectively, have spent more than $107 million, according to Facebook's Ad Library, one of its transparency initiatives. Andrew Bosworth, a top corporate executive considered a confidant of Zuckerberg, said in a post in December that Facebook was 'responsible for Donald Trump getting elected' in 2016 through his effective advertising campaign "" a comment that underscored the stakes of the company's policy moves.
Facebook's quest to quell conservative criticism has infused a range of decisions in recent years, say people familiar with the company's internal debates. These included whether to allow graphic images of premature babies on feeding tubes "" a prohibition that had rankled antiabortion groups "" or to include the sharply conservative Breitbart News in a list of news sources despite its history of serving, in the words of its former executive chairman Stephen K. Bannon, as the 'platform for the alt-right.' 
Breitbart spokeswoman Elizabeth Moore, citing the popularity of the news site and what she called a strong track record of accuracy, said, 'It would be an insane oversight to disenfranchise our massive audience that uses Facebook and craves our news content.' 
But its inclusion has sparked criticism among those who say the move was mainly to address Republican complaints about the company.
'I don't think they do this as a conservative company. I think they do this as a scared company,' said Jeff Jarvis, a journalism professor at the City University of New York who has worked with Facebook on several media projects.
The price has been high in terms of anger from Democrats, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), who has promised to lead efforts to break up Facebook should she win the presidency. Liberal financier George Soros, writing recently in the New York Times, called for stripping control of Facebook from Zuckerberg and accused the company of having 'an informal mutual assistance operation' with Trump.
Yet by at least one metric, Facebook's moves have succeeded "" in appeasing a disruptive, unpredictable president. Just last month in Davos, Switzerland, Trump said of Zuckerberg on CNBC, 'He's done a hell of a job.'
Power shift in Washington
Soon after Facebook's meeting on Project P, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski came to Facebook's Washington headquarters offering to advise the company on how to handle the new White House, according to people familiar with the meeting, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive internal matters.
The shifting power in Washington was a serious issue for the company. Its employees had donated just $5,171 to Trump, compared with $1.1 million to fundraising committees affiliated with Democrat Hillary Clinton, with nearly half that amount coming from two of Zuckerberg's closest confidantes, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg and then-Chief Product Officer Chris Cox, according to the political analytics firm GovPredict.
But the meeting with Lewandowski sparked outrage within an office still reeling from the election. Particularly upset were several Democrats, including the director of U.S. public policy, Catlin O'Neill, a former chief of staff to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and the granddaughter of a legendary Pelosi predecessor, Thomas P. 'Tip' O'Neill (D-Mass.), said people familiar with the visit and its aftermath.
Facebook decided not to retain Lewandowski, who declined to comment on the details of the visit aside from saying by text, 'Please be sure to include the facts that I have never worked for them or been paid by them "" they solicited me for a meeting and I attended.' 
But the encounter left many within the company uneasy about what Trump and his allies might do "" or perhaps worse, what he might tweet.
The company gradually implemented policies to combat false, misleading news reports through new transparency initiatives and a system of third-party fact-checkers, a move that upset some Republicans. It also adopted its first policy against 'coordinated inauthentic behavior' "" essentially using bots, fake accounts or other amplification tactics to manipulate the platform, as Russians and others had in 2016 "" and bolstered its security team to police violations.
Complaints eventually grew, however, that conservatives were being unfairly targeted by these moves and by long-standing content policies, such as the prohibition against hate speech. Moves to ban conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and right-wing media star Milo Yiannopoulos in 2019 for being 'dangerous,' for example, generated allegations of censorship by 'Big Tech' among more mainstream conservatives.
As these and other complaints against Facebook grew among Republicans, Trump often amplified them over rival social media platform Twitter, where his following tops 72 million users.
'Facebook was always anti-Trump,' he tweeted on Sept. 27, 2017, amid the scandal over Russian efforts to use social media to help elect him. The following month, he added, 'Crooked Hillary Clinton spent hundreds of millions of dollars more on Presidential Election than I did. Facebook was on her side, not mine!'
Trump leveled similar charges against other technology companies, as he did in December 2018: 'Facebook, Twitter and Google are so biased toward the Dems it is ridiculous!' But, often, Facebook bore the brunt of the president's wrath, as it did after a pair of pro-Trump social media personalities, Diamond and Silk, accused the company of censoring them after they received a warning about posting 'unsafe' content. (The company later said it had acted in error.)
'The wonderful Diamond and Silk have been treated so horribly by Facebook. They work so hard and what has been done to them is very sad - and we're looking into' it, Trump tweeted in May 2019. 'It's getting worse and worse for Conservatives on social media!'
Rising internal GOP clout
The role of helping the company maneuver through this treacherous new political landscape became a core responsibility for Kaplan, Facebook's vice president for global public policy, who had joined the company in 2011, after eight years in the Bush White House and a stint as an energy lobbyist.
The former Marine Corps officer had clerked for Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and, despite supporting former Florida governor Jeb Bush and Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) for president, met with Trump in December 2016 after the White House expressed interest in having him head the Office of Management and Budget. Kaplan later played a key role in organizing support for Trump Supreme Court pick Brett M. Kavanaugh, a longtime Kaplan friend.
As Trump came to office, Kaplan was a Republican in a company increasingly self-conscious about its oversupply of Democrats in its top ranks. This included Sandberg, who had worked in the Clinton administration and hired numerous friends and former colleagues into Facebook "" creating a class of internal allies known informally as 'FOSS,' for Friends of Sheryl Sandberg.
Kaplan, who had dated Sandberg when they were students at Harvard, managed to be both a FOSS and one of the only Republicans in the room when major decisions got made. The combination lent him credibility when he warned, as he often did, that a looming decision might inflame perilous relations with conservatives.
The rising clout among Facebook's Republicans went beyond Kaplan. Katie Harbath, a onetime campaign aide to former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, gained increased prominence. Kaplan also dispensed with the tradition of having members of both major parties share power atop the Washington office by hiring a fellow Republican, former Federal Communications Commission chairman Kevin Martin, as his deputy "" strengthening the conservative cast of the office at its highest levels.
Kaplan proved to be adept at assuaging conservative concerns about Facebook. Even before Trump won the presidency, the company faced a crisis in May 2016 when tech publication Gizmodo published a story asserting that contractors managing Facebook's 'Trending' module were suppressing conservative stories.
Kaplan tapped a small team of Republicans, including Harbath, to organize a visit for prominent conservatives, such as political commentators Glenn Beck and Tucker Carlson, to Facebook headquarters. The meeting with Zuckerberg and Sandberg calmed the controversy "" at least for a time "" but conservatives soon would come back with other complaints.
'It's the squeaky wheels who get the grease,' said another person familiar with the company's effort to mollify conservatives, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 'They were the squeaky wheels.'
As for the 'Trending' topics feature, Facebook fired the contractors described in the Gizmodo story and gave the job for determining 'Trending' topics to an algorithm. That allowed the feature to become a vehicle for spreading the false news reports that marred Facebook in the months leading up to the election. One recommended story claimed "" falsely "" that Fox News host Megyn Kelly had been fired for supporting Clinton.
Russia campaign and fallout
Security researchers at Facebook found the first signs that Russians were seeking to influence the U.S. election months before the 2016 vote, discovering accounts apparently under control of foreign military hackers.
Those initial discoveries, although shared with the FBI, were not made public. But when U.S. intelligence officials announced in January 2017 that they, too, had detected Russian interference on social media, an internal debate developed within Facebook about what to reveal publicly and when.
The result, after three months of wrangling, was a 13-page white paper in April that did not include the words 'Russia' or 'Russian.' Instead, there was this oblique reference: 'Our data does not contradict the attribution provided by the U.S. Director of National Intelligence in the report dated January 6, 2017.'
Several issues were at play in these debates, including whether Facebook's researchers had enough clear evidence to name Russia definitively, and company officials pushed to make sure the white paper was rigorous enough to be defended in the face of the expected Republican backlash. But some company employees found the resulting document incomplete, and the caution of company officials fueled complaints that they were acting in part to avoid inflaming tensions with a White House consumed with battling allegations that Russia had helped elect Trump.
'If we say Russia, it will center us in this discussion and anger the administration,' a person familiar with the political dynamics in Face book's Washington office recalled hearing.
Stone, the Facebook spokesman, said, 'The goal of the white paper was to share our findings in a straightforward manner, which is why there was broad agreement with the security team's recommendation to refer to the Intelligence Community Assessment and not name any specific nations.'
The worry about political fallout grew in subsequent months as Facebook's security researchers discovered that the Internet Research Agency, whose owner was a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, had used 470 fake accounts and pages to manipulate U.S. voters. When Facebook revealed this Russian interference in September 2017, the fears of angering the White House proved prescient.
Trump soon began tweeting about the company, and conservatives in Congress used the resulting hearings to accuse Facebook of bias against conservative voices on the platform. Such complaints grew the following year, when the Cambridge Analytica scandal broke regarding the use of sensitive Facebook data to direct campaign messaging.
Zuckerberg's visit to Capitol Hill in April 2018 to address the Cambridge Analytica scandal featured frequent allegations of bias. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) cited Facebook's warning to Diamond and Silk as exemplifying 'a pervasive pattern of political bias.' In a House hearing the next day, Rep. Billy Long (R-Mo.) asked Zuckerberg, 'What is 'unsafe' about two black women supporting Donald J. Trump?'
While Zuckerberg attributed the incident to 'an enforcement error,' the next month the company announced it would conduct an audit of allegations of bias against conservatives at Facebook. Leading this inquiry was not an independent social media researcher but a prominent conservative lawyer, former senator Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.).
The resulting interim report, completed in August, catalogued numerous complaints by conservatives but offered no concrete evidence of bias or any systematic, data-based review of the question. Still, it offered two concessions: Facebook would hire more staff 'dedicated to working with right-of-center organizations and leaders.' And the company would loosen a long-standing advertising policy against graphic medical photos; the result was to allow antiabortion groups to depict premature babies reliant on feeding and other medical tubes in political messaging.
The audit and its concessions pleased many conservatives but rankled some on the other side of the political spectrum, who had begun to sense that, in their dealings with Facebook, they were on a losing streak to an organized, forceful and consistent campaign of pressure by conservatives. Civil rights leaders, for example, had been asking for an audit of racism on the platform for several years. It finally got announced the same day, in May 2018, as the conservative bias audit.
'We've been in conversation with them, in some iteration, for four years, without much success,' said Malkia Devich Cyril, a senior fellow for the activist group MediaJustice who was part of a Black Lives Matter delegation that visited Facebook in 2016. 'As individuals they might have liberal or progressive leanings, but as a company their interests are being served by conservative economic policy.' 
Fact checks and ad tools
The political stakes for Facebook became increasingly clear last summer. A major corporate initiative, a cryptocurrency called Libra, landed in Washington with a discernible thud.
'Facebook Libra's 'virtual currency' will have little standing or dependability,' Trump tweeted in July, making clear his intention to impose federal regulations on such an initiative. 'We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever, both dependable and reliable. It is by far the most dominant currency anywhere in the World, and it will always stay that way. It is called the United States Dollar!'
About the same time, the Justice Department began a broad antitrust review of major technology companies, including Facebook.
Zuckerberg "" who had lashed out at Warren over her calls to break up Facebook, telling employees in a July meeting that he would 'go to the mat and . . . fight' any such effort "" took a more conciliatory tone with Trump.
As talk of federal investigations grew in September, Zuckerberg visited the White House. Trump tweeted, 'Nice meeting with Mark Zuckerberg of @Facebook in the Oval Office today.' Included was a picture of the young tech billionaire shaking hands with the president.
Zuckerberg also hosted a group of conservatives at his home in Palo Alto, Calif., in June. One participant, longtime anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, praised the company for hiring staff specifically to work with conservatives.
'There has been what seems to be a serious effort to reach out to us,' said Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform.
Two important victories for Trump and conservatives came amid this outreach by Zuckerberg.
The first was when Nick Clegg, Facebook's vice president for global affairs and communications, announced in September that the company's system of third-party fact-checkers would not review claims by politicians. Although Facebook said this was merely the ratification of existing practice, the announcement provoked fury among Democrats weary from thousands of well-chronicled falsehoods, embellishments and misstatements by Trump and worried that he would exploit the loophole in the coming campaign season.
An immediate test further underscored these fears: A Trump campaign ad made claims against former vice president Joe Biden, at the time leading in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination, that independent fact-checkers called dubious. Biden's campaign demanded the ad be removed, but Facebook refused, reiterating it would not act against false statements from politicians.
Those defending the decision, inside and outside the company, pointed to the traditional leeway given to political speech in the United States and to Zuckerberg's own reluctance to curb user expression in all but the most extreme circumstances.
He said in a speech at Georgetown University in October that restricting political speech threatens 'the ability to speak freely [that] has been central in the fight for democracy worldwide.'
But critics saw yet another effort by Facebook to steer clear of Republican wrath.
'Right now Trump is president, and the company is obviously very attuned to the political winds,' said Vanita Gupta, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, a Washington-based umbrella group. 'They all know [at Facebook] that the Justice Department and state attorneys general are sniffing around at regulations and litigation.' 
The second victory for conservatives came soon after, when Face book rebuffed calls to limit the ability of politicians to use advertising tools that allow the narrow targeting of individuals based on their home address, gender, education level, income, marital status, job or other characteristics. Brad Parscale, a digital adviser to Trump's 2016 campaign and now campaign manager for the reelection effort, had boasted of the power of these targeting tools and made clear his eagerness to use them again.
Some Democratic political operatives and the Democratic National Committee also expressed concern to Facebook about losing access to such cheap, effective means for reaching voters. But other prominent Democrats, as well as politically independent technology researchers, warned that what they called 'microtargeting' could threaten the sanctity of elections by undermining the accountability and transparency of political speech.
These critics warned that voters had no way to know what messages reached their friends or neighbors, giving politicians license to tailor messages based on what people wanted to hear rather than what was best for the public overall. A lie delivered to just 100 carefully targeted people on Facebook, for example, was much less likely to be caught and corrected than one delivered on a billboard or in a television ad.
Ellen L. Weintraub, a Democrat who then was chair of the Federal Election Commission, warned in a Washington Post opinion piece that such targeting had a history as 'a potent weapon for spreading disinformation and sowing discord.'
For these reasons, Google prohibited politicians from using its most powerful targeting tools. Twitter decided to ban political ads altogether. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) urged Facebook to follow the lead of these other companies 'rather than continuing to chase political advertising dollars.'
Facebook seriously considered such a move during a months-long internal debate that weighed several types of restrictions, including possibly banning political ads altogether, company officials said, pointing out that such advertising produces a very small percentage of its multibillion-dollar revenue streams while generating a disproportionate amount of headaches.
But when news leaked that Face book was considering such changes, Trump made clear his-opposition. His campaign tweeted, amid red siren emoji, 'IMPORTANT @facebook wants to take important tools away from us for 2020. Tools that help us reach more great Americans - lift voices the media - big tech choose to ignore!'
Facebook ultimately announced in January that it would increase the transparency of ad targeting ahead of the 2020 election but impose no new limits for politicians.
In a blog post, Rob Leathern, Facebook's director of product management, made clear that the company had heard the political clamor on the issue.
'Unlike Google, we have chosen not to limit targeting of these ads,' Leathern wrote. 'We considered doing so, but through extensive outreach and consultations we heard about the importance of these tools for reaching key audiences from a wide range of NGOs, non-profits, political groups and campaigns, including both Republican and Democratic committees in the US.'

COLUMBIA, S.C. "" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) took hip-hop artist and activist Benny Starr to Bertha's Kitchen, a black-owned restaurant in North Charleston, where she ate collard greens and cornbread but passed on the fried chicken and sweet tea. 
Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg has pummeled the airwaves in South Carolina, Nevada and Super Tuesday states with ads, so much so that a questioner at a Tennessee news conference thanked him for a $3.5 million buy at his media station before proceeding. 
Former vice president Joe Biden rushed to South Carolina the night of last week's New Hampshire primary, abandoning a state that would disappoint him with a fifth-place finish in favor of one flush with the nonwhite voters on whom he has staked his candidacy. He has since spent four days in Nevada.
'You can't be the Democratic nominee,' Biden said in Columbia that night, 'unless you have overwhelming support from black and brown voters.' 
After two contests in states with overwhelmingly white electorates, the Democratic presidential primaries are rushing into a broader and more diverse landscape where Latino and African American voters play a potentially decisive role "" and are up for grabs.
Just as more voters of color are poised to assert their say in the primary, the battle for their support is growing more competitive. Biden, who has been both popular among Latinos and the longtime polling leader among black voters, enters this phase as a weakened candidate.
His chief rivals "" who like him are white "" all boast spotty records on race or have demonstrated other weaknesses that pose steep challenges as they seek to appeal to a powerful and skeptical electorate.
Nonwhite voters have been left to evaluate past actions and future promises as the candidates try to ingratiate themselves by tweaking applause lines, translating campaign themes into Spanish, and filling the airwaves with images of themselves working alongside the first black president. 
'You're now seeing voters of color, who are the backbone of the Democratic Party, particularly black women, flex their electoral muscle,' said Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina state legislator and influential Democrat in the state. 'My mom and her friends will decide who the nominee is and who goes toe to toe against Donald Trump.'

A third of voters in Nevada, whose caucuses conclude Saturday, are Latino or black. In South Carolina, which votes on Feb. 29, nearly two-thirds of expected Democratic voters are black. Most Democratic voters in the 2016 Texas and Alabama presidential primaries were nonwhite, according to exit polls, as were more than a third of the voters in Arkansas, Tennessee, Virginia and North Carolina. All of those states, along with heavily minority California, will vote on Super Tuesday, March 3. 
'This is the season where the candidates will now face the Democratic Party. By that I mean the diversity that is the strength of the party,' said Donna Brazile, a longtime strategist who served as interim Democratic Party chair during the 2016 election. 
Biden's unsteady turn "" a fourth-place finish in Iowa preceded his decline in New Hampshire "" has given an opening to rivals to make their own arguments to black and Latino voters. Bloomberg and another billionaire candidate, Tom Steyer, already have made inroads among black voters, polls have suggested. 
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) successfully attracted young Latino and African American voters in Iowa and New Hampshire, and has risen in polls among nonwhite voters in other states as well. But he has had difficulty attracting older nonwhite voters, who are more reliable at casting ballots.
In Nevada, he has begun advertising in Spanish-language ads; in South Carolina he has leaned on endorsements from young, black members of the legislature. His national surrogates, including former Ohio state senator Nina Turner and Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King, routinely tout Sanders's record of involvement in the civil rights struggle going back to the 1960s.
Warren has, like Sanders, been working to build support among nonwhite voters for months, albeit with fewer financial resources. On Monday, her campaign launched a new outreach effort entitled Latinas en la Lucha "" 'Latinas in the Fight.' She has also worked to create kinship with black women, although the efforts have so far fallen largely flat, according to polls.
'The electability factor that the Bidens have used in their campaign has been seriously moved to the column of uncertainty because of Iowa and New Hampshire,' said Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights leader and MSNBC host. 'It leaves the black vote wide open. At the same time, it's a question of who can penetrate that. It's a different terrain.'

Biden also has been hit by rivals for his past support of crime bills whose stiffer sentences impacted nonwhite communities and for having touted how he worked as a senator with colleagues who were segregationists. In response, he has leaned on his long relationships with African Americans and Latinos, and his service as Barack Obama's vice president.
'Too often, your loyalty, your support, your commitment to this party have been taken for granted,' Biden said last week in Columbia. 'I have never once in my career, since I got involved as a kid, taken you for granted. And I give you my word as a Biden, I never, ever, ever will.' 
He spoke of his time as a public defender and a county councilman, when he fought against redlining. 
'And by the way,' he added, 'I had the back of a great president, Barack Obama, for eight years.' 
Rosemary Lawrence, a 75-year-old black woman who leads the political ministry at Charlotte's mostly black Friendship Missionary Baptist Church, represents Biden's biggest worry. She supported Biden when he entered the race in April, laying out the argument for anyone who asked that he was the candidate most likely to defeat Trump. But not anymore.
'I love Joe Biden,' she said. 'I really love him. Because he was so supportive and so helpful to [Obama]. They did great things together. Especially health care. And you know, I really wanted to support him, but what I've seen recently is he doesn't seem to be as energized and focused and alert as he was, say, eight years ago even.
'And now his funding is drying up. The bottom line is I want to find somebody who can beat Donald Trump.' 
Early voting has already started in North Carolina. Next week, Lawrence plans to cast a ballot for Bloomberg. 
Bloomberg, however, has his own problems. As New York mayor, he pushed a stop-and-frisk program that aggressively targeted nonwhite men for police searches, which he defended until issuing an apology days before entering the presidential race. He has also come under fire for other comments critical of young black men and others.
His Democratic rivals have accelerated their criticism of him as he prepares to be on ballots for the first time in the Super Tuesday contests.
'When you peel back the layers of Bloomberg, it's devastating,' Sellers said. 'You look at the utterly disgusting way he spoke about black men after stop-and-frisk, his policies. He's not a racist but he implemented racist policies.' 
Bloomberg's strategy so far has been to overwhelm other candidates with paid advertising, including in South Carolina via stations at historically black colleges and universities. While his crowds, even in southern states, are often affluent and white, he is regularly introduced by black leaders who testify to Bloomberg's understanding of the history of racism in the country and his commitment to nonwhite voters.
Bloomberg has been endorsed by more than 100 mayors, many of them black. He has proposed a plan, named 'the Greenwood Initiative' for a black Tulsa community destroyed in a 1921 racial massacre, that sets a goal of helping 1 million black families buy a home, double the number of black-owned businesses and triple the net worth of a typical black family. 
'I am committed to using the power of the presidency to right the wrongs of institutional racism,' Bloomberg told a mostly black crowd last week in Houston, decorated with a sign announcing a new branding effort, 'Mike for Black America.' 
Steyer has dotted the Palmetto State's freeways with billboards and spent generously on television ads. Jonathan Metcalf, the South Carolina state director for Steyer's campaign, said Steyer has ascended in state polls not just due to those tactics but because he has invested in campaign infrastructure and in the communities he hopes will turn out to vote for him. 

'Ninety-three percent of our organizers are African Americans. Most are females. Sixty percent of those are organizing within 20 miles of where they grew up,' Metcalf said. 
In some ways, Steyer's success in South Carolina is proof that another candidate can eat into the lead that Biden has held among black voters since he entered the race. But it would not be easy, or quick: Metcalf said Steyer's campaign has been building its infrastructure in South Carolina since last summer. 
That reality complicates the task for candidates who have surged recently, including former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg and Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.). Each has benefited overall from stronger-than-expected showings in the first states but face both a lack of familiarity and pointed accusations as the contest broadens to highlight nonwhite voters.
As mayor, Buttigieg fired South Bend's first black police chief and has been accused of having only a superficial understanding of the needs of black America "" and the black residents of the city he headed. 
He has argued that nonwhite voters simply don't know enough about him yet. In Nevada, he has built an organizing team that his campaign says mirrors the demographics of the state. Over 40 percent of his team there speaks Spanish, and a third identify as Latinx. 
In one new ad airing in Nevada, Buttigieg looks directly into the camera and begins to speak in Spanish. 'Quiero que imagines el primer dia despues de la presidencia de Donald Trump, ' he says. 'I want you to picture the first day after the Donald Trump presidency.' 
In South Carolina, he, like Bloomberg, has touted plans meant specifically to appeal to African American residents with investments and policy changes.
'I'll be very attentive to the ways in which just the culture and the climate and the tone can help build up a sense of belonging, backed up by all the policies we're going to do,' he said during a recent campaign event at Claflin University, a historically black college in Orangeburg, S.C. 
Klobuchar is only now able financially to try to organize in states beyond Iowa and New Hampshire, putting her at a stiff deficit. Like Buttigieg, she has been hit for past actions, including decisions while a Hennepin County prosecutor not to bring charges against police who killed residents, and for aggressive prosecutions that critics said disproportionately affected nonwhite communities. 
She has campaigned on her efforts to go after white-collar criminals and expand voting rights. Along with Buttigieg, she launched a Spanish-language ad; unlike him, she is not the narrator. 
'Amy will bring back to the White House the respect it deserves, will fight to give us better health care, better prices on our prescription medicines and the best education for our loved ones,' the ad says. 'Amy knows what's important: our well-being.'
Bernice Scott, a former Richland council member who leads the South Carolina grass-roots organizing group known as the 'Reckoning Crew,' warned that ads and endorsements will not be enough. Her group has thrown its support behind Biden. 
'We're not as stupid as people think we are. Throw some money down and say, 'I'm better for you than anyone else.' We know history. It's a history here,' Scott said. 'We aren't just going to change our minds.'

That remains Biden's biggest hope, even if his popularity among nonwhite Democrats appears to have weakened. His campaign has sent 100 paid canvassers to South Carolina and Nevada, where the campaign is 'all in,' said senior campaign adviser Symone Sanders. Biden also has ads running in the top four television markets in the state, reaching 85 percent of South Carolinians. 
'Joe Biden is not new to these communities,' she said, citing the decades he has spent as a candidate and as vice president. 'They know him.'
In Nevada, Biden's campaign had hoped for the endorsement of the mostly Latino Culinary Workers Union, but the group announced last week it would not side with a candidate. In South Carolina, Biden could benefit from the endorsement of his longtime friend, House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn, the state's most powerful Democrat. 
Clyburn "" who has faced countering pressure from his grandson, who works for the Buttigieg campaign "" said last week that he hasn't decided whether he will endorse, or who his nod would go to. 
'I think I might be inclined to make an endorsement,' Clyburn said in an interview. 'I haven't ruled it out.' If he did endorse, he said it would only come in the final days of the race in South Carolina, after the Feb. 25 debate in Charleston.

MODERATE DEMOCRATS UNITE 
Klobuchar, Buttigieg offer their support

A parade of establishment Democrats began coalescing around Joe Biden on Monday, an attempt to bolster the former vice president and stall Sen. Bernie Sanders's ascent as voters in 14 states prepared to cast ballots Tuesday, the most consequential day of the presidential nominating contest. 
On a day with cascading developments that rapidly recast the presidential race, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (Minn.) dropped out and rushed to join Biden at his rally in Dallas on Monday night. In a visual symbol of Biden's attempts to consolidate the moderates in the party, former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg - who dropped out Sunday night and who had an intensely frosty relationship with Klobuchar - also scrambled to get to Texas and endorse Biden. 
""We need a politics that's about decency, a politics that brings back dignity. That's what Joe Biden has been practicing his entire life,"" Buttigieg said at a restaurant in Dallas, ahead of the rally where Klobuchar declared: ""I cannot think of a better way to end my campaign than joining his."" 


Beto O'Rourke, the former Texas congressman who ended his presidential bid in November, joined Biden on stage at the end of the Dallas rally - and concluded a speech by inviting him for dinner at a nearby Whataburger. 
Biden seemed taken aback by the swift change in fortunes. He told Buttigieg that he reminded him of his late son, Beau, the highest compliment he can offer. He told the crowd Klobuchar has a long political future ahead, and he told O'Rourke, whose candidacy was marked by liberal positions on gun control, ""You're going to take care of the gun problem with me. You're going to be the one who leads this effort."" 
It was the second straight day that moderates, previously paralyzed over whom to rally behind, rushed to join Biden's campaign. Harry M. Reid, a former Senate majority leader from Nevada, endorsed Biden along with other Democrats including Susan E. Rice, a former national security adviser to President Barack Obama; political activist and actress Alyssa Milano; Victoria Reggie Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.); and Sen. Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.).
There are still looming questions about Biden - his propensity for gaffes, the moments when he searches for words or, on Monday, his struggle to come up with well-worn phrases in the Declaration of Independence before shouting, ""You know . . . the thing!"" - but his campaign has found unmistakable new momentum that it is hoping to carry into the elections Tuesday.
Not everyone was playing to his benefit, however. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg both pledged Monday to stay in the race.
""I'm in it to win it,"" Bloomberg said. He has poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the primary contest and will appear on ballots for the first time Tuesday.
Warren's current plan is to remain an active candidate all the way to the convention, even if she is not accumulating significant numbers of delegates. She says that will give her some leverage over the party's platform and any other issues that might be at the forefront in Milwaukee. 
She continued her refrain Monday that her operation is built ""for the long haul,"" and she received an endorsement from Emily's List, which works to elect women in politics. 
The super PAC supporting her candidacy is raising money for a big TV ad buy in states like Arizona, Florida, Illinois and Ohio, which vote March 17, according to a person familiar with Persist PAC's operations who was not authorized to openly discuss the group's strategy and spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
Sanders remains perhaps the most formidable force in the race, finishing in the top two in all four early states and holding on to a polling advantage in numerous delegate-rich states that will vote Tuesday. He also has a significant financial edge and a grass-roots army that Biden so far has lacked, and he was defiant Monday in the face of the moderate consolidation.
""Look, we are taking on the establishment. And I fully understand - no great surprise to me - that establishment politicians are not going to endorse us,"" Sanders told reporters in Salt Lake City, just minutes before the news broke that Klobuchar was ending her campaign and planning to support Biden.
""The establishment will rally around the establishment candidate,"" he said. ""That's the simple reality.""
President Trump, who has repeatedly tried to offer sideline commentary about the Democratic contest, tweeted with glee: ""They are staging a coup against Bernie!"" 


What began a year ago as a historically large and diverse Democratic field has quickly narrowed to five remaining contenders. With the two youngest major candidates dropping out, all of the remaining major candidates are septuagenarians. 

In Tuesday's primaries, 1,357 delegates are up for grabs, nearly a third of the total and the most of any single day in the Democratic race. California and Texas are the biggest prizes, but delegate-rich states like Virginia, North Carolina, Massachusetts and Colorado will also vote. 
Top advisers to the campaigns agree that Sanders is poised to win a big delegate haul, and the main question is whether it will set him on an insurmountable course toward the nomination.
""After watching this campaign unfold, after watching 10 debates, there's no way you can rationally believe that Joe Biden is strongest candidate to defeat Donald Trump,"" said Ari Rabin-Havt, a deputy campaign manager for Sanders.
Shortly after Reid announced his endorsement of Biden, Faiz Shakir, who is Sanders's campaign manager but also worked for Reid, wrote on Twitter: ""Disappointing. I'll forever have respect and love for Senator Reid. But I'm old enough to remember when he thought Biden's ideas were worthy of being put in a fireplace.""
Biden is hoping that the momentum from his romping South Carolina win, and the party's efforts to consolidate behind him, will be enough to offset his campaign's continuing deficiencies. He is spending the least on ads, has one of the thinnest organizations and saw his candidacy stall at a time when most other campaigns were banking early votes. 
Biden hopes to win among Southern states that more closely mirror South Carolina, where he won nearly 50 percent of the vote Saturday, in part because of his giant lead among African American voters. 
His campaign has since received a large fundraising boost, with $5 million coming Saturday and at least $5 million Sunday - all told, more in two days than it raised in all of January. 
But the money came too late to make a major advertising splash in the Super Tuesday states, and instead Biden was hoping to be carried by momentum and endorsements. 
""The country is hungry - hungry, hungry, hungry - to be united. Most Americans, they don't want a promise of a revolution, they want a guarantee of results,"" Biden said earlier in the day during a campaign stop in Houston. "". . . We need real results, and we need them now. I've done that my whole career.""
On CBS on Monday morning, Biden said his surge in support occurred in part because candidates down the ballot are wary of running with Sanders as the Democratic standard-bearer.
""I think there's an awful lot of people who are running for office who don't want to run with Bernie at the top of the ticket as a self-proclaimed socialist,"" he said.

The party's donor class also began to rally to Biden's side. 
A handful of key Democratic donors who were raising big checks for Buttigieg or considering publicly endorsing Bloomberg said they were throwing their support to Biden on Monday - and were persuading others to do so, too. 
On Monday, a longtime Obama donor in Northern California who had given to multiple candidates during the primaries sent emails urging party donors waffling between Bloomberg and Biden to coalesce around Biden. And on Wall Street, Buttigieg donors were calling one another to say Biden was the best alternative, barring a Bloomberg upset Tuesday.
One longtime Democratic donor in New York, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private conversations, said there were meetings scheduled with major Wall Street financiers starting Sunday through Wednesday, out of anxiety about Buttigieg's fourth-place finish in South Carolina and concern over his chances on Super Tuesday. 
Klobuchar's early exit means that her home state of Minnesota, which has 75 delegates at stake in its primary, is up for grabs Tuesday. Sanders won the state when it held caucuses in 2016 and had closely trailed Klobuchar in recent polls. He held a rally in Minneapolis on Monday night. 
Klobuchar's decision came after she finished near the bottom in the South Carolina primary Saturday. The senator had briefly surged in some polls after a strong performance at the Feb. 7 Democratic debate in Manchester, N.H. Her campaign had dubbed the boost ""Klomentum"" and hoped it would catapult her into the top tier of candidates through the rest of the early-nominating states.
Klobuchar finished in third place in the New Hampshire primary, but a disappointing sixth place in the Nevada caucuses and in South Carolina. She had planned an aggressive travel schedule in advance of Super Tuesday but dropped out before she could execute it.

His standing improves as fewer Americans report fears regarding economy


President Trump begins his reelection year in a more competitive position than he was in last fall against potential Democratic challengers, aided by rising approval for his handling of the economy, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll. 
The state of the economy and perceptions of Trump's handling of it pose a challenge for Democratic presidential candidates, who have criticized the president's policies and focused their economic messaging on inequities between the richest Americans and everyone else and on alleviating the financial struggles of many families who are dealing with rising health-care, child-care or educational costs. 
Despite Americans' concerns that the economic system favors the wealthy, the latest Post-ABC poll finds that fewer than half are worried about maintaining their own standard of living, a shift from 2016, when most expressed concern about losing their financial footing. 
With just over nine months until Election Day, Americans see Trump as a slight favorite for reelection, with 49-percent expecting him to win and 43-percent predicting that his Democratic challenger will prevail. But those expectations are highly partisan, with 87-percent of Republicans saying they believe Trump will win reelection while a somewhat smaller 78-percent majority of Democrats say they believe their party's nominee will win. 
The national Post-ABC poll tested Trump in six potential general-election matchups and finds that registered voters nationwide are roughly split between supporting the president and backing the Democratic candidates. Neither Trump nor Democrats hold a statistically significant advantage in any matchup. 

Former vice president Joe Biden is currently favored by 50-percent of registered voters, while 46-percent support Trump. Former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg has 49-percent support to Trump's 46-percent, also virtually even given the poll's four-point margin of sampling error among registered voters. 
Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) receives 49-percent to Trump's 47-percent, while Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) stands at 48-percent to Trump's 47-percent. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is tied with Trump at 48-percent. Former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg is at 45-percent to Trump's 48-percent. 
Among the broader population of all voting-age adults rather than just registered voters, most Democrats maintain at least slight advantages over Trump, with Sanders and Bloomberg leading Trump by eight percentage points and Biden leading by seven points. Warren and Klobuchar each hold slighter five-point advantages over Trump, while Buttigieg is roughly even, with 46-percent to Trump's 45-percent. 
The close matchups between Trump and Democrats among registered voters represent a contrast with an October Post-ABC poll in which Biden, Sanders, Warren and Buttigieg all held double-digit advantages over the incumbent. (Bloomberg and Klobuchar were not tested against Trump in that poll.) 
The shift coincides with a rise in Trump's approval rating from 38-percent to 44-percent among the public overall, with 51-percent currently disapproving. Opinion is even more closely divided among registered voters, with 47-percent approving of Trump and 50-percent disapproving, matching the best margin of his presidency. 
Other national polls this month have not consistently found a rise in Trump's approval rating and also show Democratic candidates maintaining an advantage in national support over Trump. But the Post-ABC poll underscores how a modest improvement in Trump's political standing can boost his chances at reelection. 
Throughout his presidency, Trump's poll numbers have generally stayed within a narrow range, with far less variation than seen with his predecessors. When his ratings do move sharply in one direction or another at times, they tend to soon revert closer to the norm.
The improvement in his job approval rating in this poll "" to 44-percent, an increase of six percentage points since fall "" coincides with the Senate impeachment trial, which has further polarized the country. Whether it represents a lasting shift in Trump's favor has obvious political implications, given the stakes in the election year.
Trump's improved standing in the latest survey is in part due to political independents. Trump receives between 47-percent and 52-percent support among voters in this group, depending on his Democratic opponent, an improvement from October, when he got between 39-percent and 42-percent support. Self-identified independents make up 39-percent of the overall sample in the survey, almost identical to last October's poll. Most independents, though, lean toward either one party or the other, and in this month's poll, the mix of independents leaned less Democratic than in October. 

In 2016, exit polls showed that Trump won independents by four percentage points nationally and by seven points or more in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where narrow wins ensured his victory in the electoral college. 
The Post-ABC poll finds that 37-percent of registered voters say they would support Trump against all six Democratic candidates tested in the survey and that they would be 'very enthusiastic' or 'fairly enthusiastic' about doing so. Similarly, 33-percent of voters say they would support any of the six Democrats and are enthusiastic about opposing Trump. 
The remaining 30-percent who are inconsistent in their support or less enthusiastic about their decision represent a loose definition of voters whose allegiance to one side or the other is more tenuous. Some portion of that group is likely to be targeted for persuasion and mobilization efforts by the campaigns of the president and the eventual Democratic nominee. 
Nearly half of these up-for-grabs voters are nonwhite, and 50-percent identify themselves as moderate, both a larger portion than among voters overall. 
The 2020 election promises to continue the country's deep political divisions along gender, racial and educational lines. In a head-to-head matchup, 56-percent of white registered voters support Trump, while 68-percent of nonwhites support Biden. Fifty-eight percent of men support Trump, while 61-percent of women back Biden. Among whites only, 54-percent of college graduates favor Biden, while 64-percent of those without four-year college degrees support Trump. 
Those divisions were roughly similar in matchups between Trump and other Democrats. For instance, 60-percent of men support Trump in a matchup with Warren, while 59-percent of women support Warren in that scenario. 
Another critical question is how much Trump may benefit from an improving national economy. Economic growth has been a strong indicator of presidents' popularity and reelection chances for decades, but Trump's approval rating has been net negative since he entered office and has shown little sustained improvement despite positive perceptions about the economy. 
A newly evident easing of financial concerns and the overall economic climate could represent a key asset for Trump, who has sought to take as much credit as possible for historically low unemployment and the continuing economic recovery, which began in 2009. 
The 56 percent majority of Americans who now say they are not particularly worried or not worried at all about maintaining their standard of living marks a sharp increase from the start of the 2016 election year, when a minority of adults (37 percent) offered an optimistic view of their finances.
The Post-ABC poll also finds that 56 percent approve of Trump's handling of the economy, up 10 percentage points from last fall and the highest rating of his presidency on this issue. The difference of 12 points between Trump's economic approval rating and his overall approval is an indication of how public opinions on other aspects of Trump's performance have been a drag on his popularity. 

Indeed, Americans' more-positive views of the economy and Trump's handling of it may help him only insofar as they boost his overall job approval rating. 
For example, 13-percent of registered voters approve of Trump's handling of the economy but disapprove or have no opinion of his overall job performance. Among that group, 73-percent say they would support Biden while 15-percent would back Trump if the election were today. 
In the 2018 midterm elections, when nearly 7 in 10 voters said the economy was excellent or good, according to network exit polling, Republicans still lost a net of 40 seats in congressional elections, with Democrats gaining control of the House of Representatives. 
The Post-ABC poll was conducted by telephone from Jan. 20 through Jan. 23 among a random national sample of 1,004 adults, 65-percent of whom were reached on cellphones and 35-percent on landlines. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The error margin is four percentage points among the sample of 880 registered voters.

Pro-Trump super PAC
defends message aimed
at African Americans
Former president Barack Obama on Wednesday called on South Carolina television stations to stop running an ad from a super PAC supporting President Trump that uses Obama's words out of context in a misleading attack on former vice president Joe Biden.
The Committee to Defend the President, a pro-Trump group, circulated an ad that falsely suggests that words Obama spoke in the narration of his own 1995 book were meant to describe Biden.
The group, which placed a similar amount of anti-Biden advertising in Nevada earlier this month, reported to the Federal Election Commission on Tuesday spending more than $250,000 in South Carolina to oppose Biden.
'This despicable ad is straight out of the Republican disinformation playbook, and it's clearly designed to suppress turnout among minority voters in South Carolina by taking President Obama's voice out of context and twisting his words to mislead viewers,' Katie Hill, Obama's communications director, said in a statement. 'In the interest of truth in advertising, we are calling on TV stations to take this ad down and stop playing into the hands of bad actors who seek to sow division and confusion among the electorate.'
Hill said Obama has 'several friends' in the Democratic presidential primary, 'including, of course, his own esteemed Vice President.' She also said Obama has 'no plans to endorse in the primary.'
Late Wednesday, Patchen M. Haggerty, an attorney representing Obama, wrote the pro-Trump group's executive director, Chad Banghart, to say the ad's unauthorized use of Obama's 'name, image, likeness, voice and book passage is clearly intended to mislead the target audience of the ad into believing that the passage from the audiobook is a statement that was made by President Obama during his presidency.' 
The letter demanded that the group 'immediately remove' the ad from public view.
An attempt to sway black voters in the state, the ad begins with a narrator saying 'Joe Biden promised to help our community. It was a lie. Here's President Obama.'
The ad then runs audio of Obama reading an unrelated passage from his book, 'Dreams from My Father,' about a conversation he had with a barber in Chicago when he was a community organizer.
The Obama passage, which describes the mistreatment of black voters by politicians, refers to complaints about 'plantation politics' and the history in Chicago of Democratic politicians expecting black votes despite poor housing, poor job opportunities and police brutality.
The ad repurposes a similar attack the Committee to Defend the President ran last year in several states with many black politicians, including Georgia, Michigan and Louisiana, according to PolitiFact. Similar tactics, aimed at decreasing black turnout for Democrats, were used in a radio ad by another pro-Trump super PAC, Great America Alliance, in the 2017 special House election in Georgia.
'Donald Trump and his allies are absolutely terrified that Joe Biden will defeat him in November. Trump even got himself impeached by trying to force another country to lie about the vice president,' said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for the Biden campaign. 'This latest intervention in the Democratic primary is one of the most desperate yet, a despicable torrent of misinformation by the president's lackeys.'
Separately, Republican activists in South Carolina have boasted about a plan called Operation Chaos to encourage Trump backers to vote for Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in Saturday's primary. The South Carolina GOP has canceled the state's Republican primary this year.
The Committee to Defend the President, which grew out of a group called Stop Hillary PAC, traditionally raises its money in increments of $5,000 or less, according to FEC records. The group has reported spending $655,285 on television advertising, $279,800 on voter phone contact, and $144,657 on online voter contact since the beginning of this year.
The group spent about $250,000 on a Spanish-language ad before the Nevada caucuses attacking Obama and Biden on immigration reform.
'They separated families and put children in cages,' the narrator says in that spot, appropriating a Democratic critique of Trump's immigration actions.
Ted Harvey, chairman of the Committee to Defend the President, defended the group's advertising in a statement on Wednesday. 
'It took President Trump to lower black unemployment and create jobs for the African-American community, in addition to passing criminal justice reform,' Harvey said in the statement. 'Joe Biden, on the other hand, is simply giving lip-service for votes. That's the point President Obama made in his book, and we have every right to use his own words "" in his own voice "" in the political forum.'

BRIEFER SAid RUSSIA PREFERS TRUMP
Perception of disloyalty leads to removal of DNI
A senior U.S. intelligence official told lawmakers last week that Russia wants to see President Trump reelected, viewing his administration as more favorable to the Kremlin's interests, according to people who were briefed on the comments.
After learning of that analysis, which was provided to House lawmakers in a classified hearing, Trump grew angry at his acting director of national intelligence, Joseph Maguire, in the Oval Office, seeing Maguire and his staff as disloyal for speaking to Congress about Russia's perceived preference. The intelligence official's analysis and Trump's furious response ruined Maguire's chances of becoming the permanent intelligence chief, according to people familiar with the matter who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter.
It was not clear what specific steps, if any, U.S. intelligence officials think Russia may have taken to help Trump, according to the individuals. 
Trump announced on Wednesday that he was replacing Maguire with a vocal loyalist, Richard Grenell, who is the U.S. ambassador to Germany. The shake-up at the top of the intelligence community is the latest move in a post-impeachment purge. Trump has instructed aides to identify and remove officials across the government who aren't defending his interests, and he wants them replaced with loyalists.

Maguire, a career official who is respected by the intelligence rank and file, was considered a leading candidate to be nominated to the post of DNI, White House aides had said. But Trump's opinion shifted last week when he heard from a Republican ally about the official's remarks. 
The official, Shelby Pierson, said several times during the briefing that Russia had 'developed a preference' for Trump, according to a U.S. official familiar with her comments. That conclusion was part of a broader discussion of election security that also touched on when the U.S. government should warn Democratic candidates if they are being targeted by foreign governments. 
The New York Times first reported on the intelligence conclusion that Russia wants to help the president in 2020. 
Trump erroneously believed that Pierson had given the assessment exclusively to Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, people familiar with the matter said. Trump also believed that the information would be helpful to Democrats if it were released publicly, the people said. Schiff was the lead impeachment manager, or prosecutor, during Trump's Senate trial on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. 
Trump learned about Pierson's remarks from Rep. Devin Nunes (Calif.), the committee's ranking Republican and a staunch Trump ally, said one person familiar with the matter. Trump's suspicions of the intelligence community have often been fueled by Nunes, who was with the president in California on Wednesday when he announced on Twitter that Grenell would become the acting director, officials said.
A spokesman for Nunes did not respond to requests for comment.
'Members on both sides participated, including ranking member Nunes, and heard the exact same briefing from experts across the intelligence community,' a committee official said. 'No special or separate briefing was provided to one side or to any single member, including the chairman.'
The briefing, which was offered to all members of the committee, covered 'election security and foreign interference in the run-up to the 2020 election,' the committee official said.

Other people familiar with the briefing described it as a contentious re-litigating of a previous intelligence assessment that Russia interfered in 2016 to help Trump. Republican members asked why the Russians would want to help Trump when he has levied punishing sanctions on their country, and they challenged Pierson to back up her claim with evidence. It is unclear how she responded.
Republicans on the committee also accused some of the briefers from other agencies of being part of an effort to sabotage Trump's reelection, these people said. Schiff, for his part, said in a tweet Thursday evening: 'We count on the intelligence community to inform Congress of any threat of foreign interference in our elections. If reports are true, and the president is interfering with that, he is again jeopardizing our efforts to stop foreign meddling.'
Trump became angry with Maguire and blamed him for Pierson's remarks when the two met the next day during a special briefing for Trump on election security attended by officials from other agencies, but not Pierson.
At that briefing, Trump angrily asked Maguire why he had to learn of what Pierson had said from Nunes and not from his own aides, according to administration officials with knowledge of the meeting. He said that Maguire should not have let the Capitol Hill briefing happen "" particularly before he received the briefing "" and that he should not have learned about it from a congressman, said one administration official.
Trump told Maguire and other aides in the Oval Office that he did not believe Russia was interfering to help him or planning to do so, and that the intelligence community was getting 'played,' according to an administration official with knowledge of the meeting. He said that the information would be used against him unfairly and that he could not believe that people were believing such a story again, reflecting his opinion that Russian interference in 2016 was a 'hoax' made up by officials with a political agenda.
Maguire struck an apologetic tone and said he was looking into it, this official said.
Trump gave Maguire 'a dressing-down,' said another individual, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter. 'That was the catalyst' that led to the sidelining of Maguire in favor of Grenell, the person said.

Maguire came away 'despondent,' said another individual.
A spokeswoman for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment. The White House did not comment on Trump's Oval Office comments to Maguire.
Trump's removal of Maguire exacerbated long-standing tensions between intelligence officials and the president. Intelligence leaders have long been some of Trump's favorite targets on Twitter and at campaign rallies, where he portrays them as members of a 'deep state' bent on sabotaging his reelection. 
But officials at the agencies insist they have carried on the tradition of providing the president and his top aides with unvarnished information not infected by politics or policy agendas. 

Grenell has no lengthy intelligence experience. But his history of pro-Trump tweets and his personal relationships with Trump's children have caused current and former officials to doubt whether he could credibly serve as the country's top intelligence official, which they said Maguire did, despite having spent his career in the military. 
White House officials said that Trump's decision to make Grenell the acting director rather than nominate him for the permanent position reflected concerns that he might not win confirmation in the Senate, given his polarizing reputation. 
'The president likes acting [officials] better,' one White House official said. 
On Thursday, Grenell said in a tweet that the president would nominate a permanent DNI 'soon' and that it would not be him. A senior White House official said a nominee would be announced before March-11.
The president has been focused lately on officials who are allegedly disloyal to him, particularly at the Justice Department, the National Security Council, the Pentagon and the State Department, aides said, and has heard from outside advisers that 'real MAGA people can't get jobs in the administration,' in the words of an administration official, referring to Trump's 2016 campaign slogan, 'Make America Great Again.' 
Trump has centralized his efforts to purge the ranks of his perceived opponents. In recent weeks, he pushed out Sean Doo cey, the head of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, over the fierce objections of some White House aides, replacing him with Johnny McEntee, Trump's former personal assistant. Trump has instructed McEntee, who lost his job in 2018 over concerns about his online gambling, to install more loyalists in government positions.
Some of those removed from their jobs testified about the president's actions toward Ukraine during his impeachment hearings. 
Trump removed
Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, as well as Vindman's twin brother, who did not testify, from their positions at the National Security Council. Alexander Vindman witnessed a phone call Trump had with Ukraine's president in which Trump pressured the leader to conduct investigations of Trump's Democratic rivals.
Trump asked for the resignation of Gordon Sondland, the ambassador to the European Union, who told House lawmakers that the president had engineered a quid pro quo with Ukraine, conditioning a White House meeting with the country's president on investigations of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter. 
This week, Trump also asked for the resignation of John C. Rood, the official in charge of Defense Department policy, who had certified that Ukraine had met anti-corruption obligations required by law to receive U.S. aid that Trump froze. 
The deputy national security adviser, Victoria Coates, has also been removed from her post after some colleagues, including trade adviser Peter Navarro, accused her of being the author of 'Anonymous,' a scathing account of dysfunction in the White House, according to people familiar with the matter. Coates has strenuously denied the accusation. She was moved to an advisory position in the Energy Department.
By contrast, Grenell appears to be an ideal Trump appointee. The president appreciates that he publicly bashes Germany over policy disagreements. Grenell also defends the president on Fox News and on Twitter, and when he visits the White House for meetings, Trump usually wants to see him, current and former administration officials say.
As acting DNI, Grenell will oversee the intelligence community's efforts to combat election interference and disinformation, but he has been skeptical of Russia's role in 2016. 
'Russian or Russian-approved tactics like cyber warfare and campaigns of misinformation have been happening for decades,' he wrote in a 2016 opinion article for Fox News, playing down the severity of the threat. That view is at odds with the conclusions of senior U.S. intelligence officials, who have said Russia's operation in 2016 was sweeping and systematic, and unlike previous Russian or Soviet efforts.

Democrats also defend Biden on Ukraine
Nadler says Trump's actions were founders' fear
House impeachment managers laid out the heart of their abuse-of-power case against President Trump on Thursday "" charging that his efforts to pressure Ukraine into political investigations were precisely what the nation's founders wanted to guard against when they empowered Congress to remove a president from office.
The Democrats also detailed their defense of former vice president Joe Biden's actions regarding Ukraine in anticipation that it will be a major portion of the White House's defense later this week, saying Biden's actions were in line with official U.S. policy at the time and not done to benefit an energy company connected to his son.
But a significant number of Senate Republicans remained unmoved and played down the case from House managers, dismissing it as repetitive and unpersuasive as they sought to counter Democrats' narrative at a time when Trump's lawyers must stay silent in the Senate Chamber.
House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), who led the case for Democrats on Thursday, cited 'abuse, betrayal and corruption' as not only the offenses that the nation feared the most when they wrote the Constitution, but also those alleged abuses at the core of Trump's dealings with Ukraine.
'The president's abuse of power, his betrayal of the national interest, and his corruption of our elections plainly qualify as great and dangerous offenses,' Nadler said. 'President Trump has made clear in word and deed that he will persist in such conduct if he is not removed from power.'
During his arguments, Nadler also drew liberally from past comments made by key Trump allies, including Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), Attorney General William P. Barr and lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who all argued there doesn't have to be a statutory crime committed to impeach a president.

In one of many video clips played on the Senate floor during the trial, Graham "" then serving as a House manager in former president Bill Clinton's 1999 impeachment trial "" defined 'high crimes' more loosely than he does now as one of Trump's staunchest defenders.

'It's just when you start using your office, and you're acting in a way that hurts people, you've committed a high crime,' Graham said on the Senate floor in the clip from 1999. He was not in the chamber Thursday when his quote was played, but later told reporters that the use of his previous comments was 'fair game' and recommended that the White House do the same with Democrats when Trump's lawyers begin their defense of the president. 
Nadler made a case to the Senate that it would be unreasonable to expect Congress to envision all types of potential presidential corruption and pass laws explicitly forbidding it.
'The Constitution is not a suicide pact,' Nadler said. 'It does not leave us stuck with presidents who abuse their power in unforeseen ways that threaten our security and democracy. Until recently, it did not occur to me that our president would call a foreign leader and demand a sham investigation meant to kneecap his political opponents, all in exchange for releasing vital military aid that the president was already required by law to provide.'
Trump was impeached Dec. 18, with Democrats accusing him of withholding nearly $400 million in military aid and a White House visit coveted by Ukraine in exchange for launching investigations into Biden and his son Hunter, as well as a discredited theory that the eastern European nation interfered in the 2016 election. Trump and his counsel have maintained he did nothing improper when he asked Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky in a July 25 call to probe the two matters. 
In addition to the abuse-of-power charge, Democrats also impeached Trump on a second article of impeachment: that he obstructed congressional attempts to investigate the Ukraine matter.
But the second official day of the House impeachment managers' arguments centered on the Democrats' abuse-of-power claims. They will wrap up their case Friday. Trump's team will launch its defense of the president on Saturday, with the key question of whether the Senate will subpoena new witnesses or documents set to be decided around the middle of next week.
The Senate may only come in for a few hours Saturday morning rather then spending a full day on the trial, in part because Trump did not want much of his defense to be aired on Saturday, when the public may be focused on weekend plans rather than the news, according to a GOP official who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversations.
Outside the Senate chamber on Thursday, GOP senators and the president's legal team fanned out across the airwaves to push back against the Democrats' case.
Echoing a comment from several Senate Republicans, Trump attorney Jay Sekulow said 'we're hearing the same things over and over' from the House Democrats. 
Meanwhile, even if some Republicans didn't outright reject the Democrats' case that there did not need to be an underlying crime for a president to be impeached, most continued to dismiss the overall argument made by the impeachment managers. 
'I don't think that anything they've actually alleged "" any of the 'abuses' "" they have actual evidence for,' Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) said during a break in the trial.
White House officials said Thursday that West Wing aides and Trump's lawyers will continue to be a frequent presence at the Capitol in the coming days as the president's team works to defend him. Aggressive public relations and press availabilities are a key part of that strategy, one Republican strategist familiar with the planning said. 
'This is going to be more than the president tweeting,' the strategist said, adding that the strategy would include Sekulow addressing the media at microphones set up in the Capitol and Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) 'huddling with 100 reporters' in the hallways. 
Trump did tweet Thursday, insisting that Democrats are opposed to a witness deal because they are afraid of what the people called to testify by the GOP would reveal. Democrats have repeatedly said they oppose a witness trade because they believe the witnesses Republicans want are irrelevant to the case. 
'The Democrats don't want a Witness Trade because Shifty Schiff, the Biden's, the fake Whistleblower (- his lawyer), the second Whistleblower (who vanished after I released the Transcripts), the so-called 'informer', - many other Democrat disasters, would be a BIG problem for them!' Trump tweeted.
Though the Republicans' top desired witness remains Hunter Biden, Graham told reporters Thursday that scrutinizing the former vice president's son's service on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian gas company, would be better handled through the 'oversight' process than by calling him as a witness during the impeachment trial.
The Bidens played a prominent role in the House Democrats' arguments Thursday, as Rep. Sylvia Garcia (D-Tex.), another impeachment manager, sought to debunk the allegations that Joe Biden did anything nefarious in his dealings with Ukraine during his time as vice president.
'The allegations against Biden are completely groundless,' Garcia said, detailing how the former vice president's efforts to oust the Ukrainian prosecutor general were in line with official U.S. policy and supported by international allies.
But Republican senators said the focus on the Bidens by Democrats made the former vice president and his son fair game for Trump's defense team. 
'It means when President Trump's lawyers stand up and present their defense, that they are going to have the opportunity to present the very significant evidence that's supported and still supports a serious investigation into corruption at Burisma and ultimately whether Joe Biden participated in that corruption,' Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) told reporters Thursday evening.
In 2016, Biden was the Obama administration's point person on Ukraine policy and led a pressure campaign on the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, whom the administration believed was not doing enough to root out corruption among Ukraine's politicians. Shokin had previously investigated Burisma, but Hunter Biden was not accused of any wrongdoing. 
Garcia noted that Trump and Republicans didn't focus on Biden's actions toward Ukraine until 2019, when 'Biden became the front-runner for the Democratic nomination and polls showed that he had the largest head-to-head lead against President Trump. That became a problem.'
She also referred to a letter from Sens. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and other senators in the Ukraine Caucus to argue that Biden's desire to see Shokin removed reflected official U.S. policy and was not a sign of personal corruption.
As Garcia spoke, a visibly upset and red-faced Johnson rose from his seat, approached Portman and whispered in his ear. Portman reacted impassively, but his comments did not appear to calm Johnson, who departed the floor for the Republican cloakroom moments later. Johnson, a fierce ally of Trump, said in October that he did not recall signing the letter.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), the lead impeachment manager, addressed the other investigation that Trump wanted Zelensky to launch, saying the president floated a 'very specific conspiracy theory' that it was Ukraine, not Russia, that hacked the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016 despite there being no evidence to support the claim.
'This theory was brought to you by the Kremlin,' Schiff said. 'So we're not talking about generic interference . . . what Donald Trump wanted investigated or announced, this completely bogus, Kremlin-pushed conspiracy theory.'

CHARLESTON, S.C. - Late on a Sunday night aboard the hulking World War II-era USS Yorktown docked near Charleston, Joe Biden made a surprise appearance to see U.S. Rep. James E. Clyburn, the state's longest-serving congressman and a cornerstone of the black community whose endorsement was coveted in South Carolina.
Clyburn was at a reception with about 200 people. The two friends whose bond was forged over decades together in politics, and who supported each other more recently in grief, found a conference room nearby.
The congressman had been unimpressed with Biden's presidential campaign operation in the state, frequently hearing about its disorganization and lack of resources. He heard persistent reports that there weren't enough campaign signs in crucial areas. And he was alarmed by the polling data he'd been shown a few days earlier indicating Biden was clinging to a lead of no more than five points, down from 20 points earlier.
""I just knew they were in jeopardy,"" he said.
Clyburn was frank with his advice. Biden was known as being a good guy, and the congressman had experienced the warmth and kindness that Biden can offer. But voters seemed to crave someone with more fight, and Clyburn urged Biden to use a coming debate to more directly take on his rivals.
He also thought Biden's speeches were too meandering, so he suggested he focus on a few points.
""I said, 'There's a reason preachers deliver their sermons in threes. You know, Father, Son and Holy Ghost?' "" Clyburn said. ""Zero in on how to make this personalized, talk about their families, and talk in terms of people's communities.""
Biden took the criticism to heart. ""He told me, 'I got it,' "" Clyburn said.
While Clyburn told Biden plenty that night, there was one thing he left out: He had decided that he was going to endorse him.
The Yorktown talk came Feb. 23, midway through an 18-day stretch that has been the most important of Biden's political career, one in which he tried to revive a campaign so close to collapse at times that one adviser referred to it as a series of ""defibrillator moments.""

His campaign had been haunted by small crowds, an absence of energy and a pervasive feeling that the Democratic Party had passed by a 77-year-old out of step with its current contours. Crowds wowed to a host of candidates, including a small-town mayor half Biden's age who outpaced him in fundraising and, in Iowa and New Hampshire, votes.
Over the course of the Nevada caucuses and the South Carolina primary, the third and fourth contests of this presidential year, Biden would streamline his campaign. He brought in reinforcements, and his campaign aides worked to calm skittish donors.
But perhaps most important, those 18 days saw Biden find firmer footing as a candidate. He reveled in a state he had always considered like home. He received blunt advice from his friends, and took it. He adopted a stiffer edge on two debate stages. His verbal miscues persisted, but even rival campaigns noticed that he was more focused. A grace note came Wednesday, when a nationally televised CNN town hall showcased to the state the empathy-on-his-sleeve candidate who forges emotional connections with voters better than any other in the race.
But until Saturday night, it still was not clear whether that was enough. Voters in the first three states to cast ballots may have seen that side of Biden and respected, even loved him; they may have respected the people endorsing him. But they still didn't vote for him.
That changed here. South Carolina became the place that a nearly five-decade career, stumbling toward what seemed its end, would at least temporarily be revived. His sweeping victory was the first time in three presidential campaigns that Biden actually won a contest. Everything ahead remained unknown, including whether he could replicate his success when the race turns to a national swarm of primaries on Tuesday. But on Saturday night, his candidacy was at least alive, courtesy of South Carolina.

It had been clear for days: Biden was about to get walloped in New Hampshire.
Sitting in the captain's chair at the front his ""Soul of the Nation"" campaign bus, parked outside the DoubleTree hotel in Manchester, N.H., Biden held an intense discussion with his top advisers over whether to stay in the state until the votes were counted or flee toward potentially more friendly environs.
He had invited former governor John Lynch, his top New Hampshire supporter, to come aboard as his team decided, a few hours after the state started voting, that he was not going to stick around to appear before the cameras as a distant fifth-place loser.
""There was a back-and-forth discussion about whether it would have a material impact in New Hampshire if we announced we were leaving before the polls closed,"" said Kate Bedingfield, a deputy campaign manager. ""But we decided the most important thing to do was to not just tell people that we believed diverse voters should have their say before anyone declared this race over, but to show it. And the only way to show it that night was to take a dramatic step and physically be there in South Carolina.""
So after handing out Dunkin' Donuts to supporters and shaking hands in a half-filled restaurant, Biden boarded his chartered twin-engine, 10-seat airplane and flew out of the dreary New England weather toward a place that had always sustained him.
""You have no idea how great it is to be back in South Carolina,"" Biden said that night in an event space in Columbia, summoning all the confidence his losses in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary hadn't beaten out of him.
""It ain't over, man. We're just getting started.""
His advisers took some comfort that their gambit to head to South Carolina offered enough drama that television networks carried his remarks live. And they watched as Biden, the longtime front-runner, seemed to relish the only option he had left, battling his way forward.
""I know this is going to be the fight of my life,"" Biden said. ""But as the old song goes: Lord don't move my mountain, give me the ability to climb. I can't do it alone. I need your help to climb that mountain!""

Biden's campaign always knew that it faced hurdles in the first two states, even if there were moments last fall when his advisers sensed they might be able to overwhelm the field with victories there. He won endorsements, he toured in a bus wrapped with the phrase ""No Malarkey"" - a decision that some allies complained made him seem hopelessly outdated - and spent significant time and energy trying to win.
But after a fourth-place finish in Iowa on Feb. 3 gave way to the more depressing fifth place in New Hampshire eight days later, the campaign was reeling. Even if advisers had felt he would perform better in what one called ""the second two of the first four"" states, they did not account for how big of a punch he would take in those first two.
""Obviously we expected to do better in Iowa than we did. And to be clear, we should have been competitive in New Hampshire,"" said a senior adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity to offer a candid assessment. ""The fact that we were leading and competitive in polls for a long time demonstrated the appetite voters did and do have for Biden. But the reality is, we couldn't come in where we did in Iowa and hope to have a stellar showing in New Hampshire.""
Between the two contests, Anita Dunn, a senior adviser and Biden confidante, was elevated and given final decision-making authority. The campaign also tapped a widely respected Democratic operative, Jen O'Malley-Dillon, to come in and run the Nevada operation.
But blame also rested elsewhere - on Biden himself.
After the New Hampshire loss, Biden's campaign co-chairman Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-La.) wrote him a tough-love email: ""If you really believe you're fighting for the soul of the country, then go act like it.""
""I think he was being too cautious,"" Richmond said. ""After New Hampshire we were like, 'Throw caution to the wind. Go be you. You're not going to be a perfect candidate. You're not going to be a robot. Just go be you.' ""
""If we're fighting for the future of the country, then let's go fight for it.""
Aides attempted to focus Biden's message, refining a speech that even on good days can feel like a stream-of-consciousness vent. And a candidate who had spent the past year orienting himself as the alternative to President Trump began instead casting himself as the Democratic Party's chief alternative to Sanders.
Biden sought to drive home that Sanders had a record more favorable to gun manufacturers. He continued to hammer away at the costs of Sanders's signature Medicare-for-all plan, and the risks to the party of having a democratic socialist as the standard-bearer.
But Biden also benefited from something he could not control - other candidates' desperation as their odds of winning lengthened. As one adviser said, ""Biden's success in some ways is built on other people's disappointments.""
Sanders and former South Bend, Ind., mayor Pete Buttigieg had shaken the field with their strong performances in the first two contests, knocking back Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Biden. Sen. Amy Klobuchar's surprisingly strong third-place finish in New Hampshire further muddled the moderates, while former New York mayor Mike Bloomberg spent a fortune to brand himself the most capable alternative to both Sanders and Trump. Businessman Tom Steyer also spent heavily in South Carolina, beginning to peel black voters away from Biden.
The debate in Las Vegas on Feb. 19 unleashed a new dynamic among candidates, with Warren being particularly animated in attacking everyone onstage but especially Bloomberg, whose poor performance began to give voters pause.
""I have to give a little bit of credit to Elizabeth Warren, to her surgical takedown of Mayor Mike,"" said Larry Rasky, a Boston-based consultant who knows Warren and Biden well and is helping run the super PAC supporting Biden.
Bloomberg's fall came to Biden's benefit as voters continued to look for a more moderate option. ""Results matter. And things shifted,"" Rasky said.
On a Saturday afternoon in Las Vegas, 11 days after New Hampshire and seven before South Carolina, Biden and his team watched results from the caucuses. A candidate who had slumped from fourth in Iowa to fifth in New Hampshire had finished second in Nevada. It was a distant second, but his trajectory had reversed.
""Even though Bernie did well, that we came in second was important,"" said John Anzalone, a Biden adviser and pollster. ""It showed we were still alive.""

Biden arrived back in South Carolina on Sunday morning, Feb. 23, and headed to Royal Missionary Baptist Church in North Charleston. When other presidential candidates had come to the church, they spoke in side buildings on the campus. Biden, though, was granted the center of the sanctuary for a crowded Sunday service.
It was a visible reminder that he had deeper connections in the state than other candidates and that his campaign was buttressed by black voters whose role had not been visible until South Carolina but who would make up the majority here.
""The thing about the African American church is that it's all about hope,"" he said after thanking the people who'd allowed him the moment. It was clear his hope was not simply spiritual.
""This is real,"" he said. ""The African American community in South Carolina will make a judgment about who the next president is going to be. . . . You have in your hands the power to decide, to determine who the next Democratic nominee will be. . . . You can own this election.""
Over the next few days, Biden gathered with aides inside a hotel suite at the Mills House hotel in the historic downtown of Charleston, where the beds had been cleared out and, in their place, a large circular conference table was brought in.
The next debate would be widely watched in South Carolina, and they knew these sessions would be crucial. Rather than do a mock debate, they batted around ideas. They talked about ways for Biden to be more direct in his points, how to hammer Sanders and how to take on Steyer among African Americans.
""The truth is when he's on the debate stage he's very, very, very careful not to misspeak or get any little thing wrong, which can cause a problem all in itself,"" said Richmond, the campaign co-chairman. ""We were saying, 'Look, don't worry about that. People make mistakes. But if you try so hard not to make any mistake, you're going to paralyze yourself.' ""
""He's getting more comfortable trusting his instincts,"" he added. ""He doesn't have to get it all in for an answer. He has to get the main points in and get them in forcefully.""

On the debate stage Feb. 25 he was, at times, so forceful that it surprised some of his advisers. The candidate who in the first debate said, ""My time is up"" as he voluntarily stopped talking was now chastising the moderators for not giving him more chances to speak. For one of the first times in a presidential primary debate, Biden seemed to have a hometown crowd, with frequent cheers at his answers.
The next morning brought another pivotal turn. A few days earlier, Clyburn had been at the funeral of his accountant when an older woman beckoned him to her pew. She whispered in his ear - who are you voting for? - and said others were looking to him for guidance.
He paused before telling her Biden was his choice. And he decided he would publicly say so the next Wednesday, the morning after the debate.
Clyburn delivered a glowing and deeply personal endorsement. He recounted how Biden comforted him when his wife had died a few months earlier. Biden, hugging Clyburn, was moved to tears.
There were three days to go before South Carolina voted.

South Carolina had always been different, both demographically and in Biden's mind.
""Joe Biden is at home when he's here, "" said Symone Sanders, a senior adviser who relocated after the New Hampshire primary and had been living in the state for weeks.
It was the state's long-serving Sen. Ernest ""Fritz"" Hollings who convinced a grief-stricken Biden to take his U.S. Senate seat after Biden's wife and daughter died in a car accident just after his 1972 election. Biden's family would often vacation in South Carolina, and his extended family came to Kiawah Island just south of Charleston in 2015 as they mourned the death of Biden's oldest son, Beau.
When he dies, Biden has said, he wants to be reborn in Charleston. Still, even here the campaign struggled.
Only after the New Hampshire loss, some close to the campaign say, did the campaign truly begin to invest in the state, hiring paid canvassers, increasing spending on radio ads and sending senior staffers to the state.
""South Carolina is his territory, and we've leveraged his relationships here,"" said Kendall Corley, the state director of the campaign. ""We went out and had real conversations with voters, with elected officials. And tapped into their enthusiasm.""
Biden's campaign operation has often been a mess. Internally, decisions tended to get bottled up at the top and delayed. On the ground it was so disorganized that volunteers attempting to help would be turned away.
His campaign even overlooked a group of about a half-dozen long-standing informal black advisers who were so loyal that they referred to themselves as the Bidenites. Miffed that the campaign hadn't asked for their support as he sought the presidency for the third time, some members had migrated to Steyer. Others had joined up with the campaign of Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) before he dropped out in October.
""We said, 'To hell with it. If they don't want us, to hell with it,' "" recalled Fletcher N. Smith, a former state legislator who was in the group. But after Biden lost in New Hampshire, his campaign here started reaching out to people like Fletcher and another Bidenite, Brandon Brown.
""They were like, 'We need you guys back,' "" Smith recalled.
The Bidenites had grown worried about the rise of Sanders, fearing that if he were the nominee the party would lose the House and Senate.
""We all just made a determination that whatever differences we may have had in the past, Biden is still our man,"" Smith said of the Bidenites. ""This is not anything about a personality or ego or anything personal. It's about the business of politics.""
Their informal group activated, drawing on its political and religious networks. Smith began working the phones and traveling the state, propping up Biden and knocking Sanders. A group that had been on the outside looking in, frustrated with the campaign operation, was now back on board.
On Friday, Smith introduced the vice president at Wofford College, Smith's alma mater.
""The Joe Biden I know respects both his friends and his adversaries,"" he said. ""The Joe Biden I know cherishes his Irish roots and his Catholic faith. The Joe Biden I know didn't hesitate to join the administration of the first black president of the United States.""
Smith sat onstage with Biden for the rest of the event, including as Biden offered his thanks.
""Fletcher Smith, you have been a good friend for a long, long time,"" Biden said, ""and I really appreciate your friendship.""


On Saturday night, his win was so resounding that the election was called for Biden as soon as the polls closed at 7 p.m. 

Preliminary exit polls of South Carolina's voters showed the success of the tactics Biden employed over the 18 days. About three-quarters of Democratic primary voters viewed Biden favorably, a far better standing than enjoyed by any other candidate.
More than half of primary voters were black. And nearly half said Clyburn's endorsement was important in deciding their vote. 
A slew of new challenges begin with Tuesday's contests. Several candidates are in better financial shape than Biden and have deeper organizations. It may not last, but for the first time in a long time, Biden on Saturday was basking in good news.

""For all those of who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind - this is your campaign,"" he said, before alluding to those who had predicted, after his first three losses, that his campaign was dead.
He let out a broad smile, leaned into the microphone and proclaimed: ""We are very much alive.""

Many of the most endangered Republicans have concluded that fully embracing President Trump is their only credible path to victory in November, rallying to his side in the final days of the Senate impeachment fight and indulging his most controversial actions and statements.
At-risk Republicans "" including those in battlegrounds such as Arizona, Colorado and Georgia "" are calculating that a strong economy and an energized pro-Trump base will be enough to carry the party as it works to retain the White House and its Senate majority in 2020, according to interviews and private discussions with more than a dozen Republican senators, Senate aides and veteran strategists and officials.
More broadly, most Republicans have also largely jettisoned plans to break ranks with Trump to woo independents and suburban women, who turned on the party in 2018 and helped hand the House to the Democrats. This political positioning is driven in part by their view that Democrats are again poised to nominate a uniquely vulnerable presidential standard-bearer weighed down with ideological or establishment baggage.
'There's nothing in the middle of the road other than dead possums and yellow lines,' said Will Ritter, co-founder of Poolhouse, a center-right ad agency. 'Like no other president before, Republican voters want you to wrap yourself around Trump. There is no upside to doing any distancing.'
Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.) has concentrated in recent weeks on rallying base Republicans rather than appealing to moderates for her tough reelection fight, pushing for a swift acquittal in Trump's impeachment trial while raising money off a feud with a CNN reporter she called 'a liberal hack.' Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who is running for reelection in a state Hillary Clinton won by five points in 2016, came under attack by his likely Democratic opponent, former governor John Hickenlooper, after deciding against calling for impeachment witnesses and evidence this week.
And Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-Ga.), facing a tough intraparty primary fight from Rep. Douglas A. Collins (R-Ga.), has gone all-in on supporting Trump in a state that Democrats are targeting for its growing diversity and booming Atlanta suburbs, including an attack this week on fellow Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) for supporting the call for witnesses.
Loeffler, who has been personally friendly with Romney and who has donated to him in the past, accused him in a tweet of trying to 'appease the left' and concluded: 'The circus is over. It's time to move on!'
Trump's uncontested grip over his party came into focus again Friday as two key Republican senators "" Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, who is retiring, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, who is not up for reelection "" supported the president by blocking Democratic attempts to extend the trial, couching their positions as driven by frustrations with Democrats. It will mark the first time in U.S. history that no witnesses will be called in a Senate impeachment proceeding.
'There is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the United States Constitution's high bar for an impeachable offense,' Alexander said in a statement, arguing that while Trump had taken 'actions that are inappropriate,' they did not merit his removal from office.
It was the most significant political move made by Senate Republicans this week: Their refusal to join Democrats in calling for additional evidence or witnesses in Trump's impeachment trial, ensuring that it could wrap up in the coming days.
At the center of the calculation was Trump himself, and just how much Republicans feel they can distance themselves from a president who, in just over three years, has traveled from troublesome outsider to Republican Party standard-bearer.
Ritter said some vulnerable Republicans running in swing states and House districts may be able to differentiate themselves from Trump and appeal to the center on specific policy issues, but on something hyper-politicized like impeachment, they cannot afford to cross the president.
'On Trump, it's binary,' Ritter said. 'You're either a treacherous Democrat or you're with the president.'
The 2018 midterm elections did provide a flashing alarm for Republicans about the risks of being inextricably bound with Trump. Democrats retook the House majority after toppling Republican incumbents in many suburban districts and in state and local races "" a takeover that laid the groundwork for impeachment.
Former Republican senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania said challenges in suburbs, such as those surrounding Philadelphia, remain troubling for the party. But he said opposing Trump on impeachment is seen by most at-risk Republicans as the 'wrong way to try to win over those voters.'
'You won't get seen as playing to the suburbs,' Santorum said. 'You'll be seen as playing to the angry leftists who hate the president.'
Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), who as the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee worked to keep the probe of Russian election interference as bipartisan as possible, said he fully supports Trump and is surprised that anyone might be surprised.
'He's a Republican, he's president and we support his agenda,' Burr said. 'The media, of course, tries to drive a wedge and wonder, but every poll today shows the president actually stronger today than he was four years ago.'
For Trump, Republican unity on impeachment is the fruit of the ultimate pressure campaign in a short political career defined by them. The president has upended so many norms that he has simply become the norm, with everyone else in the party scrambling to adjust.
That doesn't mean Republicans all personally like Trump or cheer his conduct, either on foreign policy or other matters "" in fact, many Republican lawmakers still complain loudly about him behind closed doors, sometimes mocking him as incompetent and undisciplined.
But many also privately acknowledge that Trump dominates the party in a potent and visceral way and say they are operating out of the partisan reality of an intensely divided nation.
Democrats, they add, should stop expecting a Republican establishment to stand up and block Trump, since Trump himself is now the establishment.
'I regularly talk to five or six Republicans who I feel some closeness to,' said Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio). 'I've heard for months that they know the president lies a lot. . . . They worry about his character. But they aren't willing to come forward and say that publicly. That's one of the tragedies of this era.'
Former Republican Georgia congressman Jack Kingston said he once had reservations about Trump but has since become an ardent admirer and booster. He explained his transformation with a shrug, saying his party and Washington 'needed a shake-up.'
'I accept it,' he said.
The Georgia primary fight brewing between Loeffler and Collins is a classic Trump-era standoff, he added.
'Any GOP candidate is going to want to show he or she is close to Trump,' Kingston said. 'If you think about the Republican Party, he's the center of the orbit. You don't want him to say something bad about you.'
The impulse for Republicans to link themselves tightly to the president spans the country, and includes some lawmakers not even currently up for reelection. Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who doesn't face reelection for four years, released a 30-second ad in Iowa that sided with Trump and attacked former vice president Joe Biden and other Democrats.
'I'd like to thank the Democrats for badly botching this impeachment charade and for spending so much time in a coverup for Joe Biden,' says Scott, who introduces himself as a juror in the Senate trial. 'The real story here is the corruption Joe Biden got away with.'
The ad goes on to levy a series of factually problematic charges against Biden and his son Hunter, but its mere existence is sure to delight Trump "" and sparked speculation that Scott is eyeing a 2024 presidential bid, seeking to cast himself as the torchbearer of Trump's brand.
Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general under Trump who is now running to retake the Alabama Senate seat he vacated to join the administration, is also pushing to prove his fealty to the president "" despite the fact that Trump, furious at Sessions for recusing himself from the Russia investigation, publicly and privately berated and humiliated his attorney general for the majority of his tenure.
Nonetheless, on Wednesday, Sessions touted his loyalty to Trump in a trio of tweets focused on former national security adviser John Bolton, whose forthcoming book directly ties Trump to the Ukraine decision at the heart of his impeachment trial. Sessions emphasized that he never publicly criticized the president and dismissed Bolton's memoir as 'an act of disloyalty.'

Former senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said he understands if Republicans poke holes in the Democrats' case against Trump and vote for acquittal but cannot accept Republicans insisting that Trump did nothing wrong. Those who do the latter, he said, are willfully taking a position they know is false.
'That's the difference. Vote to acquit? Okay. You can make that argument. But to say this wasn't an egregious abuse of his presidential duty? That's where this party has problems,' Flake said. 'To suggest otherwise signals complete subservience to the president.'
But Scott Reed, senior strategist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, pointed to Trump's 'unprecedented high approval ratings with the GOP rank and file.'
'It's Trump's party now "" there's no way around that,' Reed said. 'You may not agree with the boxes, but he's checking all the boxes.'
Democrats, meanwhile, have had their own challenges holding their ranks together as Trump voters in red states have made clear to Democratic senators that they will pay a price for opposing the president.
Two centrists who won election last year "" Sens. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) "" as well as Sen. Doug Jones (D-Ala.), who will face voters this year after a long-shot win in a special election in 2017, have been coy about how they will vote on acquittal, giving hope to Trump's allies that the president could win bipartisan support.
Many Republicans also believe that Trump stands a strong chance of reelection against a flawed Democratic opponent, whether a nominee from the left like Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) or Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), or a longtime politician like Biden.
Dick Wadhams, a longtime Republican strategist based in Colorado, said the specific choice between Trump and the eventual Democratic nominee will help Republicans who have tacked to the right to appease the party's base win over moderates, as well.
'It's going to be a choice on the ballot and not a referendum in 2020, and that's what makes this very different than 2018,' Wadhams said. He added that he was a begrudging Trump voter in 2016 but now is fully supportive. He pointed to Trump accomplishments like passing a tax cut and appointing conservative judicial nominees, as well as his concern about where the Democrats would take the country.
'I still have concerns about the way he behaves, his tweets drive me nuts, and a lot of Republicans feel that way, but at the same time "" Medicare-for-all, Green New Deal, killing fracking "" spare me,' he said, rattling off a list of liberal proposals. 'Democrats are driving people who might want to vote for them back to Trump.'

The state of Congress's investigation wars may depend more on Democratic voters in Iowa, New Hampshire and other early primary states in the 2020 presidential campaign than on the merits of the cases. 
Despite the near-certain acquittal of President Trump in the Senate's impeachment trial, possibly within a week, his allies are demanding a reciprocal investigation of one of his leading rivals "" former vice president Joe Biden. 
'I think there is more than sufficient evidence to open an investigation and at minimum answer the questions. Joe Biden may have a defense on the merits, but he's never been "" there's never been an investigation,' Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) said Friday night after the House managers concluded their opening arguments in the impeachment case. 
Cruz, along with Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, have increased their talk of forcing either a special counsel investigation and, if the Justice Department declines, opening a more formal probe in that committee. 
The investigation would focus on Hunter Biden's 2014 appointment to the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father had that nation's security interests as part of his vice-presidential portfolio. 
Democrats see a simple motive for such an investigation: Biden's strong position in the Democratic primary field and the chance to haunt his campaign should he emerge the front-runner after the early caucus and primary states in February and March. 
'Benghazi, Benghazi, Benghazi,' said Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), a Biden supporter.
That's a reference to the Libyan city where terrorists attacked a U.S. diplomatic compound and a CIA annex in 2012, killing the U.S. ambassador and three others. Republicans hounded Hillary Clinton, then serving as secretary of state and the future 2016 Democratic nominee against Trump, over her handling of that incident, including a more than two-year investigation by a select House committee. 
Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), then the House majority leader, acknowledged in a late 2015 interview that Clinton's 'numbers are dropping' and 'she's untrustable,' something that was 'part of the strategy' in starting the probe. 
In street parlance, he said the quiet part aloud. 
And for Democrats, this is deja vu all over again. 
Cruz struggled to explain why Senate Republicans waited until now to talk about a Biden probe. He paused for five full seconds before finally answering.
'I think there needs to be additional investigation but right now we're in the middle of an impeachment trial,' he said. 
It's been almost six years since Burisma, the Ukrainian company, announced in a news release that Hunter Biden had joined its board and more than three years since Joe Biden left the White House. Republicans have held the Senate majority for more than five years. 
'There was absolutely no interest in this topic for years,' Coons said. 
Over their three-day presentation in the impeachment trial, House managers connected Trump's interest in pressuring Ukraine officials to investigate Biden to his entry into the 2020 race. 
By late October, Graham told reporters that Trump and his close allies were pressuring him to use the Judiciary Committee to launch Biden-Ukraine investigations but that he refused to do so because he would not 'turn the Senate into a circus.'
He said his portfolio included the Justice Department's investigation into the 2016 campaign, but matters like Ukraine fell into other committees. 
A month later, as pressure from Trump mounted, Graham sent a letter to the State Department requesting documents related to Biden's 2016 calls to the president of Ukraine at that time, Petro Poroshenko, who lost his reelection bid last year to Volodymyr Zelensky.
Aides to Graham did not respond to requests for an update on the State Department's response. 
Previously a close friend of Biden's, Graham now regularly suggests that the former vice president forced Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma, a charge that has never been proved. Former U.S. and Ukrainian officials have said the prosecutor's investigation of Burisma had been dormant. A bipartisan group in Congress hoped that the change in prosecutors backed by Biden and others would lead to more aggressive anti-corruption investigations, punctuated by a February 2016 letter to Poroshenko from three Senate Republicans and five Democrats demanding a shake-up of his prosecutor's office. 
During a trial break Friday, Graham sort of said the quiet part out loud. 
Of Biden, he said, 'I don't think he's corrupt,' and he said Hunter Biden's board position might have just been 'bad judgment.' Graham said a main reason Biden needed to be investigated was because Trump had been investigated by the team of special counsel Robert S. Mueller III. 
'Nobody has done an investigation anywhere near like the Mueller investigation of the Bidens, and I think they should. Once this is over, the Congress will do it if we can't have an outside entity do it,' Graham told reporters. 
'We cannot have an America where only one side is looked at,' Graham added, ignoring the exhaustive reviews of Biden by his Democratic rivals and the news media. 'We're not going to live in a country where only Republicans get looked at.'
Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) went a bit further in explaining Trump's motives in pressuring Zelensky to launch corruption investigations. 
'The president ended up with suddenly a new president in Ukraine who ran on and won overwhelmingly on an anti-corruption agenda,' Cramer said Friday. 'That presented an opportunity to look more closely at this relationship between Joe Biden, Ukraine and his son Hunter's good fortune, being well paid for a job he wasn't qualified to do.'
In their initial opening arguments Saturday, Trump's lawyers steered clear of talking about Hunter Biden and Ukraine, but most Senate Republicans want that to change in their higher-profile second phase Monday afternoon. 
Once the impeachment trial is finished, Cramer said 'it's only appropriate' that the Senate investigate the Bidens. 
Some Democrats believe voters will see such a move for what it is. 'I think it could well backfire if they abuse the power that Congress has for venal political purposes,' Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a member of the Judiciary Committee, said Friday after the managers finished. 
Voters expect that out on the campaign trail, not Congress, Blumenthal said. 'I know it may sound naive, but I think when we're done here the American people will have very little appetite for partisan conflict here. There's going to be so much of it during campaigns.'
But Coons remembers going to polling places on Election Day 2016.
'Can you explain to me,' he asked one voter, 'what it is about emails and Benghazi that would make you vote for or against someone?'
'I don't really know,' the voter said, 'but there must be something wrong.'
