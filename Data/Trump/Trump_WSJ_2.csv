An intraparty Republican fight over a Georgia Senate seat is intensifying, as campaign vendors face pressure not to work with a congressman trying to unseat the state's newly appointed senator.
The battle pits 53-year-old Rep. Doug Collins, a four-term conservative congressman and staunch defender of President Trump, against Sen. Kelly Loeffler, 49,
a business executive
with no political experience who has tens of millions of dollars of personal funds to spend on a campaign.
Republican Gov. Brian Kemp appointed Ms. Loeffler to replace Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, who left office at the end of 2019
because of declining health
. Under state law, the governor can appoint senators temporarily, but candidates must run to fill out the rest of the term at the next general election. Some Republicans worry that a divisive fight would hurt the party's prospects against the Democratic nominee in November.
If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, the two top vote-getters, regardless of party, will compete in a Jan. 5 runoff. Whoever wins the general election would be up for re-election for a new six-year term again in 2022.
Mr. Collins appeared on Fox News in late January to say he would run, too. Within days, at least three campaign vendors dropped him as a client under pressure from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm of Senate Republicans, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Some of the companies' clients also were warned to distance themselves from Mr. Collins if they wanted to work with NRSC again, the people said. The NRSC's stance has long been that working for candidates challenging incumbent senators could cost vendors their good standing with the committee, whose mission it is to defend them.
Stephen Lawson, a spokesman for Ms. Loeffler's campaign, said she wasn't available to comment. ""Kelly isn't worried about politics—she's focused on supporting President Trump's agenda and creating more opportunities for Georgians to prosper,"" Mr. Lawson said.
Mr. Collins is defiant. His campaign hired new vendors to replace those who left and is seizing on the controversy as a way of casting him as an insurgent outsider ready to battle the party establishment.
""The efforts that are under way in Washington and under the Gold Dome in Atlanta have a whiff of panic about them,"" said Collins campaign spokesman Dan McLagan. ""The side that doesn't want there to be a vote is likely the side that doesn't have the votes.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What is the best strategy for either party to take the state Senate seat? Join the conversation below.
The unknown factor in the Collins-Loeffler showdown is Mr. Trump, who thanked them both recently for their support during the impeachment process. Mr. Collins voted against articles of impeachment against the president in the House and Ms. Loeffler voted for his acquittal in the Senate. At a White House event, Mr. Trump called Ms. Loeffler ""a young woman who I didn't know at all, but she's been so supportive."" A few minutes later, he saluted Mr. Collins, saying, ""You have been so great. Thank you very much, Doug…Really amazing job.""
Mr. Trump, who hasn't endorsed either candidate for Senate, added, without elaborating, ""Something is going to happen that's going to be very good. I don't know. I haven't figured it out yet.""
In November, The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Kemp and Ms. Loeffler
met quietly with Mr. Trump
, but the meeting didn't go well. The president pressed for Mr. Collins, who had applied for the job, to be the appointee. Mr. Kemp, for whom Mr. Trump campaigned in 2018, appointed Ms. Loeffler anyway.
The NRSC has blasted Rep. Collins's decision to run as selfish.
""With this emotional, ill-informed decision, Doug Collins has united conservatives in opposition to his candidacy and Senator Loeffler has quickly assembled more Republican support in Georgia than Collins ever knew existed,"" said NRSC spokesman Jesse Hunt.
The GOP split opens the door for a possible Democratic win in November. Under state law, all candidates run against each other in such a vote without a party primary first. The Rev. Raphael Warnock, the African-American pastor of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Ebenezer Baptist Church, is seen as a leading Democratic candidate with backing from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
Supporters of Mr. Collins pushed state legislators to quickly pass a law to add a primary, which would help Mr. Collins because primary voters tend to be more conservative. But Mr. Kemp promised to veto any such bill.
Eric Tanenblatt, an Atlanta-based Republican strategist who supports Ms. Loeffler, said she is qualified and will help with women voters. The split is hurting the party by forcing Republicans to choose sides, he said, adding, ""I'm not a big fan of family fights.""
Supporters of Rep. Collins say they doubt Sen. Loeffler will excite GOP voters.
""What we need is someone who can ignite the base and bring Trump voters out,"" said Kris Yardley, a Republican activist in Georgia.
Bryan Long, a Georgia Democratic campaign consultant, said the brewing GOP fight is great news for his side.
""Y'all see who can out Trump each other,"" he said. ""The Republicans seem to be doing everything they can to help Democrats in this race.""

NASHUA, N.H.—Democrats in search of a centrist nominee to challenge President Trump are increasingly worried after contests in
Iowa
and
New Hampshire
consolidated liberal support behind Bernie Sanders and divided the larger moderate vote among multiple candidates.
The party's center lane is crowded with the rising former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Vice President Joe Biden. Looming in the
March 3 Super Tuesday states
and beyond is former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, buoyed by
campaign spending that dwarfs all his opponents combined
.
With no clear centrist front-runner, vulnerable freshman Democrats in Congress are texting each other anxiously, a Biden-allied fundraiser warns of a ""doomsday scenario"" and party strategists fret about what mixed early-state turnout means for November.
Predictions about which candidates are the most electable and which will prevail through a long primary season have proven unreliable in the past, particularly at this early stage of the process, before voting in the diverse states of South Carolina and Nevada. Barack Obama faced intraparty doubts in 2008, as did Mr. Trump in 2016.
With multiple contenders vowing to stay in the race, party leaders are yet again bracing for the likelihood of a protracted fight for the nomination that may not be settled by the time of the July convention in Milwaukee.
Adding to some Democrats' worries is the president's
acquittal from impeachment
and his strength among his most fervent supporters, as evidenced by the more than 11,000 who turned out for his
Monday night rally in Manchester, N.H.
, a larger crowd than any assembled by a Democrat campaigning in the state.
""There is one thing that's universal, and that is anxiety,"" said Rufus Gifford, who served as finance director for President Obama's re-election campaign and has contributed to several campaigns.

The fear among some Democrats is predicated on the idea that Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist, would struggle to defeat Mr. Trump in November. Mr. Sanders and his supporters believe the party could unite around him if he is the nominee and that he could energize young voters and those in crucial Rust Belt states who swung to the GOP in 2016.
The Sanders campaign disputed the notion he would hurt Democrats in swing districts, noting that candidates in states that will be crucial in 2020 had requested his help during 2018 midterms.
Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg, a 38-year-old newcomer to the national scene, essentially tied in Iowa and finished one-two in New Hampshire. Ms. Warren has faded in the first two contests but is pressing forward, while Ms. Klobuchar, the No. 3 finisher in Iowa, is eyeing delegates when her home state of Minnesota votes on March 3.
If Mr. Biden has a strong showing in South Carolina and Nevada, he could regain lost momentum and potentially persuade wavering Democrats to stick with him through subsequent states.
Mr. Bloomberg meanwhile has poured more than $350 million of his fortune into a series of March states, including California, Texas and North Carolina.
Philip Levine, a former mayor of Miami Beach, Fla., who supports Mr. Bloomberg, said in an interview he received ""an avalanche"" of phone calls and emails Wednesday from donors asking how they could help, and from elected officials, whom he didn't name, asking his advice on ""how to tactfully retract"" their endorsements of Mr. Biden and shift their support to Mr. Bloomberg.
Some Democratic donors say privately there will be a lot of pressure for Mr. Biden to get out after South Carolina if he performs poorly there.
""We are going to compete in Super Tuesday states,"" said Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a Biden campaign co-chairman. ""Bloomberg is spending an awful lot of money, but he's also not had his turn in the barrel. He has not been on the debate stage. He's untested.""
Larry Rasky, who leads a pro-Biden super PAC called Unite the Country, sought to rally Biden donors in a fundraising memo Sunday by telling them that if they hedge their bets on Mr. Biden because of Mr. Bloomberg, they could be creating a ""doomsday scenario.""
""The Sanders-Warren wing of the Party is ready for the Bloomberg fight. Democrats cannot afford a split Convention. Do you really think the Sanders voters wing will support Mike Bloomberg? Do you think all the camps who have busted their butts and played by the rules will happily sign on"" to Mr. Bloomberg's campaign, he wrote.
The party's attempt to present itself as a steady, competent alternative to Mr. Trump has been
marred by the chaotic Iowa caucuses
, where more than a week later Mr. Sanders narrowly trails Mr. Buttigieg in state delegates, but Mr. Sanders leads in the popular vote. Both candidates have requested a recanvassing of certain precincts.
Party strategists are watching early-state turnout closely for clues about whether Democrats are energized to vote.

More than 176,000 people participated in the Iowa Democratic caucuses this year, a slight increase from four years ago but well behind the nearly 240,000 who caucused in 2008. New Hampshire was a brighter spot for Democrats: Turnout reached about 297,000 voters in the Democratic primary, compared with about 255,000 in 2016 and nearly 290,000 in 2008.
""Everything is splintered,"" said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist and former adviser to West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. ""And it just shows that voters aren't falling in love with any of these candidates, and that's a problem.""
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has conducted focus groups in early-voting states and general-election battlegrounds, said she has been struck by ""the duality of who you like and who you think can beat Trump. And they're not necessarily the same thing.""

In a sign of Democrats' interest in finding an alternative to Mr. Biden, some moderate House Democrats have embraced Mr. Bloomberg, including Reps. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Haley Stevens of Michigan and Scott Peters of California. On Wednesday, two African-American members of Congress, Reps. Lucy McBath (D., Ga.) and Gregory Meeks (D., N.Y.) said they were backing Mr. Bloomberg. All are members of the centrist New Democrat Coalition.
Rep. Stephanie Murphy, the chairwoman of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition caucus, said Mr. Sanders wouldn't be able to win over swing voters, and if he becomes the party's nominee, he could put the new House majority at risk. ""For many moderate districts and Trump-won districts, Bernie Sanders at the top of the ticket would create headwinds for house members running for re-election,"" she said.

Former Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, said in a tweet Tuesday that ""Sanders is just as polarizing as Trump AND he'll ruin our economy."" Mr. Sanders's campaign manager tweeted back: ""This is what panic from the Wall Street elite looks and sounds like.""
For most of the campaign, Mr. Biden has presented himself as the candidate best able to win states narrowly carried by Mr. Trump, including his boyhood state of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.
""He did not have a shot to win Iowa or do well in Iowa,"" said Rep. Tim Ryan (D., Ohio), who endorsed Mr. Biden after his own candidacy failed. ""His two strongest groups are communities of color and older voters, and both are pretty much excluded from the caucus process.""
Mr. Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, joined a conference call with the campaign's top financial donors on Wednesday afternoon, according to three participants, and noted the campaign's strength in Nevada and South Carolina among Latinos and African-Americans.
Polls indicate that Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar both have struggled to appeal to African-American voters. Mr. Bloomberg apologized for a second time Tuesday amid a fresh round of criticism for his support of stop-and-frisk policing in New York City.
Mr. Sanders has argued that Democrats must nominate someone who can generate enthusiasm and mobilize young people and infrequent voters who were turned off by their choices in the 2016 election. The senator has arguably the best ability to command large crowds, evidenced by more than 7,500 people who showed up for a primary eve rally and concert at the University of New Hampshire.
In the last week, Mr. Sanders has taken the lead in the RealClearPolitics average of national Democratic primary polls, after Mr. Biden had led for months.
While Mr. Biden's candidacy has foundered, Mr. Bloomberg has courted members of Congress. In January, Mr. Bloomberg flew to Salt Lake City where Rep. Ben McAdams (D., Utah) hosted the former mayor at his home with local Democrats and Republicans. Mr. Bloomberg talked about his hope for a pragmatic government and answered questions on climate change and fiscal responsibility.
Mr. McAdams said he was looking for someone he could support, but also said he was looking for someone who understood a congressional district like his own, which the president carried by 7 percentage points in 2016.
About a week later, he endorsed Mr. Bloomberg.

Jane Cline has been bombarded by political texts from different Democratic 2020 presidential campaigns. She doesn't recall signing up for any of them.
Americans, particularly in early nominating and battleground states, are already receiving millions of texts from Democratic and Republican political campaigns, with fundraising messages and calls to action regularly lighting up their smartphone screens.
Ms. Cline, a 58-year-old retiree, hasn't responded to any of the messages she's received out of fear she will just get more. ""I don't like them,"" she said in January at an Ames, Iowa, event for Joe Biden ahead of the state's caucuses. ""I guess it's just replacing the telemarketer on the phone.""
Political texts have grown increasingly important as some campaigns pulled back from digital advertising after certain technology platforms such as Twitter and Google changed their policies. The text messages capture voter attention more effectively than emails, mailers or calls, advocacy groups and campaign organizers say.
Many campaigns scrape data, including voter registration files, event attendee lists or survey respondent records for reams of phone numbers that belong to individuals likely to be interested in their messages, whether or not those people have explicitly agreed to receive texts. In late January, the Democratic National Committee said it purchased tens of millions of cellphone numbers to better reach voters.
Within the complex plumbing that delivers those political text messages, however, texting service providers, wireless carriers and consumer advocates are divided over what permission, if any, is necessary, to ping a voter. There are no federal guidelines clarifying whether these messages require consent.
In the 2018 midterm election, Democratic campaigns and politically adjacent organizations sent 350 million text messages through the two largest left-leaning political texting companies, Hustle and GetThru, according to an analysis by progressive nonprofit Tech for Campaigns.
President Trump's re-election campaign has been reaching out to people through texts and is expected to send hundreds of millions of messages leading up to the November election, people familiar with the efforts said.
Democratic presidential contenders, including those who have dropped out of the race, have already sent at least tens of millions of texts, campaign aides said. Michael Bloomberg's campaign is hiring workers in California to post on social media and send text messages to their friends about him, The Wall Street Journal has reported.
Political texting firms serving presidential campaigns have for months built strategies to reach voters or potential supporters through what they describe as peer-to-peer texting, in which messages are sent manually to individual voters. Those messages are usually sent by volunteers or political staffers holding smartphones, and at times by workers at desktop computers hired by campaigns to broaden their reach.
Many messages are prewritten, though certain details like names can be customized. They typically focus on organizing supporters, asking for money or sharing event information. As it gets closer to the election, they will turn toward getting out the vote.
""This isn't Nike trying to sell people shoes or Ray-Ban trying to sell people sunglasses,"" said Daniel Souweine, founder and chief executive GetThru, which is working with Democratic campaigns. ""This is political campaigns of all stripes reaching out, up and down the ballot.""
At the heart of the brewing conflict is whether political text messages are, in fact, peer-to-peer messages, or if they involve automation that makes them subject to a telephone consumer protection law that requires explicit consent from recipients and can lead to stiff financial penalties for violations.
Political campaigns and the technology firms that help them distribute messages say text messages are peer-to-peer because a human manually hits send. Consumer advocates say many political texts rely on systems that can be used to make robocalls and are therefore subject to the federal law.
Verizon Communications Inc. asks political campaigns to use a text message distribution system that requires consumer consent. Verizon says messages sent through other channels risk getting flagged as spam. ""We're trying to make sure that text messaging doesn't go the way of out-of-control robocalling,"" said Tamara Preiss, vice president of federal regulatory affairs.
AT&T Inc. doesn't want to risk blocking political messages. The carrier is working on a code that would let them all go through, people familiar with the matter said. A spokesman for the carrier referred queries to the CTIA industry group, whose best practices state political organizations should secure consumers' consent before they start sending messages.
Matt Gerst, vice president of regulatory affairs at the CTIA, said it wants to balance emerging communications channels with consumer protection. ""Our experiences with robocalling and emailing led us to this place,"" he said.
Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google allow most mobile phone users to filter spam texts.
Autodialed texts aren't allowed without prior express consent, according to the Federal Communications Commission. But the regulator and Congress have stopped short of defining what constitutes an auto-dialer. Courts have issued differing opinions on the matter.
An FCC spokesman said the agency is still reviewing whether peer-to-peer messages are subject to the federal law governing contact with mobile phones.
California in January started requiring more disclosure in text messages, including whether they are sent from paid staff.
RumbleUp, which works with Republican and center-right political campaigns and groups, added to its platform an explainer of the rule and a template with proper disclosures for text messages sent to California area codes, said Thomas Peters, who leads the texting firm. It is in the process of adding one for relevant ZIP Codes.
Florida resident Shehan Wijesinha sued antiabortion group Susan B. Anthony List Inc. in July 2018 after he received a text message from the organization about President Trump's Supreme Court selection. Mr. Wijesinha said he hadn't provided the group with consent and reached a class-action settlement with the group.
A spokeswoman for Susan B. Anthony List said the organization denied wrongdoing and settled to avoid expensive and drawn-out litigation. It agreed to pay $5 to each member of the settlement class who submitted timely and valid claims with a cap of around $1 million, and said it received $20,055 in claims.

Betting markets show Hillary Clinton is one of the top contenders in the race for the Democratic nominee.
She isn't running for president.
Prediction markets have become a popular, though not necessarily reliable, way for people to bet on political results. While notoriously volatile and often proven wrong, betting markets are drawing extra scrutiny ahead of this week's Super Tuesday contests.
Consider PredictIt, an online market run by New Zealand's Victoria University of Wellington. Offering a range of election and other political bets, PredictIt currently shows a bettor can pay 7 cents to win $1 if Mrs. Clinton wins the Democratic nomination. Those are the fourth-best odds of any nominee, better than those of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
Perhaps the prediction markets know something others don't, but Mrs. Clinton isn't a candidate. (A PredictIt spokesman said Mrs. Clinton's odds were likely a reflection of ""trader long-shot bias"" and the possibility of a brokered convention, among other factors.)
Other metrics also show extremes that don't mesh with what more traditional political polls show. Bettors at one point on PredictIt last month gave former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg a 33% chance of winning the nomination.
Those odds—which placed him in second place at the time and came on some of the heaviest volume PredictIt has logged over the past 90 days—were also far higher than the probabilities he garnered in other political polls.
The 2020 presidential election campaign has largely been a secondary factor driving recent financial-market performance. Stocks are coming off their
worst week since the financial crisis
on fears of how the spreading coronavirus, or Covid-19, could crimp the global economy and corporate profits.
Yet some investors also are trying to decipher what the Super Tuesday outcomes could mean for markets, particularly as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders appears to be moving closer to securing the nomination.
Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, said the markets' recent swoon was driven by ""rising Covid-19 fears, and, to a lesser extent, Bernie Sanders' strong momentum.""
Mixing politics and portfolios has historically had a mixed record. The conventional wisdom heading into the 2016 presidential election was a Donald Trump victory would prompt stocks to go down. Betting markets played down then-candidate Trump's chances. Of course, the opposite played out.
Goldman Sachs analysts said prediction markets suggest a divided federal government is the most probable election outcome, one that could lead to additional uncertainty if corporate tax reform implemented under President Trump is reversed. Under that scenario, Goldman said, ""the impact on S&P 500 profits would be significant.""
The firm is no longer expecting U.S. companies to post any earnings growth in 2020. It expects exporters will register falling demand and companies will suffer from supply-chain disruptions as a result of the spreading coronavirus outbreak, which could pose widespread disruptions on people's everyday lives and business activity and imperil the U.S. economy's longest expansion on record.
""An economic slowdown caused by this virus certainly increases Bernie's chances,"" said Dave Lutz, managing director and head of ETF trading at JonesTrading.
The thinking is a struggling economy, or even a recession, could hurt Mr. Trump's odds at being re-elected, paving the way for whoever becomes the Democratic nominee. PredictIt shows Mr. Sanders has a greater-than-50% chance of securing the nomination, but only a 31% chance of beating President Trump in the election.
One indicator Goldman Sachs analysts are watching is second-quarter gross domestic product growth. Historically, this has been one of the most important metrics to watch in gauging a sitting U.S. president's re-election probability.
""If Covid-19 becomes widespread and leads to a slowdown in U.S. growth or a recession, it could alter current expected election outcomes,"" Goldman said.

Three weeks
before the Iowa caucuses
, Democratic presidential candidates would typically be blitzing the state with a final appeal to undecided voters.
Instead, several contenders are drawing up plans to lean on surrogates and television ads while they spend much of the final stretch before the caucuses as jurors in the Senate's impeachment trial of President Trump.
The House voted Wednesday to transmit articles of
impeachment to the Senate
, paving the way for the long-anticipated trial in the upper chamber to begin next week.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you think the impeachment trial will reflect on the senators running for the presidency? Join the conversation below.
Four senators seeking the Democratic nomination—including front-runners Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren—will come to Washington to deliberate on whether to remove Mr. Trump from office. How long the trial will last remains to be seen.
""If people decide they want to call witnesses, it probably could go on for a while,"" South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said on Tuesday. He said that wrapping up the trial by President Trump's State of the Union address on Feb. 4—the day after the Iowa caucuses—""seems like a fairly tight deadline given what we are facing.""
The trial is likely to disrupt the senators' campaigning before and potentially beyond the caucuses in Iowa, where former Vice President Joe Biden and former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg are locked in a dead heat with Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren.
""It's uncharted territory,"" said Joe Lockhart, a former White House press secretary to President Bill Clinton. ""You'd rather be in Iowa over the next few weeks than sitting on your hands in the U.S. Senate, unable to speak.""
Aides to Mr. Sanders said that while he is off the campaign trail, they will rely on surrogates, including a trio of freshman lawmakers—Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan—regarded as rising stars within the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. Sanders aides also said they are confident he is well-known in Iowa, because of his 2016 White House bid and a robust operation in the state.
An aide to Ms. Warren said the senator is dispatching all three of her campaign co-chairwomen—Reps. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts; Katie Porter of California, who is an Iowa native; and Deb Haaland of New Mexico—to Iowa over the coming weeks.
Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota will hold tele-town halls while she is in Washington and will send surrogates to Iowa, including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz; Ms. Klobuchar's husband, John Bessler; and her daughter, Abigail Klobuchar Bessler, a campaign aide said.
Still, a protracted break from the campaign trail poses risks in a tight race. Last week, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker cited the looming impeachment trial as part of his decision to drop out of the race.
""Between you and me, I'd rather be here in Iowa,"" Mr. Sanders said at a rally in Davenport, Iowa, on Saturday. ""But I have a constitutional responsibility, which I accept as a United States senator, to be a juror in Trump's impeachment trial. So I'll be there.""
Ms. Warren struck a similar tone in Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate in Des Moines.
""Some things are more important than politics,"" she said. ""If we have an impeachment trial, I will be there, because it is my responsibility.""
The timing could be difficult for Ms. Klobuchar, who has been counting on a strong showing in Iowa. Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, who has struggled to break through with voters, will also be called off the campaign trail.
Although the Senate has yet to agree on a process for impeachment proceedings, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) has said he intends to model the trial after that of President Bill Clinton in 1999. That trial, which resulted in Mr. Clinton's acquittal, lasted roughly five weeks and required senators to convene six days a week.
Whereas the House impeachment inquiry allowed members to question witnesses, resulting in dramatic televised hearings, the senators are expected to sit quietly in the chamber as House impeachment managers and Mr. Trump's lawyers make their arguments.
The absence of the senators could provide an opportunity for Messrs. Biden and Buttigieg to capitalize on face time with voters.
""I will leave it to the analysts to figure out the political impacts,"" Mr. Buttigieg told reporters on Wednesday in Newton, Iowa. ""What I know is that we're going to use every moment available to us to continue making the case and to continue listening to voters, as we are here, sharing, learning stories, sharing our priorities and building momentum.""
Mr. Biden's aides have said the proceedings bolster his argument that he is the candidate the president most fears. Mr. Trump's impeachment stems in part from his attempts to
pressure Ukraine to investigate
Mr. Biden's son's work there.
""This election on the Democratic side has been defined by voters' overriding desire to have a candidate who can beat Donald Trump,"" said Andrew Bates, a spokesman for Mr. Biden's campaign. ""Impeachment itself always serves as a reminder of how Trump has shown us all who he is most threatened by as a candidate.""
Mr. Biden's campaign released a new ad this week, airing in Iowa's top four media markets, asking why Mr. Trump was ""obsessed"" with the former vice president.
It remains to be seen whether voters will be moved by impeachment in a primary that has largely centered on health care and economic issues. Although a majority of Democratic primary voters support impeachment, a December
Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll
found they were split on whether the party should focus its efforts on building the case for Mr. Trump's removal from office or defeating him at the ballot box.
Ellen Graber, a 68-year-old retired human resources director from Newton, Iowa, said she doesn't think the trial will affect the campaign much, because most of the candidates will still be visible through advertising and media appearances.
""We're bombarded with commercials from the minute we get up until we go to bed,"" she said.
Ms. Graber said she doesn't expect to watch the trial very closely because she's convinced the president won't be removed from office by the Senate.
""We'll just have to vote him out,"" she said.
Eliza Collins, Joshua Jamerson and Chad Day in Washington and John McCormick in Newton, Iowa, contributed to this article.

WASHINGTON -- With his anticipated acquittal in his impeachment trial a day away, President Trump used his annual State of the Union address Tuesday to paint an optimistic picture of the country's future and tout the strong economy nine months before Election Day.
""In just three short years, we have shattered the mentality of American decline and we have rejected the downsizing of America's destiny,"" Mr. Trump said in the House chamber. ""We are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never going back.""
Mr. Trump entered the House chamber just after 9 p.m. to sustained applause, shaking hands and pausing for a moment to speak with Chief Justice John Roberts, who has been presiding over the impeachment trial.
From there, the deep partisanship that has marked Mr. Trump's presidency was on full display. The president handed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) a copy of his remarks, but turned away without shaking her hand as she extended it. Mr. Trump and Mrs. Pelosi haven't spoken in months; tension over impeachment has frayed their relationship. Moments later, Republicans began chanting, ""Four more years!""
During the speech, Republicans repeatedly jumped to their feet and cheered, and Democrats sat stone-faced, standing rarely. A few Democrats walked out of the State of the Union speech early. At the end of the address, Mrs. Pelosi tore the president's speech in half.
Asked by reporters why she ripped up the speech, Mrs. Pelosi said, ""Because it was a manifesto of mistruths.""
In a one-hour, 18-minute address punctuated by made-for-TV moments, from Mr. Trump presenting a school-age girl with a scholarship to a surprise appearance by a service member returning from his overseas deployment, the president's remarks focused squarely on the economy.
He ticked through a litany of statistics designed to drive home his core message that he is the lead architect of the nation's economic boom. ""If we hadn't reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would now not be witnessing this great economic success,"" he said.
With acquittal in the Senate on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress charges expected Wednesday, the speech came at a moment when the president is feeling triumphant, according to people close to him. He spent part of the day Tuesday reveling in the chaos in Iowa over counting the results of the Democratic caucuses.
The impeachment trial -- which Mr. Trump didn't directly address in his speech -- doesn't appear to have moved his approval ratings. Mr. Trump's job approval in the most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll late last month stood at 46%, with 51% disapproving, in line with results throughout his presidency.
The president told television anchors during an off-the-record lunch at the White House Tuesday afternoon that he planned to address impeachment in more detail later this week, according to people familiar with the matter. After Bill Clinton in 1999, he was the second president to deliver a State of the Union address during his impeachment trial.
House and Senate lawmakers, as well as Supreme Court justices and the president's cabinet, attended the address. The top Democratic candidates -- including Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts -- weren't in the audience. Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren were in New Hampshire for campaign events Tuesday. Several House Democrats boycotted the speech.
The theme of the speech, ""The Great American Comeback,"" echoed the core message of Mr. Trump's recent remarks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where the president cast himself as crucial to the success of the U.S. economy.
As he did in his remarks in Davos, Mr. Trump touted what he called a ""blue-collar boom,"" part of an effort to highlight how his policies are helping the middle class, aides said. The president also trumpeted the economic effects of a pair of recent trade agreements: the newly approved U.S.-Mexico-Canada deal and a ""phase one"" deal with China.
""Many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace Nafta -- only to do absolutely nothing. But unlike so many who came before me, I keep my promises,"" he said.
Mr. Trump also highlighted immigration, an issue that animates his supporters, by giving an update on his efforts to build a wall along the border with Mexico.
The issue of health care presented Mr. Trump with an opening to criticize his Democratic opponents. ""To those watching at home tonight, I want you to know: We will never let socialism destroy American health care,"" Mr. Trump said.
When Mr. Trump said there are those who want to take away people's doctors and abolish private insurance, Democrats shouted, ""Who? Who?""
Drew Hammill, the deputy chief of staff to Mrs. Pelosi, said Mr. Trump hasn't lived up to his promises to make health care affordable and lower prescription-drug prices.
The president called on Congress to approve legislation implementing his vision on health care, school choice and other issues. Bitterly divided and with the election later this year, Congress is unlikely to pass major legislation before November.
On foreign policy, Mr. Trump vowed to oust Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro. The administration has been seeking his removal for more than a year without success.
""Maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people. But Maduro's grip of tyranny will be smashed and broken,"" the president said, pointing to Venezuela opposition leader Juan Guaido, who attended the address.
Mr. Trump praised conservative talk radio host Rush Limbaugh, who attended the speech after revealing on Monday he is being treated for advanced lung cancer. First lady Melania Trump presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom during the speech.
Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer gave the Democratic response to the speech, saying that people were being left behind in Mr. Trump's economy.
""It doesn't matter what the president says about the stock market,"" she said. ""What matters is that millions of people struggle to get by or don't have enough money at the end of the month after paying for transportation, student loans, or prescription drugs.""

WASHINGTON -- President Trump endorsed former football coach Tommy Tuberville in the runoff to be the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama, throwing his influence behind the opponent of his former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who is trying to win back his old seat.
""Tommy was a terrific head football coach at Auburn University,"" Mr. Trump wrote in tweets late Tuesday. ""He is a REAL LEADER who will never let MAGA/KAG, or our Country, down! . . . Coach Tommy Tuberville, a winner, has my Complete and Total Endorsement,"" Mr. Trump tweeted.
Mr. Tuberville and Mr. Sessions emerged from a Republican primary this month to compete in a runoff election on March 31. Mr. Tuberville won the primary by a few points.
The endorsement could be decisive in the race, which has largely become a contest about supporting the president. Mr. Trump won Alabama by 28 percentage points in 2016.
The winner will face Democratic incumbent Sen. Doug Jones in November. While Mr. Jones has raised more funds than both candidates, Republicans see the primary as the real obstacle. Mr. Jones won a 2017 special election by just 2 percentage points after the Republican nominee was accused by several women of sexual misconduct that they say occurred when they were underage.
Mr. Sessions formerly served in the Senate and was one of Mr. Trump's early backers in the 2016 campaign. He was then picked to serve as attorney general but angered the president by recusing himself from the probe into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential election and any ties between Russia and Mr. Trump's campaign.
Mr. Trump needled Mr. Sessions repeatedly in tweets during his tumultuous time in the administration, forced him to resign in 2018 and later said appointing him was his ""biggest mistake.""
Mr. Tuberville, a native of Arkansas, has faced attacks from Mr. Sessions that he isn't Alabamian enough to represent the state.

Lawmakers continued to joust Sunday over the structure of the Senate trial of President Trump, including whether to allow new witnesses and evidence.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) hasn't outlined publicly how the trial will be structured. But Sen. David Perdue (R., Ga.), said Sunday on NBC the plan would allot two days for House impeachment managers to present their case, a matching amount of time for Mr. Trump's lawyers to rebut and 16 hours for senators' questions submitted in writing to Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial.
Mr. Perdue said Democrats declined to negotiate the structure of the trial without first resolving the issue of witnesses, leading Mr. McConnell to schedule a Tuesday vote on his plan.
The House approved two articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump last month. The first article of impeachment stems from Mr. Trump pressing Ukraine to investigate Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden, including by withholding almost $400 million in aid to help Kyiv combat Russian aggression. The second article accuses Mr. Trump of impeding the congressional investigation by preventing witnesses from testifying and defying subpoenas for documentary evidence.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How are you feeling about the impeachment of President Trump? Join the conversation below.
While some GOP senators have said they would be open to hearing new witnesses, Senate Republicans agree a vote on witnesses should be delayed until after the trial begins, according to people familiar with the plans.
Republicans defended Mr. McConnell's approach, while Democrats renewed their calls to allow new witnesses and documents.
Democrats have said they want to hear from former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who were directed by the White House not to testify during the House inquiry.
""I don't know how you justify not calling witnesses and introducing new information if it's related to this trial,"" Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) said on CNN.
Mr. Brown said he would consider hearing from Lev Parnas, an associate of Rudy Giuliani currently under indictment on campaign-finance charges. Mr. Parnas has broadly tied Mr. Trump to efforts by himself, Mr. Giuliani, and others to press Ukrainian officials to announce an investigation into the Bidens.
Mr. Brown also said it would be ""fine"" if Hunter Biden were called as a witness, a proposal often put forward by Republican lawmakers. Mr. Trump has alleged that Hunter Biden's appointment to the board of a Ukrainian energy company while his father was vice president amounted to a corrupt arrangement. The Bidens have denied wrongdoing.
""It's not negotiable whether you have witnesses,"" Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.), one of seven House impeachment managers, said on CBS. ""Any Republican senator who says there should be no witnesses or even that witnesses should be negotiated is part of the coverup.""
Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.) faulted the House for presenting ""a weak hand.""
""They're wanting us in the Senate to open the case up and…re-try their stuff"" through new witnesses and documents, Mr. Shelby told ABC.
Mr. McConnell has said that Mr. Trump's trial would be similar to the procedures adopted for then-President Bill Clinton's 1999 impeachment hearing. However, Mr. McConnell's plan would condense 48 hours of arguments from eight days to four, leading Democratic lawmakers to fear that Mr. McConnell is attempting to fast-track the trial.
Mr. McConnell would need a simple majority of the Senate to pass rules for the trial, and with 53 Republican senators, he doesn't need bipartisan support.
Senators act as jurors in the trial.
The president denies the accusations and says the transcripts from calls with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky show he did nothing wrong.
The Democrats' 111-page document, filed on Saturday, outlines the case House impeachment managers plan to present.
The president's legal team, in a response posted Saturday, called the House impeachment articles ""a brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election and interfere with the 2020 election"" and said the articles fail to allege any crime or violation.
Democrats counter that impeachment doesn't have to include a crime, and say abuse of power is an impeachable offense, according to an aide working on the inquiry.

PEACH COUNTY, Ga. -- Garrett Milton rarely talks politics these days. All the voters in this rural community already have made up their minds, he says.
""It's like the Bible, two people can read it but you aren't going to have the same view,"" said Mr. Milton, 61 years old, who owns a hair salon in the county's predominantly African-American Fort Valley.
Even as the coronavirus pandemic reshapes the nation's outlook and economy, President Trump is expected to do well in rural America this fall. But the margin of turnout in Peach County and places like it in Georgia, North Carolina and elsewhere -- joined with votes from urban and suburban areas -- could shape whether Democrats have a chance to win in the Deep South.
In Georgia, Democrats are ratcheting up efforts to reach rural voters after recent elections have shown that it isn't enough for the party to win Atlanta and its suburbs without also picking up rural support. The key to victory here isn't persuading the unconvinced, but turning out the base. And as in much of the rural South, the parties' bases tend to group along racial lines, with most African-Americans voting Democratic and most whites voting Republican.
This agricultural area in central Georgia, two hours southeast of Atlanta, is evenly split between Democrats and Republicans. That divide is most clearly seen in its two main towns: Byron and Fort Valley.
Republicans here, many living in and around the city of Byron, say the economy improved under President Trump and are eager to have him back for another term. Democrats, most of whom live in and around Fort Valley, say a majority of the jobs offered these days are low-paying with fewer benefits. They also worry that excitement for their candidates is lacking.
Both parties will be trying to track down every possible Peach County voter they know will support them, using phone banks, canvassing and other efforts. But the Republicans have a much better get-out-the-vote effort in rural counties, with stronger party networks and more activists than Democrats, said Chris Grant, a political-science professor at Mercer University in nearby Macon.
""When Barack Obama has not been on the top of the ticket, there has been a problem getting African-Americans to the polls,"" Mr. Grant said. ""It's Trump's county to lose. He can lose it, but it depends on a really strong effort by Democrats to get people out.""
Peach County was one of 206 counties across the country -- and 19 in the Deep South -- that favored Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, before flipping for Mr. Trump in 2016, according to the nonpartisan Ballotpedia.com, which tracks election data. But Mr. Trump's margin of victory was much smaller in Peach than other counties: Just under 3%, compared with an average of 11.45%.
Any moderation in rural Southern Republican voters or increase in their Democratic peers could prove critical in increasingly competitive states such as North Carolina and Georgia. In 2016, Mr. Trump lost metro Atlanta -- which now constitutes well over half of the state's population -- but made up for it with a big uptick in rural Georgia, winning about 90,000 more votes there than Utah Sen. Mitt Romney did in 2012.
Metro Atlanta is ""the base of the base"" of the Democratic Party, ""but you win elections on the margins,"" said Nikema Williams, a state senator and chairwoman of the Georgia Democratic Party. This election season, the party has been holding fundraisers and other meetings in rural parts of the state and is campaigning more aggressively on issues like rural health care and the impact of proposed state budget cuts on services, she said.
The state GOP didn't respond to requests to comment.
Bobby Vinson, a 55-year-old Byron resident who runs an excavation business, said he and his friends plan to back Mr. Trump even more enthusiastically than they did in 2016 because of the president's efforts to reduce regulations for businesses, fight for better trade deals, combat illegal immigration and challenge entrenched interests in Washington.
Shanita Bryant, 43, a Democratic county commissioner from Fort Valley, said getting Democratic voters excited will be hard because many are struggling and aren't focused on politics. ""What we are fighting in Peach County is apathy,"" she said.
Political discussions that do take place at meetings or on social media tend to be nasty, said Wade Yoder, 50, an at-large Republican county commissioner who has a business in Fort Valley. ""Between Republicans and Democrats, it is pretty tough down here and I hate it,"" he said. ""It's very, very partisan, and the elections, seesawing is the best description. It seesaws back and forth.""

The Trump administration's decision to order an airstrike that killed an Iranian general injected a new focus on foreign policy in the Democratic presidential campaign, as the field accused President Trump of engaging in a reckless move that would escalate tensions in the Middle East.
The
U.S. airstrike near Baghdad's airport
that killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani and several of his associates brought condemnation from 2020 Democratic candidates, who warned that Mr. Trump's move could pull the U.S. into an unplanned war with Iran, which has threatened retaliation.
""We could be on the brink of a new kind of conflict in the Middle East,"" said former Vice President Joe Biden during a campaign event in Dubuque, Iowa. In somber remarks, he warned that the Trump administration had increased the risk of nuclear proliferation and the potential for Islamic State to regenerate in the Middle East, and questioned whether the administration had a strategy to de-escalate tensions.
Foreign policy has played a limited role in the Democratic nomination contest so far, which has been driven by health care, climate change and the economic plight of middle-class workers. But the airstrikes elevated the issue of America's standing around the globe, giving Democrats an opening to accuse Mr. Trump of undercutting alliances—and to distance themselves from Democratic polling leader Mr. Biden over his past role in deepening U.S. involvement in the Middle East.
""This is a dangerous escalation that brings us closer to another disastrous war in the Middle East which could cost countless lives and trillions more dollars and lead to even more death, more conflict, more displacement in what is already a highly volatile region of the world,"" Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told supporters at a campaign event in Anamosa, Iowa, on Friday.
Mr. Sanders, who referred to Soleimani's killing as an ""assassination,"" also continued to emphasize his opposition to the Iraq war as a member of the House.
""Instead of provoking more volatility in the region, the United States must use its power, its wealth and its influence to bring the regional powers to the table to resolve conflicts,"" he said.
In Iowa, non-interventionist sentiment has previously played a decisive role in the leadoff presidential caucuses. As a candidate in 2008, Barack Obama successfully used his opposition to the Iraq war to draw a contrast with Hillary Clinton, who had voted in favor of authorizing the war.
Mr. Biden, who traveled to more than 50 countries while serving under President Obama, said Friday that Soleimani deserved ""to be brought to justice."" But even as he questioned the administration's approach to Iran, he said he was ""not passing judgment,"" urging the President Trump to ""listen to his commanders.""
""I hope this administration, I pray this administration, has thought through the second and third order of consequences of what they have chosen. American lives and global stability are at risk,"" Mr. Biden said.
The fresh focus on the Middle East could allow Mr. Biden to emphasize his foreign-policy experience. He often notes that he developed relationships with every major world leader during his lengthy Senate career, where he served as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and as vice president.
As he was addressing supporters in Dubuque, Mr. Biden's campaign sought to raise money off the international developments, telling supporters in a fundraising email: ""It's more clear than ever that we need strong, steady, experienced leadership. The stakes for getting this nomination wrong couldn't be higher.""
Mr. Biden's rivals have questioned the former vice president's judgment on foreign policy, pointing to his 2002 vote in support of the Iraq war authorization as a Delaware senator.
Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg said last week the decision to invade Iraq was ""the worst foreign-policy decision made by the United States in my lifetime.""
""As we learn more in the coming days and weeks, one thing is clear: This must not be the start of another endless war,"" Mr. Buttigieg, who served in Afghanistan as a Naval intelligence officer, said Friday. ""We must act wisely and deliberately, not capriciously or through Twitter. The consequences are grave, as anyone who has served in uniform understands all too well.""
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is vying with Mr. Sanders for support from the party's liberal wing, said the ""reckless move"" by the Trump administration would increase the possibility of a new Middle East conflict. ""Our priority must be to avoid another costly war,"" she said on Twitter.
Mr. Sanders suggested recently that Mr. Biden's past support for the Iraq War could hurt his chances in a general election against the president. During a Friday stop at his Cedar Rapids, Iowa, campaign office, Mr. Biden deflected a question about Mr. Sanders's foreign policy judgment. ""You're not going to get me in a fight with Bernie. Bernie's got enough baggage,"" Mr. Biden told reporters.
Democrats contend that relations with Iran have deteriorated since Mr. Trump's decision in May 2018 to
withdraw the U.S. from the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement
with world powers, and they have vowed to renegotiate and strengthen the pact if Tehran is willing to return to compliance.
But some experts suggested it was no longer feasible for Democrats to simply argue that the next president could renegotiate the Iran deal.
""We're going to be back where we were at the beginning of the Iran negotiations,"" said Ben Rhodes, a top national-security adviser to Mr. Obama. ""This now introduces the unknown: What is the nature of the conflict between the U.S. and Iran a year from now? What is the nature of the Iranian nuclear program a year from now?""
""I don't think Democrats should assume that Americans are just going to understand how dangerous this is,"" he added. ""You have to make the case to them, you have to lay it out for them.""
Thus far, Democratic candidates have largely pushed for a diplomatic approach to dealing with Tehran and emphasized de-escalation.
Kelly Magsamen, vice president for national security and international policy at the Center for American Progress, said Mr. Trump's latest provocations toward Iran had provided Democrats with a fresh opportunity to reframe the debate around national security.
""The Democrats are in a very strong position to make the case that President Trump and his policies are making America less safe and that they are putting us back on a path to greater conflict in the Middle East, which the American public has repeatedly demonstrated it is not interested in,"" she said.
A
Gallup survey conducted in August
found that a majority of Americans favored economic and diplomatic efforts to curtail Iran's nuclear program, as opposed to military action.
Michael O'Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said it was too soon to assess how Mr. Trump's actions would register with the American public. If Tehran's response was to escalate tensions, Mr. O'Hanlon said, then ""all bets are off as to how this is seen by an American public.""
Kay Brimeyer, a retired elementary-school teacher who attended Mr. Biden's event in Dubuque, said the increased focus on foreign policy had made her firm in her decision to back Mr. Biden after considering other candidates, such as Mr. Buttigieg.
""We need someone to get in there who knows the leaders. There's no time to be teaching somebody to do that,"" Ms. Brimeyer said. ""Experience matters now.""

Democratic presidential candidates are debating in Charleston, S.C., as the rivals of Bernie Sanders are expected to challenge the early front-runner prior to Saturday's South Carolina primary and next week's delegate-rich Super Tuesday contests.
The Vermont senator's
massive win in Nevada
last week cemented him as
the front-runner
in the Democratic presidential race and added to
the concerns of moderates
in his party who don't agree with some of his policies and fear nominating a self-described democratic socialist would be a mistake.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Which candidate has the most to win or lose from their debate performance? Why? Join the conversation below.
Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg—who is second in the delegate hunt—former Vice President Joe Biden, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar,
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren
and billionaire activist Tom Steyer are all hoping a strong performance on stage will give them a boost in the South Carolina primary and the 14 states that vote on March 3, known as Super Tuesday.
Meanwhile, former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg is hoping to redeem himself after
a lackluster debate performance
last week. Mr. Bloomberg isn't competing in South Carolina and is hoping that about half a billion dollars
he has put into
TV, radio and digital advertising will help make him moderate Democrats' consensus choice to take on Mr. Sanders.

Dan Kanninen, states director for Mr. Bloomberg's campaign, said Monday that his team believes this debate will have to be centered on one candidate who is ""on pace to amass an insurmountable delegate lead,"" referring to Mr. Sanders.
Some candidates have previewed that they will go after the lawmaker for calling himself a democratic socialist, portraying it as a tag that could hurt not only him in a general election but bring down other Democrats running for office, too.
A recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed
Mr. Sanders leading
President Trump in a hypothetical matchup. But Mr. Trump's team
has already been trying
to tie Democrats to socialism, particularly in appeals to Venezuelan and Cuban Americans in Florida.
Rivals are also likely to seize on comments Mr. Sanders made in a ""60 Minutes"" interview Sunday, in which he defended past positive comments about communist Cuban leader Fidel Castro's literacy program.
Mr. Sanders continued to defend his views in a CNN town hall Monday, saying: ""I think teaching people to read and write is a good thing. I have been extremely consistent and critical of all authoritarian regimes all over the world, including Cuba.""
Mr. Buttigieg said during a CNN town hall that he didn't think Democrats wanted to explain ""why our nominee is encouraging people to look on the bright side of the Castro regime when we're going into the election of our lives. We need to stand unequivocally against dictatorships everywhere in the world.""
Mr. Biden, who has campaigned with Democrats who won seats in 2018 that were previously held by Republicans, has said that Mr. Sanders will make it difficult for those candidates to be re-elected.
Mr. Biden is jostling with Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Klobuchar for the support of moderate Democrats. The former vice president has seen his comfortable lead in South Carolina dwindle in recent polls, and
he needs to do well
in the state to prove he can build the diverse coalition he has promised would propel him to the White House. A lackluster performance Tuesday could hurt his chances at winning and further boost Mr. Sanders. Mr. Steyer has also concentrated resources on the state and will be looking to make an impact.
Mr. Bloomberg is likely to encounter scrutiny after being the center of attention in the last debate. He has stayed out of the public eye preparing for this gathering. Last week in Las Vegas, Ms. Warren grilled him over the number of nondisclosure agreements he had signed with women who made accusations about his behavior in lawsuits against Bloomberg LP. Mr. Bloomberg later said that
he was releasing
three former employees from their NDAs.
Ms. Warren appears to be ready to attack him again. On Tuesday morning, her campaign released a new ad highlighting Mr. Bloomberg's support for her Republican opponent during her 2012 Senate campaign.

TEL AVIV -- President Trump said Thursday he likely would make public his administration's long-delayed plan for peace in the Middle East before a visit to Washington next week by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main political rival, Benny Gantz.
The two Israeli political leaders accepted a U.S. invitation to discuss the peace plan during a visit to Jerusalem by Vice President Mike Pence.
Mr. Trump said he also has spoken briefly to the Palestinians, and said U.S. officials would speak further to them. Mr. Trump has taken a series of steps during his administration considered favorable to the Israelis, including recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, slashing bilateral assistance to the Palestinians and backing Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.
""I'm sure they [Palestinians] maybe will react negatively at first but it's actually very positive for them,"" Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Florida.
Mr. Trump and others on his team have committed to time frames to release the plan before, only later to back away from them. Palestinian officials had cut off all contact with the Trump administration in late 2017, when Mr. Trump said he would move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem.
The White House is considering making its peace plan public before Israel's March vote to try to get ahead of the U.S. election season and as political support in Israel grows for the release of the political blueprint.
The White House wouldn't say whether it invited Palestinian officials, but they are not expected to attend.
""This step only reaffirms our absolute rejection of what the U.S. administration has done so far,"" said Husam Zomlot, who was the Palestinians' ambassador to Washington before the U.S. closed the Palestinian mission in 2018. He is now the ambassador to the U.K.
In Jerusalem, Mr. Pence said Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz accepted President Trump's invitation.
The White House formally announced the visit shortly after. The visit, on Jan. 28, is the same day Israel's parliament will begin the process of forming a panel that will debate Mr. Netanyahu's request for immunity from charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. The charges stem from allegations he traded official favors for flattering news coverage, as well as gifts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
If the panel is formed before the March vote, as is expected, Mr. Netanyahu likely will see his immunity request denied, though his Likud party is trying to delay the process.
Mr. Trump's Mideast peace team, headed by his son-in-law Jared Kushner, is concerned that the window before Israel's ballot could be the last opportunity to release the blueprint before the U.S. election season, according to people familiar with the matter.
The coming vote in Israel might again be inconclusive, followed by months more of political wrangling to set up an Israeli government.
Mr. Netanyahu failed after April and September elections to form a governing coalition, and Israel faces an unprecedented third vote in less than a year as the political deadlock continues. He remains the head of a caretaker government during the impasse.
Mr. Netanyahu has welcomed the U.S. plan, describing it as an opportunity for Israel to annex parts of the West Bank under a supportive administration in Washington. Mr. Gantz also has warmed to having the plan released before the election.
Mr. Trump tapped Mr. Kushner to work on the Mideast peace plan in 2016, before taking office, and the administration has repeatedly delayed its release.
Administration officials presented a Mideast economic plan in Bahrain in June, but it was seen as impossible to implement without a political component and none of the promised follow-up summits to sign off on the document have been held.
U.S. officials have maintained a close hold on the political portion of the document. More than 50 pages long, it envisions that no Israelis or Palestinians in the West Bank will leave their homes and it would move Israel's border east of the internationally accepted Green Line with the West Bank, U.S. officials have said.
That, veteran peace negotiators say, indicates the Trump plan is likely a sharp departure from past efforts that left many of the sensitive details -- such as the final status of Jerusalem and security arrangements -- for later talks and envisioned land swaps to resolve one of the key issues of the conflict: precise borders and what will be done with Israeli settlements.

Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman arrived to testify before the House Intelligence Committee in November. PHOTO: Al Drago for The Wall Street Journal
WASHINGTON—Two central witnesses in the probe of President Trump's actions regarding Ukraine were removed from their posts Friday, two days after Mr. Trump was
acquitted in the Senate
impeachment trial.
Late Friday, Gordon Sondland said Mr. Trump ordered him removed from his post as U.S. ambassador to the European Union, effective immediately. Mr. Sondland gave some of the most-high-profile testimony in the impeachment inquiry. He told House lawmakers that he had urged Ukraine to announce investigations that would benefit the president politically in this year's election and that his actions were
""at the express direction""
of Mr. Trump.
Earlier, Army Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, a National Security Council official who
voiced concerns
about Mr. Trump's July phone call with Ukraine's leader, was removed from his White House post and escorted off the grounds.
Democrats said Mr. Sondland's account backed up the central issue in the impeachment inquiry. Republicans questioned his memory and truthfulness and said he was overstating the evidence for his conclusion.
""I am grateful to President Trump for having given me the opportunity to serve,"" Mr. Sondland said in a statement announcing his dismissal. ""Our work here has been the highlight of my career.""
The White House declined to comment on the recall of Mr. Sondland.
Mr. Sondland was one of the few House witnesses who had direct interactions with Mr. Trump. Mr. Sondland initially testified privately to investigators that Mr. Trump had told him that ""I want nothing"" from Ukraine and that there was no quid pro quo tying security aid to Ukraine with Kyiv launching the investigations.
In his public testimony, however, Mr. Sondland made a key revision, telling investigators that despite Mr. Trump's words, he had understood the aid to be contingent on investigations and had relayed that information to a Ukrainian official.
The other dismissed official, Col. Vindman, the NSC's Ukraine expert, had angered Mr. Trump over his testimony in the House impeachment probe. Col. Vindman is expected to return to the Army, a U.S. official said, though his exact role is unclear.
Asked about reports of Col. Vindman's possible dismissal, Mr. Trump told reporters Friday: ""Well, I'm not happy with him. You think I'm supposed to be happy with him? I'm not."" He later retweeted tweets critical of Col. Vindman and last year called him a ""Never Trumper"" on Twitter.
People with insight into the White House's thinking argued the moves were overdue and important for morale at the NSC, saying they were necessary even if they drew criticism. One person said both Col. Vindman and Mr. Sondland had defied the president, characterizing Mr. Sondland as disloyal.
Share Your Thoughts
How do you think the Trump administration should treat witnesses who testified during the impeachment inquiry? Join the conversation below.
Col. Vindman's lawyer, David Pressman, said his client ""did what any member of our military is charged with doing every day: he followed orders, he obeyed his oath, and he served his country, even when doing so was fraught with danger and personal peril."" Mr. Pressman added: ""And for that, the most powerful man in the world—buoyed by the silent, the pliable and the complicit—has decided to exact revenge.""
Also escorted from the White House was Col. Vindman's twin brother, Yevgeny Vindman, a senior lawyer and ethics official on the NSC who is also an Army lieutenant colonel. Col. Yevgeny Vindman didn't testify to House investigators. Yevgeny Vindman's future role in the military wasn't clear.
Mr. Pressman said Yevgeny Vindman was ""deeply disappointed that he will not be able to continue his service at the White House.""
NSC spokesman John Ullyot said, ""We do not comment on personnel matters.""
Several other officials who testified to impeachment investigators have already left the administration. Bill Taylor, the acting ambassador to Ukraine, left his post in December. Marie Yovanovitch, whom Mr. Trump ordered recalled as ambassador to Ukraine last spring but who had remained a State Department employee, left the agency earlier this year. Tim Morrison, a National Security Council official who testified about the conversation between Mr. Sondland and the Ukrainian official about aid, left his post shortly after testifying.
Mr. Trump's allies said the president is feeling emboldened after being acquitted in the Senate impeachment trial, and he has lashed out at his adversaries in recent days. Earlier this week, he called the Democrats who sought to impeach him ""very evil and sick people."" He accused Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, the lone Republican who voted to convict him on one of the charges in the Senate trial, of using his religion as a ""crutch"" to justify his vote.
Earlier on Friday, Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters at the Pentagon that Col. Vindman would be welcomed back from the White House like any other military official returning from an assignment. Mr. Esper said Col. Vindman would be protected when a reporter asked if the Army would shield him from any possible retribution for his testimony against Mr. Trump.
The ranks of the White House National Security Council are made up of specialists from agencies such as the State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Pentagon, and they rotate in and out for set periods.
The lengths of the appointments vary, but Defense Department personnel are often detailed for a period of one to three years. Col. Vindman was detailed to the NSC in July 2018 as director for European affairs. His two-year detail was slated to end in July, said a person familiar with the matter.
Col. Vindman, who listened in on Mr. Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, told impeachment investigators last year that Mr. Trump's request for an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden was ""inappropriate and improper."" He also said ""there was no doubt"" that Mr. Trump was asking on the call for an investigation from Kyiv as a condition for Mr. Zelensky to get a proposed White House meeting.
Col. Vindman testified that he had raised concerns about the call with an NSC lawyer. But he denied that he was the whistleblower whose complaint sparked the impeachment probe and said he didn't know the identity of the whistleblower.
Mr. Trump has defended himself against the charges, calling the impeachment probe a Democratic ""witch hunt,"" and repeatedly describing his July call with Ukraine as ""perfect.""
In November testimony before the House, Col. Vindman said he had reassured his father not to worry about the repercussions of his appearance before the committees investigating the president.
Asked by a lawmaker why he wasn't worried, Col. Vindman said, ""Congressman, because this is America. This is the country I've served and defended. That all my brothers have served. And here, right matters."" Applause broke out in the hearing room.

WASHINGTON—Attorney General William Barr said President Trump's tweets and public statements make it ""impossible"" for him to do his job, a striking criticism of the president in the wake of his complaints about the case involving Roger Stone.
""I think it's time to stop the tweeting about Department of Justice criminal cases,"" Mr. Barr said in an interview with ABC on Thursday, while adding the president had never asked him to intervene in any criminal case.
His statements came after days of political furor in Washington sparked by Mr. Barr's decision earlier in the week to overrule prosecutors at the U.S. attorney's office in Washington who had
sought a prison term
of between seven and nine years for Mr. Stone.
Mr. Stone, an informal Trump adviser, was
convicted in November
of lying to Congress and witness tampering, in a case filed by special counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.
The intervention on the sentencing—in which top Justice Department officials ordered prosecutors to tell the court that the earlier recommendation was excessive—
prompted the resignation of one career prosecutor
, the withdrawal of three others from the case, and criticism from Democrats and some in the Justice Department that Mr. Barr had gone out of his way to help an ally of the president.
On Thursday, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) called Mr. Barr one of the Trump administration's ""henchmen"" and said his handling of the Stone sentencing ""deeply damaged"" the justice system.

Prosecutors Quit Roger Stone Case After Justice Department Seeks Less Prison Time
(Feb. 11)
In the ABC interview, Mr. Barr said he had already begun the process of amending the department's sentencing recommendation when ""someone walked in and told me…about the president's tweet,"" in which Mr. Trump criticized the sentencing recommendation, calling it a ""disgrace.""
""That sort of illustrates how disruptive these tweets can be for the Department of Justice,"" Mr. Barr said. He said tweets about the case and other criminal investigations ""make it impossible for me to do my job and to assure the courts and the prosecutors in the department that we're doing our work with integrity.""
Other officials at the Justice Department said the prosecutors involved didn't learn of any plan to submit a revised filing until after Mr. Trump publicly criticized the original recommendation, leaving them with the impression that Mr. Trump was
driving the change
.
Prosecutors in the case made their recommendation in keeping with official guidelines, though they also have the authority to forgo a recommendation and leave it to the presiding judge to decide the sentence.
The attorney general's defenders said that in this and other sensitive decisions, Mr. Barr is making what he believes are the right calls while disregarding the political flak he knows will ensue in the heated environment of Washington—a point Mr. Barr made in the interview.
""I'm not going to be bullied or influenced by anybody…whether it's Congress, a newspaper editorial board or the president,"" Mr. Barr said. ""I'm going to do what I think is right.""
In a statement, Stephanie Grisham, White House press secretary, said of Mr. Barr's remarks: ""The president wasn't bothered by the comments at all and he has the right, just like any American citizen, to publicly offer his opinions."" She added: ""The president has full faith and confidence in Attorney General Barr to do his job and uphold the law.""
Mr. Trump, in a tweet on Friday morning, acknowledged Mr. Barr's comment that the president had never asked the attorney general to intervene in a criminal case, but Mr. Trump added: ""This doesn't mean that I do not have, as President, the legal right to do so, I do, but I have so far chosen not to!""
Mr. Barr's critics said his intervention in the Stone case and many other decisions strongly favor the president's interests—such as when Mr. Barr publicly expressed his misgivings about Mr. Mueller's report. Such moves, critics said, erode the department's tradition of independence in law enforcement and potentially undermine prosecutors in future cases.
Mr. Barr, 69 years old, has told friends he isn't driven by concern for his reputation. When a reporter asked him last year if he worried about his legacy, he responded: ""Everyone dies.""
Still, Mr. Barr's associates had become concerned in recent days about the perception that he was taking directives from the president on matters including Mr. Stone's sentencing recommendation, a person familiar with the matter said.
On Thursday morning, Justice Department officials contacted allies of the attorney general to ask them to make the case that Mr. Stone's sentencing recommendation by the prosecutors had been absurd and that Mr. Barr ""could not let this stand,"" the person said.
The person characterized the message from the Justice Department as: ""It would be good to rally around the flag a little bit.""
""He has a lot of credibility with the boss, so he can afford to be a little critical,"" the person said of Mr. Barr's statements about Mr. Trump. ""It's not a Sessions situation""—a reference to Mr. Trump's first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who was frequently the target of Twitter broadsides from the Oval Office.
Prominent Republicans also have defended Mr. Barr and expressed disapproval of Mr. Trump's tweets. On Wednesday, Sen. John Kennedy (R., La.) called the Stone controversy the result of an ""unfortunate miscommunication"" and nothing more sinister, but said Mr. Trump's tweet ""aggravated the situation.""
A national association representing assistant U.S. attorneys around the country issued a statement Thursday saying the Stone prosecutors had appropriately recommended a guideline sentence and warned against such decisions being made by political appointees.
Since being confirmed a year ago, Mr. Barr has intervened personally in a number of contentious issues. Neither Mr. Barr nor his handpicked deputy, Jeffrey Rosen, worked as a line prosecutor within the Justice Department, though Mr. Barr served a previous stint as attorney general in the George H.W. Bush administration. Mr. Barr has long advanced an expansive view of executive authority and views himself as a defender of the office of the presidency against what he sees as an erosion of presidential power by congressional Democrats and other Trump opponents.
Much of Mr. Barr's legal experience stems from decades of work as a corporate defense and telecom industry lawyer. The combination, associates say, has given him a disdain for government bureaucracy, a short fuse for indecision and a tendency to find it more efficient to make a call himself.
""Bill Barr has the intestinal fortitude that comes with his convictions,"" said Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University professor. ""If he believes that trial prosecutors have exceeded their instructions he is not someone who is going to be deterred by the optics of the moment.""
To some degree, Mr. Barr's time on the job—Friday is the first anniversary of his confirmation—has brought to the fore the conflict inherent in the role of an attorney general, who is at once supposed to be the nation's top law-enforcement officer free of politics but at the same time a backer of the president's policy agenda. Democrats say he has strayed too far toward favoring the president.
Mr. Barr made waves early on by sending a March 24 letter to Congress summarizing Mr. Mueller's report in a way that Mr. Mueller himself and many others said failed to describe the investigators' account of the extensive efforts Mr. Trump took to curtail their inquiry.
Rather, Mr. Barr said that Mr. Mueller hadn't made a decision on charging the president and that he and his then-deputy, Rod Rosenstein, had determined the president committed no crime.
He later defended the letter as an attempt to summarize a 400-page report in four pages, and pointed to his decision to release the full, redacted report as evidence that he wasn't trying to hide anything or protect Mr. Trump.
In some instances, Mr. Barr has established parallel processes within the department led by his handpicked teams that can appear to overlap with rank-and-file work.
As the Justice Department inspector general was looking into the early stages of the FBI's investigation in then-candidate Donald Trump and any connections to Russia's interference in the 2016 election, Mr. Barr appointed the top federal prosecutor in Connecticut to pursue a similar avenue of inquiry, incorporating other agencies beyond Justice, such as the CIA.
When the inspector general in December found major missteps in a portion of the inquiry but said the inquiry itself was appropriately opened, Mr. Barr
rejected that assertion
and said the bureau had acted on the ""thinnest of suspicions.""
In antitrust enforcement, an area of the law that generally has received little attention from attorneys general, Mr. Barr made clear even before he was confirmed that he was interested in exploring legal questions related to the dominance of online platforms. After settling in at Justice, he has gradually shifted control and oversight of that issue away from the antitrust division to attorneys he has hired in his office.
In the Stone case, several of the prosecutors involved had threatened to withdraw from the case on Monday if supervisors mandated a request for a downward revision to their recommendation, according to people familiar with the matter.
The prosecutors' original sentence recommendation included language that acknowledged the court should consider whether the factors underpinning it were appropriate. Some supervisors of the line prosecutors thought that would quell any concern among senior leadership that they were pushing for an excessive punishment, the people said.
But Mr. Barr was surprised by the language that said Mr. Stone ""should be punished in accord"" with the guidelines, and worked with his staff in the top tier of the Justice Department to develop the revised filing.
U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson is scheduled to sentence Mr. Stone on Feb. 20. She has the discretion to ignore the government's sentencing recommendations and could ask the government to explain the change.
On Thursday, the chief judge of the court, Beryl Howell, issued an unusual statement defending the role of judges. ""Public criticism or pressure is not a factor"" in sentencing decisions, she said.

TEL AVIV—Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main political rival Benny Gantz were expected to meet separately with President Trump this week to discuss the administration's plan for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
Mr. Netanyahu told reporters before his flight to Washington that he would meet with Mr. Trump on Monday and Tuesday. The White House and Mr. Gantz's spokesman said he would have his own meeting with Mr. Trump on Monday.
""I am going to meet with President Trump tomorrow. On Tuesday, together with him, we will make history,"" Mr. Netanyahu said Sunday.
The White House had originally announced that Messrs. Gantz and Netanyahu would meet Mr. Trump on Tuesday, but Mr. Gantz had second thoughts about accepting the invitation over concerns it could be seen as a boost to Mr. Netanyahu, whom he is running against after two inconclusive elections.
Mr. Trump has said he would release the White House peace plan, which has been delayed several times since 2018, before the politicians visit.
Mr. Gantz's decision to meet separately with Mr. Trump reflects a careful effort to cultivate constructive ties with the U.S. president while avoiding a shared stage with Mr. Netanyahu.
Mr. Gantz would return to Israel in time for the country's parliament to debate forming the committee that would hear Mr. Netanyahu's request for immunity from bribery and fraud charges.
The charges stem from allegations that he traded official favors for flattering news coverage, as well as gifts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, including pink champagne, cigars and jewelry. Mr. Netanyahu denies wrongdoing and has vowed to fight the charges.
""These are fateful times, for both Israel's borders and character, as well as its democratic fabric,"" Mr. Gantz told reporters Saturday, adding that he would meet Mr. Trump as head of Israel's largest party.
Mr. Gantz's Blue and White party, whose popularity stems largely from its message that Mr. Netanyahu has been in power too long, has pushed to complete the immunity proceedings before the March elections. In the parliament's current makeup, Blue and White has majority support to reject Mr. Netanyahu's request.
Mr. Netanyahu's Likud party is trying to delay the immunity process, which includes standing up the committee to hear his request, until after the March 3 vote. The Israeli leader hopes a new election will change the makeup of the body to give more favorable consideration to his request.
The meetings on the peace plan won't include any Palestinian leaders, who cut ties with the Trump administration in 2017 after the U.S. recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
Mr. Trump said he had spoken to Palestinian officials about the effort, though the White House declined to provide details of those conversations. Palestinian officials denied speaking to Mr. Trump about the plan, and said they would reject any plan that doesn't include East Jerusalem as the capital of an independent Palestinian state and which is based on borders before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
Israel's parliament will vote Tuesday to form the committee that is expected to deny Mr. Netanyahu's request for immunity from bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges. Tuesday is also the final day for Mr. Trump's defense team to make its arguments in the Senate impeachment trial.
Avigdor Liberman, the head of a secular right-wing party who has played a kingmaker role in the past two elections, called the timing of the Washington rollout ""very suspicious.""
More than six months after releasing its economic plan for the area, U.S. officials have kept the political portion of the document under wraps. More than 50 pages long, the political part of the plan envisions that no Israelis or Palestinians in the West Bank will leave their homes and it would move Israel's border east of the internationally accepted Green Line with the West Bank, U.S. officials have said.

Michael Bloomberg said he would transfer $18 million from his presidential campaign to the Democratic National Committee, boosting the party's operations instead of forming his own super PAC.
The investment is aimed at strengthening the DNC's battleground program, which includes 12 states and is run in coordination with the state party committees. Mr. Bloomberg has also offered to transfer the ownership of many of his field offices to state party committees, according to a Democratic official, who said that the former New York City mayor's contributions would help speed up their hiring for positions in organizing, data and operations.
The multimillion-dollar boost to the party's field organizing program could serve as a
major asset to the Democratic nominee
. Former Vice President Joe Biden is leading the delegate count and has struggled to amass a large campaign war chest. Sen. Bernie Sanders is still in the race, but Mr. Biden's campaign is preparing to build out a larger staff for the general election while grappling with the new realities of campaigning during the coronavirus pandemic.
President Trump's team has built a large campaign organization and
is planning an extensive operation of field organizers
and digital outreach to voters. Mr. Trump and the Republican National Committee had more than $225 million in the bank at the end of February.
After launching his long-shot White House bid in late November, Mr. Bloomberg committed to keeping his staff on the payroll and field offices open in at least six competitive general-election states, even if he wasn't the party's nominee.
The billionaire
dropped out
after giving his own campaign more than $935 million, an unprecedented amount in just 100 days, according to reports filed with the Federal Election Commission on Friday that show his spending through the end of February. He earned only 61 delegates on Super Tuesday, meaning he spent at least $15.3 million per delegate.
Since he exited the race, Mr. Bloomberg's advisers had been working on a way to absorb his campaign operations into an outside entity that would boost Mr. Biden. He said in the statement Friday they had ultimately decided to change course.
""While we considered creating our own independent entity to support the nominee and hold the President accountable, this race is too important to have many competing groups with good intentions but that are not coordinated and united in strategy and execution,"" Mr. Bloomberg wrote in a memo to DNC Chairman Tom Perez that was made public Friday.
""The dynamics of the race have also fundamentally changed, and it is critically important that we all do everything we can to support our eventual nominee and scale the Democratic Party's general-election efforts,"" Mr. Bloomberg said.
The shift in thinking was fueled by a few factors, according to a campaign aide. Mr. Bloomberg and his advisers had been expecting a more prolonged primary contest and believed a new outside group could keep the focus on anti-Trump efforts while the remaining candidates battled for the nomination, the aide said.
But with Mr. Biden appearing on track to secure the nomination, they started at looking at ways of funding more coordinated efforts to support his campaign and discovered the presidential campaign could make an unlimited contribution to the DNC.
While individuals have limits on how much they can give to party committees, presidential campaign committees can transfer unlimited amounts—even if they are solely funded, as in Mr. Bloomberg's case, by one person.
In a roughly six-minute phone call with staffers, Dan Kanninen, states director for the campaign, said Mr. Bloomberg's team had considered what his general-election operation might look like, but was more focused on competing on Super Tuesday, according to a person on the call. Mr. Kanninen said
Mr. Biden's performance that day
changed their calculation.
""An independent effort would simply not be as effective or as efficient in our goal of beating President Trump in November,"" Mr. Kanninen said, according to a person on the call. ""I want to be clear: It was impossible for us to predict the events of last month politically.""
The aide said that
the coronavirus outbreak
also played a role in changing their plans. Although some of the field work conducted by Mr. Bloomberg's staffers in battleground states can still be done through digital platforms and phone banking, campaigns will be unable to carry out one of their biggest organizing activities—knocking on doors—for an unknown period of time.
""The Democratic Party stands united and fully committed to defeating the most dangerous president in modern history, and we welcome the announcement of Mayor Bloomberg's extraordinary investment to ensure that happens,"" Kate Bedingfield, a spokeswoman for Mr. Biden's campaign, said in a statement.
Hawkfish LLC, Mr. Bloomberg's digital startup, will continue its operations.
Mr. Bloomberg's campaign told staff in the six battleground states where he had committed to continuing operations that they would be paid through the first week in April and have full benefits through the end of April. They will now have to reapply for positions through the DNC's program, according to the Democratic official.
Mr. Bloomberg's campaign staffers—many of whom believed, based on the candidate's public comments and private conversations with the campaign, that they were guaranteed jobs through November—were informed in a call Friday morning about the billionaire's decision not to form a new super PAC and keep them on payroll. Many were surprised by the news and concerned about finding new jobs in a market roiled by the coronavirus pandemic.
""There has been no sensitivity,"" said one of the staffers on the call. ""It's been all about beating Trump and not about the people who worked"" for Mr. Bloomberg.
The Bloomberg campaign aide said they have provided names of their staff to the DNC with the hope that they will use the new funding to hire them.
The former New York City mayor's contribution to the DNC will be the largest transfer from a presidential campaign in recent history. Following the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign made a transfer of $3.8 million in cash and in-kind contributions, the DNC said.
""With this transfer from the Bloomberg campaign, Mayor Bloomberg and his team are making good on their commitment to beating Donald Trump,"" Mr. Perez said in a statement. ""This will help us invest in more organizers across the country to elect the next president and help Democrats win up and down the ballot.""

The presidential election is 10 months away, but Michael Bloomberg's long-shot campaign is running like it's already late October.
The candidate has spent $217 million so far on television and digital advertising, mostly ignoring the Democratic primaries and squarely challenging President Trump. The total is roughly three-quarters of the amount spent by all other campaigns, including Mr. Trump's, combined.
It's the game plan the billionaire used in his campaign for mayor of New York City in 2001, when he outspent his competitor nearly 5 to 1. Big spending has also made his philanthropy a dominant force on climate change, gun control and other issues. And it is how he has managed his lucrative business, paying up to bring in talent.
The flow of cash -- dubbed the Bloomberg effect by media-measurement firm Advertising Analytics LLC -- has upended the financial dynamics of the election. Television ad rates jumped 45% in Houston after the Bloomberg campaign bought $1 million worth of ads in November, Advertising Analytics said. The campaign paid as much as double the going rate for staff and promised jobs to workers through November, whether or not Mr. Bloomberg stays in the race. The candidate, who is funding his run entirely by himself, now has 1,000 campaign staffers.
It's a big part of the reason roughly $20 billion is expected to be spent on political advertising this election cycle, dwarfing the previous record of $12 billion in 2016, according to media research firm, Borrell Associates.
""Everything about what Bloomberg is doing is unprecedented,"" said Rufus Gifford, former finance director for Barack Obama's presidential campaign. Mr. Bloomberg remains a long shot, Mr. Gifford said, ""but when you have Donald Trump as president and one of the 10 richest people running for president, anything can happen.""
Kevin Sheekey, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager, said there's more to Mr. Bloomberg's candidacy than his spending, pointing to wealthy but politically inexperienced candidates such as Meg Whitman or Ross Perot who failed in the past. ""Money won't just determine elections,"" he said. ""You have to have a record and a message.""
Lots of rich people have run for office, lots of candidates have claimed excellent business credentials and many have claimed to have top-flight data operations, which Mr. Bloomberg emphasizes. What sets his campaign apart is his $55 billion checkbook.
Mr. Bloomberg is No. 9 on the Forbes list of the world's richest people, ahead of each of the Google founders, either Koch brother and the wealthiest members of the Walton family. A person familiar with the plans said he could spend $500 million on the primaries alone, and Mr. Bloomberg hasn't ruled out spending $1 billion before November if needed.
""Certainly it's going to be disruptive,"" said Robert Wolf, former chairman and CEO of UBS Americas and a longtime Democratic donor. ""We just don't know how yet.""
Mr. Bloomberg, who was mayor of New York from 2002 to 2013, is currently supported by 6% of voters, compared with 27% for former Vice President Joe Biden in the Real Clear Politics average of polls. More voters have a negative than a positive view of Mr. Bloomberg, according to a Quinnipiac University National Poll from mid-December.
Mr. Bloomberg said he entered the race at a moment when polling data suggested voters placed less importance on ideology and more on finding a candidate who could beat Mr. Trump. His campaign believed Mr. Trump was winning the race and was going unchallenged in political ads in competitive states as Democratic candidates focused on the primary battle.
At the time, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was surging. Polls showed Mr. Biden beating Mr. Trump but within the margin of error. Ms. Warren's policies, such as a wealth tax, would likely hurt Mr. Bloomberg, and she is generally disliked by his circle of wealthy New Yorkers, according to a longtime staff member. Mr. Bloomberg has said he will back whoever wins the nomination, even if it is Ms. Warren or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
To offset criticism that he was running out of his own self interest, Mr. Bloomberg pledged $15 million to $20 million to register 500,000 voters before the election. His attacks on Mr. Trump are part of that effort.
""There's a sense that Bloomberg is doing something that the party can't do -- going negative on Trump,"" Mr. Gifford said. ""It's work that the party doesn't have the money to do, and other candidates don't have the ability to do.""
After Mr. Trump's campaign said it had bought a 60-second TV spot during the Super Bowl on Feb. 2, the Bloomberg campaign bought a 60-second spot that will target the president. The Bloomberg campaign declined to disclose how much it was spending for the spot, but advertising tracker Kantar/CMAG estimates it is worth $10 million.
Bloomberg spending has drawn Mr. Trump's attention. When the campaign aired an ad saying the president had broken his promise of protecting those with pre-existing health conditions, Mr. Trump pushed back on Twitter and labeled Mr. Bloomberg ""Mini Mike.""
Mr. Bloomberg's campaign said that because he started late, it is focusing on the Super Tuesday votes on March 3, rather than the early voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire. The plan plays to Mr. Bloomberg's financial advantage and minimizes his weaknesses -- shaking hands and making small talk with voters, and giving stump speeches. The Super Tuesday states, where 40% of delegates will be chosen, instead depend more on television and digital advertising.
In addition to huge TV spending -- $193 million on ads since his campaign began -- the campaign has spent heavily online. It spent $16.1 million on Google ads as of Jan. 11 and $6.8 million on Facebook as of the end of December according to Kantar/CMAG.
Mr. Trump has spent $6.5 million on digital ads, and Tom Steyer, the other billionaire Democratic candidate, has spent $5.6 million since Mr. Bloomberg entered the race in November, as of the end of last year.
The Bloomberg campaign is offering field organizers salaries of $6,000 a month. For state data directors, it's between $10,000 and $12,000 a month, according to job postings.
The campaign's 1,000-person payroll is more typical of an operation in the final months before Election Day. Mr. Biden has roughly 400 campaign staffers, while Mr. Sanders has built an 800-person staff.
The former mayor's late entry into the race has forced the campaign to ""create a sense of momentum and hope people will actually jump on,"" said a person familiar with Mr. Bloomberg's state operations.
Campaign veterans said money won't necessarily bring in the best staff and said many experienced staffers want to work for people they support. Other campaigns, including Ms. Warren's and Mr. Sanders's, already have operations in Super Tuesday states and are ramping up hiring in later states.
Mr. Bloomberg has spent in markets that haven't been targeted by other Democrats. His campaign has plunked down $21.2 million on television advertising in Texas, where none of the leading Democrats have spent a penny. It has spent $8.4 million in Pennsylvania, which doesn't hold its primary until April 28.
It has even poured resources into smaller states that are typically not on the primary radar. In Idaho, it has spent $979,000 so far; in Utah, $1.6 million.
""He is going far, far ahead of where the rest of the guys are scrumming,"" said Kip Cassino, executive vice president at Borrell Associates, the media research firm. ""He is basically saying, 'I'm not going to win in Iowa, and I am not going to get out there and kiss pigs. And I won't win in New Hampshire, but I will win in the rest of the states, and I will get the states that most everyone didn't care about before.'""
At the beginning of January, candidates had spent close to $540 million on political ads in the presidential race over the prior 12 months, about 10 times what would have been expected at this point in this election cycle, Mr. Cassino said.
""We have never seen anything like this,"" Mr. Cassino said, referring to Mr. Bloomberg's spending. ""We are only just starting to see how distorting this might be.""
Mr. Bloomberg's potential handicaps among Democratic voters include his support for Republican candidates in the past, including former President George W. Bush. Other issues that could hurt are his support for charter schools in his education-reform efforts, and the stop-and-frisk policy he adopted as mayor, in which New York police had wide latitude to detain and search passersby for contraband. A federal judge eventually ruled the policy violated the constitutional rights of minorities. Mr. Bloomberg apologized for the stop-and-frisk policy before he kicked off his campaign.
Some Democrats fear Mr. Bloomberg could drag out the primary with his limitless budget, or use his money to try to influence the leading candidates, hoping to pull some of them to the political center, which he sees as the way to beat Mr. Trump.
Mr. Bloomberg's team said the data operation he is building will benefit Democrats overall, which he said are far behind the Republicans on the gathering and use of voter data. His data firm, Hawkfish LLC, launched in the spring. It has hired Facebook's former chief marketing officer and the former CEO of Foursquare, the location tracking firm.
Mr. Bloomberg has cited his research and spending on the 2018 midterm elections as evidence of his commitment to the party's success. Democratic candidates won 21 of the 24 races in which he was involved. In most races, the spending focused on digital advertising early in the election cycle and TV advertising closer to election day, when ad reservations were more expensive and Republican groups could not as easily counter their message.
In an Oklahoma House of Representatives race, which appeared to be a long-shot for the Democrats, Mr. Bloomberg unleashed a wave of last-minute ads that attacked the Republican candidate. Democrat Kendra Horn won by a few thousand votes.
""I supported 24 candidates who were good on guns and good on environment, and 21 of them won, and that flipped the House,"" he said at a recent campaign stop in Philadelphia. ""So if it wasn't for that, you wouldn't have [Speaker of the House Nancy] Pelosi and you wouldn't have impeachment.""

WASHINGTON—The deep partisan divide over the allegations against President Trump was on full display as the
Senate impeachment trial
moved into the
questioning period
and senators got their first chance to influence the trial.
The two-day questioning session comes as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.)
works to lock down enough support
to defeat a vote to bring in new witnesses and information to the trial. Wednesday's session offered a window into what senators on the fence about the witness decision were considering ahead of the vote, which is expected Friday.
Mr. Trump's lawyers used their answers to portray Democrats' case for impeachment as politically motivated, rushed and lacking evidence, and as falling well short of the bar needed to remove a president from office. Democratic managers said they were trying to block Mr. Trump from interfering in the 2020 election and mounted a forceful defense of the
articles of impeachment
—on abuse of power and obstruction of Congress—as they argued that Republican senators were holding Mr. Trump to an unusually low standard.
GOP leaders gave the first question to Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who submitted her query on behalf of herself as well as Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Mitt Romney of Utah, all Republican senators who are debating on siding with Democrats on a motion to bring in witnesses. They asked the president's lawyers for their guidance on how the Senate should view a situation where the president might have more than one reason to withhold aid from Ukraine last summer.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What questions are you hoping get asked and to whom? Why? Join the conversation below.
White House Deputy Counsel Pat Philbin answered by saying that in a situation where there are mixed motives, some personal and some in the public interest, the act isn't impeachable.
""All elected officials, to some extent, have in mind how their conduct, how their decisions, their policy decisions, will affect the next election,"" Mr. Philbin said. ""It can't be a basis for removing a president from office.""
The president's motivation for freezing aid to Ukraine, just as he was pressing the country to announce investigations that would benefit him politically, is at the heart of the impeachment case. Mr. Trump has said he did nothing wrong and called the impeachment a politically driven hoax.
In the Democratic senators' opening question, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York sought to underscore the importance of witnesses who could provide a firsthand account of the president's thinking. He asked the House managers if there could be a fair trial without calling former national security adviser John Bolton, who
alleges in a coming book
that Mr. Trump told him in August that he wanted to keep aid to Ukraine frozen until the country helped with investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter.
The lead Democratic impeachment manager, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, responded: ""The short answer to that question is no,"" and told lawmakers to not wait for the book. Democrats need to pick up at least four Republicans to win a vote later this week opening the door for witnesses.
In tweets Wednesday, Mr. Trump urged Republicans to reject calling witnesses and called Mr. Bolton's yet unpublished book ""nasty & untrue.""
In the questioning session, the House Democrats and Mr. Trump's legal team differed sharply on questions of what sort of action is impeachable.
One of the president's lawyers, Alan Dershowitz, offered a new argument: that because Mr. Trump believes his re-election is in the public interest, even if he had political motivations in pressing Ukraine to open an investigation into the Bidens, it wouldn't be an impeachable offense.
""Every public official that I know believes that his election is in the public interest,"" Mr. Dershowitz said. ""If a president does something which he believes will help him get elected in the public interest, that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment.""
The president's lawyers had previously argued that Mr. Trump's decision to freeze aid wasn't driven by political considerations and that his push for investigations in Ukraine was due to his concerns about corruption in the country. The aid was released in September amid a bipartisan uproar in Congress.
Mr. Schiff, of California, shot back that if President Obama had asked Ukraine to investigate Mr. Romney, his 2012 opponent, the Senate would have found it impeachable. ""Are we ready to say the president can sacrifice the interest of that…country, because all quid pro quos are fine, it's carte blanche? Is that really what we're prepared to say?"" Mr. Schiff said.
The hypothetical continued in a later question, from Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Ted Cruz of Texas to Mr. Schiff. If Mr. Obama had had evidence that Mr. Romney's son was being paid $1 million a year by a corrupt Russian company and Mr. Romney had acted to benefit that company, they asked, would Mr. Obama then have legal authority to ask for that to be investigated.
Mr. Trump and his allies have said it was corrupt for the elder Mr. Biden to seek the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had once investigated a Ukrainian gas company, Burisma Holdings, where his son sat on the board. Mr. Biden sought the prosecutor's removal as part of a broad international effort to combat corruption in Ukraine. The Bidens have denied wrongdoing.
Mr. Schiff said that the hypothetical didn't have a direct correlation and said the U.S. had ways to investigate corruption that didn't involve the president seeking a foreign leader's help.
Senators were given 16 hours over two days to submit questions to Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding, following
six days of arguments
by Democratic managers and Mr. Trump's legal team in which senators, acting as jurors, had to remain quiet.
Republican leaders, who on Tuesday said
they didn't have enough votes
to block witnesses, on Wednesday worked to dissuade Republicans from joining Democrats on seeking subpoenas. Mr. McConnell met Wednesday morning with Ms. Murkowski, who had said that she was curious about what Mr. Bolton had to say. After the meeting, Ms. Murkowski declined to discuss witnesses or her meeting.
""We will open Pandora's box if we move to talking about witnesses,"" said Sen. David Perdue (R., Ga.), a close ally of Mr. Trump who speaks to the president frequently.
Other GOP senators said they wanted to hear from witnesses. ""I'd like to hear from John Bolton,"" Mr. Romney said. Ms. Collins reiterated her support for witnesses ""to clarify some ambiguities.""
The House last fall had sought Mr. Bolton's testimony but declined to subpoena him, in Democrats' effort to move quickly and not get bogged down in court fights.

Separately, the National Security Council disclosed Wednesday that it told Mr. Bolton's lawyer last week that the manuscript of his book contained ""significant amounts"" of classified information, including some classified as top secret, and directed him to remove those materials before publishing, according to
a copy of the letter
viewed by The Wall Street Journal.
Chuck Cooper, Mr. Bolton's lawyer, didn't respond to a request for comment. Three days after the letter was sent, the New York Times published details of the manuscript on Sunday.
Meanwhile, more revelations emerged about Mr. Bolton's concerns about the administration's dealings with Ukraine. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel (D., N.Y.) said that in a Sept. 23 phone call weeks after Mr. Bolton left his post, Mr. Bolton urged him, unprompted, to have his committee look into the removal of the former ambassador to Ukraine. ""He strongly implied that something improper had occurred around her removal,"" Mr. Engel said.
Marie Yovanovitch's removal last spring is one of several key episodes in the impeachment inquiry. The former ambassador was for months targeted by Rudy Giuliani, who said he wanted to remove her because she was blocking his push for investigations in Ukraine. Mr. Trump, who has the right to replace ambassadors, ordered her removed after hearing complaints from Mr. Giuliani.

WASHINGTON—House Democrats and President Trump's legal team traded shots over the limits of executive and congressional power, as senators held their
second and final day of questioning
in the
impeachment trial
ahead of a pivotal vote on calling witnesses.
The
prosecution and defense teams
have up to eight more hours on Thursday to make their cases for and against allowing the Senate to subpoena witnesses and documents. Four Republicans would need to join the 47 Democrats for the motion to pass, and

GOP leaders have indicated
in recent days they don't yet have the votes to block the measure, though they have expressed more confidence in the past day.
At a GOP lunch, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky didn't reveal where the vote count on witnesses stood, other than that leaders don't know for sure, said Sen. Mike Braun (R., Ind.).
""There's been no clear declaration of who's still stewing on it,"" Mr. Braun said. ""It's going to be very, very close.""
In the questioning session Thursday, Democrats used their answers to decry the arguments presented by the president's defense team, in particular a controversial theory raised by Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz on Wednesday: that because Mr. Trump believes his re-election is in the public interest, even if he had political motivations in pressing Ukraine to open an investigation into the Bidens, it wouldn't be impeachable.
""What we have seen over the last couple days is a descent into constitutional madness,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the House Intelligence Committee chairman and lead House manager. ""That is an argument made of desperation.""
Shortly before the session started, Mr. Dershowitz moved to clarify his remarks on Twitter. ""Presidents cannot do anything illegal in order to get re-elected,"" he said. ""But nor can their lawful behavior be turned into a criminal or impeachable offense just because it was motivated in part by electoral considerations.""
The president's lawyers accused Democrats of using impeachment to interfere in the 2020 election. ""That is the most massive election interference in our history,"" said White House counsel Pat Cipollone, echoing a tweet by the president days earlier. ""Let's leave it to the people of the United States.""
The session began on a dramatic note as Chief Justice John Roberts declined to read a question submitted by Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.). Mr. Paul had said he planned to ask a question related to the whistleblower whose complaint about the president's dealings with Ukraine helped set off the impeachment inquiry. The whistleblower hasn't been identified.
Mr. Paul could have asked the Senate to vote on overruling the decision not to read the question, but he declined to do so.
Thursday marks the final full day for each party to rally its members ahead of an expected vote on Friday on whether to summon new evidence.
If a simple majority of senators don't agree to open the door to new evidence, the trial could end by Saturday. If they do agree to allow new evidence, senators could face a string of motions seeking testimony and records from specific people and agencies. There are a handful of senators on either side of the aisle who are in a position to swing these votes.
Democratic House managers, acting as prosecutors, are arguing that senators should convict Mr. Trump for abusing his power by withholding nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine as leverage for the country to open investigations that would aid his re-election efforts. The managers also accuse him of trying to cover up his alleged misconduct by obstructing congressional investigations into the matter. Mr. Trump has dismissed the impeachment process as a hoax and denies wrongdoing.
In the first session of questioning Wednesday, Mr. Trump's lawyers said Democrats' case for impeachment was politically motivated and fell well short of the bar needed to remove a president from office. Democratic lawmakers countered that they want to stop Mr. Trump from cheating to win re-election in November and argued that Republicans are holding Mr. Trump to an unusually low standard, and that their arguments open the door to corrupt behavior.
Democrats have intensified their calls for new witnesses following
the leak of a manuscript
by former national-security adviser John Bolton, in which Mr. Bolton wrote that the president told him he was freezing aid to Ukraine until the country helped with investigations into Democrats, including the Bidens. Mr. Bolton has said
he would testify if subpoenaed
by the Senate. Mr. Trump has denied Mr. Bolton's account.
Deputy White House counsel Pat Philbin argued that ""the evidence just doesn't stack up"" to show the president linked aid or a White House meeting to Ukraine opening investigations. He didn't address the possibility of testimony by Mr. Bolton, who could offer precisely such evidence.

Six Days in the Senate: How Democrats, Trump Team Tried the Impeachment Case

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) on Thursday played down talk that Chief Justice Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, could step in to break a 50-50 tie over calling witnesses, saying Democrats remain focused on getting to 51 votes. It isn't clear how Mr. Roberts would handle a 50-50 tally, and the Senate rules are silent on the matter.
Mr. Schumer is confident that his party will have no defections on the vote on allowing witnesses, although whether Democrats will remain unified beyond that point is less certain.
It isn't currently known whether Republicans will be able to muster the 51 votes necessary to block witnesses and documents. Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), who, as GOP whip is responsible for counting votes for his party, said on Wednesday night that at this point, ""it's still uncertain.""
""It's totally unknown territory,"" he said. ""And there's a lot of uncertainty and unpredictability about what might happen next.""
Two GOP senators—Mitt Romney of Utah and Susan Collins of Maine—are seen as likely to vote for witnesses. Other senators have indicated they might be open to witnesses, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee.
Ms. Collins, along with a handful of other senators, on Thursday asked Democrats whether there were legitimate circumstances under which a president could ask a foreign country to investigate a U.S. citizen—including a political rival—who wasn't under investigation by the U.S.
""It would be hard to contemplate circumstances where that's appropriate,"" Mr. Schiff responded. Mr. Philbin said it was legitimate for the president to ask for a foreign investigation into a matter where a U.S. citizen broke the law abroad.
Mr. Alexander, who is retiring, emerged from a closed-door GOP lunch on Thursday shaking his head no when reporters asked if he had decided about witnesses. ""I'm going to listen to the questions,"" he said.

President Trump plans to speak at the March for Life in Washington Friday, making him the first president to attend the antiabortion march in person in the event's history.
Mr. Trump, who has spoken to the group via video in past years, said in a tweet Wednesday afternoon: ""See you on Friday...Big Crowd!"" The White House confirmed he would attend.
""We are so excited for him to experience in person how passionate our marchers are about life and protecting the unborn,"" said March for Life President Jeanne Mancini in a statement. ""President Trump and his administration have been consistent champions for life and their support for the March for Life has been unwavering.""
The president's appearance at the 47th annual March for Life will come on the third day of his impeachment trial in the Senate, providing a split-screen as he seeks to connect with supporters amid the process.
Mr. Trump has won plaudits from antiabortion advocates for his efforts to restrict abortion access and appoint conservative judges. He is strongly supported by Christian conservatives, who favor his antiabortion efforts, and sees those voters as key to his 2020 re-election bid.
Under Mr. Trump, the administration has restricted funding for health clinics that provide on-site abortions, or refer women for the procedure, and has expanded the U.S. policy denying federal funds to foreign nongovernmental organizations that perform or promote abortions. The administration also has curtailed federal funding for research involving fetal tissue.
The administration on Wednesday also said Texas will receive federal Medicaid funds for a women's family-planning program that excludes health clinics, such as Planned Parenthood Federation of America, that also provide abortion. The approval indicates the Trump administration could back requests from other states that want to cut Planned Parenthood out of Medicaid family planning programs.
Mr. Trump has drawn criticism from abortion-rights groups for his policies and rhetoric, with advocates accusing him of limiting access to abortion.

In a tweet
, Alexis McGill Johnson, the acting president and CEO of Planned Parenthood, called Mr. Trump's planned appearance at the march ""confirmation that the sitting President of the United States is determined to end the American people's ability to access abortion.""
Naral Pro-Choice America issued a statement Wednesday, the anniversary of the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that recognized abortion as a woman's constitutional right, criticizing Mr. Trump for his plans to speak at Friday's march and ""turning to deception and disinformation about abortion to gin up a vocal and extreme minority as he faces the escalating reality that his presidency is crumbling around him.""
In 2019, the president spoke via video to marchers, while Vice President Mike Pence attended in person.
""When we look into the eyes of a newborn child, we see the beauty and the human soul and the majesty of God's creation,"" Mr. Trump told the crowd last year. ""We know that every life has meaning and that every life is worth protecting.""
Mr. Trump last year urged antiabortion advocates to stick together amid debate over the merits of new state laws aimed at curtailing abortion rights that revealed divisions within the GOP about how restrictive to make those policies.

WASHINGTON—President Trump finalized his legal team for the
Senate impeachment trial
, choosing a group of attorneys with the household name recognition and TV experience he values, while overlooking their links to past and continuing controversies, a tradeoff that Mr. Trump has often made.
Mr. Trump filled out his team on Friday by increasing the total number of attorneys to ten from four who will defend him against two charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. The most controversial selections were constitutional-law professor Alan Dershowitz and former Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr.
He also added Robert Ray, who succeeded Mr. Starr in the broad Whitewater inquiry; Jane Raskin, a veteran of Mr. Trump's private legal team during Robert Mueller's probe; and former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who has appeared frequently on Fox News and
joined the White House as an impeachment aide in November
.
In a statement late Friday, the White House said Eric Herschmann, a lawyer at the New York law firm Kasowitz, Benson, Torres LLP, would also join the team. Mr. Herschmann works alongside Marc Kasowitz, Mr. Trump's longtime lawyer. He previously served as vice chairman of the board of Southern Union Company and as assistant district attorney in the Manhattan district attorney's office.
The six will serve in an assisting role to White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Jay Sekulow, a personal lawyer for Mr. Trump. White House lawyers Patrick Philbin and Mike Purpura also have been working on impeachment issues for the president. All attorneys may address lawmakers as the White House presents its case to the Senate, but those roles hadn't yet been finalized, a White House official said.
Tensions have emerged in recent weeks between House and Senate Republicans over whether to include some of Mr. Trump's staunchest defenders from the House in the impeachment team. No House members were included on Friday.
Mr. Dershowitz would address the constitutional issues with the impeachment charges, say people familiar with the matter. He is among the most high-profile attorneys in the country, having helped defend O.J. Simpson during his trial on murder charges in the 1990s.
Mr. Dershowitz now faces a defamation suit filed against him in April by
a woman who says she was a victim of financier Jeffrey Epstein
and was forced to have sex with his friends, including Mr. Dershowitz. Mr. Dershowitz has countersued for defamation and infliction of emotional distress, saying her accusations were fabricated and baseless. The White House declined to comment.
Mr. Starr, along with Mr. Dershowitz, worked on the 2007 team representing Mr. Epstein and helped hammer out a controversial nonprosecution agreement between him and federal authorities. Mr. Starr also
resigned as chancellor of Baylor University in 2016
amid allegations the school mishandled sexual-assault allegations aimed at the school's football team.
But Mr. Starr is best known for leading investigations of President Bill Clinton during the 1990s, including his impeachment for allegedly lying under oath and obstructing justice related to his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, then a White House intern. Mr. Clinton was eventually acquitted in the Senate, and
just 28% of Americans approved of Mr. Starr's handling
of the case when he stepped down as independent counsel, according to Gallup.
""It's a weird choice,"" Sen. Pat Leahy (D., Vt.) said about the selection of Mr. Starr on MSNBC on Friday. Messrs. Dershowitz and Starr didn't return calls seeking comment.
The White House released no official statement about the selection of the team. Mr. Trump often watches Messrs. Starr and Dershowitz on cable networks and spreads their quotes on social media. Both men also have long relationships with the two attorneys who will be leading Mr. Trump's defense: Messrs. Cipollone and Sekulow.
The House voted to impeach Mr. Trump last month. The first article of impeachment stems from Mr. Trump
pressing Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden
, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, including by
withholding the almost $400 million in aid
to help Kyiv combat Russian aggression. The second article accuses Mr. Trump of impeding Congress's investigation by preventing witnesses from testifying and defying subpoenas for documentary evidence.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What strategy should the president's impeachment team pursue? What does each member bring to the team? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Trump's team is prepared to defend him by arguing that he did nothing wrong and that the Democratic-led process in the House was unfair, according to White House officials and people working with the legal team. The White House will give a glimpse of its legal argument in a document scheduled to be filed on Saturday, and then a fuller brief expected on Monday.
Allies of Mr. Trump, GOP lawyers and members of Congress said the team should aim to win acquittal by warning senators about the dangerous precedent they would set by voting to remove him from office.
That argument would focus on attacking the idea that Mr. Trump's actions amounted to high crimes and misdemeanors, instead of disputing the details of the accusations. Several Republican senators have said that Mr. Trump's interactions with Ukraine were inappropriate, but not impeachable, a contention that Mr. Trump and his team dispute.
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) said he has advised Mr. Trump to let the trial focus on the office of the president instead of the president himself, telling him, ""This is the one time it not being about you helps you.""

Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who served under President George W. Bush, said he would look to analogous situations to argue that Mr. Trump's actions weren't impeachable. ""It was way over the top,"" Mr. Mukasey said about Mr. Trump's phone call with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""I would not characterize it as a perfect phone call.""
But the Trump team must also consider a second jury—American voters—who will simultaneously be weighing the case in the court of public opinion, Trump allies said. The challenge for Mr. Cipollone and the rest of the Trump impeachment team, these people said, will be trying to find a balance between both juries.
Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas) said he has advised the White House to ""keep it simple."" ""This impeachment isn't just being heard by 100 senators in the chamber, it's being heard by the American people,"" he said. ""It's beneficial to the public to tell a story that is understandable, is clear and is persuasive the same way one would tell a story to a jury in a criminal case or a civil case anywhere in the country.""
The impeachment team plans to amplify its arguments by having Mr. Trump's allies issue an aggressive defense on Twitter and on TV while the trial is under way, according to people familiar with the matter. That is partly aimed at satisfying Mr. Trump's concerns, one of the people said. ""There's a way to be as aggressive as the president would want his team to be—but by augmenting what's happening on the Senate floor,"" the person said.

The Trump team is expected to have a total of about 24 hours to fill over two days. It will be the first time the White House offers a full, official response to the accusations that House investigators spent the final few months of last year laying out in committee hearings. The White House didn't participate in the House investigation, refusing to produce multiple requested witnesses and documents in protest against a process the Trump administration deemed unfair.
Mr. Cipollone and Mr. Sekulow are expected to have the largest speaking roles, according to people familiar with the planning.
The presidents team has discussed having Mr. Sekulow focus on arguing that the impeachment case is the latest version of Democrats' efforts to oust Mr. Trump from office, which he would contend included Mr. Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, said a person familiar with the planning.
Mr. Cipollone's arguments would be more ""big picture,"" and criticize Democrats' handling of the impeachment process, the person said.
The impeachment team has also discussed a strategy to undercut the widely believed notion that Rudy Giuliani, a personal lawyer for Mr. Trump, was working on the president's behalf in Ukraine, the person said. Mr. Giuliani has said he was in frequent contact with the president about his activities in Ukraine, and several witnesses described to House investigators that Mr. Trump instructed them to work with Mr. Giuliani.

WASHINGTON—House Democrats began making their case for President Trump's removal from office in the
first day of arguments
in the Senate impeachment trial as they continued to try to persuade Republicans to call new witnesses and subpoena documents.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) opened the arguments Wednesday, alleging the president abused his power and interfered in the coming 2020 election by pressing Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival, and then obstructed Congress's probe of the move.
Mr. Schiff, the House's lead impeachment manager, argued that senators should remove Mr. Trump from office, saying his actions created a threat to national security.
""Over the coming days, you will hear remarkably consistent evidence of President Trump's corrupt scheme and coverup,"" said Mr. Schiff, speaking to the 100 senators before him in the ornate Senate chamber. ""There is no serious dispute about the facts underlying the president's conduct.""
Mr. Trump's legal team argues that Democrats don't have a strong case, saying it is one reason the House prosecutors are seeking more witnesses. Mr. Trump maintains he did nothing wrong and has called the impeachment a hoax driven by politics. His team will be able to counter after the Democrats finish the 24 hours of arguments they have been allotted over three days.
Mr. Schiff laid out the chronology of the Democrats' case, playing video clips of administration officials who testified in the House impeachment investigation about Mr. Trump's push for investigations into Mr. Biden and the hold placed on nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. The aid was later released amid bipartisan pressure in Congress.
Early Wednesday, the Senate passed a resolution in a 53-47 vote along party lines setting the structure for the trial. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) tried to amend the resolution 11 times to allow the subpoena of witnesses and new documents, and to make changes in the rules.
All of the amendments failed on party-line votes in the Republican-controlled Senate, with only one of them drawing a single Republican vote.
Democrats still hope to win over at least four GOP votes to seek subpoenas later in the trial. Some Republican lawmakers have said they are open to new witnesses, but they want to wait until after the House Democrats and Mr. Trump's legal team have made their cases.
Headed into their opening arguments, Republicans said they were taken aback by comments from House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.). Mr. Nadler, while arguing for a Democratic amendment, said in the early hours Wednesday morning that senators who voted against allowing witnesses in the Senate trial were ""complicit in the president's coverup.""
""I took it as very offensive as one who is listening attentively and working hard to get to a fair process—I was offended,"" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska,), whose support Democrats will likely need to call new evidence later in the trial.
Mr. Schiff tried to tamp down the controversy. As he opened his presentation, he thanked
Chief Justice John Roberts
, who is presiding over the trial, and the senators for their patience in listening to the case the previous evening and tried to anew to appeal to Republicans.
""If the senators are serious about wanting to learn all the facts, if the president's team wants to contest any of the facts, these documents and witnesses will need to be produced,"" he said.
Earlier in the day, during a news conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump said he was sympathetic toward the idea of a longer trial, but said certain testimony would present problems. ""I would rather go the long way. I would rather interview [former national security adviser John] Bolton. I would rather interview a lot of people,"" he said. ""The problem with John is that it's a national security problem.""
The White House instructed many witnesses, including Mr. Bolton, not to testify in the House probe. Any witnesses would have to be deposed privately before they could testify before the Senate.
Democratic senators' next chance to push for witnesses will likely be at the end of next week. Following the opening arguments by each side, senators will get 16 hours for questions. After that, there will be a pivotal vote on whether the Senate wants to request fresh testimony or new evidence.
The Democratic-led House
approved two articles of impeachment
against Mr. Trump last month. The first stems from Mr. Trump pressing Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden. The second article accuses Mr. Trump of impeding Congress's investigation by preventing witnesses from testifying, and defying subpoenas for documentary evidence.
It takes 67 votes for the Senate to remove a president from office, a threshold that wasn't reached in the two previous impeachment trials that went to a vote, involving Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson. It is highly unlikely to happen this time with Republicans holding 53 seats.

What do you hope to see happen during the impeachment trial? Join the conversation below.
In his presentation, Mr. Schiff also took on another aspect of the impeachment fight, arguing that a president can be impeached for an action that doesn't amount to a criminal offense. Many of Mr. Trump's allies disagree, saying an abuse-of-office charge amounts to overreach by Congress.
""This idea that you can use abuse of power as a grab bag in which to stuff all your political policy, or personal grievances, I think is very dangerous,"" said Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas).

WASHINGTON—A lawyer for an indicted associate of Rudy Giuliani on Saturday released an audio recording that appears to show President Trump at a 2018 dinner with donors saying of the then-ambassador to Ukraine: ""Get rid of her.""
The recording, which Lev Parnas's lawyer turned over to House investigators on Friday, appears to underpin Mr. Parnas's description of the dinner. Mr. Trump has said repeatedly that he didn't know Mr. Parnas, who worked with Mr. Giuliani to try to persuade Ukraine to open investigations that would benefit Mr. Trump politically.
Mr. Trump has unilateral authority to dismiss ambassadors, an authority he emphasized Friday in an interview with Fox News.
The lawyer, Joseph Bondy, said the tape was made by Igor Fruman, an associate of Mr. Parnas. Messrs. Parnas and Fruman both assisted Mr. Giuliani, a lawyer for the president, in his push last year for Ukraine to undertake probes into Mr. Trump's political rival, former Vice President Joe Biden, and his son, Hunter.
The lawyer said Mr. Fruman made the recording at the Trump International Hotel in Washington during an April 2018 dinner, which was attended by the president and several top donors to his super PAC. Messrs. Parnas and Fruman donated $325,000 last spring to the super PAC, America First Action, according to Federal Election Commission records.
The recording starts with a video of the room. The camera pans to some of the name cards, including one for the president's son, Donald Trump Jr. The video disappears soon after, as it appears the phone was put down on the table.
On the tape, a voice that appears to be Mr. Parnas's can be heard telling the president: ""The biggest problem here, I think where we need to start is we gotta get rid of the ambassador. She's still left over from the Clinton administration."" The ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch, began serving in the U.S. Foreign Service under the Reagan administration.
Mr. Parnas adds: ""She's basically walking around telling everybody, 'Wait, he's gonna get impeached, just wait.'""
""Get rid of her,"" a voice that appears to be Mr. Trump's replies. ""Get her out tomorrow. I don't care. Get her out tomorrow. Take her out. OK? Do it.""
It isn't clear to whom the order has directed. There were no State Department officials in attendance at the dinner.
The tape's existence was first reported by ABC News. The Wall Street Journal reported Mr. Trump's comments at the dinner
in favor of firing Ms. Yovanovitch
in November.
Shortly before the comments about the ambassador, a voice that appears to be Mr. Trump's asked: ""How long would they last in a fight with Russia?"" Mr. Parnas appears to respond: ""Without us, not very long.""
""Without us,"" Mr. Trump echoes.
The Trump administration froze $400 million in aid to Ukraine last summer but released the aid in September.
Mr. Trump sought repeatedly to fire Ms. Yovanovitch, at one point directing Madeleine Westerhout, his personal assistant at the time, to call administration officials including Mr. Pompeo and tell them to fire Ms. Yovanovitch, according to people familiar with the matter. He sought again to fire her after hearing complaints from Mr. Giuliani that she was obstructing his push for investigations in Ukraine, according to people familiar with the matter.
In late April 2019, Ms. Yovanovitch
was recalled to Washington
.
In the Fox News interview, Mr. Trump defended his right to fire Ms. Yovanovitch. Asked why he told Mr. Parnas to fire her, the president responded: ""Well, I wouldn't have been saying that. I probably would have said—it was Rudy there, or somebody—but I make no bones about it…I have every right, I want ambassadors that are chosen by me.""
In a July phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Mr. Trump criticized the ambassador and said she would ""go through some things,"" according to a transcript of the call. Ms. Yovanovitch, who has denied speaking ill of the president abroad, told House investigators she felt threatened by the president's comments on that call.
In an MSNBC interview last week, Mr. Parnas recounted telling the president the ambassador was ""bad-mouthing him and saying he was going to get impeached,"" and said Mr. Trump responded by telling an aide: ""Fire her."" Mr. Parnas has said he has since realized the claim that Ms. Yovanovitch was bad-mouthing the president wasn't true.
Mr. Parnas was arrested in October on campaign-finance charges, to which he has pleaded not guilty. Since then, he has turned over hundreds of pages of documents to House investigators about his interactions with Mr. Giuliani and other high-level members of the president's orbit. In TV interviews last week, including on MSNBC, he said—without offering evidence—that the president was aware of everything he and Mr. Giuliani were doing in their push for investigations in Ukraine.
Mr. Parnas and his lawyer have said they hope that aiding the impeachment investigation will help obtain some leniency for Mr. Parnas from Manhattan federal prosecutors, who have said they are continuing to investigate Mr. Parnas's business dealings.
Mr. Trump didn't dispute that he had dined with the pair in his Fox News interview, but said: ""You have to understand…I see thousands of people.""
Since the president's initial assertion that he didn't know the two men last fall, Mr. Parnas's lawyer has released several videos and photos showing Mr. Parnas at public events with the president.

WASHINGTON—President Trump's Middle East peace plan, to be formally unveiled Tuesday, is a detailed blueprint of more than 50 pages that outlines his administration's ideas about how to resolve core issues on borders, security and Jerusalem that have bedeviled negotiators for decades.
Although the administration has steadfastly
declined to publicly discuss specific elements
, people briefed on the contents described a plan that heavily tilts toward the Israeli position on key issues.
The plan, they say, envisions Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem, including areas Palestinians claim as the capital of a future independent state. The Palestinians would have control over some neighborhoods on outer parts of East Jerusalem.
There would be land swaps between areas controlled by the Israelis and Palestinians. In the end, the Palestinians might control 70% to 80% of the West Bank. That would fall short of Palestinian demands, but the plan isn't expected to formally rule out a Palestinian state.
Officials have said Israelis and Palestinians won't be forced to leave their homes as Israel expands its borders. Unlike past efforts, the Trump administration isn't expected to seek compromises that would allow some Palestinians to return to land they or their families left after Israel's creation or receive compensation for it.
The White House has invited Arab and European diplomats to the Tuesday rollout featuring Mr. Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Mr. Netanyahu and his main Israeli political rival, Benny Gantz, visited the White House on Monday.
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas's spokesperson called Monday for Arab ambassadors to boycott the event. The Trump administration has lined up tentative support from at least some Arab states, people familiar with the matter say.
The White House hasn't publicly mapped out the next steps for discussions or if Mr. Trump plans to dispatch envoys to the region for talks.
""Peace in the Middle East has been long sought, for many, many, many years and decades and centuries,"" Mr. Trump said, speaking alongside Mr. Netanyahu at the White House on Monday. ""This is an opportunity, we'll see what happens. Whatever it is, it is.""
Aaron David Miller, a former adviser to Democratic and Republican secretaries of state, predicted the plan would give Israel most of what it wants and that the Trump administration's Arab allies, which are concerned about Iran and want Washington's support, will be reluctant to openly oppose it.
""Israelis will say 'yes' or 'yes, but,'"" Mr. Miller said. ""Key Arab states will probably say 'maybe' in order to stay on the right side of Donald Trump. Palestinians will say 'hell no.' ""
Politically, the timing of the plan's release will help Mr. Netanyahu in a tough re-election battle ahead of an unprecedented third vote in March, analysts say. The White House announcement Tuesday will come on the day Israel's parliament begins deliberations on whether to grant Mr. Netanyahu immunity from prosecution over corruption charges.
The plan also holds potential benefits for Mr. Trump amid the Senate impeachment trial. Mr. Trump's ardent support for Israel will appeal to the U.S. evangelical movement and some elements of the American Jewish community.

Netanyahu Withdraws Immunity Request Over Corruption Charges

Mr. Gantz backed the plan after a meeting with Mr. Trump and pledged to begin implementing it if he is elected and able to form a government after the March elections. Current polls indicate that neither Mr. Gantz nor Mr. Netanyahu will be able to form a majority coalition after the vote.
A broader question is whether veering from the diplomatic architecture that long has guided U.S. Mideast policy will provide fresh ideas that come as Gulf Arab leaders have found common cause with Israel over Iran—or aggravate Israeli-Palestinian tensions.
""It is obviously one-sided,"" said Martin Indyk, who served as a special envoy to the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations in 2013 and 2014 driven by then-Secretary of State John Kerry. ""It is blatant interference in the Israeli elections masquerading as a peace plan.""
If the plan fails, supporters and critics say, it could end up paving the way for unilateral Israeli steps to annex parts of the West Bank, which could inflame Palestinian sentiment and signal the end of diplomacy.
""This plan is to protect Trump from isolation and Netanyahu from jail. It's not a peace plan for the Middle East, but rather a self-security plan,"" said Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Muhammad Shtayyeh in a cabinet meeting in Ramallah on Sunday.
Several Israeli settlement leaders also came to Washington to join the discussions, including Oded Revivi, the chief foreign envoy for the Yesha Council, which represents the 450,000 Jewish Israeli residents of the West Bank.
""We have high expectations,"" Mr. Revivi said. ""I am aware that just like the prime minister, the president [Trump] is also in an election year and the president needs to deliver to his hard-core supporters in the U.S.""
Mr. Trump took an unorthodox approach to peacemaking from the beginning, tapping his son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner to spearhead the effort shortly after his election. He also added David Friedman, a former bankruptcy attorney and settlement supporter, and Jason Greenblatt, formerly of the Trump Organization.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you think relations between the U.S. and Israel will change, if at all? Join the conversation below.
Some Palestinians have said the fact that all three are observant Jews added to perceptions that the plan would be one-sided. The White House has said they worked hard to create a blueprint they think is even handed.
Dennis Ross, who worked on Middle East issues for Republican and Democratic administrations, said the plan's prospects will depend heavily on reactions of Arab leaders. ""If there are a number of Arab leaders who will say the plan is serious, the plan will have legs regardless of the almost certain Palestinian initial rejection,"" Mr. Ross said.
Some analysts say that such a rebuff by the Palestinians might play into the hands of Israeli officials who want to move quickly to annex much of the West Bank. According to their assessment, supporters of annexation would seize on that rejection to argue that diplomacy has reached a dead end.
Mr. Netanyahu is also seeking the support of right-wing voters to form a government after the March vote, which could prompt him to support annexation of some kind.
""The [Trump] administration is trying to square a circle between avoiding rejection of the Arab states and at the same time trying to have a plan that is acceptable to the Israeli right, and squaring that circle is not always easy,"" said David Makovsky of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.

OXON HILL, Md. -- The impeachment of President Trump motivated her to fly up from Texas, but after a half day at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Cathie Broten was convinced a more sinister force is in play.
""It's like Custer's Last Stand: the Republicans vs. the socialists,"" said Ms. Broten, 70 years old, wearing a pin reading, ""Kiss me, I'm a capitalist.""
Mr. Trump, greeted by wild applause as he took the CPAC stage on Saturday afternoon, sought to portray Democrats as seeking policies that would turn the U.S. into a ""large-scale Venezuela.""
""But we will never let them do that,"" he said. Mr. Trump trash-talked the Democratic presidential candidates, at one point ducking down to mock Michael Bloomberg's height.
He acknowledged the rise of Sen. Bernie Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist, in the fight for the party's nomination. He asked the crowd to cheer to indicate which candidate he should face in November, Mr. Sanders or former Vice President Joe Biden.
By the cheers, the crowd seemed itching for the ideological showdown that was the theme of CPAC: America vs. Socialism. ""We'll probably end up with Crazy Bernie,"" Mr. Trump said.
The event's theme shows how Republicans plan to frame the November election, with or without Mr. Sanders as the nominee. Repeatedly, speakers portrayed the Democrats' agenda on health care, the environment, college tuition and other issues as an attempt to radically transform America.
""Donald Trump and his allies are getting a little bit nervous about facing Sen. Sanders in a general election, and they're all quickly realizing that the only way to attack someone who spent his entire life standing with the working class is to lie,"" said Sanders campaign spokesman Mike Casca.
Amid the ""crazy Bernie"" and communist Cuba references at CPAC were warnings about being overconfident.
""Get your laughs out of the way and get the mockery out of the way and then get deathly serious,"" said the young conservative activist Charlie Kirk. ""Because we should not do what the left did in 2016 and dismiss an outsider populist candidate from thinking that person can't win the White House.""
When Mr. Trump spoke at CPAC in 2011, saying he might run for president the following year, many in the Republican establishment laughed it off. He skipped it in 2016.
This year showed how Mr. Trump commands the GOP, injecting his own sense of grievance and fight. The mere mention of Mitt Romney, the party's 2012 nominee who voted this month in the Senate to convict Mr. Trump on one article of impeachment, brought boos.
Before noon on Thursday, attendees had sat through four panels focused on ""the coup,"" with speakers dismissing the impeachment and other investigations into Mr. Trump as the work of Democrats and a bureaucratic deep state.
""They're never going to stop,"" said Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio. ""They tried to overturn the will of 63 million Americans -- all of us who voted for President Trump.""
Democrats hit back at claims like Mr. Jordan's, calling it ""the oldest trick in the GOP playbook.""
""Republicans are trying to distract because they know they can't win on the issues. In 2017, 2018 and 2019 Democrats won on a message of expanding access to health care,"" said Daniel Wessel, a Democratic National Committee spokesman.

Facebook Inc. removed Trump campaign ads that referred to a census, saying they violated
a company policy
aimed at preventing disinformation and other interference with the nationwide 2020 census, which goes online next week.
The ads, which began running on the social network this week, asked people to take the ""Official 2020 Congressional District Census"" and then directed users to a website for fundraising to support Mr. Trump's reelection. ""The information we gather from this survey will help us craft our strategies for YOUR CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT,"" the ads said.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What steps should social-media companies take to help reduce online disinformation surrounding the U.S. census? Join the conversation below.
Facebook said Thursday that it was the first time the company removed a Trump campaign ad for violating its census interference policy. ""There are policies to prevent confusion around the U.S. Census, and this is an example of those being enforced,"" a Facebook spokesman said.
The ads were paid for by Trump Make America Great Again Committee, a joint fundraising committee of Donald J. Trump for President Inc. and the Republican National Committee. Representatives for Mr. Trump's reelection effort didn't respond to requests for comment.
Facebook and other social media platforms are under scrutiny for the way they handle political ads to prevent disinformation during this year's election season, and many of those same concerns have also come up with the 2020 census.
The census, which is required to take an accurate count of the population and apportion congressional seats, takes place once a decade. The 2020 census will be the first one where most Americans are asked to respond online, raising new challenges about security and preventing bad information from discouraging participation.
The Trump campaign ads were posted on Facebook pages for President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence and began running earlier this week. The Republican National Committee began circulating a similar ad via mail last year.
Tech and politics newsletter Popular Information initially reported on the Trump campaign Facebook ads related to a census.
Some of the campaign ads remained active, while others were inactive, as of Thursday afternoon, according to Facebook's ad library.
The ads drew heat from Democrats on Capitol Hill on Thursday who said the campaign solicitations might confuse people, whose participation in the census is crucial to obtaining an accurate nationwide count.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said, before the ads were removed, ""This is, on the part of Facebook, a robust unacceptable interference in the census."" She added at her weekly news conference, ""I know the profit motive is their business model, but it should not come at the cost of counting who is in our country so that we can provide the services.""
Asked about the ads at a Senate hearing, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross told lawmakers that he has ""asked the career staff at census to look into this and see what appropriate action, if any, we should be taking to deal with it.""
New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said the Republican National Committee mailing seemed to be deliberately trying to cause confusion.
""They don't know the difference between this document and what comes out officially from the census,"" she said.
""That could be,"" Mr. Ross said in response.
Facebook said the Trump campaign ads were in violation of the policy because they are misleading about how to participate in the official U.S. Census.
Census officials have raised concerns that social media platforms may be used to spread misinformation about the count. Facebook said it anticipates census interference may increase as it gets closer to Census Day.
The census is fully available next week, going online Thursday. Mailings from the Census Bureau urging people to participate will also begin arriving at homes next week.
Facebook announced in December a policy designed to prevent census interference by banning misleading information about ""when and how to participate in the census and the consequences of participating."" It also banned ads portraying census participation ""as useless or meaningless"" or advising people not to participate, according to the announcement.

Montana's two-term Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock said he would challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines, putting the GOP on defense in another state as it fights to keep control of the Senate in November.
Democrats had heavily recruited Mr. Bullock, who has won three times statewide in Montana, once as attorney general and twice as governor. He won his second term as governor in 2016 by about 4 percentage points—when President Trump won the traditionally red state by about 20 points.
Mr. Bullock had repeatedly denied any interest in running for Senate before and after
his failed presidential campaign
, which ended in December. Since then, he met with former President Obama last month, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer traveled to Montana to make a last-minute appeal to Mr. Bullock to run.
Mr. Bullock's announcement came just under the wire, coinciding with the filing deadline in Montana and propelling a previously sleepy Senate race into the national spotlight.
""I've always fought for the people of Montana. Together, we expanded health care, protected public lands, banned dark money in politics & more. Now I'm taking that fight to the US Senate. Let's make Washington work more like Montana,"" Mr. Bullock wrote on Twitter Monday morning.
Republicans now hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate. But this is an unfavorable election cycle for the party, which is defending 23 Republican-held seats in 2020. Democrats are defending just 12 seats, nine of them in states President Trump lost in 2016.
Democrats must gain three seats to take control of the Senate if they win the White House. If Mr. Trump is re-elected, Democrats would need to net four seats.
""Bullock getting into the race is a legitimate game-changer,"" said Nathan Gonzales, editor and publisher of Inside Elections, which provides nonpartisan analysis of campaigns. ""It brings a seat that was previously solid for Republicans onto the battlefield of competitive races. It decreases the percentage of competitive seats that Democrats need to win in order to gain control.""
With Mr. Bullock's entry, Inside Elections likely will move its rating of the race from solid Republican to lean Republican, Mr. Gonzales said.
Democratic Sen. Jon Tester narrowly won re-election for the other Senate seat in Montana in 2018. Mr. Daines, a businessman who served in the House from 2013 to 2015, is seeking his second term in the Senate. He was elected in an open race in 2014. He has stockpiled more than $5 million in campaign cash in preparation for the possibility that Mr. Bullock might take him on.
Other Competitive Senate Races
The Montana Senate race will be one of the competitive contests this election cycle. Others include:
North Carolina, where Democrat Cal Cunningham, a former state lawmaker and Army veteran, is challenging incumbent Republican Sen. Thom Tillis;
Colorado, where former Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper is hoping to oust GOP Sen. Cory Gardner, who is hoping for a second term;
Arizona, where former astronaut Mark Kelly has outraised Republican Sen. Martha McSally, a former combat pilot appointed in 2018 to fill Sen. John McCain's seat after he died;
Maine, where polls show Republican Sen. Susan Collins in a close race with her likely rival, Democrat Sara Gideon, speaker of the Maine House of Representatives.
""We're going to win this race because Steve Daines is always on Montana's side fighting for more high-paying jobs, against big government and defending Montanans' way of life,"" said Shane Scanlon, campaign manager for Mr. Daines.
""I'm still feeling confident,"" said Sen. Todd Young of Indiana, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Senate GOP's campaign arm. ""Steve Daines is a great fit for the state. He's helped to sustain the longest period of economic prosperity and economic growth in American history, and he's fighting hard for the people of the state."" Mr. Young said Mr. Bullock's entry wouldn't change the Republican campaign committee's strategy. ""We're good,"" he said.
But Sen. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who headed the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee last cycle, said Mr. Bullock's decision to run in Montana would expand the map for his party, making Montana a top-tier race alongside tough contests in Colorado, Arizona, North Carolina and Maine. ""He is immediately a credible, strong candidate for United State Senate and he clearly puts that state in play,"" Mr. Van Hollen said.
Long seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party, Mr. Bullock was sought-after as a Senate recruit, but he said he wasn't interested. Instead he
launched a presidential bid in May
, touting his ability to work with Republicans to expand Medicaid coverage in his state.
He raised and spent about $5.4 million, framing himself as a moderate who could win in states friendly to Mr. Trump. But in a crowded field, his campaign never took off. He only made one debate and dropped out in December, before the Iowa caucuses.
Mr. Bullock's announcement to run for the Senate comes less than a week after an unexpectedly strong Super Tuesday performance revived former Vice President Joe Biden's 's hopes of securing the Democratic presidential nomination.
Mr. Gonzales said there is little doubt that Mr. Bullock's prospects would be better with Mr. Biden as the party's nominee, rather than Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist.
""It's hard to believe that a top-tier candidate in a red state would put their life on hold to run with Bernie Sanders at the top of the ticket,"" he said.

Editor's note: This is an excerpt from our newsletter,
""2020 Election+Business,""
a weekly dive into the intersection of business, finance and the 2020 election.
You can sign up here
.
Few contrasts are as stark in the 2020 election, or the primaries, as business taxes.
President Trump would keep or expand his tax cuts, even as
debate rages
over their
costs and successes
, while the Democratic candidates are proposing dramatic tax increases on wealthy people and corporations that go far beyond what the party has offered before.
President Trump's proposals are the fuzziest. His advisers have been
touting another round of tax cuts
for months and the president has promised a middle-class tax cut—if he's re-elected and Republicans control Congress. But the White House won't provide details yet. A spokesman said the White House is studying numerous proposals.
By contrast, the four leading Democratic candidates are proposing tax increases, along with tax credits and deductions likely to benefit some kinds of companies, particularly in the renewable energy industry.
At the high end, Elizabeth Warren's plan would raise $28.4 trillion in new tax revenue—nearly two-thirds of which would fund her Medicare for All health care proposal—while at the low end (relatively speaking), Joe Biden's proposals would raise $3.4 trillion,
according to an analysis
by Americans for Tax Fairness Action Fund, a liberal advocacy group.
All are bigger than the $1.4 trillion in tax increases that Hillary Clinton ran on in 2016. That partly reflects a more progressive Democratic party. It's also just arithmetic: The 2017 tax cuts reduced federal revenue, and reversing some of them adds to the price tag.
Of course, the candidates' proposals wouldn't just sail into law even with Democratic control of the House, Senate and presidency—and Republican control of any branch would make adoption still less likely. The Medicare-for-All plans, in particular, have divided Senate Democrats.
The candidates count on different sources to raise these funds, too. Ms. Warren and Mr. Biden would generate just over half their totals from business, while Bernie Sanders would get just over half from individuals and families.
Business, of course, is a broad term, and some of the new taxes Democrats propose would be felt by individuals, including shareholders, customers and workers. The candidates are also proposing a wide range of credits and deductions that would ultimately benefit a range of businesses, from electric-car makers to pharmaceutical-makers.
Here's a look at some details of the Democratic candidates' tax plans, courtesy of analyses by the Tax Policy Center:
Corporate tax rate:
Several Democrats want to raise the corporate rate from 21% back to 35%, but Mr. Biden prefers 28% and Amy Klobuchar, 25%. Ms. Warren has proposed a 7% tax on profits over $100 million, above and beyond a 35% tax rate, while Mr. Biden has pitched a 15% minimum tax on book income, offset by foreign taxes paid.
Partnerships and S-Corps:
Pete Buttigieg and Mr. Sanders would end a deduction adopted in 2017 that cut the taxes levied on the owners of businesses that don't pay corporate income taxes.
Overseas profits:
Most Democratic candidates have proposed altering portions of the 2017 tax overhaul's complex international provisions, which impose a minimum tax on U.S. companies' foreign income that's often below what they would pay on the same profits at home.
—Mr. Biden wants to raise the global minimum tax on U.S. firms to 21% and raise $200 billion from penalties on countries seen as facilitating tax shenanigans.
—Mr. Sanders wants companies to pay the same rate on foreign as on U.S. income and would limit the credit companies get for foreign tax payments and their deductions for the expense of moving production overseas.
—Ms. Warren would replace the global minimum with country-specific rates bringing tax rates on foreign income up to 35% with a 35% country-specific tax, and tax foreign companies based on their U.S. sales.
Manufacturing:
Mr. Biden would create a tax credit benefiting communities affected by manufacturing layoffs, while Ms. Klobuchar would create a tax preference for manufacturing investments in such communities and rural areas.
Banking:
Ms. Warren would charge banks 0.15% of liabilities other than deposits insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
Energy:
All the leading candidates say they would eliminate tax preferences benefiting fossil-fuel production, and several also would create or expand tax credits for displaced workers. Ms. Warren and Messrs. Bloomberg, Biden and Buttigieg propose expanding tax credits for solar and wind energy production.
Pharmaceuticals:
Mr. Buttigieg would tax drugmakers' gross sales each quarter they don't reach a negotiated price with federal health programs. He would also provide tax incentives to companies making drugs in the U.S. Mr. Biden would end tax deductions for drug advertising costs.
Private equity:
Ms. Klobuchar and Ms. Warren would both eliminate the existing tax preference for carried interest, under which private-equity managers' profits are taxed as capital gains. Ms. Warren would also limit interest deductions for excessive debt used to acquire a company.

A series of libel lawsuits filed by the Trump campaign against large media organizations are likely to run up against tough obstacles and depending on how far they progress, could subject the president to depositions, according to legal experts.
The Trump campaign's defamation claims against the New York Times on Feb. 26, the Post on Monday and CNN on Friday appear to be unprecedented, legal scholars said. Courts have heard defamation lawsuits from governors, an ex-president and a presidential candidate, but legal scholars said they couldn't recall the last time a sitting U.S. president or his campaign elevated grievances against the news media into civil legal action.
The Trump campaign's initial lawsuits concerned two Post opinion pieces published in June last year and one in the New York Times last March. Each contain passages implying Donald Trump sought or welcomed Russia's intervention in the 2016 presidential election or the 2020 race.
The Trump team's libel complaints continued Friday with a new lawsuit against CNN, alleging the campaign was defamed by a lengthy opinion article posted in June on CNN.com. The complaint focuses on a passage stating that the Trump campaign had ""assessed the potential risks and benefits of again seeking Russia's help in 2020 and has decided to leave that option on the table.""
The lawsuit called the passage ""blatantly false."" A representative for the network, a unit of WarnerMedia, declined to comment on Friday.
The lawsuits demand millions of dollars in damages. The suits were filed in federal court in Washington against the Post, in New York state court against the Times and in Atlanta federal court against CNN.
President Trump is entitled to the protections of libel law, but his campaign organization could have disadvantages as a plaintiff, say legal scholars.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Why do you think it is so rare for sitting presidents to sue the media, even though they often complain about coverage? Join the conversation below.
When it comes to defamation litigation, public figures like Mr. Trump must establish that not only was a statement false and defamatory, but also that it was published with ""actual malice."" That means showing evidence that the people who wrote and edited the statement knew it was false—or likely false but they didn't care to print the truth.
Each of the lawsuits emphasize that
special counsel Robert Mueller's report
on allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election found insufficient evidence that Mr. Trump and his campaign criminally conspired or coordinated with Russia. Suggestions to the contrary are damaging to the campaign's reputation and require expenditures to clear the record, the suits state.
Legal scholars said there is a crucial distinction between statements asserting facts and ones expressing opinions. Opinions are usually treated as protected speech, while an incorrect, defamatory fact isn't. Libel law tends to have gray areas and close judgment calls.
That is where the president's campaign—with its powerful platform—may be less likely to get the benefit of the doubt, said Rodney Smolla, a First Amendment scholar at Delaware Law School of Widener University.
He said a jury or judge would probably be ""extremely skeptical of a suit brought by the president of the United States for libel given the powerful First Amendment principles that protect dissent.""
The odds against the president are underscored by how few Americans in the last century have been accused and punished for libeling a president.
In 1969, a Connecticut judge convicted a 22-year-old student of criminal libel for publishing a
cartoon depicting Richard Nixon
as a phallic middle finger. An appellate court later overturned the guilty verdict.
More famously, Theodore Roosevelt directed his Justice Department to prosecute New York World publisher Joseph Pulitzer and other newspapermen for criminal libel over articles alleging the sale of the Panama Canal was tainted by corruption—indictments later quashed by the courts that held there was no crime of criminal libel in federal statute.
More recent past presidents looked at libel lawsuits as a political loser or beneath their dignity, says Prof. Eugene Volokh, a law professor and First Amendment scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles School of Law.
He said Mr. Trump may have spotted a chance to expose media bias and burnish his image as a politician who fights back. The president has
long assailed the news media
as ""enemies of the people"" and purveyors of biased ""fake news.""
But his lawsuits aren't without risk, said Mr. Volokh.
Mr. Trump and past presidents have avoided testifying as defendants in civil lawsuits by arguing that the proceedings would interfere with their public duties. It would be harder for Mr. Trump to dodge deposition when his campaign is the one doing the suing, said Mr. Volokh.
Should the lawsuits survive motions to dismiss, the Times and the Post would likely get an opportunity to examine and cross-examine Mr. Trump under oath about the articles in question and their assertions about his dealings with Russia, according to legal experts.
""It's hard to see how you could resist testifying about that,"" said Mr. Volokh.
The Trump campaign declined to comment. Both lawsuits accuse the Times and the Post of a ""systematic pattern of bias against the campaign, designed to maliciously interfere with and damage its reputation and ultimately cause the organization to fail.""
In a statement, Fred Ryan, publisher and chief executive of the Post, said the lawsuits were an affront to the principles of press freedom. He called the litigation ""a shameful ploy designed to intimidate news organizations as they work to inform voters on the important issues at stake in this election.""
A spokeswoman for the Times said the Trump campaign was using litigation to ""try to punish an opinion writer for having an opinion they find unacceptable,"" referring to the column's author, former Times executive editor Max Frankel.

WASHINGTON -- In the brewing battle for control of the U.S. Senate, both Democrats and Republicans hope to get a political boost from the impeachment trial of President Trump, with each side pointing to energized bases and record fundraising.
Democrats must gain three seats to take control of the Senate, if they win the White House, too. If Mr. Trump is re-elected, Democrats need to net four seats to overcome a tiebreaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence.
Democrats have an advantage over the GOP this election cycle that has nothing to do with impeachment: Republicans are defending more seats. There are 23 Republican-held seats up in 2020, compared with 12 Democratic-held seats.
After the Senate voted, largely along party lines, to acquit Mr. Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that in all of Republicans' competitive Senate races, GOP candidates were in better shape than they had been a month earlier. ""I think you'd have to conclude from this episode that we won and they lost,"" he said.
That was the opposite of how the Senate's Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, saw it. He said impeachment had been a positive force for Democrats. ""Contrary to what Leader McConnell said, our data shows every one of the Republicans in difficult races is hurting because of it,"" Mr. Schumer said.
Still, the fallout from impeachment could be ancient history in political terms by the time voters head to the polls. ""There are many things that will occur between now and the fall,"" Mr. McConnell acknowledged.
The week after Mr. Trump's acquittal by the Senate, Gallup reported Mr. Trump's job approval at an all-time high of 49%. Only one Republican, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, had crossed the aisle to vote with Democrats to convict and remove Mr. Trump from office on a charge of improperly withholding aid to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations that would help the president politically.
Republicans are trusting in the president's post-impeachment popularity bump to supercharge enthusiasm for Republicans down-ballot.
Democrats say that the 2020 election is going to be fought over voters' pocketbook concerns, such as prescription-drug costs and health care, and that is where they will focus their 2020 messaging. But they are hopeful that independent and moderate voters in swing states will view the impeachment acquittal of Mr. Trump as a sign that Republican senators won't stand up to the White House and hold Mr. Trump accountable when necessary.
The nonpartisan publication Cook Political changed only one Senate race rating post-impeachment, downgrading the Democratic-held Senate seat in Alabama from tossup to ""leans Republican"" after incumbent Sen. Doug Jones voted to convict and remove the president. ""He was sort of damned if you do, damned if you don't,"" said Jessica Taylor, who analyzes Senate and House races for Cook. ""The tides were against him for re-election, and this was sort of maybe the final nail.""
Republican senators facing the toughest re-election fights this year include Martha McSally of Arizona, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. All three represent states that will be competitive in the presidential election, which is sure to energize core voters in both parties. All three opposed allowing witnesses or documents in the Senate trial, and they all voted to acquit Mr. Trump.
In the weeks after the impeachment votes, they still are hewing close to the president. Mr. Tillis appeared alongside Mr. Trump at a rally in Charlotte, N.C., two days after the acquittal, Ms. McSally will join the president at a rally in Phoenix on Wednesday, and Mr. Gardner will attend Mr. Trump's rally in Colorado Springs, Colo., on Thursday.

WASHINGTON—Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) proposed changes to rules on President Trump's impeachment trial that
he had just issued a day earlier,
allowing more time for each side to make its opening argument and entering the House impeachment evidence into the Senate trial record.

As the third presidential-impeachment trial
in U.S. history kicked off in earnest with Tuesday afternoon's session, Mr. McConnell proposed that the prosecution and the defense each have as many as three days to make opening arguments, instead of the two-day cap he had proposed on Monday. Mr. McConnell also said evidence gathered in the House impeachment probe would be automatically entered into the Senate record, reversing his earlier stance.
The Senate will vote on final passage of Mr. McConnell's resolution after the conclusion of several hours of debate between the Democratic House managers, acting as the prosecution, and Mr. Trump's defense team. Senators, many armed with notebooks, quietly took in the testimony.

How Trump Has Kept Near-Unanimous GOP Support

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, as expected, introduced amendments in the afternoon calling for subpoenas to be issued for White House and State Department documents relating to the impeachment inquiry. Mr. McConnell's rules call for a vote to be held later in the process on whether to call new witnesses and documents, but Democrats said they wanted guarantees of witnesses.
Mr. Schumer's first amendment was defeated. Democrats need to draw four GOP votes in the Republican-controlled Senate to pass any amendments.
In his remarks on the Senate floor, White House counsel Pat Cipollone accused Democrats of manufacturing a case against the president, alleging they mischaracterized a pivotal July phone call with which Mr. Trump pressed Ukraine's president to announce investigations that could help the U.S. president politically. That conversation is at the heart of the abuse-of-power and obstruction-of-Congress charges facing the president.
""They made false allegations about a telephone call,"" Mr. Cipollone said. He said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.) was out of line for issuing subpoenas for documents and executive-branch testimony.
""It's an act of patriotism to defend the constitutional rights of the president,"" Mr. Cipollone said. ""If they could do it to the president, they could do it to any of you and do it to any American citizen, and that's wrong.""
Mr. Schiff, who is serving as the lead House manager for the trial, countered that Mr. Trump's legal team never made any specific claim of executive privilege, alleging that the president ""was determined to obstruct Congress no matter what we did.""
Democrats had objected to the initial rules, and the changes followed pressure from Republicans including Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who is up for re-election this year. Her position was that the trial's format should be as similar as possible to the rules for President Clinton's impeachment trial in 1999, which Mr. McConnell had long cited as a model for his own plans.
She had raised concerns that the 24 hours of opening statements for each side would be too much to fit into two days apiece, and she said that not having House evidence automatically admitted into the record was a departure from precedent.
White House Legislative Affairs Director Eric Ueland said the White House was supportive of the late changes to the Republican resolution on the trial rules.
Mr. Schumer, of New York, cheered the change.
""Republican senators felt the heat and went to McConnell and said we gotta change it; it shows that they can make other changes, and that we can get documents and witnesses,"" Mr. Schumer said.
After the week or so of opening statements, a question-and-answer period, in which senators direct questions to the prosecution or defense through Chief Justice John Roberts, is expected to last 16 hours—the same as during Mr. Clinton's trial.
In comments on the Senate floor ahead of the trial session, Mr. McConnell said the resolution ""sets up a structure that is fair, evenhanded and tracks closely with past precedents that were established unanimously.""
Democrats had said the initial rules proposed by Mr. McConnell departed from the Clinton precedent by not automatically including the House trial record into evidence in the Senate trial, and said the schedule was designed to push much of the trial late in the evening.
Democrats need four Republicans to win any votes, assuming all the Democratic caucus sticks together. It would take two-thirds of the Senate to convict Mr. Trump.
Mr. McConnell had said he had unanimous support within his 53-member conference for his proposed trial rules and that any opposition would have been an embarrassment—and could possibly have blocked the rules from taking effect, if four Republicans sided with Democrats to vote against the Senate's trial rules.
A Senate GOP aide said that each side retains the ability to make motions to strike or add evidence.
The White House in a legal filing
wrote that ""the Senate cannot rely on a record developed in a hopelessly defective House proceeding to convict the President."" Some Republican senators have complained only about the legitimacy of evidence gathered after the House impeached Mr. Trump on Dec. 18, saying that the Senate shouldn't be forced to conduct an investigation that was the responsibility of the House.
The vote on the Senate's trial rules could occur as early as Tuesday night. Then the chamber can begin to hear the arguments on the House's charges that Mr. Trump
abused the power of his office
by pressuring Ukraine to initiate investigations benefiting him politically, and that he obstructed the House's investigation. Mr. Trump denies any wrongdoing and has
dismissed the impeachment process
as dangerous and politically motivated.
In laying out the rules, Mr. McConnell designed a trial with some procedures favored by the White House. Mr. Trump's legal team will be able to make a motion to dismiss the charges after the trial rules are approved because such motions are permitted by the Senate's standard impeachment rules. Mr. McConnell, who wants to protect some Republicans up for re-election this year from tough votes, has told colleagues he would prefer not to have a dismissal vote.
Mr. Schumer said he would seek to amend the trial rules. The first amendment he plans would be aimed at getting documents from the executive branch, in particular communications involving acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and his aide, Robert Blair, as well as former national security adviser John Bolton.
""It's very likely that some of these communications may have been with President Trump between him and his people,"" Mr. Schumer said. ""That's why they're so important.""
After that, Mr. Schumer said he would also offer amendments aimed at issuing subpoenas for the documents that the White House has blocked Congress from receiving and for testimony from witnesses who haven't already been deposed by the House.
Republicans defended the proposed rules.

""Just because the House proceedings were a circus that doesn't mean the Senate's trial needs to be,"" tweeted Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.).

U.S. talks with China to complete a first-stage trade deal had hit an impasse around Thanksgiving, raising fears a nascent accord would collapse again -- and with it, hope for a halt to the nearly two-year-old trade war.
Looking for a direct route to the president, Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai spoke with President Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, say people familiar with the episode. The U.S. offer didn't roll back enough tariffs, he told Mr. Kushner.
It was time to settle, Mr. Kushner responded. If not, on Dec. 15 the president was ready to proceed with new tariffs on about $156 billion in Chinese imports, including smartphones and toys. ""Don't think in terms of tariff reduction,"" he advised. ""Think in terms of what will happen if you don't make a deal.""
To Chinese negotiators dealing with a president they considered erratic, Mr. Kushner's words at least offered certainty, say the people familiar with episode. They also recognized an opportunity: The agreement wouldn't force them to make economic-policy changes Washington had long insisted on.
About two weeks later, both sides announced the compromise set to be signed at a White House ceremony Wednesday. ""This is an attempt to work together and solve problems,"" says Clete Willems, a former Trump White House trade negotiator who had worked on China issues. ""It's not everything the U.S. set out to do.""
Adds a Beijing regulator with knowledge of the negotiations: ""Hopefully, this deal can help prevent the bilateral relationship from getting much worse.""
The accord promises increased purchases of U.S. goods and services, greater access for American firms to China's banking, insurance and other financial sectors, an end to tariff threats -- and a chance to reset relations between the world's largest economies. The two sides also have agreed to semi-annual meetings to discuss trade and economic issues.
Even so, the deal isn't what either side said it had wanted. The U.S. doesn't get the fundamental reforms in Chinese economic policy it sought to help American businesses. And levies remain on about $370 billion of China's exports.
Two days before Christmas, Chinese leader Xi Jinping dined with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the Great Hall of the People, where Mr. Abe said he hoped the so-called phase-one deal would encourage China to liberalize its economy further, say people familiar with the exchange.
China has already opened up significantly, replied Mr. Xi, trumpeting a World Bank survey showing China's improved business environment. ""It's good to have the phase-one agreement,"" he said, but added many issues remained unresolved and a deal ""can't solve everything.""
This account of how the limited deal came together is based on interviews with policy makers in both capitals and people who have been consulted on the negotiations, and reveals the little-seen pragmatic side of a publicly fraught relationship.
As Washington and Beijing sweltered last summer, Mr. Trump was losing patience. Outraged that Beijing hadn't come through with what he claimed were promised purchases of soybeans and other commodities, he threatened in August to raise tariffs on half of what China sells the U.S. and impose new tariffs on the other half. China, denying it made a purchase promise, retaliated by suspending buying U.S. farm products.
Mr. Trump took to Twitter on Aug. 23 and ""hereby ordered"" U.S. firms ""to start immediately looking for an alternative to China, including bringing . . . your companies HOME.""
By September, both sides wanted to pull back from the brink. In Washington, a succession of CEOs paid calls on Mr. Trump and his economic advisers, warning of the tariff battle's dangers. After the president's tweet, Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas Sands Corp. CEO who contributed $20 million to Mr. Trump's presidential campaign and whose Macau casinos depend on Chinese goodwill, warned the president new tariffs would hurt the economy and Mr. Trump's re-election chances by increasing consumer prices.
Mr. Trump had long claimed China was paying the cost of tariffs. Executives from Best Buy Co. were among those pointing out the burden falls on U.S. businesses and customers. A spokesman for Mr. Adelson confirmed his lobbying. Best Buy declined to comment.
Beijing, which worried about the trade war's impact on its economy, also signaled through U.S. business representatives that it wanted to negotiate. For China's leaders, 2019 was supposed to focus on celebrating on Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule and its success in lifting hundreds of millions from poverty.
Instead, the trade war threatened to tank the economy, as unrest in Hong Kong and other challenges highlighted Mr. Xi's domestic problems. Premier Li Keqiang and other top officials stressed to visiting American executives the importance of engagement to help prevent tensions from spinning out of control, figuring they would relay those views to the White House.
By mid-September, China was cracking down on shipments of the addictive drug fentanyl, a Trump priority. It also said it would exempt some U.S. soybeans and pork from tariffs. The U.S. responded by delaying tariff increases.
Behind the scenes, the U.S. also was debating how to compromise. Mr. Trump had long instructed his chief negotiator, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, to get a ""great deal."" Now, Mr. Lighthizer was after the best deal available.
In May, the U.S. and China had been close to a comprehensive agreement. But it would have required China to change as many as 60 laws and regulations covering intellectual property, regulatory review panels, financial services and other areas. It fell apart when China's lead negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, couldn't get the top leadership approval.
Mr. Lighthizer, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin now sought to ""pocket the gains,"" as they called it, from prior negotiations even if that meant jettisoning for now demands for China to eliminate subsidies and revamp state-owned firms.
They counseled Mr. Trump to show restraint. During Oval Office meetings in August, the president had threatened to double to 50% the tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods. In the past, Mr. Lighthizer had urged him to increase rates to pressure China. Now, he joined the other two to persuade the president to threaten just a 5-percentage-point increase -- as a warning to Beijing but small enough it wouldn't disrupt negotiations. The president later delayed putting the increase into effect.
""Bob Lighthizer isn't an ideologue. He is a realist,"" says former Trump strategist Stephen Bannon. ""His client wanted a deal, as good a deal as you could get to close.""
Negotiators on both sides started exploring a settlement with different phases, the first focused on agriculture purchases and other less contentious issues. That had long been China's strategy. Since 2018, Chinese negotiators had pushed what they called a 40-40-20 plan: They said 40% of American demands were doable because they involved reforms China planned anyway, 40% were negotiable and 20% were off-limits, impinging on national security.
Mr. Lighthizer and other negotiators had earlier privately derided the effort because Beijing categorized as off-limits issues the U.S. considered priorities. That included further opening China's cloud-computing market. Now the U.S. essentially was ready to accept China's framework.
Chinese negotiators focused on three areas important to the U.S. team, starting with increased purchases of U.S. farm goods -- a priority of Mr. Trump's. China had largely stopped buying U.S. crops to retaliate against tariffs, hitting his supporters in farm states.
Beijing also offered compromises on the deal's enforcement, a priority for Mr. Lighthizer, and financial liberalization, an issue for Mr. Mnuchin.
When Mr. Kudlow sketched out a possible deal for Mr. Trump in early October, the president responded, ""I could be for that,"" though he wanted to see what the Chinese offered.
The two teams of negotiators met Oct. 10 at Washington's Metropolitan Club, a Lighthizer haunt, going over the outline of a deal. The next day, the president invited Mr. Liu into the Oval Office and with television cameras present announced what he called a ""tremendous"" deal. ""I'd suggest the farmers have to go and immediately buy more land and get bigger tractors,"" he said. Beijing would buy $40 billion to $50 billion annually in agricultural products, he said, about twice what it has ever bought from the U.S. Mr. Liu didn't contradict him but didn't confirm the claim.
Both sides wrangled over deal details during videoconferences over the next two months. Chinese negotiators continued to insist on what they called a balanced deal, not wanting to be seen as caving to foreign pressure. To that end, enforcement provisions were relabeled ""bilateral assessment and dispute settlement,"" according to Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency. That put the emphasis on planned consultations to settle disputes rather than U.S. insistence it could impose tariffs if unsatisfied. Beijing also wanted the U.S. to roll back tariffs sharply. Again, Chinese negotiators divided U.S. demands into hundreds of items and calculated their offer covered 72% of the demands, which they argued should be matched by commensurate tariff reduction.
No way, Mr. Lighthizer responded, the Chinese offer was worth maybe half that. On Oct. 31, the president tweeted their offer covered 60%.
Back and forth went the argument over percentages. Mr. Lighthizer offered to cut 15% tariffs on $120 billion of Chinese imports to 10% and drop plans to impose new tariffs. That represented the first U.S. offer to scale back tariffs since the trade battle started. But it left 25% tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports, about half what China sold to the U.S. Mr. Xi wanted all tariffs eliminated or at least a schedule to reach zero tariffs.
The Chinese ambassador relied on Mr. Kushner for a better read on what Mr. Trump wanted. To Beijing, Mr. Kushner was a trusted intermediary who had helped arrange a Mar-a-Lago summit between Messrs. Xi and Trump a few months after the president's inauguration.
After listening to Mr. Kushner's counsel, the Chinese side was ready to settle if Mr. Lighthizer approved one more compromise -- reduce the 15% tariffs to 7.5% instead of 10%. Both sides could live with that and worked to clear remaining issues. The U.S. side was exultant and started providing deal details on Dec. 12.
The Chinese side was silent. The following workday in Beijing, none of China's state-owned media outlets or government agencies commented on the negotiations.
First, Mr. Xi had to approve the deal, which he did. Then, Beijing had to decide how to spin the agreement to fend off any domestic criticism China made too many concessions.
Near midnight Dec. 13 in Beijing, about 90 minutes after Mr. Trump tweeted the sides had reached ""an amazing deal,"" a half dozen vice ministers held a rare press conference. They confirmed the deal but didn't give details. Negotiations continued, particularly over how to translate the text into Chinese, which could give Beijing wiggle room on commitments. China's state media has stayed largely quiet about the deal.
""Because of the remaining uncertainty, we're being told to be standing by,"" said a senior editor at a state-owned news agency in Beijing. ""But no news is good news,"" the editor added. ""It shows the top leader here wants to get it done.""
Before heading to a New Year's Eve celebration at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump told reporters he would head to Beijing in 2020 for talks on a second-phase deal and hinted Mr. Xi might travel to the U.S. -- a suggestion the president had made before. Beijing didn't confirm any travel plans. Chinese diplomats say their priority is preparing for Mr. Xi's planned state visit to Japan this spring.
The U.S. is counting on remaining tariffs to compel Beijing to continue negotiating and agree to economic-policy changes. Failing that, Washington could use other pressure points, such as limiting the ability of Chinese firms to list shares in U.S. markets.
Still, Chinese officials feel they have little to gain from a phase-two deal forcing Beijing to ease state control of the economy, and Mr. Trump recently said a phase-two agreement probably wouldn't conclude until after the Nov. 3 election. Beijing continues to plan for a future where the economies would be less intertwined and China would develop technology rather than rely on U.S. imports.
When Mr. Xi met with a group of foreign luminaries including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson in a November forum in Beijing, say attendees, he told them: ""We did not start the trade war, but we won't flinch from confrontation. . . . Why should we change policies that are working?""

DES MOINES, Iowa—Voters across the political spectrum here expressed everything from frustration to relief at the likely acquittal of President Trump as his impeachment trial sputters to an end.
The one emotion in short supply was surprise.
""It's unthinkable from a legal perspective and a moral perspective to not have witnesses in a trial,"" said Jack Trout, an 18-year-old-student at Grinnell College who is supporting Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the Democratic caucuses.
But Mr. Trout said he expected such an outcome from the Republican-led Senate. ""I feel like the GOP has become very much party over country,"" he said.
Taking the opposite view, 77-year-old retiree Ken Brown from Carlisle, Iowa, called the process ""an absolute hoax on the Democratic side.""
""They have nothing to offer except 'Hate Trump,'"" said Mr. Brown, who added the outcome also didn't surprise him. ""They'll continue. They will not quit because they have nothing else.""
Iowans' views as they readied for the state's leadoff caucuses on Monday underscored the deep ideological divides that have become the political status quo and signaled that the contentious process could drive enthusiasm on both sides of the aisle in a presidential election year.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you feel President Trump's acquittal will sway voters in the general election? Join the conversation below.
Their reactions could also point to how the outcome will be received more broadly. The early-voting state is a key general election battleground, which Mr. Trump captured by nearly 10 percentage points in 2016 over Hillary Clinton—but which President Obama won in 2008 and 2012.
Mr. Trump has argued that he did nothing wrong, painting impeachment as a partisan ""witch hunt.""
""We're having probably the best years that we've ever had in the history of our country, and I just got impeached. Can you believe these people?"" the president told a rally in Iowa on Thursday.
Democrats chasing the presidential nomination sought to emphasize impeachment as they made their closing arguments before the caucuses, with Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., describing himself as exhausted by the process and former Vice President Joe Biden making it a central part of his pitch to voters.
The Senate impeachment trial effectively ended Friday, after
Republicans blocked Democrats' demands
to call new witnesses and documents in the trial, putting the president on track for an acquittal vote on Wednesday. The impeachment trial centered on the president's efforts to press Ukraine to launch investigations that could benefit him politically and whether he blocked a congressional inquiry.
It wasn't clear that the Senate trial had significantly shifted views in Iowa, but rather reinforced existing feelings.
Diane Kueker, a 61-year-old who operates a thrift store in Cresco, Iowa, called it a ""horrible waste of tax dollars,"" adding that Democrats ""have been after him since the day he got in."" 





Cresco, Iowa. PHOTO: Daniel Acker for The Wall Street Journal
Ms. Kueker, who says she leans Republican and voted for Mr. Trump, lives in Iowa's Howard County. It's the only one of the U.S.'s more than 3,000 counties that voted by more than 20 percentage points for Mr. Obama in 2012 and by more than 20 percentage points for Mr. Trump four years later.
Susan Ohnysty, 60, a Trump supporter from West Des Moines, echoed Ms. Kueker's views, saying impeachment had been a ""waste of time and taxpayer money."" She said she was always hopeful the process would end in acquittal because ""the House articles of impeachment were not meeting the standards of a high crime.""
Mr. Trump was accused of freezing $400 million in security aid to Ukraine until it opened investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, and then with obstructing Congress in its impeachment inquiry. Mr. Trump has denied tying the aid to investigations and has defended blocking aides from testifying to Congress.
Linda Robinson, 72, a retiree from Boone, Iowa, who plans to caucus for Democrat Andrew Yang, said she thought the impeachment trial had value by establishing a public record of Mr. Trump's actions, even though many of her Democratic friends considered it a waste of time.
She said she watched the House hearings but paid less attention once Republicans took charge of the proceedings in the Senate. She said she wasn't surprised by the speed or result of the Senate trial.
""It's all gone the way I guess we thought it would because no one has a backbone,"" she said.
Phil Peterson, 67, an Iowa City resident and retired finance executive at a local hospital, who is considering caucusing for Mr. Biden, said the ""chances were kind of slim and almost none"" that Senate Republicans would allow Mr. Trump to be removed from office, and he expected the outcome that now seems likely on Wednesday.
But he predicted House Democrats would continue to cause political headaches for Mr. Trump.
""I think while the impeachment part is over, some investigations, I presume, will continue and more will come out in the public,"" Mr. Peterson said.

WASHINGTON—Sen. Bernie Sanders collected $34.5 million in the fourth quarter, outpacing former Vice President Joe Biden, as both Democratic presidential candidates reported a fundraising surge with one month to go until the Iowa caucuses.
While Democrats brace for a costly—and potentially lengthy—primary season, Republican President Trump faces no significant intraparty opposition and continued to amass campaign cash. His campaign said it raised $46 million in the final three months of last year, its best fundraising quarter to date, and had a war chest of about $103 million.
The Democratic field's quarterly tallies so far more than double Mr. Trump's haul. But unlike the incumbent president, the Democratic hopefuls are entering a period of heavy spending in a primary still crowded with 14 candidates, even after
the exit of former Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development Julián Castro on Thursday.
Mr. Biden said he raised $22.7 million in the fourth quarter, his best number of the year. Mr. Biden, who has relied on larger donors who pay to attend fundraising events, told supporters in a video posted Thursday that his online contributions have increased.
Several other candidates have released their quarterly totals in recent days. Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend, Ind., mayor, said Wednesday that
he had raised $24.7 million
, while tech entrepreneur and political newcomer Andrew Yang said Thursday that he raised $16.5 million, a sharp increase from the third quarter. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard raised $3.4 million in the fourth quarter, according to her campaign.
Another top contender, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, hasn't disclosed her fourth-quarter haul but said in
a fundraising plea last week
that she had raised $17 million headed into the final days of the quarter, a slowed pace from her third quarter, when she brought in $24.6 million.
None of the Democratic candidates have released their current cash on hand. All presidential campaigns must report fourth-quarter fundraising and spending activities to the Federal Election Commission by Jan. 31.
The Iowa caucuses are Feb. 3, and the New Hampshire primary is Feb. 11. The Democratic field also faces a potential shake-up deeper into the voting calendar, when former New York Mayor
Michael Bloomberg begins competing
in the states that vote March 3, a date known as Super Tuesday. The billionaire businessman entered the race just before Thanksgiving and has already spent $132 million on TV and radio commercials, according to advertising tracker Kantar/CMAG.
Mr. Biden was embarking on a bus tour of eastern Iowa on Thursday, boosted by the endorsement earlier in the day of Rep. Abby Finkenauer (D., Iowa), the first member of the state's congressional delegation to endorse a 2020 candidate. Meanwhile, Mr. Sanders unveiled a new campaign bus and recently increased his TV commercial bookings, according to Kantar/CMAG.
Mr. Sanders's latest haul, which is expected to lead the Democratic pack, is the most that any 2020 Democratic candidate has raised in a single quarter, and highlights the strength of his small-dollar fundraising operation. The Vermont senator has raised about $96 million since entering the race in February, through five million donations that averaged $18, his campaign said.
Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have sworn off events where they woo donors who can give the legal maximum of $2,800. Instead, they are counting on an army of smaller contributors who give online. That is also how Mr. Sanders funded his 2016 bid, when he raised more than $230 million but lost the primary to Hillary Clinton.
Mr. Biden has raised $59.5 million since his late April kickoff. Mr. Biden's campaign said its average contribution amount for the fourth quarter was $41.
Mr. Trump's campaign didn't share information about its average donation size, but he has done well with small online donors in addition to bigger givers. In all, his campaign raised about $143 million last year.
His incumbency enables him to ask individual donors for as much as $360,600 each, money that gets doled out to both his own campaign and to his fundraising partners: the Republican National Committee and state GOP parties. The campaign didn't disclose the joint fundraising totals on Thursday.
The eventual Democratic nominee will also be able to create a bigger-ticket fundraising operation.
Sitting presidents almost always enjoy strong fundraising for re-election. Former President Barack Obama raised about $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2011, and former President George W. Bush raised $47.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2003, according to Federal Election Commission reports. Mr. Bush's campaign had almost $100 million in available cash at the start of his re-election year, the FEC reports show.
Mr. Trump gave himself an advantage by kicking off his re-election campaign the day he was inaugurated. While recent presidents typically have waited until their third year in office to return to the campaign trail, Mr. Trump immediately arranged to fundraise for re-election and never stopped holding the large political rallies that helped him win office in 2016.

WASHINGTON—President Trump's defense team plans to present the bulk of its argument in the
Senate impeachment trial
Monday, moving swiftly as representatives of both parties spar over whether more evidence should be introduced later this week.
After Democratic lawmakers took the maximum 24 hours over three days to
make their case for the president's removal
, Mr. Trump's lawyers
began their defense Saturday
. They argued over two hours that Democrats had failed to make a compelling case and were relying on circumstantial evidence to conclude that the Republican president had conditioned nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine on investigations that could benefit him politically.
The president's team plans to present arguments Monday beginning at 1 p.m. EST and likely wrapping up by about 8 p.m., according to a person familiar with the discussions.
Constitutional law professor Alan Dershowitz and former independent counsel Kenneth Starr will likely speak Monday, the person said. Depending on how the session goes, the team may not use its session on Tuesday, the last day it has to make arguments before senators begin their questioning.
After a day of questions, the Senate will vote on whether to call more witnesses.
Democrats have accused the president of abusing his office in seeking the Ukraine investigations and of obstructing Congress during its impeachment probe. They argue that testimony by figures including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and former national security adviser John Bolton, which has been blocked by the White House, would provide firsthand accounts of the president's actions and motivations.
The president's team this week is expected to argue he was justified in pressing Ukraine on investigations.
Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the lead House impeachment manager and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said Sunday on NBC that Republicans who oppose calling witnesses would be denying the public information that is relevant to the case.
""I think they're deathly afraid of what witnesses will have to say, and so their whole strategy has been deprive the public of a fair trial,"" Mr. Schiff said of Republicans. ""If they're successful in depriving the country of a fair trial, there is no exoneration.""
Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), a top ally of the president on Capitol Hill, told Fox News he fervently opposes hearing more testimony.
""If we seek witnesses, then we are going to throw the country into chaos,"" he said.
Sixty-six percent of Americans said the Senate should call witnesses to testify in Mr. Trump's impeachment trial, including 45% of Republicans, 65% of independents and 87% of Democrats, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll released on Friday.
Democrats would need four Republicans to vote with them for more witnesses, assuming all members of their caucus stick together. A handful of Republicans have signaled they are on the fence about the vote, among them Sens. Mitt Romney of Utah, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska.
If the Senate votes against calling more witnesses, it would proceed soon afterward to a vote on whether to convict or acquit the president. Mr. Trump faces little prospect of conviction, which requires a two-thirds majority of senators to remove him from office.
The president told aides he was pleased with his team's presentation Saturday, but over the weekend he lobbed insulting nicknames at top Democrats. He was in particular rebuked by Democrats on Sunday for a tweet he issued about Mr. Schiff saying ""he has not paid the price, yet, for what he has done to our Country.""
Mr. Schiff on NBC called the president ""wrathful and vindictive"" and added: ""I don't think there's any doubt about it. And if you think there is, look at the president's tweets about me today.""
Separate from the trial, new information has continued to emerge about the president's dealings with Ukraine. On Saturday, a lawyer for Lev Parnas, an associate of Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani,
released a 90-minute recording
that appeared to show Mr. Trump ordering the removal of the ambassador to Ukraine at a small 2018 dinner with donors.
Mr. Trump has denied knowing Mr. Parnas, who is under indictment for alleged campaign-finance violations, to which he has pleaded not guilty.
The former ambassador, Marie Yovanovitch,
testified during
about her removal, which Democrats argued was designed to clear the way for the Ukraine pressure campaign. Republicans portrayed her testimony as largely irrelevant to the impeachment inquiry.
Among other matters, the president's team is expected to say Mr. Trump was right to press Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic candidate for president, and his son, Hunter, the person familiar with the discussions said. They will argue that it was corrupt for the younger Mr. Biden to serve on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father as vice president was overseeing U.S. efforts to combat corruption in Ukraine. Neither Mr. Biden nor his son has been accused of wrongdoing, though Hunter Biden has said serving on the company's board while his father worked on anticorruption efforts showed poor judgment.
Republican lawmakers have echoed the president's calls for an investigation into the Bidens, which Democrats say amount to an effort by the White House to enlist a foreign country's help in interfering in this year's election.
In addition, Mr. Dershowitz is expected to argue that the House's articles of impeachment would have been rejected by the Constitution's framers as too open-ended.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you think each party is utilizing the impeachment trial in the coming presidential election? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Dershowitz has been criticized in recent weeks for his argument that a president must have committed a crime to be removed from office, a key contention by the president's lawyers. During former President Clinton's impeachment trial, Mr. Dershowitz said a crime wasn't required for impeachment.
On ""Fox News Sunday,"" Mr. Dershowitz was asked by host Chris Wallace why he changed his position on the prerequisites for impeachment. Mr. Wallace played a clip of his comments during the Clinton trial.
""I did say that then,"" Mr. Dershowitz said. But, he added, ""I've been immersing myself in dusty old books and I've concluded that, no, it has to be a crime.""
Mr. Wallace appeared skeptical. ""You're too good a lawyer not to have studied that back in 1998,"" he said.

WASHINGTON—In the brewing battle for control of the U.S. Senate, both Democrats and Republicans hope to get a political boost from
the impeachment trial
of President Trump, with each side pointing to energized bases and record fundraising.
Democrats must gain three seats to take control of the Senate, if they win the White House, too. If Mr. Trump is re-elected, Democrats need to net four seats to overcome a tiebreaking vote by Vice President Mike Pence.
Democrats have an inherent advantage over the GOP this election cycle that has nothing to do with impeachment: Republicans are defending more seats. There are 23 Republican-held seats up in 2020, compared with 12 Democratic-held seats.
After the Senate voted, largely along party lines, to acquit Mr. Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters that in all of Republicans' competitive Senate races,
GOP candidates
were in better shape than they had been a month earlier. ""I think you'd have to conclude from this episode that we won and they lost,"" he said.
That was the opposite of how the Senate's Democratic leader, Chuck Schumer, saw it. He said impeachment had been a positive force for Democrats.
""Contrary to what Leader McConnell said, our data shows every one of the Republicans in difficult races is hurting because of it,"" Mr. Schumer said.
Still, November is a long way off, and the fallout from impeachment could be ancient history in political terms by the time voters head to the polls. ""There are many things that will occur between now and the fall,"" Mr. McConnell acknowledged.
The week after Mr. Trump's
acquittal by the Senate
, Gallup reported Mr. Trump's job approval at an all-time high of 49%. Only one Republican, Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, had crossed the aisle to vote with Democrats
to convict and remove
Mr. Trump from office on a charge of improperly withholding aid to pressure Ukraine to launch investigations that would help the president politically.
Republicans are trusting in the president's post-impeachment popularity bump to supercharge enthusiasm for Republicans down-ballot.
Democrats say that the 2020 election is going to be fought over voters' pocketbook concerns, such as prescription drug costs and health care, and that is where they will focus their 2020 messaging. But they are hopeful that independent and moderate voters in swing states will view the impeachment acquittal of Mr. Trump as a sign that Republican senators won't stand up to the White House and hold Mr. Trump accountable when necessary.
Nathan Gonzales, editor and publisher of Inside Elections, is skeptical that a marginal uptick in Mr. Trump's approval rating is enough to fundamentally change the dynamic of any race.
""Much of the Trump factor is baked into the cake,"" Mr. Gonzales said. ""Of course, in close races, everything matters. So if a race is decided by a few thousand votes, then an uptick for Trump could matter. But distinguishing that from a bunch of other factors would be difficult.""
The nonpartisan publication Cook Political changed only one Senate race rating post-impeachment, downgrading the Democratic-held Senate seat in Alabama from tossup to ""leans Republican"" after incumbent Sen. Doug Jones voted to convict and remove the president.
""He was sort of damned if you do, damned if you don't,"" said Jessica Taylor, who analyzes Senate and House races for Cook. ""The tides were against him for re-election, and this was sort of maybe the final nail.""

Ms. Taylor said she would have downgraded Mr. Jones's chances anyway, for non-impeachment-related reasons. Mr. Jones has an uphill fight to win a state where Mr. Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton, 62%-34% in 2016.
Republican senators facing the toughest re-election fights this year include Martha McSally of Arizona, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Thom Tillis of North Carolina. All three represent states that will be competitive in the presidential election, which is sure to energize core voters in both parties. All three opposed allowing witnesses or documents in the Senate trial, and they all voted to acquit Mr. Trump.
In the weeks after the impeachment votes, they still are hewing close to the president. Mr. Tillis appeared alongside Mr. Trump at a rally in Charlotte, N.C., two days after the acquittal, Ms. McSally will join the president at a rally in Phoenix, on Wednesday, and Mr. Gardner will attend Mr. Trump's rally in Colorado Springs, Colo., on Thursday.
Joining Mr. Trump on the campaign trail might help senators such as Mr. Gardner and Ms. McSally raise money, Ms. Taylor said. Both have been outraised by their Democratic competitors.
""For these Republicans, once you've gone down that road [supporting Mr. Trump] you really can't go back,"" said Ms. Taylor. ""The Democrats would all tie them to Trump, anyway. They would only get the benefit of the base that Trump can bring by running alongside him.""
Ms. McSally is leaning hard into her pro-Trump stance. Her campaign aired its first 2020 TV ad this month, attacking her Democratic opponent Mark Kelly for supporting impeachment. Mr. Kelly has outraised Ms. McSally for four quarters in a row, and now has a $6 million cash advantage over her.
In Colorado, former Democratic Gov. John Hickenlooper outraised Mr. Gardner in the last quarter of 2019, $2.8 million to $2 million. In Maine, Democrat Sara Gideon outraised Ms. Collins, $3.5 million to $2.3 million. Mr. Gardner and Ms. Collins still have bigger campaign war chests than their competitors, however.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Which party do you think will garner the most momentum for the elections? Why? Join the conversation below.
In Michigan, a state Mr. Trump narrowly won in 2016, Republican John James, who is trying to unseat Democratic incumbent Sen. Gary Peters, raised $3.5 million in the fourth quarter, outstripping the $2.5 million raised by Mr. Peters. Mr. Peters has $2 million more cash in hand than Mr. James.
Two wild cards are the Senate seats in
Kansas
and
Georgia
, vacated by retiring GOP senators Pat Roberts and Johnny Isakson, respectively. Bitter clashes in those states among Republicans vying against each other have national Republicans worried that the infighting could work to Democrats' advantage.

WASHINGTON—Former national security adviser John Bolton said he would testify in a Senate impeachment trial if subpoenaed, potentially lining up a central witness to President Trump's pressure on Ukraine to investigate a political rival and jolting a process that has bogged down in procedural disputes.
Mr. Bolton's Monday statement adds pressure on Republicans to call the former official who has conveyed that he has new information about the White House's Ukraine policy that could shed light on the investigation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) hasn't committed to calling witnesses in the impeachment trial, and the White House has objected to new testimony.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What impact do you think John Bolton's testimony would have in the Senate impeachment trial? Join the conversation below.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) has held off on sending the
approved articles of impeachment
to the Senate pending more clarity on the rules of the Senate trial, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has demanded the Senate subpoena documents and testimony from the White House.
It would take a simple majority of the Senate's 100 senators to approve any new witnesses, meaning four Republicans would be needed if all 47 Democrats backed new testimony.
""Since my testimony is once again at issue, I have had to resolve the serious competing issues as best I could, based on careful consideration and study. I have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify,""
Mr. Bolton said in a statement.
He noted that he had weighed Mr. Trump's objection to his testimony against Congress's request that he testify about the White House's Ukraine policy.

[Read John Bolton's statement here]

The Democratic-led House
approved abuse-of-power and obstruction-of-Congress articles
in December alleging that the president abused his office and tried to enlist a foreign power to help him in this year's election. The chamber had sought Mr. Bolton's testimony but moved forward with articles of impeachment
when he resisted testifying.

Mr. McConnell said Monday that Democrats are ""toying"" with the impeachment process and reiterated his position that requests for witnesses should be addressed after the trial begins, as during former President Clinton's impeachment.
""That was good enough for President Clinton, so it ought to be good enough for President Trump. Fair is fair,"" he said on the Senate floor.
New witness material was used in the Clinton impeachment, after approval by the Senate. On Monday, Republicans seemed wary about introducing new information for this case.
""Our inquiry should be limited to whatever evidence or testimony they used when they voted on the articles of impeachment,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.). ""If the House thinks there's additional testimony and so forth then they could take the item up again.""
Mr. Trump has said he did nothing wrong, tweeting on Monday that the impeachment process was a ""con game by the Dems to help with the Election!""

Former Russia Adviser Testifies She Was Alarmed About Ukraine Pressure
(Oct. 14)
Mr. Bolton, according to testimony from other witnesses in the House impeachment investigation,
was alarmed at a parallel Ukraine policy
overseen by Mr. Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani aimed at pressuring Kyiv to investigate 2016 election interference and the family of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Mr. Bolton referred to the matter as a ""drug deal,"" according to the
testimony of Fiona Hill
, who had been Mr. Bolton's top Eurasia specialist.
Mr. Bolton, whom
Mr. Trump fired in September
after nearly a year and a half on the job, ""was personally involved in many of the events, meetings, and conversations""
about the Ukraine matter
""as well as many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far,"" Mr. Bolton's attorney Charles Cooper wrote to the House's general counsel, Douglas Letter, in November.
Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) said he would be open to hearing from Mr. Bolton, anticipating he might vindicate the president.
""My suspicion is that he would be a good witness for the president, from the standpoint of saying that what the president has been impeached for is a difference over how to conduct foreign policy,"" he said.
Mr. Schumer has called for hearing from three new witnesses besides Mr. Bolton: acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney; Mr. Mulvaney's aide Robert Blair; and Office of Management and Budget official Michael Duffey.
Mr. Bolton's acknowledgment of the Senate's power to compel him to appear sidesteps a brewing conflict between the branches of government over their rights and privileges in the impeachment proceedings. Precedent on whether a president can invoke legal privilege over documents or testimony in an impeachment process, particularly a Senate trial, is scant.
In 1974, the Nixon Justice Department concluded that ""a constitutional confrontation of the highest magnitude would ensue"" if a president tried to withhold information or testimony from the Congress in an impeachment trial by claiming executive privilege over the objection of the Senate.
Mr. McConnell hasn't ruled out hearing from witnesses. Over the break, two Senate Republicans—
Lisa Murkowski of Alaska
and
Susan Collins of Maine
—indicated they would bring an independent mind-set to a trial, suggesting that witnesses could be called if enough Republicans vote for motions by Democrats to subpoena witnesses or documents.
In the House impeachment testimony, witnesses described Mr. Bolton as hostile to the Ukraine pressure campaign. According to witnesses, Mr. Bolton abruptly ended a July 10 White House meeting with Ukrainian government officials after U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland linked a meeting between Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and Mr. Trump to Ukraine's willingness to announced investigations that Mr. Trump sought.
During the House probe, Mr. Bolton maintained that he wouldn't appear voluntarily in that investigation. If a judge were to determine he doesn't have immunity from being forced to testify, he would likely have no choice but to comply with a subpoena, a person familiar with his thinking said last year.
In his statement Monday explaining his decision, Mr. Bolton said he believed he had run out of time on seeking a judicial ruling. ""It now falls to the Senate to fulfill its Constitutional obligation to try impeachments, and it does not appear possible that a final judicial resolution of the still-unanswered Constitutional questions can be obtained before the Senate acts.""

WASHINGTON—Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said Thursday that the nation needs to harness a comprehensive public-health and economic response to the coronavirus, offering a look at how he would address a crisis in the White House.
The former vice president, in a speech near his home in Wilmington, Del., said the nation must respond aggressively to combat the spread of the disease, with practices and staff he described as grounded in science.
He said President Trump's labeling of the outbreak as a ""foreign virus"" during a Wednesday night Oval Office address ""does not displace accountability for the misjudgments that have been taken thus far by the Trump administration.""
""Let me be crystal clear, the coronavirus does not have a political affiliation,"" Mr. Biden said. ""It will infect Republicans, independents and Democrats alike.""
The former vice president outlined a new plan to fight the virus, saying the U.S. should lead a coordinated, global response that prepares hospitals and public-health workers and responds to the economic fallout. ""President Trump is welcome to adopt all of it today,"" he said.
Mr. Trump's campaign said in response that the president had ""acted early and decisively"" to fight the virus, and he had put the U.S. ""on stronger footing than other nations.""
""His every move has been aimed at keeping Americans safe, while Joe Biden has sought to capitalize politically and stoke citizens' fears,"" Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, said.
The image of Mr. Biden standing before a backdrop of American flags in a conference room at the Hotel DuPont aimed to project steadiness and serve as a counterweight to Mr. Trump, who has been accused by Democrats of providing a halting response to the outbreak.
It came as the coronavirus has forced the presidential campaigns of Mr. Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Mr. Trump to curtail their public activities. Mr. Biden canceled events in Ohio, Florida and Illinois this week; the campaign is planning ""virtual"" events in Chicago and Miami in coming days.
Mr. Biden's campaign said in an internal memo Thursday that all staff at its Philadelphia headquarters and around the country would work from home beginning Saturday. The campaign will continue to hold smaller events such as round-tables and house parties, but all fundraisers ""will become virtual fundraisers indefinitely.""
Mr. Sanders also addressed the pandemic in a speech in Burlington, Vt., using it to highlight Medicare for All, one of his signature policies. He said even without a single-payer health-care system, the government needed to provide care at no cost.
Mr. Trump, meanwhile, canceled a trip to Colorado and Nevada, including an appearance at a Republican Jewish Coalition event in Las Vegas. That event has since been postponed.
The president has publicly and privately chafed at postponing rallies and had largely defended continuing them as the virus escalated. The campaign had recently been looking at holding a rally in Tampa, but hadn't announced any plans as some allies grew concerned that Mr. Trump should put the activity on pause.
Speaking to reporters Thursday, Mr. Trump said the campaign had been looking at ""four or five"" rallies, adding that the never-announced event in Tampa was ""all sold out.""
""I think we'll probably not do it, because people would say it's better to not do. You know, we need a little separation until such time as this goes away,"" Mr. Trump said. ""It's going to go away. It's going to go away.""
Mr. Biden's speech came at a pivot point for his campaign as it readies for a likely general election battle against the president. Mr. Biden on Thursday installed Jennifer O'Malley Dillon,
a top former Obama campaign aide, as his new campaign manager
, succeeding Greg Schultz, who will focus on planning for the general election.
Mr. Biden's remarks effectively were a response to the Oval Office address of Mr. Trump, who announced a 30-day ban on most travel from Europe to the U.S.
The former vice president said Americans should have access to free testing for the virus, especially the elderly living in nursing homes, and said the nation needed to swiftly develop a vaccine for coronavirus.
Mr. Biden said the country also needed a strong economic response, and urged Congress to press for emergency paid leave for workers affected by the outbreak, an expansion and broadening of unemployment benefits and temporary loans for small businesses dealing with revenue shortfalls.
Some of those steps, including paid leave, have been pushed by the president, who has said workers affected by the virus should be able to ""stay home without fear of financial hardship."" The president has also pressed for payroll-tax relief and said the Small Business Administration will soon offer low-interest loans to small businesses.
Mr. Biden's campaign announced Wednesday its own advisory committee on coronavirus, bringing together several former Obama officials to provide what he described as science-based, expert advice on ways the campaign can minimize health risks for the candidate, staff and supporters.
But more than simply advising the campaign, the list of people served as a preview of the type of administration Mr. Biden might assemble if elected.
The committee includes former Obama homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco, Dr. David Kessler, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and Dr. Vivek Murthy, who served as the nation's surgeon general.
Mr. Biden ""was there during the economic crisis, he oversaw the bailout. He's been there,"" said Dr. Zeke Emanuel, an advisory committee member and a vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania. ""More importantly, no single person can address these issues.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu dropped his
bid for parliamentary immunity
from prosecution on corruption charges, exposing the embattled leader to a possible trial that would decide his personal and political future.
Mr. Netanyahu was indicted in November on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust in connection with three corruption probes, making him the first Israeli prime minister to be criminally charged while in office. He denies wrongdoing and asked lawmakers to grant him immunity from the charges earlier this month. The request paused the indictment process ahead of an election in March, the third such vote in a year. But parliamentary discussion of his immunity request threatened to keep the issue central to the election campaign.
The Israeli premier announced his retraction in a Facebook post on Tuesday, an hour before parliament was set to vote on key measures that would have likely led to his immunity request being denied. A majority of lawmakers had vowed to refuse him protection from prosecution.
Mr. Netanyahu, who is in Washington for the unveiling of President Trump's
Middle East peace plan
, said he didn't want the ensuing debate over his immunity to overshadow that event Tuesday. People briefed on the contents of the peace plan described it as heavily tilted toward the Israeli position on key issues.
""At this fateful hour for the people of Israel, at a time when I'm in the U.S. for a historic mission to shape Israel's permanent borders and secure its safety for the coming generations, another show of the removing immunity circus is expected in parliament,"" Mr. Netanyahu wrote on his Facebook page.
With the immunity request withdrawn, Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit filed the indictment against the prime minister with Jerusalem's district court, his office said.
The court will decide when the trial begins. Some legal analysts say it is unlikely to start before the next election because of the unprecedented nature of indicting a sitting prime minister.
Mr. Netanyahu can't seek parliamentary immunity from the current indictment again and would still face trial if he wins the coming election.
His legal troubles have contributed to a period of political paralysis in Israel. Neither Mr. Netanyahu nor his political rivals were able to form a government after back-to-back elections in April and September, with the country bitterly divided over whether Mr. Netanyahu should continue as leader while facing corruption allegations.
The prime minister has vowed to continue fighting the charges, which he has described as a witch hunt. He retains the support of his Likud party and other right-wing political allies, having won a party leadership vote in December by a large margin.
Parliament's discussion of his immunity request on Tuesday was scheduled well before Mr. Netanyahu announced his plan to travel to Washington.
By withdrawing the call for immunity, Mr. Netanyahu appears to have avoided a possible parliamentary defeat and weeks of discussions about his legal troubles that could have dented his re-election campaign.
Benny Gantz, Mr. Netanyahu's main political rival who
met President Trump at the White House
on Monday to discuss the peace plan, said Israelis should consider the sitting prime minister's legal troubles when voting in the March election.
""Netanyahu is going to trial. Before the citizens of Israel is a clear choice: a prime minister who will work for them or a prime minister who is busy with himself,"" Mr. Gantz, who is leader of the Blue and White party, wrote in a tweet.
Political opponents accuse Mr. Netanyahu of striving to stay in power at any cost—including dragging Israel into a new election cycle—to preside over a government that would be more likely to grant him immunity from prosecution.
The most serious charge he faces, that of bribery, carries a potential penalty of up to 10 years in prison.
Still, some analysts suggest the prime minister's large and committed base won't be deterred by legal proceedings against him, while others say he might seek a plea deal. The latest polls indicate Israeli voters will stick to previous voting patterns in March, likely leading to another hung parliament.

WASHINGTON—To lay the groundwork for
an expected Senate impeachment trial
, the White House sent a full black Suburban to the Capitol earlier this month.
Inside were members of President Trump's impeachment team, including aides from legislative affairs and communications offices. Crammed into the back row was a triumvirate of attorneys: White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his top deputies, Patrick Philbin and Mike Purpura.
In the three months since the impeachment inquiry began,
the counsel's office
has spearheaded the White House's response, writing blistering letters to Democrats declining to cooperate with their demands for documents, arguing that witnesses need not testify before the House and meeting with Republican senators to prepare for a trial, expected next month.
Though Mr. Trump has solicited advice elsewhere, resulting in competing bids for influence by aides, the president has chiefly relied on Mr. Cipollone for impeachment strategy, officials say. He has been a near-constant presence in Mr. Trump's office in recent weeks.
The two have developed a close bond and sometimes converse with a shorthand born of their familiarity, one official said: ""They are stapled to each other's side.""
Pat Cipollone
* Named White House counsel in October 2018
* Fox News host Laura Ingraham introduced him and Mr. Trump in 2016. He helped Mr. Trump prepare for debates against Democrat Hillary Clinton.
* Served in the Justice Department during William Barr's first stint as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush
* Worked at Kirkland and Ellis, a Washington law firm where Mr. Barr once served as counsel, before becoming a partner at Stein, Mitchell, Cipollone, Beato and Missner
* Earned $6.7 million a year before joining the White House, according to his most recent personal financial disclosure
* Father of 10
Mr. Cipollone and his deputies started laying the groundwork for a defense with key senators in September, within days of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) announcing the impeachment probe. Three months later, the shape of a Senate trial remains unclear, in part because Mr. Trump has told allies that he wants a short trial but also a lengthy list of witnesses.
The talks are now centered around a format in which the White House and House Democrats would present their cases, and votes would follow on key questions such as whether to call for fresh testimony, according to people familiar with the discussions.
Mr. Cipollone, a longtime litigator with little political experience, is reserved and often keeps his cards close to the vest. Until recently, he was reluctant to share details of his legal strategy with
Republicans on Capitol Hill
or even within the White House, according to officials in both places.
Initially, he told senators little beyond promising to pass along their points to the president, while telling associates he wanted to avoid trying the case until he got in front of a jury, according to officials. More recently, he has been willing to acknowledge potential complications for controversial witnesses, according to people familiar with the talks.
Some expect him to defend the president effectively when the trial comes. ""He's a fierce and effective litigator, and he's going to dissect and disembowel the other side's case,"" said Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel during the Clinton impeachment who worked with Mr. Cipollone at Kirkland & Ellis, a Washington law firm.
Others have questioned his strategy of not cooperating with House Democrats, which provided fodder for the accusation that Mr. Trump obstructed Congress, one of the
two articles of impeachment
passed by the House.
A report released by impeachment investigators in December called Mr. Cipollone's explanation of why the White House wouldn't cooperate ""remarkably politicized"" and unsupported by the constitution and legal precedent.
Mr. Cipollone's team views itself as the protector of executive privilege, which allows the president, under certain circumstances, to shield material from public or congressional scrutiny. The lawyers are working in close coordination with the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, which writes administration legal opinions that have backed the White House's moves.
Pat Philbin
* Served in the Justice Department in the George W. Bush administration, overseeing investigations into espionage, counterterrorism and counterintelligence and applications for electronic surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
* He and James Comey, then deputy attorney general, famously rushed to the bedside of then-attorney general John Ashcroft to keep him from approving a warrantless wiretap program.
* Worked at Kirkland & Ellis
* Joined counsel's office in January 2019
Lawyers from the counsel's office contacted attorneys for witnesses requested by House investigators to argue why executive privilege applied, though they didn't press the matter if witnesses indicated they wanted to testify, according to lawyers for the witnesses.
Ultimately, 17 witnesses testified in the impeachment hearings but several senior White House officials declined to appear.
Mr. Cipollone took over the counsel's office after Democrats seized control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections. He increased the staff of 19 to about 40, bringing in lawyers with experience in trials and government investigations in anticipation of more confrontational relations with Congress.
The president has indicated that Mr. Cipollone would lead his legal defense team but is considering adding others with the television experience he values. Under consideration are Jay Sekulow, one of the president's personal lawyers, and Alan Dershowitz, a professor emeritus at Harvard Law School and TV commentator, officials said. The White House is also considering adding some of the president's staunchest defenders on the House Intelligence and Judiciary committees to the Senate trial team, according to a person familiar with the deliberations.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you think President Trump's legal team can put together an effective defense? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Dershowitz's appointment could be complicated by a defamation suit filed against him in April by a woman who says she was a victim of Jeffrey Epstein and was forced to have sex with his friends, including Mr. Dershowitz. Mr. Dershowitz has countersued for defamation and infliction of emotional distress, saying her accusations were fabricated and baseless.
Mr. Cipollone brings a collaborative and protective instinct to his work, relying on his assembled team of accomplished lawyers while fending off efforts to add some additional high-profile attorneys to the impeachment defense. He has influenced many of the key moments in the strategy so far, at times over the objections of other senior officials or without including key staff.
His advice that the president release the transcript of Mr. Trump's July 25 call with the Ukrainian president—which formed the basis of a whistleblower complaint that helped set off the impeachment inquiry—was opposed by other senior members of the administration, according to White House officials.
Mr. Cipollone's legal team also sketched out a communications plan without first consulting Stephanie Grisham, the White House press secretary, the officials said. The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Cipollone clashed with Mick Mulvaney, the acting chief of staff, according to White House officials.
Mike Purpura
* Former prosecutor in the Southern District of New York
* Joined White House counsel's office in 2007 under George W. Bush administration
* In that role, worked for Emmet Flood, who at the time held the role Mr. Purpura now occupies and later became the top White House lawyer in Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation
* Worked in Hawaii before joining the counsel's office in January 2019
Mr. Cipollone and his team helped Mr. Mulvaney prepare for a press briefing this fall and were furious when Mr. Mulvaney connected the president's decision to hold up aid to Ukraine to his desire for Ukraine to open investigations that could benefit Mr. Trump politically, according to White House officials.
Mr. Mulvaney later the same day issued a statement contradicting his own remarks.
Mr. Mulvaney's team has said that Mr. Cipollone should have acted faster and alerted others in the West Wing this summer when he first heard concerns from national security staff about the president's Ukraine call, administration officials said.
The counsel's office hasn't led on all the prominent moves. A six-page letter the president sent to Mrs. Pelosi on Dec. 17 comparing impeachment to the Salem witch trials was written by Eric Ueland, the White House legislative affairs director, and senior adviser Stephen Miller. Mr. Philbin and others submitted edits to a draft but not all were incorporated, according to one official.
Still, the center of gravity for the impeachment response remains the White House counsel's office, even as the war-room is a one-man operation inside the Oval Office.
""He's doing a great job,"" Mr. Trump said about Mr. Cipollone in the Oval Office this month. ""Pat has been fantastic.""

Bernie Sanders, in a final ad ahead of Monday's Iowa caucus, touts universal health care and free college, dismissing moderate alternatives to his ambitious agenda as mere half-measures.
Joe Biden, in his own ad, responds with warnings about moving too far left: ""This is no time to take a risk.""
The two 30-second spots frame the stakes for the U.S. economy. As Democratic voters choose a nominee to challenge President Trump in November,
starting in Iowa
, they will choose between two visions: a continuation of the more market-oriented approaches of the past two Democratic presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, or a more full-throated revival of the earlier, sweeping visions for big government, such as Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal and Lyndon Johnson's Great Society.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Will Democratic voters choose center-left or far-left policies to take on the platform of President Trump? Why? Join the conversation below.
National and early-state polls suggest
Democrats are divided
. Roughly half support one of the self-proclaimed pragmatists, a group including former Vice President Biden, former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg. Vermont Sen. Sanders, a democratic socialist, leads the bigger-government camp, joined by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
Most Democrats say they are hungry to oust Mr. Trump and
will unify around the eventual nominee
. But many worry the big ideological divisions could be hard to bridge this year, just as lingering acrimony with Sen. Sanders's camp hampered Hillary Clinton's bid in 2016. ""The question is whether we have an economic message that can win over at least half the country,"" says Jim Kessler, executive vice president at Third Way, a Washington think tank seeking middle ground between liberal goals of more equality with more business-friendly policies.
Moderates tout Mr. Clinton's 1992 ""New Democrats"" agenda of keeping the deficit in check, promoting growth, targeted tax cuts, job training and free trade. They cite the resulting Clinton boom of the 1990s, and also the recovery from the great financial crisis under Mr. Obama.
Before Mr. Clinton, Democrats lost five of the previous six presidential elections, the moderates note. Since Mr. Clinton, they won four of seven—and captured the popular vote twice even in those losses.
The moderates attribute such gains to the party's move to the center. ""If Democrats are seen as too far left,"" Mr. Kessler says, ""then Donald Trump wins re-election.""
Progressives, by contrast, are casting the 2020 election as a chance not just to retake the White House, but to smash the longstanding economic model they blame for stoking income and wealth inequality during the past four decades, even amid economic expansions.
In a recent report framing the intra-party ideological battle lines, the Roosevelt Institute—a progressive New York think tank seeking to define a 21st-century version of FDR's New Deal—calls the centrist approach as much a threat as Mr. Trump, and criticizes Democrats who seek ""policy tweaks rather than wholesale reforms.""
The Democratic field is, in fact, united over a number of policies that would move the party leftward. Candidates from both wings call for trillions of dollars in new federal spending on health care, child care and higher education. They agree on reorienting the American economy away from fossil fuels by mid-century.
They all support doubling the federal hourly minimum wage and giving labor unions new organizing powers. They rarely warn about the dangers of government debt and deficits, a major focus of the Clinton and Obama administrations. And
they all call for expanding Social Security
and Medicare and for higher taxes on corporations and capital gains.
Republicans say any leading Democrat would ""tank the economy, ruin health care, raise taxes,"" as Tim Murtaugh, communications director for Mr. Trump's re-election campaign, put it in commenting on the final pre-Iowa caucus debate Jan. 14.
While Democrats are all vilified by their GOP opponents, they differ sharply among themselves over what they believe ails the economy and how far they would go to fix it. Mr. Biden tends
to portray Mr. Trump as the main problem
to be solved. He envisions repealing many of the president's programs and replacing them with an updated version of Obama-era policies, adapted to new challenges.
Sanders-Warren backers see Mr. Trump as a symptom of deeper woes, of the desperation of long-struggling voters disaffected by the recent economic prescriptions of both parties. They say the party can only win back support with sweeping changes curbing the power of big corporations and the wealthy. Mr. Sanders portrays good-paying jobs, health care, education and affordable housing as not just policy goals, but as government-guaranteed economic rights.
According to a Wall Street Journal analysis of public statements by the candidates, Mr. Biden more frequently uses words like ""growth"" and ""opportunity,"" while Sens. Sanders and Warren are the most likely to invoke terms like ""billionaire,"" ""Wall Street"" and ""rigged.""
While Messrs. Biden and Buttigieg hold regular big-dollar fundraisers with affluent Democratic business donors, Sens. Warren and Sanders refuse to do so. They have largely avoided the veteran Clinton and Obama economic advisers who have shaped the Biden and Buttigieg plans. In mid-January, 18 liberal activist groups urged unity among Sens. Sanders and Warren backers in fighting what they called ""the corporate wing of the party.""

This Year's Iowa Caucuses Are Different. Here's How They'll Work.

The main economic flashpoints in the contest so far have been the progressive wing's support of universal government health care, free college and taxes on the wealthy, policies that would increase federal taxes and spending by tens of trillions of dollars over the next decade—more than triple the amounts proposed by their more-moderate rivals.
Wealth-tax proponents see it not only as a means to pay for their big-ticket items, but also to curb the power of the rich. Opponents say the tax is inefficient, unconstitutional and unnecessarily vilifies success. Liberals, meantime, say the private health insurance market is so broken that only a fully government-run system can replace it. The moderate camp continues to favor a blend between the public and private sectors.
In the free-college debate, liberals want to expand the roster of universal entitlements as a way of building broad-based public support, while moderates warn of excessive costs.
""We have an obligation to be fiscally responsible,"" Ms. Klobuchar said in the December Democratic debate in Los Angeles, making sure voters understand the party is ""honest with them about what we can pay for.""

Facebook's Relationship With Democrats Hits Low Point

The economic policy divide extends to less prominent issues as well. Both Sens. Klobuchar and Warren have sought to bolster antitrust policies to curb corporate power. But Ms. Klobuchar's platform calls for toughening the process—to ""update the standards for reviewing … mergers,"" and ""to undertake aggressive retrospective review of mergers.""
Ms. Warren promises clear results on antitrust: ""My administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector,"" she says, ""including breaking up Amazon, Facebook and Google.""
While all the main candidates float new regulations for industries from pharmaceuticals to fossil fuels, Ms. Warren is the only one with a broad blueprint for overhauling American business: requiring a federal charter for all big companies, limiting the ability of executives to sell shares, and setting aside 40% of all board seats for worker-elected directors.
That type of expansive agenda has sparked a backlash from the Democratic economic establishment. Speaking at a Brookings Institution panel in Washington on Tuesday, Harvard economist Lawrence Summers labeled the types of ideas promoted by Sens. Warren and Sanders as fanciful. A leading architect of Clinton and Obama economic policies, he said: ""What we should not do is launch untried, massive experiments.""

When the Democratic National Committee decided to move its convention up to mid-July—roughly two weeks earlier than in 2016—it was billed as a way to give the party's nominee more time to focus on President Trump and spend general election dollars earlier.
The
coronavirus pandemic
is making that move seem riskier in retrospect, as Democrats face the possibility that much of the nation will be hunkered down for weeks or months to come. The earlier timetable is placing greater pressure on the party to decide whether the convention will move forward as planned.
Organizers of the Milwaukee gathering held hastily scheduled calls last week with groups involved in planning to discuss contingency scenarios, people familiar with the discussions said. Options mentioned on some of the calls included shortening the four-day convention by a day or holding a mostly remote event.
DNC spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said the committee is ""not considering a rules change at this time,"" which would be required for a remote option to move forward. Chairman Tom Perez also said earlier this month that such changes weren't in the works.
Fundraisers began offering suite packages weeks ago to top donors, some of the people said. As uncertainty grows, some donors have asked if they can get their money back if the convention doesn't move forward as planned, one of the people said. Ms. Hinojosa said the party isn't aware of any such requests.
A Democratic aide said conversations about the coronavirus response are being held by several different groups involved in aspects of convention planning.
The convention is scheduled to start July 13 and is expected to attract about 50,000 attendees. Democrats
chose the battleground state of Wisconsin
, hoping to win it back after President Trump became the first Republican to carry the state since Ronald Reagan in 1984.
The Democratic convention is set to start 42 days earlier than the Republican gathering. An earlier convention is important from a
fundraising perspective
because candidates can raise money for both the primary and general election during the primary, but they cannot spend the general election dollars until they are formally the nominee. Mr. Trump, who didn't face serious opposition in this year's primaries, and Republicans have been filling their campaign war chest for the general election as Democrats have been spending on the nominating contest.
Across the U.S., efforts to contain the novel coronavirus have escalated. A number of large gatherings, including business conferences, music festivals and sporting events,
have been canceled
due to concerns about the spread of the virus.
Blair Ellis, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Convention planned for late August in Charlotte, N.C., declined to answer questions about whether specific contingency plans are being discussed or donors are asking questions. That gathering is also expected to draw about 50,000 people.
""We recognize and will take additional steps to ensure the safety and health of all attendees in light of the spread of Covid-19 and will continue to communicate with federal, state and local health experts in our planning,"" she said in a statement. ""We have fantastic partners in Charlotte and beyond helping us plan a successful convention.""
For the Democrats, the compressed timetable is also setting up a potentially intense electoral period in early June, when several states have decided to hold primaries that were
pushed back because of the pandemic
. That is just more than a month before the start of the convention.
Many states have also pushed back their congressional district and state conventions, where delegates are formally selected to attend the national convention.
The DNC has established a June 9 deadline for state parties to finish holding primaries or caucuses. Eight states are now set for June 2, while Louisiana and Kentucky are later in the month and past the deadline. States that hold nominating contests past the deadline will need a DNC waiver to keep from losing their full share of delegates.
There are also basic logistical questions. Some of the hotels in southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois that are to house the expected guests are nearly shut down or closed due to the virus, and many workers at those properties have been laid off. Contracts have been signed with hotels to provide the needed rooms, a Democratic aide said.
Greg Hanis, president of the consulting firm Hospitality Marketers International, said it could take a month or so for properties to come back online after a closure and that some smaller entities may not survive if the downturn lasts too long. There is considerable worry among hotel operators in the area about the potential loss of business, he said.
""The logistics of this is totally up in the air,"" Mr. Hanis said. ""Where will these people go, if there are 11th-hour closures of hotels?""

President Trump offered up plenty of greatest hits and some surprise flourishes for his third
State of the Union address
.
Seeking to set the tone as he moves
past impeachment
and toward the general election, the president
focused on familiar messages
on the economy, national security and immigration.
But the night was as notable for the sharp partisan divides evident in the room as for the topic he pointedly left out.
Here are some key takeaways:
What Impeachment?
A day before an expected impeachment acquittal vote in the Republican-controlled Senate, Mr. Trump sought to keep the speech focused on his accomplishments rather than the rancorous impeachment process.
But while the speech sought a lofty tone, Mr. Trump is unlikely to keep it that way. He has vigorously derided the impeachment during his campaign rallies as a ""witch hunt"" and a ""hoax.""
""You know, we're having probably the best years that we've ever had in the history of our country, and I just got impeached. Can you believe these people?"" he said in Iowa last week.
Mr. Trump followed the example of a previous president who addressed the nation amid impeachment. In 1999, President Clinton faced a similar challenge after he was impeached by the Republican-controlled House for perjury and obstruction of justice as he sought to cover up his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
Mr. Clinton also avoided all mention of impeachment.
It's the Economy
Mr. Trump kicked off his State of the Union address highlighting economic gains under his administration and trying to draw a contrast with the Obama administration.
""Jobs are booming. Incomes are soaring. Poverty is plummeting,"" he said, adding, ""the years of economic decay are over.""
The U.S. economy has been growing since the end of the last recession in 2009, albeit at a pace that lagged behind previous economic expansions. Mr. Trump argued that his policies—a reversal of what he called the ""failed"" policies of President Obama—have given the economy an extra boost.
Most economic statistics, including on growth, unemployment and poverty, have been steadily improving since 2009. Growth has continued under Mr. Trump, and the unemployment rate has kept ticking lower, hitting a 50-year low of 3.5%.
December's jobs report
capped a decade of payroll gains—the longest stretch in 80 years of record-keeping.
The Commerce Department last week said fourth-quarter
GDP rose 2.1%
, the same pace as the previous quarter—a steady pace, but well below the 3% growth rate Mr. Trump promised.
Political Partisanship
While Mr. Trump sought at times to strike a unifying tone, the tensions with Democrats after the rancorous impeachment process were on full display.
Ahead of his remarks, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appeared to reach out her hand to the president, who didn't shake it. At the conclusion of his address, Mrs. Pelosi stood behind the president and ripped up the remarks.
The political division was also clear throughout the room. When the president's entrance was announced, loud cheering and whistles broke out on the Republican side of the aisle, while many Democrats stood quietly, not clapping. Republicans then started chanting, ""Four More Years,"" clapping in unison.
During the remarks, when Mr. Trump said, ""The state of our union is stronger than ever before,"" Republicans again rose to their feet and cheered, while Democrats sat still.
Three Democratic senators who are vying for the Democratic presidential nomination—Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota—weren't in the House chamber for the State of the Union. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, who also is running in the Democratic presidential primary, was in attendance.
Showstopping Surprises
A former reality-show star, Mr. Trump inserted a number of Oprah-esque surprises throughout the night, geared at some key interest groups.
First he announced a scholarship for a girl from Philadelphia who he said wasn't able to attend the school of her choice.
Then he awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom to conservative talk-radio host Rush Limbaugh, who is
receiving treatment
for advanced lung cancer.
Mr. Trump thanked the radio icon for ""decades of tireless devotion to our country,"" and asked first lady Melania Trump to give him the honor at that moment. Mrs. Trump then gave the medal to a visibly emotional Mr. Limbaugh.
And toward the end of his remarks, Mr. Trump surprised the family of a deployed service member, Sgt. First Class Townsend Williams, by announcing that the sergeant was there in the chamber, home from deployment.
""We have a very special surprise,"" Mr. Trump said.
Amy Williams from Fort Bragg, N.C., covered her mouth in shock as a murmur rippled through the crowd and her husband, in dress uniform, walked down the stairs to where she sat in the front row of the first family's box.

WASHINGTON -- President Trump has had two major national audiences in the past five days, and both times he aimed a message at African-Americans, a group that overwhelmingly disapproves of the job he is doing but could help decide whether he gets to keep it.
During the Super Bowl, Mr. Trump's campaign spent millions of dollars on a commercial featuring an African-American woman who had a drug sentence commuted by the president. ""Politicians talk about criminal-justice reform,"" the ad said. ""President Trump got it done.""
At the State of the Union, Mr. Trump celebrated the low unemployment rate among African-Americans, talked of urban development zones, honored one of the last surviving Tuskegee Airmen, and awarded a fourth-grader from Philadelphia, Janiyah Davis, with a school-choice scholarship.
The black unemployment rate is 5.9%, according to the latest government statistics, up slightly from the historic low of 5.4% reached in August 2019. Overall, the U.S. unemployment rate is 3.5%.
While Mr. Trump's re-election strategy mainly relies on motivating his conservative base, the focus on African-Americans, and a similar push for Hispanics, shows an effort to attract new voters. Only 8% of black voters went for Mr. Trump in 2016, but his campaign is confident it can improve on that. Even a small boost could help in battleground states such as Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.
""There's significant support out there that you're not going to hear about but it will show up at the ballot box. People see results,"" said Calvin Tucker, who directs minority outreach for the Republican Party of Pennsylvania. He noted that Mr. Trump in 2016 did better among black voters than the past two Republican nominees, Mitt Romney and John McCain.
The push Mr. Trump has displayed in the last week -- chiefly the emotional Super Bowl ad, which generated favorable reviews -- also appears intended for another group of voters he has struggled with.
""Ads showing the compassionate part of Trump's agenda could help raise his favorable ratings with some suburban voters,"" said Alex Conant, a Republican strategist in Washington. ""They like his economic policies, but are turned off by the tweets and harsh rhetoric.""
The Trump campaign has been holding outreach events, seeking to shake the decadeslong dominance Democrats have held with black voters. It is a far different effort than 2016, when Mr. Trump lacked a record and simply asked, ""What the hell do you have to lose?""
The campaign plans to continue an advertising campaign geared toward black voters, including African-American community newspapers and radio. Ads encourage people to text ""woke"" to receive updates. The campaign is also training activists to engage and register voters, according to a person familiar with the strategy.
With a strong economy at the president's back, some Democrats say Mr. Trump's outreach is a wake-up call.
""What we saw from Donald Trump was a 2020 surgical strategy,"" said Quentin James, founder of the Collective PAC, which helps elect black candidates to office. Mr. James said Democrats need a large-scale program to engage with African-Americans and fears the party will play catch-up.
Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee who is also African-American, said Mr. Trump was smart to make a play for black voters. But he said that effort is hampered by the president's history of controversial statements, from saying there were fine people on ""both sides"" of the deadly 2017 white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Va., to saying four Democratic lawmakers, all of them minority women, should return to the ""totally broken and crime infested places from which they came"" and ""fix"" them.
""This is a man who wanted to execute the Central Park Five,"" said Mr. Steele, referring to the black and Hispanic teenagers who were wrongfully convicted of raping a jogger in 1989. Asked about the case last year, Mr. Trump refused to apologize for his stance, which he had emphasized at the time in newspaper ads that called for bringing back the death penalty in New York.
A Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll from January showed only 15% of African-Americans approve of the job Mr. Trump is doing, and 83% disapprove -- by far the worst of any demographic group.
Still, another Journal poll in December showed Mr. Trump could improve on his 2016 margin. While only 9% of blacks were almost certain to vote for the president and 72% were almost certain to vote against him, 21% said it depends on whom Democrats nominate.

WASHINGTON—As
the coronavirus affects
almost every aspect of business, a collection of Trump administration officials—at times at odds with one another—have been seeking to coordinate government action to soften the anticipated blow to the economy.
So far, that coordination has been more ad hoc than organized or torn from the classic crisis playbook, which has administration policy makers acting in concert with the Federal Reserve and seeking buy-in from congressional leaders from both parties before announcing a policy response.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is leading the economic effort alongside Mr. Trump's top economist, Lawrence Kudlow. Mr. Mnuchin has good relations with Congress, where he appeared Wednesday, as well as with Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, according to people familiar with the matter.
Yet Mr. Mnuchin faces counter currents from inside the White House. President Trump has criticized the Fed in recent weeks, urging it to cut interest rates further. Meanwhile, senior staff have expressed divergent views about the best way
to protect economic growth
, which Mr. Trump and his campaign are counting on to propel his re-election efforts.
At a briefing Monday, Mr. Trump called for
a large payroll-tax cut
. It was a surprise to aides who hadn't yet fleshed out a detailed proposal or discussed it in depth with congressional leaders, according to people familiar with the discussions. On Tuesday,
lawmakers rebuffed the idea
.
""We've seen this with the president in the past, where the announcement is made before the policy is decided,"" said Andy Laperriere, a policy analyst at Cornerstone Macro who was previously a GOP policy adviser on Capitol Hill.
Mr. Mnuchin spoke Wednesday morning with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) and Mr. Trump and later urged lawmakers to approve a more modest package that includes relief for small- and medium-size businesses affected by virus-related disruptions.
""This package isn't going to include everything,"" he told reporters following a hearing before the House Appropriations Committee. ""This is round one. We'll be back for more.""
The administration is working on broader measures, including assistance for workers and industries hit by the virus, such as airlines, Mr. Mnuchin said. The Treasury also is planning to extend the April 15 tax payment deadline ""for virtually all Americans, other than the super-rich,"" he said. He estimated the extension would provide about $200 billion of stimulus for the U.S. economy.
""I assure you and I assure the American public we will have a full economic plan to deal with this, and I believe there will be bipartisan support,"" Mr. Mnuchin said.
In a nationwide address from the Oval Office on Wednesday night when he announced a 30-day travel ban from Europe, President Trump renewed his call for a payroll tax holiday. He also said he would seek $50 billion in funding to increase low-cost loans guaranteed by the Small Business Administration to certain companies.
The administration began exploring economic policy responses to the epidemic early last week, when Mr. Mnuchin tapped a handful of aides in Treasury's legal, domestic and international finance teams to come up with a suite of options.
As Mr. Trump hosted Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida last weekend, Treasury aides hustled to assemble a package of 12 to 15 proposals to present to Mr. Trump.
Monday's stock market plunge convinced Mr. Trump that he needed to act, people familiar with the matter said. The threat of the outbreak crystallized when Rep. Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.) was told as he boarded Air Force One that he might have been exposed to the virus. Immediately after Mr. Trump landed in Washington late Monday afternoon, he met with his economic advisers.
In a tense Oval Office meeting, Peter Navarro, Mr. Trump's trade adviser, argued for an immediate payroll-tax cut to boost demand and shore up growth. Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and senior adviser, and legislative affairs director Eric Ueland supported the idea.
Messers. Mnuchin and Kudlow, who last week said publicly that a payroll tax cut wasn't under active consideration, argued against it. They recommended narrower measures, such as extended sick leave for workers.
Mr. Kudlow found himself defending the payroll tax cut at a Tuesday evening news conference at the White House, where reporters questioned him about the cost of the proposal. Mr. Trump has privately mused about permanently suspending the payroll tax, which funds Social Security and Medicare, though aides countered they were hoping to put it on hold through December.
Congressional Democrats and Republicans poured cold water on the proposal after a meeting Tuesday with the president and Messers. Mnuchin, Kudlow and Navarro. By Wednesday, administration officials acknowledged privately that a payroll tax suspension was unlikely to gain traction.
On Thursday, the House prepared to vote on a bill that provides for paid leave for people affected by the spread of the virus, expands unemployment insurance, and requires that health insurance cover diagnostic testing for the disease for free, among other measures.
Without administration buy-in, the GOP-led Senate is unlikely to consider the legislation in the hours before senators leave town. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky has said he would leave the negotiations to Mrs. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin.
Now, Mr. Mnuchin is seeking to broker a compromise measure that the president, House Democrats and Senate Republicans can support. It is a familiar role for Mr. Mnuchin, a 57-year-old former Goldman Sachs partner.
Share Your Thoughts
What elements should a virus stimulus include? Join the conversation below.
Last summer, he helped reach a two-year budget deal with House Democrats that also raised the government's borrowing limit. In the fall, he negotiated a spending agreement to avoid a government shutdown. In the process, he developed a working relationship with Mrs. Pelosi.
At a weekly Senate lunch Tuesday, Mr. Trump and his advisers briefed Republicans but not Democrats, and Mr. Trump attacked Democratic lawmakers on Twitter.
""It's not encouraging for getting a bipartisan deal,"" said Mr. Laperriere.
That afternoon, Mrs. Pelosi said she met Mr. Mnuchin to see ""where our common ground was as to how we go forward."" She declined to say if the two had made progress.
The administration's efforts so far present a contrast to the last economic crisis, in 2008. President George W. Bush unveiled a $145 billion package of tax rebates after consulting congressional leaders from both parties. The House passed its own version of the package less than two weeks later, and the House and Senate agreed on a deal one week after that.
Meanwhile, the Fed cut rates twice, by a total of 1.25 percentage points. In the months that followed, as the economy swooned, the Treasury and Fed presented a united front. Any disagreements between the Fed and the White House never spilled into public view.
By contrast, Mr. Trump on Tuesday renewed his criticism of the Fed, calling it ""pathetic"" and ""slow moving""—even after last week's half-point emergency interest-rate cut. Investors expect the central bank to lower rates again at or before its March 17-18 policy meeting.
Fed Chairman Powell, a frequent social media target of Mr. Trump, nevertheless maintains a solid working relationship with Mr. Mnuchin, according to people who know both men.
Mr. Mnuchin backed Mr. Powell for the Fed chairmanship. They have a weekly breakfast and have met or dined together 32 times since January 2019, according to public calendars.
Mr. Mnuchin attended the only two White House meetings between Mr. Trump and Mr. Powell since he became Fed chairman in February 2018: a dinner at the White House residence in February 2019; and a 30-minute morning meeting, also in the residence, last November.
Mr. Mnuchin said he and Mr. Powell have been in daily contact during recent financial-market gyrations. Their relationship could grow more important as the coronavirus crisis deepens.
In keeping with Fed practice, Mr. Powell has avoided commenting on specific fiscal policy debates. Still, if rates are lowered to zero, the Fed is likely to look to Congress and the White House to boost the economy.
""The virus outbreak is something that will require a multifaceted response,"" Mr. Powell said at a press conference last week, including ""from fiscal authorities should they determine that a response is appropriate.""

CLINTON, Iowa -- Before President Trump, no American president had ever sought re-election in the middle of an impeachment.
Former Vice President Joe Biden is contending with a similar distinction in the Democratic primaries, as a White House candidate caught up in the impeachment of Mr. Trump, whose trial centers on his pressing Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden, a possible opponent in this year's election.
Days before the Iowa caucuses, Mr. Biden is trying to turn Republican efforts to damage him in the impeachment trial into a badge of honor and a sign of his resilience. His campaign hopes it will help him appeal to Democratic voters struggling to answer the contest's biggest question: Which Democrat is best positioned to defeat Mr. Trump in November's general election?
""This whole impeachment trial for Trump is just a political hit job to smear me,"" Mr. Biden told an audience Tuesday night in Clinton, a community along the Mississippi River. ""That's how scared Trump is about having to run against me.""
When Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst suggested the Senate's trial in Washington could undercut Mr. Biden's appeal in Iowa, his campaign quickly seized upon her comments and posted a digital ad.
Mr. Trump's lawyers argued this week that the president was justified in seeking investigations into Mr. Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who served on the board of the Ukrainian natural-gas company Burisma while Mr. Biden was vice president. Mr. Biden has said he did nothing wrong in pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who had at one time been involved in investigating Burisma and who was widely viewed as insufficiently aggressive on corruption. Mr. Biden has also noted he was carrying out the Obama administration's Ukraine policy, which was in line with international partners on rooting out corruption.
Mr. Biden rarely hears questions from voters about the impeachment trial. But the uncertainty over how long it will last has loomed over the final week in Iowa.
Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar have been forced to scrap most of their Iowa campaign schedules to attend the trial.
The possibility of testimony at the impeachment trial from witnesses, such as former national security adviser John Bolton, could mean the proceeding spills over into campaigning ahead of the Feb. 11 New Hampshire primary.
It also could increase the likelihood that Mr. Biden's son, or even Mr. Biden himself, might be called to testify.
He told reporters this week that he had ""nothing to defend. This is all a game.""
Republicans, meanwhile, haven't been subtle about trying to use the trial to undermine Mr. Biden's candidacy.
Ms. Ernst, who is seeking re-election this year, told reporters that she was ""really interested"" to see how the arguments made by Mr. Trump's legal team ""informs and influences the Iowa caucus voters.""
Mr. Biden pounced, reading aloud the senator's comments during his events in Iowa. The campaign placed a homemade sign on the wall that said, ""Joni -- We're w/ Joe.""
""She spilled the beans,"" said Mr. Biden, who told his supporters, ""You can ruin Donald Trump's night by caucusing for me, but also you can ruin Joni Ernst's night.""
One of Ms. Ernst's Senate colleagues, meanwhile, bought airtime in Iowa to bolster Mr. Trump's defense. Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.) cut a 30-second ad accusing Mr. Biden of getting away with a pressure campaign against Ukraine and helping his son profit from his position, charges the Bidens and supporters have denied.
""I just see that as part of the desperation of the Republicans in facing him, that they've got to try to drag him and his son into this,"" said Jeff Hermiston, a retired teacher from West Liberty, Iowa, who saw Mr. Biden at a recent event and plans to caucus for him.

WASHINGTON—President Trump used his Twitter account to share a post naming the alleged whistleblower whose complaint set off the congressional investigation that led to his impeachment.
Late Friday night, Mr. Trump's Twitter account retweeted a tweet by a user named ""Surfermom77"" that identified the alleged whistleblower.
The Wall Street Journal and others have
previously reported
the whistleblower was a Central Intelligence Agency officer. Most mainstream news outlets haven't reported the whistleblower's name.
Democratic lawmakers and the whistleblower's attorneys have raised concerns that the person's safety could be put at risk if publicly identified, and they have pointed to laws that provide anonymity to intelligence employees who report wrongdoing. Mr. Trump and his allies have
questioned the whistleblower's motives
, challenging the person to step forward.
Several conservative news organizations have named a person they speculate is the whistleblower, and some Republican lawmakers have touted those articles on Twitter. The president's son, Donald Trump Jr., has also tweeted out the alleged whistleblower's name.
On Thursday, Mr. Trump retweeted a tweet from an account associated with the president's re-election campaign that linked to an article that names the alleged whistleblower.
The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the tweets. The whistleblower's lawyer didn't immediately respond to a message seeking comment.
In private conversations with allies in recent months, the president has mentioned reports in conservative media organizations that name the person alleged to be the whistleblower, according to people familiar with the conversations. This has prompted concerns among some in the administration that Mr. Trump could repeat the person's name publicly. Administration officials have cautioned the president against publicizing the name, according to people familiar with the matter.
The whistleblower filed an intelligence community complaint in August that raised concerns about Mr. Trump's July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which the president pressed for Kyiv to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. The complaint was released publicly in September.
The Trump-appointed intelligence community inspector general, Michael Atkinson, determined the complaint was both urgent and credible. Mr. Trump has referred to the call as ""perfect"" and denied any wrongdoing in his interactions with Ukraine.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi launched an impeachment investigation in September and the House voted along party lines to
impeach the president earlier this month
. The Senate is expected to convene a trial next year.
Twitter said Saturday that due to a system outage, tweets on some account profiles, including Mr. Trump's retweet on the alleged whistleblower, were visible to some but not others. The outage made it seem like the president's retweets had been deleted. But they reappeared in his Twitter feed later Saturday.
The issue affected millions of accounts, according to a spokesperson. ""We're still working on fixing this and apologize for any confusion,"" Twitter said, adding that it was an internal system error, not a security issue.

COLUMBUS, Ohio—As President Trump
backs away from conflict with Iran
, some of his most loyal supporters say they never worried about the clash getting out of hand.
In the battleground state of Ohio, Trump backers attending a Wednesday campaign event with the president's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, said they supported Mr. Trump's move to
take out an Iranian military leader
and that they didn't believe he was ever going to send ground troops into the country, based on his opposition to what he calls ""endless wars.""
""I come from a solid military family, so I know what it is to lose somebody,"" said Sherry Laughman, 57 years old, of Galena. ""He has from the beginning said he was not in it to start a war.""
Martha Verblaauw, also 57 and from Worthington, echoed that sentiment, saying: ""I knew it wasn't going to happen. He literally follows through on things he's said from way back when.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you think President Trump's decision to strike against Iran will affect the presidential race? Join the conversation below.
As Mr. Trump appeared in Ohio on Thursday for his first major campaign rally since his confrontation with Iran intensified, his campaign seized the moment to portray him as a strong commander, touting the killing of an Iranian military leader and targeting what they see as mixed messages from Democrats. But the approach comes with risks, among them that should the conflict escalate, the president may turn off antiwar supporters.
""[Maj. Gen. Qassem] Soleimani was actively planning new attacks and he was looking very seriously at our embassies and not just at the embassy in Bagdhad,"" Mr. Trump said at the rally. ""We stopped him quickly and we stopped him cold.""
The threat of conflict with Iran intensified last week with the U.S.
strike against Gen. Soleimani
. The president sought to take down the temperature Wednesday, signaling no more military strikes after an
Iranian missile barrage on U.S. bases
, which was seen as a tempered response to the killing.
The president's re-election campaign has kept up its tough rhetoric.
Soon after the U.S. took out Gen. Soleimani, the Trump campaign sent out an email titled ""ANOTHER dead terrorist,"" building on their tough talk after the
raid that killed an ISIS leader last year
. After the president's relatively measured address Wednesday, the campaign blasted a text to supporters, directing them to a survey that asked if they would prefer Mr. Trump in office or a ""terrorist-apologist Democrat.""
For their part, Democrats are casting Mr. Trump's effort as another example of a reckless policy. Speaking at a fundraiser Tuesday, former Vice President Joe Biden said: ""We are alone now—we're alone and we will have to bear the cost of Donald Trump's folly.""
Antiwar activists and lawmakers hosted a call Wednesday night with two Democratic presidential candidates where they discussed demonstrations set for Thursday in opposition to military action in the Middle East. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont spoke briefly and urged listeners to be active in their resistance.
""This is the moment that Americans need to speak up and say we do not want another war in the Middle East, we do not want war with Iran,"" Ms. Warren said.
Mr. Trump's campaign has sought to highlight inconsistencies in Mr. Biden's foreign-policy record, as well as slam Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren for their rhetoric about the strike against Gen. Soleimani.
""Now they are trying to defend killing a terrorist,"" Ms. Trump said Wednesday in Columbus. ""What is going on with the Democrats?""
From the Oval Office Tuesday, Mr. Trump said: ""I don't hear too many people other than politicians who are trying to win the presidency, those are the ones that are complaining, but I don't hear anybody else complaining.""
Some Democratic voters in Ohio expressed frustration over Mr. Trump's tactics with Iran, although these voters said they had largely already made up their minds not to support him in 2020.
""It puts his foreignpolicy ineptitude on display,"" said Andy Steele, 46, of Columbus, who works for a technology company and plans to vote Democratic. Tom Hohenberger, a 64-year-old retired nurse from Columbus who also plans to vote Democratic, said, ""I think he didn't get the right kind of briefing.""
Rose Mary Blair, a 57-year-old project manager who attended an event in Akron for 2020 hopeful Michael Bloomberg Wednesday, said she thinks Mr. Trump's recent moves against Iran ""put a lot of young people and our country at risk.""
Mr. Trump's entanglement with Iran offers the latest example of a foreign policy that has long swung between aggressive and isolationist impulses. As a candidate, he pledged to stop ""endless wars,"" but also promised to build up the U.S. military.
In office he has sought to withdraw troops from the Middle East while also promising to unleash ""fire and fury"" in the face of a nuclear threat.
Those close to the president said his views have always been complicated. Said one Trump ally: ""Trump was never, never a noninterventionist in the way that Ron Paul was a noninterventionist.""
Some Trump backers said they would be comfortable even if he did send troops into Iran, saying they trusted his judgment.
""If they want, I'll come out of retirement and I'll go over there"" and help, said Curtis Stroede, 66, of Chillicothe, who is a veteran. ""He's showing strength, he's pushing back on bullies, he's showing them he's willing and able.""

WASHINGTON -- House Democrats argued before the Senate Thursday that President Trump should be convicted of an abuse-of-power charge, rebuffing the White House's position that the Constitution requires a criminal act to remove a president from office.
In the second day of arguments in the impeachment trial, the Democratic managers also laid out Thursday Mr. Trump's alleged motive for seeking investigations by Ukraine into former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, saying Mr. Trump was determined to undercut a rival, not battle corruption, and that he put U.S. national security at risk as a result.
""A president who uses his office to ask for, or even worse, to compel foreign nations to meddle in our elections is a president who attacks the very foundation of our liberty,"" Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said on the Senate floor. He said it is ""without doubt a crime against the Constitution warranting, demanding, removal from office.""
Mr. Trump and members of the president's defense team as well as many Republican lawmakers have dismissed the impeachment trial as a political assault by Democrats. They also argue that the ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" cited in the Constitution's impeachment clause require the allegation of a crime.
Speaking to reporters during a break in the proceedings, Jay Sekulow, an attorney for Mr. Trump, said the president's defense team will advance ""multiple schools of thought"" about what is an impeachable offense as they argue for his acquittal. ""Our job here is to defend the president, the office of the presidency and the Constitution,"" he said.
One week after the senators were sworn in as trial jurors, Democrats remained hopeful of picking off some Republicans to support their calls for more documents and witnesses, such as hearing from former national security adviser John Bolton. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the chamber's Democratic leader, said his party's presentations at the trial ""may have planted the first seeds in their mind that, yes, perhaps the president did something very wrong here.""
But several Republicans said the presentation wasn't telling them anything new. ""There was certainly a lot of repetition,"" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska), who previously said she was open to supporting votes for new evidence.
Democrats need 51 votes in the GOP-controlled Senate to call witnesses, while a two-thirds supermajority would be required to remove Mr. Trump from office.
Under the rules governing the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history, the House managers and Mr. Trump's defense team each have 24 hours spread over three days to make their arguments. The House team used about eight hours of its time Wednesday and used about eight more Thursday.
Democrats are expected to turn to the second article of impeachment, focused on Mr. Trump's alleged efforts to block documents and testimony sought by House investigators, on Friday.
During his presentation, Mr. Nadler outlined the legal underpinnings of abuse of power, arguing that it has been at the center of previous presidential impeachments.
""The charges set forth in the first article of impeachment are firmly grounded in the Constitution of the United States,"" he said.
The managers played a series of clips, including decades-old videos of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.) and Harvard Law Prof. Alan Dershowitz, now a member of Mr. Trump's defense team, in which each argued that certain acts deserve impeachment even if they aren't illegal under criminal statutes.
Mr. Dershowitz, in a CNN interview Sunday, said he would argue that even if House Democrats' allegations about the president are true, they don't rise to the level of an impeachable offense because they aren't crimes.
The impeachment managers have argued that Mr. Trump withheld nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine as part of an effort to pressure Kyiv to open investigations into Mr. Biden. The Trump administration released the aid in September after protests from lawmakers in both parties.
Much of Thursday's arguments focused on Mr. Trump's request, during a July 25 phone call with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, that Ukraine probe Mr. Biden. Mr. Trump also mentioned the subject of aid during the call, but didn't tie the two together.
Mr. Biden helped lead an international anticorruption push in Ukraine while vice president. His son Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukranian natural-gas company at the time. Mr. Trump and his allies have accused Mr. Biden of working to replace a Ukrainian prosecutor to protect his son, but Mr. Biden pressed for the removal with the backing of U.S. allies at a time when the prosecutor's probe into Burisma, the gas company, was dormant.
The Bidens have strenuously denied any wrongdoing.
In his closing remarks, lead impeachment manager Rep. Adam Schiff said Mr. Trump posed a danger to the country unless removed from office.
""You can't trust this president to do what's right for this country,"" the California Democrat said. ""You can trust he will do what's right for Donald Trump. He'll do it now, he's done it before, he'll do it for the next several months. He'll do it in the election if he's allowed to.""

When the going gets tough, Bernie Sanders's aides talk about what happened on Oct. 4.
That was the day the Vermont senator left the hospital after a heart attack, just after the lowest point in his presidential bid, and a reminder that the campaign has proven it can turn things around.
This week, after chaotic results out of the Iowa Democratic Party and no clear answer about who won the state's presidential caucuses, aides acknowledged frustration. So the campaign sought to reset ahead of next week's New Hampshire primary, declaring victory in Iowa while results were still coming in and disclosing massive January fundraising.
Mr. Sanders had a lead in the popular vote with 97% of precincts reporting as of Thursday. But he and former South Bend Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg were locked in a tight race for the metric that Iowa Democrats consider most important, so-called state delegate equivalents. On Thursday, the chair of the Democratic Party called for a recanvass—the auditing of paper records from each precinct's caucus—after technical problems marred the tabulation of results.
""Where I come from and where everybody else comes from, the person who gets the most votes wins,"" Mr. Sanders said during a press conference in Manchester, N.H. ""We got the most votes.""
In interviews, Mr. Sanders's top aides said they plan to stick with their strategy of appealing to young people and minorities, saying the candidate did well in Iowa precincts with large populations of those groups. On Thursday,
the campaign announced it received $25 million from grass-roots donors in January
—more than many candidates raised in entire quarters last year—and said it is investing $5.5 million in advertising in 10 states set to vote in late February and early March.
Mr. Sanders has been leading in polls in New Hampshire, too.
""I am confident that here in New Hampshire, I know you'll be able to count your votes on election night,"" Mr. Sanders told a crowd in Milford, N.H., Tuesday night. ""And when you count those votes, I look forward to winning here in New Hampshire.""
The Iowa results carried some warning signs for Mr. Sanders.
The close race with Mr. Buttigieg
, a 38-year-old Washington outsider who has sought to appeal to moderates, reveals the Democratic Party remains ideologically divided and is still deciding what type of candidate should take on President Trump.
Some more centrist voters worry that Mr. Sanders—a self-described Democratic socialist—could scare off moderate Republicans and independent voters looking for an alternative to President Trump. And Mr. Sanders could face difficulty expanding his base if the field narrows. His strategy to rack up delegates relies on a fractured Democrats field. If candidates were to drop out, early voters could coalesce around one of his opponents.
The caucuses also saw lower-than-expected turnout, despite the Vermont senator's vow to expand the electorate.
Mr. Sanders narrowly lost the state in his long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination in 2016. This time, Mr. Sanders announced his run in February with strong name identification and a more experienced team.
To move ahead of a crowded field, the Sanders campaign invested in its ground game in Iowa. On Feb. 1, the campaign announced it had knocked on half a million doors since the beginning of January. As of Monday, the Sanders campaign had bought nearly $11 million worth of TV and radio advertisements in the state, trailing just businessman Tom Steyer, who spent over $16 million.
Jane O'Meara Sanders, Mr. Sanders's wife, also said campaigning in the final days before the caucuses felt different than it did four years ago.
""I felt that in 2016, we were introducing him at every venue, we were introducing Bernie Sanders to Iowa,"" Mrs. Sanders said in an interview the weekend before the Iowa caucuses.

While nine out of 10 people in Iowa are white, the Sanders campaign also
focused on increasing turnout from voters in minority communities
and sent organizers to talk with people in areas with large Latino populations, said Misty Rebik, his Iowa state director. Mr. Sanders also held an event on a Native American settlement in Iowa and focused on how his policies would affect those in attendance. Mr. Sanders and the rest of the field have struggled for the support of African-American voters, particularly older ones, who have flocked to former Vice President Joe Biden.
Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez met with Latinos on her trips to the state. Her decision to endorse the Vermont senator while he was still in the hospital last fall helped give a shot of energy to a lagging campaign, as did those of two other liberal congresswomen, Rep. Ilhan Omar (D., Minn.) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.).
All three were in Iowa for Mr. Sanders in the last two weeks, campaigning across the state as he was stuck in Washington for the impeachment trial of President Trump.
Aides believe Mr. Sanders was able to consolidate support in the final weeks after voters looked at other candidates and compared them to Mr. Sanders, who has been calling for the same policies for decades.
Heather Purdy, a 45-year-old professor from Des Moines, said she had decided on Mr. Sanders the week before the caucuses. Ms. Purdy had been considering Mr. Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, but she said the Vermont lawmaker's consistency ultimately won her over.
""He's had the same platform for the last 40 years,"" she said.

As Democrats seek to move past
Iowa's caucus chaos
, President Trump is praising the state—along with the fellow early-voting New Hampshire—as he calls for them to remain atop the primary calendar.
Mr. Trump tweeted Friday: ""Iowa and New Hampshire will not be moved from the Primary Schedule as long as I am President. Great tradition!""
His comments came as some national Democrats
have been calling for the end
of Iowa's early-voting tradition after the results debacle that followed Monday's caucuses. Iowa and New Hampshire, which has its primary on Tuesday, have long faced criticism for their outsize role in the nomination process, given that they are smaller, mostly white, states.
The president doesn't play a direct role in determining the nomination calendar. Each state decides when to hold its primary or caucus, though the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee can influence those decisions by how they allocate delegates to the states.
Both of the first two states are key general election battlegrounds. Mr. Trump captured Iowa by nearly 10 percentage points in 2016 over Hillary Clinton, but former President Obama won there in 2008 and 2012. Mr. Trump narrowly lost New Hampshire in 2016 and sees it as a pickup opportunity in the fall.
Mr. Trump also hasn't held back on criticizing Iowa's Democratic caucuses, which were riddled with technical glitches and other issues, leading the Iowa Democratic Party to take days to release the results. Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez has called for
a recanvass of the results
, and the Associated Press reported it was unable to declare a winner.
At an event later in the day Friday, Mr. Trump criticized the process in Iowa, saying, ""It's sad. It's embarrassing.""
Leading Democrats have expressed concerns about Iowa's future in the wake of the caucuses. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin (D., Ill.) said on MSNBC this week: ""The Democratic caucus is a quirky, quaint tradition that should come to an end.""
Iowa and New Hampshire are both fiercely protective of their early-voting status, which confers both political prestige and economic benefits.
Top Republicans from Iowa issued a statement this week calling for the tradition to continue. ""Iowa's bipartisan first-in-the-nation status helped lead to the nomination of President Obama and has the full backing of President Trump,"" said the statement signed by Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, Sen. Joni Ernst and Sen. Chuck Grassley. ""The process is not suffering because of a short delay in knowing the final results.""

WASHINGTON—President Trump is seizing on
the trade deal with China
as proof that he is delivering on his campaign promises, but whether that message resonates with voters could hinge on how the agreement plays out in the coming months.
For now, Mr. Trump and his campaign say the deal with China—along with Thursday's Senate passage of
a reworked North American trade pact
—has shown that the president can stake out tough positions to achieve better deals for American businesses and workers and will do so again to win additional concessions.
The campaign is planning ads around the trade deals that seek to reinforce a broad ""promises made, promises kept"" message and target American workers, including union members and factory workers whose industries have been hit by decades of U.S. trade policy. Mr. Trump is expected to give greater prominence to the deals in coming rallies, according to a person familiar with the planning. On Sunday, he highlighted the pacts before the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual convention in Austin, Texas.
The China deal, while limited in scope, calmed a tumultuous two-year trade war under Mr. Trump and could help maintain a strong economy that has been his strongest asset heading into his re-election bid.

How confident are you in President Trump's trade strategy? Join the conversation below.
""He's sort of settled things down,"" said Republican pollster Dave Winston, who isn't associated with Mr. Trump's campaign. ""You've seen the stock market respond positively, and that's a lot of people's retirement. This is a reinforcement, at least for the moment, that the economy is headed in a positive direction.""
Mr. Trump's campaign and Republican allies are also seeking to contrast the trade deals this week with
the president's impeachment and trial
getting under way in the Senate on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. They contend that his efforts signal to voters that he is getting things done despite the partisan battles in Washington.
""Every candidate for president over many decades has promised to stand up to China, but no one ever did until Donald Trump came along. The signing of the phase-one deal shows that his America First approach is working,"" said campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh.
But any political momentum over Mr. Trump's handling of China could fade
if Beijing fails to follow through on its commitments
to increase its U.S. imports by $200 billion over two years. Tougher trade issues also remain unresolved and have been punted to future negotiations—and, notably, painful tariffs remain in place. While the economy is strong, U.S. factory output has slowed.
""True to form, Trump is getting precious little in return for the significant pain and uncertainty he has imposed on our economy, farmers and workers,"" said former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination.
Other Democratic candidates have also criticized Mr. Trump over what they describe as erratic negotiation tactics, but they have generally supported a tougher stance on China. And
the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada
was shaped by Democrats and drew mostly praise.
As a candidate in 2016, Mr. Trump made American jobs a central focus of his campaign and repeatedly said China was ripping off the U.S. and blasted large trade deals such as NAFTA and the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership. That message helped Mr. Trump narrowly flip industrial states Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
""It was hugely effective,"" said Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg.
But tariffs that Mr. Trump imposed on hundreds of billions of dollars in Chinese imports drew backlash from the business community and rattled farmers, who saw retaliatory action from Beijing and plummeting sales that required billions in government payments.
The phase-one deal reached this week leaves in place U.S. tariffs on about $370 billion in Chinese goods. Mr. Greenberg said public opinion polls show the tariffs are unpopular, particularly among independent voters, and that will impede Mr. Trump's efforts to portray the deal as a win.
Alex Conant, a Republican strategist in Washington who advises some companies fighting Mr. Trump's trade policies, agreed on that point. ""The most important factor in Trump's re-election is the economy, and tariffs are bad for American consumers and businesses.""
Mr. Trump on Thursday said the China deal was evidence that his tariff strategy had paid off, tweeting that ""farmers are really happy"" with the outcome.
As Democratic presidential candidates gathered last Tuesday for the debate in Des Moines, Iowa, Mr. Trump's campaign paid for a plane to fly over the city, towing a green banner that read ""Trump Fights for Iowa Farmers!""
On the debate stage, Democrats echoed themes Mr. Trump harnessed in 2016, but still sought ways to criticize his approach to trade negotiations. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont noted his past votes against Nafta and extending permanent normal trade relations with China. ""The answer,"" he added, ""is we could do much better than a Trump-led trade deal.""

WASHINGTON -- House Democrats argued that President Trump's efforts to press Ukraine to launch investigations that could help him politically warranted his removal from office, saying during the first day of opening arguments in the Senate impeachment trial that his actions undercut U.S. elections and national security.
Rep. Adam Schiff, the lead impeachment manager and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, laid out the allegations underpinning the two articles of impeachment passed by the House last month. The first stems from Mr. Trump pressing Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. The second accuses Mr. Trump of impeding Congress's investigation by blocking some witnesses and documents.
""Over the coming days, you will hear remarkably consistent evidence of President Trump's corrupt scheme and coverup,"" Mr. Schiff (D., Calif.) said, standing at a lectern on the Senate floor. ""There is no serious dispute about the facts underlying the president's conduct.""
Mr. Trump, a Republican, maintains he did nothing wrong and has called the impeachment a hoax driven by politics.
The Democrats, in laying out their case, continued to try to persuade Republicans to support calling new witnesses and documents, which Democrats argue will provide more details about Mr. Trump's interactions with top aides, including former national security adviser John Bolton and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.
Mr. Trump's legal team argues that Democrats don't have a strong case, saying that weakness is why the prosecutors seek more witnesses. They will be able to counter after the Democratic team finishes its three days of arguments.
Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow said that the team plans to ""challenge aggressively"" Democrats' case. ""There's a lot of things I'd like to rebut and we will rebut,"" he said.
Speaking at a news conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump said he was sympathetic toward the idea of a longer Senate trial with witness testimony, but didn't budge on his position regarding several witnesses sought by Democrats.
""I would rather go the long way. I would rather interview Bolton. I would rather interview a lot of people,"" he said. But he added that testimony from Mr. Bolton, as well as that of Mr. Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, would pose national security concerns.
The White House had instructed many witnesses, including Mr. Bolton, not to testify in the House probe. Any new witnesses would have to be deposed privately before they could testify before the Senate.
As part of his presentation, Mr. Schiff played a clip of Mr. Mulvaney from October in which Mr. Mulvaney said, ""Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy."" Mr. Mulvaney made the comment while answering reporters' questions related to the administration's freeze on aid to Ukraine. Democrats have said the freeze was part of a quid pro quo for Ukraine launching investigations into Mr. Biden.
""Should we just get over it?"" Mr. Schiff asked the senators. ""Is that what we've come to? I hope and pray that the answer is no.""
Mr. Schiff argued that the senators needed to take action now, or they risk setting a precedent that could undermine future elections and U.S. global standing while bolstering autocrats such as President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
""What message will we send if we choose not to hold this president accountable for his abuse of power, to solicit re-election interference in our upcoming election?"" He added: ""We have for generations been the shining city upon a hill that President Reagan described. . .but what worth is that idea if when tried we do not affirm the values that underpin it?""
House managers laid out the chronology of the Democrats' case, playing video clips of administration officials who testified in the House investigation about the president's push for investigations and the hold on nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. The aid later was released after bipartisan pressure in Congress.
Just before 2 a.m. Wednesday, the Senate passed a resolution in a 53-47 vote along party lines setting the structure for the trial, which doesn't include guarantees for new witnesses or documents.
Democrats still hope to win over at least four votes to seek subpoenas later in the trial. Some GOP lawmakers have said they are open to new witnesses, but they want to wait until after the Democrats and Mr. Trump's legal team have made their cases.
Headed into their opening arguments, Republicans said they were taken aback by comments from House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.), who, while arguing for a Democratic amendment to the trial rules, said in the early hours Wednesday that senators who voted against allowing witnesses were ""complicit in the president's coverup.""
""I was offended; I took it as very offensive as one who is listening attentively and working hard to get to a fair process,"" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska,), whose support Democrats likely will need to call new evidence.
Some Republicans have pushed the idea that for every possible witness that Democrats want to call, the GOP would call in a witness of their own. That could include Mr. Biden or his son Hunter, whom Republicans have criticized for serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father was the Obama administration's point man for combating Ukrainian corruption. The Bidens have denied any wrongdoing.
The former vice president said he opposed the idea of testifying in order to call Republicans' bluff and potentially get a witness that Democrats want, adding that he doesn't want the process to ""turn into a farce.""

The presidential election is 10 months away,
but Michael Bloomberg's long-shot campaign
is running like it's already late October.
The candidate has spent $217 million so far on television and digital advertising, mostly ignoring the Democratic primaries and squarely challenging President Trump. The total is roughly three-quarters of the amount spent by all other campaigns, including Mr. Trump's, combined.
It's the game plan the billionaire used in his campaign for mayor of New York City in 2001, when he outspent his competitor nearly 5 to 1. Big spending has also made his philanthropy
a dominant force on climate change, gun control and other issues
. And it is how he has managed his lucrative business, paying up to bring in talent.
The flow of cash—dubbed the Bloomberg effect by media-measurement firm Advertising Analytics LLC—has upended the financial dynamics of the election. Television ad rates jumped 45% in Houston after the Bloomberg campaign bought $1 million worth of ads in November, Advertising Analytics said. The
campaign paid as much as double the going rate for staff and promised jobs to workers through November
, whether or not Mr. Bloomberg stays in the race. The candidate, who is funding his run entirely by himself, now has 1,000 campaign staffers.
It's a big part of the reason roughly $20 billion is expected to be spent on political advertising this election cycle, dwarfing the previous record of $12 billion in 2016, according to media research firm, Borrell Associates.
""Everything about what Bloomberg is doing is unprecedented,"" said Rufus Gifford, former finance director for Barack Obama's presidential campaign. Mr. Bloomberg remains a long shot, Mr. Gifford said, ""but when you have Donald Trump as president and one of the 10 richest people running for president, anything can happen.""
Kevin Sheekey, Mr. Bloomberg's campaign manager, said there's more to
Mr. Bloomberg's candidacy
than his spending, pointing to wealthy but politically inexperienced candidates such as Meg Whitman or Ross Perot who failed in the past. ""Money won't just determine elections,"" he said. ""You have to have a record and a message.""
Lots of rich people have run for office, lots of candidates have claimed excellent business credentials and many have claimed to have top-flight data operations, which Mr. Bloomberg emphasizes. What sets his campaign apart is his $55 billion checkbook.
Mr. Bloomberg is No. 9 on the Forbes list of the world's richest people, ahead of each of the Google founders, either Koch brother and the wealthiest members of the Walton family. A person familiar with the plans said he could spend $500 million on the primaries alone, and Mr. Bloomberg hasn't ruled out spending $1 billion before November if needed.
""Certainly it's going to be disruptive,"" said Robert Wolf, former chairman and CEO of UBS Americas and a longtime Democratic donor. ""We just don't know how yet.""
Mr. Bloomberg, who was mayor of New York from 2002 to 2013, is currently supported by 6% of voters, compared with 27% for former Vice President Joe Biden in the Real Clear Politics average of polls. More voters have a negative than a positive view of Mr. Bloomberg, according to a Quinnipiac University National Poll from mid-December.
Mr. Bloomberg said he entered the race at a moment when polling data suggested voters placed less importance on ideology and more on finding a candidate who could beat Mr. Trump. His campaign believed Mr. Trump was winning the race and was going unchallenged in political ads in competitive states as Democratic candidates focused on the primary battle.
At the time, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren was surging. Polls showed Mr. Biden beating Mr. Trump but within the margin of error. Ms. Warren's policies, such as a wealth tax, would likely hurt Mr. Bloomberg, and she is generally disliked by his circle of wealthy New Yorkers, according to a longtime staff member. Mr. Bloomberg has said he will back whoever wins the nomination, even if it is Ms. Warren or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.
To offset criticism that he was running out of his own self interest, Mr. Bloomberg pledged $15 million to $20 million to register 500,000 voters before the election. His attacks on Mr. Trump are part of that effort.
""There's a sense that Bloomberg is doing something that the party can't do—going negative on Trump,"" Mr. Gifford said. ""It's work that the party doesn't have the money to do, and other candidates don't have the ability to do.""
After Mr.
Trump's campaign said it had bought a 60-second TV spot during the Super Bowl on Feb. 2
, the Bloomberg campaign bought a 60-second spot that will target the president. The Bloomberg campaign declined to disclose how much it was spending for the spot, but advertising tracker Kantar/CMAG estimates it is worth $10 million.
Bloomberg spending has drawn Mr. Trump's attention. When the campaign aired an ad saying the president had broken his promise of protecting those with pre-existing health conditions, Mr. Trump pushed back on Twitter and labeled Mr. Bloomberg ""Mini Mike.""
Mr. Bloomberg's campaign said that because he started late, it is focusing on the Super Tuesday votes on March 3, rather than the early voting states such as Iowa and New Hampshire. The plan plays to Mr. Bloomberg's financial advantage and minimizes his weaknesses—shaking hands and making small talk with voters, and giving stump speeches. The
Super Tuesday states
, where 40% of delegates will be chosen, instead depend more on television and digital advertising.
In addition to huge TV spending—$193 million on ads since his campaign began—the campaign has spent heavily online. It spent $16.1 million on Google ads as of Jan. 11 and $6.8 million on Facebook as of the end of December according to Kantar/CMAG.
Mr. Trump has spent $6.5 million on digital ads, and Tom Steyer, the other billionaire Democratic candidate, has spent $5.6 million since Mr. Bloomberg entered the race in November, as of the end of last year.
The Bloomberg campaign is offering field organizers salaries of $6,000 a month. For state data directors, it's between $10,000 and $12,000 a month, according to job postings.
The campaign's 1,000-person payroll is more typical of an operation in the final months before Election Day. Mr. Biden has roughly 400 campaign staffers, while Mr. Sanders has built an 800-person staff.
The former mayor's late entry into the race has forced the campaign to ""create a sense of momentum and hope people will actually jump on,"" said a person familiar with Mr. Bloomberg's state operations.
Campaign veterans said money won't necessarily bring in the best staff and said many experienced staffers want to work for people they support. Other campaigns, including Ms. Warren's and Mr. Sanders's, already have operations in Super Tuesday states and are ramping up hiring in later states.
Mr. Bloomberg has spent in markets that haven't been targeted by other Democrats. His campaign has plunked down $21.2 million on television advertising in Texas, where none of the leading Democrats have spent a penny. It has spent $8.4 million in Pennsylvania, which doesn't hold its primary until April 28.
It has even poured resources into smaller states that are typically not on the primary radar. In Idaho, it has spent $979,000 so far; in Utah, $1.6 million.
""He is going far, far ahead of where the rest of the guys are scrumming,"" said Kip Cassino, executive vice president at Borrell Associates, the media research firm. ""He is basically saying, 'I'm not going to win in Iowa, and I am not going to get out there and kiss pigs. And I won't win in New Hampshire, but I will win in the rest of the states, and I will get the states that most everyone didn't care about before.' ""
At the beginning of January, candidates had spent close to $540 million on political ads in the presidential race over the prior 12 months, about 10 times what would have been expected at this point in this election cycle, Mr. Cassino said.
""We have never seen anything like this,"" Mr. Cassino said, referring to Mr. Bloomberg's spending. ""We are only just starting to see how distorting this might be.""
Mr. Bloomberg's potential handicaps among Democratic voters include his support for Republican candidates in the past, including former President George W. Bush. Other issues that could hurt are his support for charter schools in his education-reform efforts, and the stop-and-frisk policy he adopted as mayor, in which New York police had wide latitude to detain and search passersby for contraband. A federal judge eventually ruled the policy violated the constitutional rights of minorities. Mr. Bloomberg apologized for the stop-and-frisk policy before he kicked off his campaign.
Share Your Thoughts
What are Michael Bloomberg's chances at the Democratic nomination, as of today? Why? Join the discussion below.
Some Democrats fear Mr. Bloomberg could drag out the primary with his limitless budget, or use his money to try to influence the leading candidates, hoping to pull some of them to the political center, which he sees as the way to beat Mr. Trump.
Mr. Bloomberg's team said the data operation he is building will benefit Democrats overall, which he said are far behind the Republicans on the gathering and use of voter data. His data firm, Hawkfish LLC, launched in the spring. It has hired Facebook's former chief marketing officer and the former CEO of Foursquare, the location tracking firm.
Mr. Bloomberg has cited his research and spending on the 2018 midterm elections as evidence of his commitment to the party's success. Democratic candidates won 21 of the 24 races in which he was involved. In most races, the spending focused on digital advertising early in the election cycle and TV advertising closer to election day, when ad reservations were more expensive and Republican groups could not as easily counter their message.
In an Oklahoma House of Representatives race, which appeared to be a long-shot for the Democrats, Mr. Bloomberg unleashed a wave of last-minute ads that attacked the Republican candidate. Democrat Kendra Horn won by a few thousand votes.
""I supported 24 candidates who were good on guns and good on environment, and 21 of them won, and that flipped the House,"" he said at a recent campaign stop in Philadelphia. ""So if it wasn't for that, you wouldn't have [Speaker of the House Nancy] Pelosi and you wouldn't have impeachment.""

WASHINGTON—A Republican senator who party leaders feared might join Democrats in seeking new testimony said Thursday night he will vote against calling witnesses, bolstering the GOP's chances of bringing the
impeachment trial of President Trump
to a rapid conclusion.
Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.) announced his plan after senators wrapped their second and
final day of questioning
Mr. Trump's legal team and House Democratic impeachment managers, during which the two sides sparred over the
limits of executive and congressional power
while revealing little new information.
Mr. Alexander said he believed that Democrats proved their core allegation that Mr.
Trump withheld aid from Ukraine
to pressure Kyiv to launch investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. But he said those actions, while inappropriate, didn't merit the president's removal from office, and therefore no witnesses were needed.
""There is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the U.S. Constitution's high bar for an impeachable offense,"" Mr.
Alexander tweeted
.
Mr. Alexander had notified Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) of his decision before announcing it. Mr. McConnell, leaving the Capitol on Thursday, said only: ""Tomorrow's a big day.""
Another GOP swing vote, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, said she would vote in favor of hearing new testimony, saying that hearing from witnesses would allow each side ""to more fully and fairly make their case, resolve any ambiguities and provide additional clarity."" But Democrats need four Republicans to join them for the vote to be successful.
While Mr. Alexander's decision doesn't mean Republicans are certain to have enough votes to block new testimony, it suggests the GOP is in a good position ahead of Friday's vote, which is likely to pave the way for Mr. Trump's swift acquittal. Mr. Alexander, who was spotted reading Jon Meacham's ""Impeachment: An American History"" in the Senate chamber earlier Thursday, had remained silent over the course of the week about how he might vote.
In addition to Ms. Collins, Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) has said he is interested in hearing from witnesses. And Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) said late Thursday she is still on the fence.
On Tuesday, Mr. McConnell told Republicans they didn't yet have the
votes to block the measure
. In the days since, Republicans have expressed more confidence.
At Thursday's GOP lunch, Mr. McConnell didn't disclose where the vote count on witnesses stood, and Republican leaders said they didn't yet know what Friday would bring. ""It's going to be very, very close,"" Sen. Mike Braun (R., Ind.) said.
Some Republican senators are suggesting that if they succeed in blocking witnesses on Friday, they will push to end the trial that night, even if that means a vote to acquit Mr. Trump could occur in the wee hours of the morning on Saturday.
Meanwhile, preparing for the possibility of a defeat on the witness vote, Democrats are exploring parliamentary maneuvers that they could use to fight such an abrupt end to the trial and draw attention to what they consider an unfair process.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What are your biggest takeaways from the impeachment Q&A? Why? Join the conversation below.
House Democrats over two days of questioning focused on the need for the chamber to call new witnesses—in particular, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton. On Sunday,
a draft was leaked of Mr. Bolton's forthcoming book
, in which he wrote that Mr. Trump told him he was freezing security aid to Ukraine until it opened investigations into Mr. Joe Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, and other matters.
Mr. Bolton has said
he would testify if subpoenaed
by the Senate. The Republican president has denied Mr. Bolton's account and has called the impeachment case against him a hoax.
Ms. Murkowski, in a question posed to the president's legal team, said the dispute over Mr. Bolton's book ""weighs in favor of calling additional witnesses"" and asked why the Senate shouldn't call Mr. Bolton, suggesting she was leaning toward voting for new testimony.
But later, she and Mr. Alexander signed on to a question asking, Even if the reports of the contents of Mr. Bolton's book were accurate, ""isn't it true that the allegations would still not rise to an impeachable offense?"" The Trump defense team agreed.
Democrats argued witnesses were central to the trial process.
""God forbid we should hear what a relevant witness has to say,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the lead House manager and chairman of the chamber's Intelligence Committee. He proposed limiting witness testimony to one week, responding to concerns from Republicans and some Democrats about prolonging the trial with new testimony and the court battles that could ensue from any new subpoenas. The presidential nomination contests begin on Monday in Iowa.
Democrats have argued that Mr. Trump was trying to cheat in this year's election. Mr. Trump's lawyers tried to turn the tables on Democrats, accusing them of using impeachment to interfere in this year's vote. ""That is the most massive election interference in our history,"" said White House counsel Pat Cipollone, echoing a tweet by Mr. Trump days earlier. ""Let's leave it to the people of the United States.""
Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, on Thursday played down the possibility that Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, could step in to break a 50-50 tie over calling witnesses. Mr. Schumer said Democrats remain focused on getting to 51 votes. It isn't clear how Mr. Roberts would handle a 50-50 tally, and the Senate rules are silent on the matter.
Thursday's session began on a dramatic note as the chief justice declined to read a question submitted by Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) that included the name of a person identified by some people as the anonymous whistleblower who helped set off the impeachment inquiry. The whistleblower's lawyer hasn't confirmed the person's name.
Mr. Trump's lawyers used Thursday to try to challenge basic elements of Democrats' impeachment case. Deputy White House counsel Pat Philbin argued that on a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Mr. Trump wasn't asking ""specifically for an investigation"" into Mr. Biden and his son Hunter. A rough transcript of the call released by the White House shows that Mr. Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart to look into the Bidens, saying ""whatever you can do with the Attorney General would be great.""
Mr. Trump and his allies have alleged that it was corrupt for the elder Mr. Biden during the Obama administration to seek the ouster of a Ukrainian prosecutor who had once investigated a Ukrainian gas company where his son sat on the board. Mr. Biden sought the prosecutor's removal as part of a broad international effort to combat corruption in Ukraine. The Bidens have denied any wrongdoing, though Hunter Biden has said it was poor judgment to serve on the Burisma board, which paid him $50,000 a month, while his father was involved with Ukraine policy as vice president.
Mr. Philbin also argued that ""the evidence just doesn't stack up"" to show Mr. Trump linked aid or a White House meeting to Ukraine opening investigations. But he didn't address the possibility of testimony by Mr. Bolton, who, based on his leaked manuscript, could offer such evidence.
Thursday's session also renewed focus on the activities in Ukraine of Rudy Giuliani, Mr. Trump's personal lawyer. In response to a question from a bipartisan group of senators—including two Republicans who have indicated they may vote in favor of new testimony—about whether Mr. Trump could assure the nation he wouldn't direct private citizens such as Mr. Giuliani to carry out foreign policy without a formal designation, Mr. Philbin replied: ""I want to make clear that there was no conduct of foreign policy being carried out here by a private person.""
That is sharply at odds with testimony House investigators heard in the fall. Several witnesses testified that Mr. Trump directed administration officials to work with Mr. Giuliani, who doesn't hold an official position, on resolving his concerns about Ukraine before he would agree to a meeting with the new Ukrainian president. State Department officials periodically reached out to Mr. Giuliani to ensure they were giving the new Ukrainian administration the proper messages to satisfy Mr. Giuliani's concerns.
Mr. Schiff called the assertion ""startling."" He noted that the president's lawyers have argued that critics of Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine objected to his policy, not his conduct. ""They have now acknowledged that the person in charge of this was not conducting policy,"" Mr. Schiff said.
Democrats also tangled with the president's legal team on Thursday over a controversial theory raised a day earlier by Trump lawyer Alan Dershowitz: that because Mr. Trump believes his re-election is in the public interest, even if he had political motivations in pressing Ukraine to open an investigation into the Bidens, it wouldn't be impeachable.
""What we have seen over the last couple days is a descent into constitutional madness,"" Mr. Schiff said.
Mr. Dershowitz wasn't present for Thursday's session. On Twitter, he clarified his remarks, saying a president's lawful behavior couldn't ""be turned into a criminal or impeachable offense just because it was motivated in part by electoral considerations.""

Six Days in the Senate: How Democrats, Trump Team Tried the Impeachment Case

Democratic House managers, acting as prosecutors, are arguing that senators should convict Mr. Trump for abusing his power by withholding nearly $400 million in U.S. military aid to Ukraine as leverage for the country to open investigations that would aid his re-election efforts. The aid was ultimately released under bipartisan pressure from Congress. The House managers also accuse Mr. Trump of trying to cover up his alleged misconduct by obstructing congressional investigations into the matter. Mr. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.
Ms. Collins, along with a handful of other senators, on Thursday asked Democrats whether there were legitimate circumstances under which a president could ask a foreign country to investigate a U.S. citizen—including a political rival—who wasn't under investigation by the U.S.
""It would be hard to contemplate circumstances where that's appropriate,"" Mr. Schiff responded. Mr. Philbin said it was legitimate for the president to ask for a foreign investigation into a matter where a U.S. citizen broke the law abroad.

WASHINGTON—The U.S. and China signed
a trade deal
that officials say will lead to a sharp increase in sales of U.S. goods and services to China, further open Chinese markets to foreign firms—especially in financial services—and provide strong new protections for trade secrets and intellectual property.

The eight-part agreement
acts as a cease-fire in a two-year trade war that has roiled markets world-wide and cut into global growth. But it leaves in place U.S. tariffs on about $370 billion in Chinese goods, or about three-quarters of Chinese imports to the U.S.
Possible tariff reductions will be left to later negotiations, which will cover a host of difficult issues at the heart of the trade battle, including Chinese subsidies to domestic companies and Beijing's oversight of Chinese state-owned firms. Those talks are expected to begin fairly soon but not conclude until after the U.S. presidential election in November.
Speaking to a packed audience of business and political leaders in the East Room of the White House, President Trump said the remaining tariffs ""will all come off"" if the talks produce a second agreement. He called the deal a ""momentous step—one that has never been taken before with China—toward a future of fair and reciprocal trade.""
Vice Premier Liu He of China, who signed the agreement for Beijing, played up the need for both countries to act together to tackle challenges such as terrorism, aging and environmental protection.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What would you like to see in the next phase of the trade deal between the U.S. and China? Join the conversation below.
""China has established a political system and an economic-development model that suits its own characteristics,"" Mr. Liu said. ""But that doesn't mean China and the U.S. can't work together.""
While the deal contains wins for the U.S., the fact that most tariffs will remain on Chinese imports clouds prospects for growth in business investment between the two countries, said John Frisbie, a China expert at the trade consulting firm of Hills & Co.
""Overall uncertainty is not reduced much because there is no removal of existing tariffs [and] questions whether China can buy the quantities of goods and services the administration wants,"" he said.
U.S. stocks have surged since the countries said they were nearing a deal, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 29000 for the first time on Wednesday. But market reaction to the actual signing was muted, suggesting investors saw little that was surprising within the text of the agreement.
""Basically, we've been told repeatedly that this deal was done,"" said Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.
The Republican president sees the trade deal as a win politically going into the November election. The president can laud the agreement and argue that he is the only one who can successfully press Beijing for more concessions. ""President Trump saw an opportunity to advance the U.S. positioning at a time when the Chinese are seeing great political and economic turbulence,"" said Jason Miller, a former Trump campaign spokesman.
Democrats have been critical of the deal. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, made clear that he wasn't going to cede the issue to Mr. Trump. He criticized many of the pact's provisions as ""vague, weak, or covered by previous announcements and existing agreements.""
The agreement is structured as one between equals, but Beijing is making nearly all the changes in policy and purchases. The pact focuses heavily on U.S. complaints that the Chinese government and companies coerce U.S. ones into handing over their technology to their rivals, and Mr. Trump's focus on trying to close the vast trade deficit with China.
Beijing has denied it engages in coercion and has, in the past, pledged to make sure no pressure is applied. The two pages on technology transfer go beyond other agreements China has signed that dealt with that issue.
""Neither party shall require or pressure persons"" to transfer technology to do business or to get regulatory approvals, the agreement said. The deal also banned pressure ""formally or informally"" on companies to use a certain technology to get a license.
However, the section doesn't require China to change any law or regulation to fulfill its obligations. A draft agreement that fell apart in May required dozens of changes in Chinese law. Top officials in Beijing nixed that deal, and the U.S. negotiators sought to retain as much of the tentative deal as possible. The deal is written in legalese and trade jargon that will be pored over by trade experts and lawyers.
As a condition of Beijing signing the deal, the U.S.
agreed to cut tariffs
on $120 billion in Chinese goods by half, to 7.5%, within about 30 days, and to forgo other planned tariffs. None of those commitments are part of the text.
In the intellectual-property section, China agreed to stiffen protection of trade secrets and to assess criminal penalties for ""willful trade secret misappropriation."" Increasing penalties was a priority of Mr. Trump's administration. But much of the intellectual-property language was light on specific rules in new areas. The pharmaceutical portion didn't include specific targets and didn't have language about defending biologic drugs from generic imitators, a major goal of big U.S. drugmakers.
The agreement also requires China to act quickly to accept applications from bank cards and payments systems seeking to access the Chinese market, and the deal's text cites Mastercard, Visa and American Express by name. The U.S. had previously fought cases at the World Trade Organization to win access for U.S. payment providers, but China hasn't followed through with permitting access to the firms in all cases.
The U.S. also pledged to continue to open its market to China's UnionPay system.
The provisions of the deal are subject to an enforcement mechanism that calls for several rounds of consultations. If the two sides don't reach an agreement, the complaining party could take ""remedial measure in a proportionate way""—trade lingo for reimposing tariffs. In practice, the U.S. would likely be the party bringing the complaint because it is China that is pledging to make changes and increase purchases.
So long as the tariff imposition is in good faith, Beijing agreed not to retaliate. But the good-faith and proportionality requirements give China a lot of room to act. Rather than retaliate with tariffs, the deal says the party whose actions led to the complaint could withdraw from the deal—although then China would be free to retaliate. A senior U.S. administration official said he figured Beijing would be very reluctant to take such steps, which would shatter the deal.
But it is unclear whether U.S. companies, wary of retaliation by China, will refer disputes to the enforcement mechanism. Most trade deals use arbitration panels to settle disputes, figuring they can be impartial.
""There is a strong element of Yogi Berra's quip about déjà vu all over again,"" said James Green, a former U.S. trade negotiator in Beijing under Mr. Trump. ""The dispute resolution section will have the same problem we've always faced—U.S. companies are reluctant to become poster children for market access problems or discriminatory treatment.""
The biggest section of the deal covers Chinese purchases. Beijing pledged to buy an additional $200 billion in goods and split across 2020 and 2021, with the deal calling for $77 billion in additional trade the first year and $123 billion the second year.
Across the two years, the targets call for China to boost its purchasing above the levels seen in 2017, by about $78 billion in manufacturing, by an extra $32 billion of agriculture, by $52 billion of energy and by $38 billion of services. The deal said targets have been agreed on for narrower categories of items, but these targets weren't disclosed, the administration said, to avoid distorting markets.
In 2017, the U.S. exported $186 billion of goods and services. To fulfill the targets in the deal, U.S. exports to China would need to climb to $263 billion in 2020 and $309 billion in 2021, an increase without precedent in the history of U.S. trade.
U.S.-China Deal at a Glance
Here is what you need to know about the 90-page first phase of the trade deal.
*
Buying American: Beijing will ramp up purchases of U.S. goods and services by $200 billion over the next two years, using 2017 as a benchmark. This includes increased purchases of manufactured goods by $77.7 billion over the two-year period. The category of tech services, which includes charges for cloud computing-related services and the use of intellectual property, is projected to grow by $37.9 billion. Energy purchases will increase by $52.4 billion under the deal.
*
Agriculture Purchases: The much-touted agriculture purchases have smaller goals for increased trade under the deal than energy, manufacturing and services, with an increase of $32 billion over the two-year period. In addition to the purchase targets, however, China has agreed to steps that allow more market access for U.S. dairy products, poultry, beef, fish, rice and even pet food.
*
Trade Secrets: The deal includes strong language related to preventing and punishing theft of trade secrets. The deal makes it easier for U.S. businesses to persuade authorities to initiate a criminal investigation in China. In addition, the deal says U.S. businesses operating in China should be able to operate ""openly and freely"" without pressure to transfer their technology to foreign business partners. Sharing tech blueprints ""must be based on market terms that are voluntary and reflect mutual agreement,"" it said.
*
Financial Services: The deal removes barriers to help U.S. banking institutions, insurers and other financial-services companies expand in the Chinese market. That includes quickly reviewing license applications from credit-card companies and U.S.-owned credit-rating services. The deal sets a five-month deadline for China to allow branches of U.S. financial institutions to provide securities investment-fund custody services.
*
Resolving Business Disputes: The deal calls for the creation of a dispute-resolution office, addressing longstanding complaints from the U.S. business community that their disagreements with Chinese partners haven't been fairly resolved. It laid out the framework for officials in U.S. and China to discuss how to implement this mechanism, including information sharing and an appeals process.
*
Tariff Relief: Prior to the deal, the U.S. agreed to cut the tariff rate to 7.5% from 15% for charges it had imposed on roughly $120 billion in Chinese products. The U.S. also held off on tariffs of 15% on roughly $156 billion in consumer products, including smartphones, that were set to take effect in December. The deal doesn't amend that prior agreement. President Trump on Wednesday said he would remove the tariffs if the next round of negotiations are successful.
*
Currency Manipulation: China commits not to devalue its currency or make persistent intervention in its currency market. China also commits to a schedule of regular disclosures of data regarding its foreign-exchange holdings.
—Katy Stech Ferek
The projected steep climb in exports left some potential beneficiaries skeptical. For instance, Mr. Liu said the purchases wouldn't come at the expense of other countries. That could make it harder for Beijing to meet the purchase goals.
The deal also has some terms that China could use to claim that the U.S. is at fault if it doesn't meet the purchase targets. For instance, China could request consultations if China's purchases are ""affected by an action or inaction by the United States,"" the text says. That could come into play if U.S. export rules limit the technology products the U.S. lets China buy.
A senior administration official said the provision just allows for discussions and wouldn't be a basis for China to claim it can't fulfill its commitments.

WASHINGTON -- A Republican senator who party leaders feared might join Democrats in seeking new testimony said Thursday night he will vote against calling witnesses, bolstering the GOP's chances for bringing the impeachment trial of President Trump to a rapid conclusion.
Sen. Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.) announced his plan after senators wrapped up their second and final day of questioning Mr. Trump's legal team and House Democratic impeachment managers, during which the two sides sparred over the limits of executive and congressional power while revealing little new information.
Mr. Alexander said he believed that Democrats proved their core allegation that Mr. Trump withheld aid from Ukraine to pressure Kyiv to launch investigations into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son. But he said those actions, while inappropriate, didn't merit the president's removal from office, and therefore no witnesses were needed.
""There is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven and that does not meet the U.S. Constitution's high bar for an impeachable offense,"" Mr. Alexander tweeted.
Mr. Alexander had notified Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) of his decision before announcing it.
Another key GOP senator, Susan Collins of Maine, said she would vote in favor of hearing new testimony, saying that accounts from witnesses would allow each side ""to more fully and fairly make their case, resolve any ambiguities and provide additional clarity."" But Democrats need four Republicans to join them for the vote to be successful.
While Mr. Alexander's decision doesn't mean Republicans are certain to have enough votes to block new testimony, it suggests the GOP is in a good position ahead of Friday's vote, which is likely to pave the way for Mr. Trump's swift acquittal. Mr. Alexander, who was spotted reading Jon Meacham's ""Impeachment: An American History"" in the Senate chamber earlier Thursday, had been silent over the course of the week about how he might vote.
In addition to Ms. Collins, Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) has said he is interested in hearing from witnesses. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) said she is still on the fence.
On Tuesday, Mr. McConnell told Republicans they didn't yet have the votes to block the measure. In the days since, Republicans have expressed more confidence.
At a GOP lunch Thursday, Mr. McConnell didn't disclose where the vote count on witnesses stood, and Republican leaders said they didn't yet know what Friday would bring. ""It's going to be very, very close,"" Sen. Mike Braun (R., Ind.) said.
Some Republican senators are suggesting that if they succeed in blocking witnesses on Friday, they will push to end the trial that night, even if that means a vote to acquit Mr. Trump could occur in the wee hours of the morning Saturday.
Meanwhile, preparing for the possibility of a defeat on the witness vote, Democrats are exploring parliamentary maneuvers that they could use to fight such an abrupt end to the trial and draw attention to what they consider an unfair process.
House Democrats over two days of questioning focused on the need for the Senate to call new witnesses -- in particular, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser John Bolton.
On Sunday, a draft was leaked of Mr. Bolton's forthcoming book, in which he wrote that Mr. Trump told him he was freezing security aid to Ukraine until it opened investigations into Mr. Biden, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, and other matters.
Mr. Bolton has said he would testify if subpoenaed by the Senate. The Republican president has denied Mr. Bolton's account and has denounced the impeachment case against him.
Ms. Murkowski, in a question posed to the president's legal team, said the dispute over Mr. Bolton's book ""weighs in favor of calling additional witnesses"" and asked why the Senate shouldn't call Mr. Bolton, suggesting she was leaning toward voting for new testimony.
But later, she and Mr. Alexander signed on to a question asking: Even if the reports of the contents of Mr. Bolton's book were accurate, ""isn't it true that the allegations would still not rise to an impeachable offense?"" The Trump defense team agreed.
Democrats argued witnesses were central to the trial process.
""God forbid we should hear what a relevant witness has to say,"" said Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), the lead House manager and chairman of the chamber's Intelligence Committee.
He proposed limiting witness testimony to one week, responding to concerns from Republicans and some Democrats about prolonging the trial with new testimony and the court battles that could ensue from any new subpoenas. The presidential nomination contests begin on Monday in Iowa.
Democrats have argued that Mr. Trump was trying to cheat in this year's election. Mr. Trump's lawyers tried to turn the tables on Democrats, accusing them of using impeachment to interfere in this year's vote. ""That is the most massive election interference in our history,"" said White House counsel Pat Cipollone. ""Let's leave it to the people of the United States.""
Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, on Thursday played down the possibility that Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, could step in to break a 50-50 tie over witnesses. Mr. Schumer said Democrats are focused on getting to 51 votes.

Friday's Agenda
-- The trial resumes at 1 p..m. ET, and senators are set to vote on the motion to allow witnesses and documents.
-- The vote will be preceded by debate.
-- President Trump will be at the White House during the day and later is expected to travel to Florida.

WASHINGTON—President Trump, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf met in the Oval Office on Thursday, following a week of public feuding between New York and the Trump administration touched off by the
federal government's barring New Yorkers from enrolling in
expedited-traveler programs, including Global Entry.
Mr. Wolf called the meeting ""productive"" and said that discussions would continue. But he expressed frustration that
New York continued to refuse federal officials full access
to the state's driver's license records.
""The relationship between New York State and the Federal government is very important but has been made difficult by the unilateral actions of New York State regarding the sharing of critical security information with DHS,"" he said.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo said the governor restated his position during the meeting and believes the DHS restrictions were unwarranted and politically motivated.
The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.
The meeting was the highest-profile event so far in the Trump administration's battle with states and cities that adopt so-called sanctuary policies limiting their cooperation with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which carries out deportations.

Gov. Cuomo Offers Feds Access to Some Driver's License Records
(Feb. 12)

DHS barred enrollment
for New Yorkers in the trusted-traveler programs last week in response to the states's so-called green light law, which allows unauthorized immigrants to receive driver's licenses and shields driver's license records from federal immigration authorities, unless they have a court order.
ICE uses the data from the records—such as photos, addresses and other personal information—to make immigration arrests. U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which oversees Global Entry and other trusted-traveler programs, also uses the data to complete background checks.
The programs, which also include Nexus, SENTRI and FAST, ease congestion at immigration checkpoints, including for thousands of residents in upstate and western New York as well as truck drivers who frequently cross the U.S.-Canada border.
Mr. Wolf and other DHS officials have said New Yorkers will no longer be allowed to enroll or re-enroll in trusted-traveler programs because the agency can't access the information needed for its background checks.
New York and federal immigration officials have traded barbs for months over the driver's license policy and other issues. Top Homeland Security officials publicly blamed New York City's policy limiting law-enforcement cooperation with ICE for the killing of a 92-year-old woman, allegedly by a young unauthorized Guyanese immigrant who had previously been arrested and released. ICE this month also petitioned a federal court to intervene after the New York City Department of Correction failed to comply with two subpoenas for information on unauthorized immigrants who had been in their custody.
On Wednesday, in a pair of radio interviews, Mr. Cuomo said he would give DHS access to the driver's license records to complete background checks for trusted-traveler programs—but not for immigration enforcement. A DHS spokesman said the department hadn't received such a proposal.
Ahead of the White House meeting, the New York State Sheriffs' Association sent a letter to Mr. Cuomo and leaders of the state legislature to express concerns over New York's law.
""Our inability, under the new law, to share DMV data with federal immigration officers jeopardizes the safety of those officers,"" the sheriffs wrote on Thursday.
Speaking in Manhattan before traveling to the White House on Thursday, Mr. Cuomo said he didn't have a high expectation the meeting would be successful. For the past week, he has said the administration's restrictions on trusted-traveler programs were motivated solely by politics. On Monday, the
state filed a lawsuit against DHS
.
Mr. Trump said on Twitter before the meeting that New York ""needs to stop all of its unnecessary lawsuits & harassment."" The president also referred to CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, the governor's younger brother, as Fredo, a reference to ""The Godfather"" films. Chris and Andrew Cuomo have previously said they believe this is a slur against Italian-Americans.
President Trump and Gov. Cuomo have known each other for decades, dating to when Mr. Trump was a New York property developer and Mr. Cuomo was advising his father, former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo. Both men were raised in Queens; Mr. Trump sent a video greeting to Mr. Cuomo's 1990 bachelor party. Mr. Trump has donated $64,000 to his campaigns over the years.
After Mr. Trump was elected president in 2016, Mr. Cuomo avoided criticizing him by name and expressed hope the president would be a partner on developing infrastructure. By 2018 the governor's tone turned sour, and he successfully sought election to a third term by promising to counteract Mr. Trump's policies.
The men have met at the White House about funding for the Gateway Tunnel, an upgraded rail link between New York and New Jersey, as well as federal limits on the deductibility of state and local taxes.

WASHINGTON -- President Trump's first visit to India next week will do more to highlight his personal diplomacy with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi than it will to address tensions over economic issues.
The leaders of the two nations likely will underscore the strength of their security relationship, according to senior U.S. officials. Bolstering those securities ties, at least in part, are shared concerns about terrorism, immigration and the rise of China as a superpower.
""The major area of convergence between the U.S. and India over the last few years has been on the diplomatic and security front,"" said Tanvi Madan, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
""It's been quite remarkable how much progress they have made, spurred in no small part by shared U.S. and Indian concerns about China's actions in the region,"" Ms. Madan said.
The visit comes amid simmering disagreements over trade, e-commerce restrictions and religious and minority protections. But senior U.S. officials say Mr. Trump and Mr. Modi will be more focused on celebrating their personal relationship.
""We are not treated very well by India,"" Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday, referring to issues concerning trade or e-commerce, ""but I happen to like Prime Minister Modi a lot.""
U.S. presidents often receive red-carpet treatment in India, from President Obama's guest-of-honor status at the historic Republic Day celebrations in 2015 to the renaming of a northern Indian village, Carterpuri, after the 38th American president visited there in 1978.
The trip by Mr. Trump, the fourth consecutive U.S. president to visit India, will be brief but colorful. With less than 36 hours between his arrival and departure, he will visit the Taj Mahal, meet with Indian businessmen who have invested in U.S. manufacturing operations, and take part in a state dinner in the presidential palace.
But Mr. Trump's most anticipated event is a rally at Sadar Patel Stadium, designed for cricket matches in Mr. Modi's home state of Gujarat, and with a capacity of 110,000.
Mr. Trump has held some 100 campaign rallies since his 2016 election victory -- just three in the past week alone -- but his largest rallies have topped off at about 20,000 people.
The festivities will gloss over an escalating trade dispute between the world's two largest democracies that largely has been overshadowed by the market-rattling conflict between the U.S. and China. A proposed U.S. deal with India was shelved this year, with Mr. Trump saying Thursday that such a pact wouldn't be made until after the U.S. election in November.
An administration official said Mr. Trump planned to discuss his concerns with Mr. Modi about an Indian citizenship law that critics say discriminates against Muslims. He also planned to privately encourage Mr. Modi to reduce tensions with Pakistan over disputes in Kashmir, and to seek support from India in the peace process in Afghanistan, the official said.
The two leaders make an odd couple. Mr. Trump is a real-estate tycoon and former reality-television star, while Mr. Modi is the son of a tea-stall owner. Both have risen on the nationalist wave and dethroned establishment powers in their conservative parties.
They have met eight times since Mr. Trump took office, including on the stage of a rally in Houston, attracting 50,000 people, that the U.S. president hosted on Mr. Modi's behalf.
President Trump is a popular figure in India. A recent Pew Research poll showed that 56% of people -- higher than almost any nation in the world -- have confidence that Mr. Trump will do the right thing in global affairs.
Mr. Modi is expected to use his meeting with the leader of the world's most powerful country to project strength. Meanwhile, Mr. Modi's policies, which critics say marginalize India's Muslims and other minorities and undermine India's secular and democratic foundation, have in recent months triggered the biggest protests since he took office. The Modi administration denies its critics' charges.

Michigan, a state that breathed life into the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign four years ago, delivered a punishing blow to his 2020 prospects as Joe Biden easily won the most closely watched primary among Tuesday's
six Democratic nominating contests
.
The Midwest industrial state was the biggest delegate prize on a day when Mr. Biden also scored wins in Mississippi, Missouri and Idaho. Mr. Sanders won in North Dakota, and Washington state hadn't been called as of early Wednesday.
Share Your Thoughts
How do you think the Democratic nominee will fare against President Trump in the Midwest in November? Join the conversation below.
The results, which raise questions about the viability of the Vermont senator's campaign, arrived after both candidates canceled election night events in Cleveland because of concerns about
the coronavirus epidemic
. Ohio hosts one of four March 17 primaries.
Mr. Sanders faces even tougher terrain as the race moves later this month to states that include Florida, Illinois and Georgia. Those delegate-rich states have large proportions of black voters and Mr. Biden, the vice president to America's first black president, has shown strength in winning their support.
Here are the key takeaways from Tuesday's voting and what they may mean for the race ahead:
Why Michigan Matters
The Michigan primary took on greater importance in the race for a variety of reasons.
There was history: Mr. Sanders scored an upset win there four years ago against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. That victory gave him momentum to keep fighting for the nomination all the way to the Democratic National Convention.
There was investment: In recent days, Mr. Sanders had shifted campaign time and money to Michigan in hopes of securing the sort of defining win Mr. Biden had in South Carolina's Feb. 29 primary.
And there was significance: Michigan is a top battleground for the general election, so Mr. Biden's victory provides ammunition for his argument that he's the party's best option to confront President Trump in the Rust Belt states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin where a total of about 77,000 gave the Republican a winning Electoral College margin.
Black Voters Keep Helping Biden
African-Americans in South Carolina helped revive Mr. Biden's candidacy, and the Michigan results showed he can win northern black voters as well. Exit polls published by CNN showed him winning roughly two-thirds of that vote in Michigan and 70% in Missouri.
Wayne County, home to Detroit and a large share of Michigan's black population, backed Mr. Biden over Mr. Sanders, 54.5% to 35.8%. Turnout there was up almost 16% from the 2016 primary.
Such strong support could prove helpful to Mr. Biden in contests later this month in Illinois, Florida and Georgia. In 2016, the black share of the Democratic primary electorate in Georgia was 51%, while it was 28% in Illinois and 27% in Florida.
Hispanic voters continued to be a weak spot for Mr. Biden and a strength for Mr. Sanders. In Michigan, the senator won 55% of Hispanic voters, while the former vice president drew 37% from that demographic.
Suburban Voters Boost Biden
While Mr. Sanders has argued he's the candidate most capable of beating Mr. Trump because he would expand the Democratic electorate, that hasn't proved to be the case in primaries and caucuses held so far. Growth from the 2016 primaries has mostly been among older people, more moderate suburban residents and African-Americans.
The suburban Detroit vote in Oakland and Macomb counties leaned heavily in Mr. Biden's direction. Four years earlier, Mr. Sanders ran a close second in both counties.
Macomb, home of automotive plants and parts suppliers and mostly white union-member voters, is also considered a key county in the general election. Mr. Trump beat Mrs. Clinton there by more than 11 percentage points in 2016.
Michigan exit polls showed roughly two-thirds of the primary's voters live in suburban areas, and Mr. Biden won a narrow majority of that vote, compared with 40% for Mr. Sanders. Mr. Biden also won in the state's urban and rural areas.
In Ionia County east of Grand Rapids, Mr. Biden beat Mr. Sanders 52% to 38%. Four years earlier, Mr. Sanders had won the county by 30 percentage points.
Mr. Biden won a majority of the vote in all five regional areas tracked by the exit polls in Michigan, a stark contrast to four years ago when Mr. Sanders won 73 of the state's 83 counties.
Young Voters Don't Grow Their Vote Share
Mr. Sanders has tried hard to boost turnout among the young voters drawn to his candidacy from the start. But he has shown little success in doing so this year, at least as a share of the total electorate.
Among voters 18 to 24 years old in Michigan, Mr. Sanders dominated Mr. Biden, 79% to 18%. But their share of the total electorate was essentially unchanged from four years ago and not enough to overcome Mr. Biden's strength with other age groups.
Among those 65 and older in Michigan, Mr. Biden won almost three-quarters of the vote.
White Working-Class Voters Back Biden
Mr. Biden also performed well among Michigan's white, working-class voters. The former vice president beat Mr. Sanders 50% to 43% among whites with no college degree, a group that accounted for 37% of the electorate.
Should Mr. Biden win the Democratic nomination, those voters will be a key group in Michigan and other states because they were a source of strength for Mr. Trump in the 2016 election.
Among white men with no college degree, Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders split the vote evenly.
Mr. Sanders beat Mr. Biden in Michigan by 7 percentage points among independent voters, who accounted for 29% of Democratic primary voters. But that was a much smaller share than four years earlier, when he won 71% of that group.

Iran will refuse to negotiate with the U.S. as long as Washington maintains its campaign of ""maximum pressure""—even if President Trump is re-elected, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said Sunday.
Mr. Rouhani's defiant remarks solidify Iran's hard line in a face-off with the Trump administration that only weeks ago
brought Washington and Tehran to the brink of war
.
""It makes no difference who will be the next [American] administration,"" Mr. Rouhani said, speaking at a news conference in the Iranian capital. ""Iran will never negotiate under pressure.""
He demanded that the U.S. return to the
2015 nuclear deal
,
which President Trump quit in 2018
, citing Iran's military activity in the Middle East.
The Iranian president, who has been isolated domestically amid the nuclear deal's near-collapse and the economic damage of U.S. sanctions, said he still had the support of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. Mr. Rouhani said he has twice asked Mr. Khamenei if he had a better candidate for the job of Iran's president but was asked to stay.
""I told the supreme leader, 'If you think for some reason that someone else or another government can serve the country better, I'm ready to quit,'"" Mr. Rouhani said.
Mr. Rouhani threatened to resign after the Iranian military mistakenly shot down a
Ukrainian passenger airline in January
, with his government clashing with the country's military over whether to admit responsibility.
Mr. Rouhani on Sunday, for the first time, acknowledged to have heard about possible missiles being the cause of the plane crash one day after the incident. He said he wasn't officially notified until nearly three days later.
The president spoke as Iran prepares for parliamentary elections on Friday, for which the establishment is trying to rally a large turnout to bolster itself against a rise of domestic discontent.
After the downing of the Ukrainian jetliner,
Iranians took to the streets
to denounce what they said were lies by their leaders. The protests followed economic-related protests weeks earlier that rocked the nation, prompting a deadly crackdown by security forces in which hundreds of protesters were killed.
Although Mr. Rouhani criticized Iran's conservative Guardian Council for disqualifying many of his fellow moderates and reformists from running in the elections, he called for Iranians to head to the polls.
The long-brewing crisis between Tehran and Washington has escalated recently following months of harsh U.S. sanctions that have hammered Iran's economy but failed to change its military posture in the Middle East.
Tensions culminated in January with a direct military confrontation when the U.S. killed Gen. Qassem Soleimani,
Iran's most prominent military commander
and the engineer behind Iran's network of allied militias. Iran responded by
firing over a dozen missiles at an Iraqi military base housing U.S. troops
. No one was killed.
While Washington says Iran is the main force responsible for destabilizing the Middle East, Mr. Rouhani said peace and stability is impossible without Iran's help.
He added that if Saudi Arabia halted its aggression in Yemen, where
Riyadh has been fighting Iran-backed Houthi rebels for more than five years
, Iran would work with it to pursue peace in the region.
However, that comment came as two Saudi pilots were missing after Houthis shot down their jet fighter over Yemen's Jawf province on Friday.
U.S. officials accuse Iran of arming the rebels with missile and drone technology—a charge Tehran denies.
The shootdown of the Saudi plane has the potential to deepen hostilities as a cease-fire threatens to collapse. The attack on the Saudi plane triggered retaliatory airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition Saturday, which according to the United Nations killed as many as 31 civilians.

WASHINGTON—President Trump endorsed former football coach Tommy Tuberville in
the runoff to be the Republican nominee
for the U.S. Senate in Alabama, throwing his influence behind the opponent of his former attorney general, Jeff Sessions, who is trying to win back his old seat.
""Tommy was a terrific head football coach at Auburn University,"" Mr. Trump wrote in tweets late Tuesday. ""He is a REAL LEADER who will never let MAGA/KAG, or our Country, down! ... Coach Tommy Tuberville, a winner, has my Complete and Total Endorsement,"" Mr. Trump tweeted.
Mr. Tuberville and Mr. Sessions emerged from a Republican primary earlier this month to compete in a runoff election on March 31. Mr. Tuberville won the primary by a few points.
The endorsement could be decisive in the race, which has largely become

a contest about supporting the president
. Mr. Trump won Alabama by 28 percentage points in 2016.
The winner will face Democratic incumbent Sen. Doug Jones in November. While Mr. Jones has out-fundraised both candidates, Republicans see the primary as the real obstacle. Mr. Jones won a 2017 special election by just 2 percentage points after the Republican nominee was accused by several women of sexual misconduct that they say occurred when they were underage.
Mr. Sessions formerly served in the Senate and was one of Mr. Trump's early backers in the 2016 campaign. He was then picked to serve as attorney general but angered the president
by recusing himself from the probe into Russia's interference
in the 2016 presidential election and any ties between Russia and Mr. Trump's campaign.
Mr. Trump needled Mr. Sessions repeatedly in tweets during his tumultuous time in the administration, forced him to resign in 2018 and later said appointing him was his ""biggest mistake.""
The morning after Mr. Trump's endorsement of Mr. Tuberville, Mr. Sessions declared himself ""one of the architects of the Trump agenda"" and said he had ""always supported it and always will.""
""Nothing the President can do will deter me from supporting this agenda, because my principles, just like my faith, are fundamental to who I am and immovable,"" he wrote on Twitter.
""We are Alabama. Nobody tells us how to vote or what to do.""
Mr. Tuberville has faced attacks from Mr. Sessions that he isn't Alabamian enough to represent the state. Mr. Sessions' first ad in the runoff was titled ""Florida Man"" and focused on how the former Auburn University head coach moved to Florida for several years. The coach has positioned himself as an outsider to politics who wants to help the nation's veterans.
Mr. Tuberville responded to Mr. Trump by tweeting, ""Looking forward to helping you drain the swamp and #KAG!""—an abbreviation for ""Keep America Great,"" the president's campaign slogan.

WASHINGTON -- The coronavirus crisis is rapidly changing President Trump's re-election strategy, forcing him into the position of leading the nation through a sprawling, complex emergency while undermining his greatest asset: a strong economy.
Mr. Trump this week has taken steps to demonstrate more command, appearing at daily news conferences and taking a solemn outlook, while his campaign weighs how to contend with battered financial markets and rising unemployment.
""People are going to judge him in this moment -- and this moment is going to last for a while,"" said Mike DuHaime, a Republican strategist not involved in the campaign. ""In the beginning he downplayed it too much and that hurt his credibility, but there is a lot of time to go now where he can compensate.""
That is forefront in the thinking of Mr. Trump's campaign advisers. The virus might ease amid extraordinary steps affecting all aspects of everyday life, and the campaign could resume its normal rhythms before Election Day. But the situation might also get worse.
Mr. Trump's campaign is banking on the economy bouncing back ahead of the crucial several months before November when voters are paying the most attention, advisers say. It has begun to formulate an argument that Mr. Trump's policies since taking office fueled the economy to new heights, and that he is best equipped to build it up a second time if necessary.
""We will point out that it is under the present policies that it was so vibrant and those policies are still in place,"" campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said. ""The stock market will rebound, and the economy will still be in solid shape.""
This week the main super PAC supporting Mr. Trump's re-election held discussions on possible ads highlighting steps the president has taken to combat the virus, including putting travel restrictions on China, according to a person familiar with the talks.
In recent days Mr. Trump has referred to the ""Chinese virus,"" a term that has been criticized for its racist connotations. His campaign on Wednesday moved to portray him as taking tough actions against a world rival and sought to draw a contrast with Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who is closing in on the party's presidential nomination.
The former vice president's campaign observed that the president has praised Chinese President Xi Jinping for his handling of the emergency. Of a Trump-campaign email that accused Mr. Biden of ""incompetence and misinformation,"" Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said, ""This is projection, pure and simple -- a classic Trump campaign move.""
For now, campaign mechanics -- including the rallies that energize Mr. Trump as much as his supporters -- are in the background or on hold and the burden largely rests on the president using the White House stage to make his case. His discipline at news conferences this week has pleased advisers, though they privately acknowledge anything can change.
""I think the base will hold with him no matter, but if he does dumb stuff, he won't be able to build on his reach to voters,"" one adviser said.
Only a short time ago Mr. Trump was feeling especially confident. He emerged from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election and then withstood impeachment. His campaign was running smoothly.
Now those gains are in jeopardy. A Gallup poll released Tuesday showed Mr. Trump's approval rating was down to 44%, slipping 5 percentage points and back to pre-impeachment levels. Among independent voters, his approval was down 7 percentage points.
Campaign officials and advisers said the tactics are evolving. While the campaign is unlikely to run any new ads focused on the economy, some believe those spots could be airing again by the fall. Mr. Trump and his team have careened from one political crisis to the next since the 2016 election, and there has been little change in his approval rating since he took office.
""Look, if in 45 days it looks like everything is going back to normal,"" one adviser said, ""then everything is going to go back to where it was.""

WASHINGTON—The House sent two articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate on Wednesday, after voting to
approve seven Democratic managers
to prosecute the case before the Republican-controlled chamber.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) said that she stressed litigation experience in choosing managers to handle the trial over alleged presidential abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Senators are expected to be sworn in on Thursday, and the proceedings will get under way in earnest on Tuesday.
""The emphasis is making the strongest possible case to protect and defend our Constitution, to seek the truth for the American people,"" Mrs. Pelosi said.
""President Trump has done nothing wrong,"" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said, adding that he ""expects to be fully exonerated.""
The managers aim to advance Democrats' arguments that Mr. Trump should be removed from office. The group comprises House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California, Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Reps. Zoe Lofgren of California, Val Demings of Florida, Sylvia Garcia of Texas and Jason Crow of Colorado.
After a brief debate, the House approved the managers, 228 to 193, almost entirely along party lines. One Democrat, Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota, broke with the party and voted against the resolution. He had also opposed both articles of impeachment. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, an independent who left the GOP last year, supported the resolution.
The Democratic-led House
voted to impeach Mr. Trump
last month. The first article of impeachment on abuse of power stems from Mr. Trump
pressing Ukraine to investigate
former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, including by
withholding almost $400 million in aid
to help Kyiv combat Russian aggression. The second article accuses Mr. Trump of impeding Congress's investigation by preventing witnesses from testifying and defying subpoenas for documentary evidence.
After the House impeached Mr. Trump, Mrs. Pelosi held off on naming the managers for nearly a month, as Democrats unsuccessfully sought guarantees from Senate Republicans that new witnesses would be heard and new evidence presented. She relented this week, after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) ratcheted up the pressure on her by signing on to a resolution to dismiss the case.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What's your assessment of the managers picked to oversee the impeachment trial? Join the conversation below.
House Democratic leaders argue the delay paid off, as new emails and documents related to the case emerged in recent weeks related to Ukraine aid, as well as documents showing the effort to undermine the then-U.S. ambassador to the country.
""It made sense to wait a while, as even more evidence piled up, but we have to proceed, because…the integrity of the election is at stake,"" said Mr. Nadler, referring to the November presidential election.
The White House doesn't believe there is a need to hear witness testimony in the Senate trial, a senior administration official told reporters Wednesday. The official said the White House considers it ""extraordinarily unlikely"" that the trial would last longer than two weeks.
But several Republicans senators, including Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, have said they would be open to hearing from new witnesses, and Mr. McConnell has ruled out a quick dismissal of the case.
Witnesses sought by Democrats
include former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who were directed by the White House not to testify before the House inquiry.
Votes on witnesses and documents could extend the trial beyond that time frame, potentially extending it through the Iowa caucuses on Feb.3—the first nominating contest in the 2020 Democratic presidential race—and Mr. Trump's State of the Union address, scheduled for Feb. 4.
""If people decide they want to call witnesses it probably could on for a while,"" Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), the No. 2 Senate Republican, said on Tuesday. He said that wrapping up the trial by Mr. Trump's State of the Union address ""seems like a fairly tight deadline given what we are facing.""

Republican senators briefed on a GOP draft of rules for the trial said it likely will include
a guaranteed vote on witnesses
and documents after opening arguments and a period for written questions. Moderate Republicans had been pushing for such a vote, putting them at odds with Mr. Trump, who recently renewed his call to dismiss the articles without a trial.
Some Republican senators are pushing reciprocity of witnesses, so that if Democrats hear from Mr. Bolton, Republicans would push to hear from Mr. Biden's son Hunter Biden, according to a person familiar with the matter. The younger Mr. Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company that Mr. Trump asked Ukraine's leader to investigate—one of the acts at the center of the House's impeachment case.
""If [Democrats] end up getting witnesses, I'm going to insist there be a motion that the president gets to call anybody deemed to be necessary to his defense,"" said Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) in an interview.
Both Bidens deny any wrongdoing, and in the Democratic debate Tuesday night, Mr. Biden called allegations from Mr. Trump and his allies ""flat out lies.""
Mrs. Pelosi signed the articles of impeachment in a ceremony at the Capitol on Wednesday. Flanked by the leaders of several House committees and the impeachment managers, she again laid out the case for impeaching Mr. Trump, accusing him of abusing his oath of office and obstructing Congress. She then sat to formally sign the articles of impeachment, cycling through roughly a dozen pens emblazoned with her name as she did so, and finally handing one of the pens to each of the lawmakers gathered. Mrs. Pelosi kept one for herself.
The House's clerk and the sergeant at arms, accompanied by all seven Democratic impeachment managers, then walked the articles to the Senate, along with a message that the House has appointed managers to exhibit the articles of impeachment.
Inside the Senate chamber, the camera flashes first came into view through the filigreed windows of the Senate door and then the footsteps. At about 5:34 p.m., the procession of seven House Democrats appeared at the door, met by Laura Dove, the secretary for the Republicans, who signaled the group to head to the back wall.
The managers entered, single file, and walked to their places. At their desks inside the chamber, 27 Senate Democrats sat in their seats. Only two Republicans—Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) and Sen. Kevin Cramer (R., N.D.)—were in the room to bear witness.
""Mr. President, a message from the House of Representatives,"" Ms. Dove told Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), the Senate's president pro tempore, who presided over the chamber.
Mr. McConnell acknowledged the message and said the Senate will receive the managers to present the articles of impeachment at noon Thursday. ""This is a difficult time for our country, but this is precisely the kind of time for which the framers created the Senate,"" Mr. McConnell said.
On Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts, who will preside over the trial, will be sworn in by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), who serves as the Senate's president pro tempore. Mr. Roberts will then administer the same oath, to do ""impartial justice,"" to all 100 senators, who will act as the jury. At least two-thirds of the senators would have to vote to convict the president to remove him from office.
Mr. Trump will be summoned and given time to respond. Then, the Senate is expected to break for the holiday weekend and reconvene to start the trial.
Proposed restrictions on press access during the trial have become a point of contention, with fewer ways for reporters to speak to senators and increased security within the Senate Press Gallery.

President Trump's announced
travel ban on Europe
, beyond surprising European capitals, deepens tensions among trans-Atlantic allies whose ties are already strained over trade, security, climate change and what Europeans say is the U.S. failure to consult them.
European governments complained that the announcement, made early Thursday Europe time, came without notice and coordination on what is a global health problem. Moreover, the U.S. ban, European Union leaders said,
directly affects European citizens
, barring many of them from travel to the U.S., and disregards the EU's ""strong action"" to contain

the new coronavirus
.
Mr. Trump defended the ban and the timing, saying the situation demanded fast action so not all European leaders could be notified.
""We had to make a decision and I didn't want to take time, and, you know, it takes a lot of time to make the individual calls, and we are calling, and we have spoken to some of them prior to.… But we had to move quickly,"" Mr. Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he met with the prime minister of Ireland, whose citizens aren't affected by the ban.
The ban—which covers most non-U.S. citizens who have traveled through 26 European countries—comes on top of other U.S. decisions made unilaterally under Mr. Trump that have dismayed European leaders. Some decisions, including
the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord
and the multinational Iran nuclear deal, followed pledges Mr. Trump made during his 2016 run for president.
Other decisions, such as his placing of tariffs on European steel and aluminum, which Mr. Trump justified on national security grounds, stunned EU leaders, who note that Europe contributes to U.S. security by participating in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other alliances.
Mr. Trump has jangled European nerves by criticizing those contributions as insufficient and by threatening to impose tariffs on European cars, also on national security grounds.
""There's considerable friction between Europe and the United States on many fronts,"" said Julianne Smith, who served as deputy national security adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic front-runner in the race to face Mr. Trump in the November election.
""One of the things that's irritating the Europeans the most, though, is the administration's failure to consult with our European allies on a number of issues,"" said Ms. Smith, a geopolitics expert at the German Marshall Fund.
EU leaders and officials said imposing the travel ban without consultation is particularly counterproductive because governments need to work together to stem the spread of the coronavirus. President Trump's decision rankled further because he said the EU failed to restrict travel from China and contain the virus, which, he said, then seeded outbreaks in the U.S.
The EU wouldn't comment on Mr. Trump's comments.
In a national address Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron drew a contrast with Mr. Trump's announcement about the travel ban, emphasizing that the coronavirus pandemic was a challenge in need of a global solution. He said any decision to close national borders would only happen when necessary and be coordinated with other European countries.
""This virus doesn't have a passport,"" Mr. Macron said, adding that he planned to speak to Mr. Trump on Friday. ""Being divided won't allow us to respond to what's a global crisis.""
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in a statement: ""I believe we are dealing with a global issue and a global challenge. We don't do it justice, including in the U.S., by taking decisions that are garnished with blame.""
The coronavirus crisis ""requires cooperation rather than unilateral action,"" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel said in a statement. ""The European Union disapproves of the fact that the U.S. decision to improve a travel ban was taken unilaterally and without consultation.""
A spokesman for the European Commission, the EU's executive, said officials were still seeking to understand the scope and consequences of the U.S. decision. Eric Mamer, the chief spokesman said there were no immediate plans for any retaliatory steps but didn't rule that out.
Mr. Trump has repeatedly accused the EU and European countries of taking advantage of the U.S. on defense and trade. He has urged them to increase defense spending and demanded a reduction in the U.S. trade deficit with the EU in goods.
European countries have pledged significant defense spending increases. On trade, the two sides recently hoped to reach agreement later this month to avert fresh U.S. tariffs on EU products.
That target date, however, now looks doubtful, EU officials said. EU Trade commissioner Phil Hogan canceled a planned trip to Canada and the U.S. in coming days due to concerns about coronavirus.

WASHINGTON—President Trump said restrictions on economic activity could be lifted in some parts of the country but not others as his administration works to develop a plan for how Americans could return to work in a few weeks without exacerbating
the spread of the new coronavirus in the U.S.

""It's time. People want to get back to work,"" Mr. Trump said in a briefing Wednesday. He said that ""large sections"" of the country could return to work far sooner than others, but that New York has a 'number of very tough weeks ahead."" The president added that ""I'm not going to do anything rash or hastily.""
Mr. Trump in recent days has repeatedly signaled his interest in reviving the economy within the coming weeks,
saying Tuesday that he hoped to do so by Easter
, which falls on April 12—just under a month after the White House issued guidelines advising Americans to practice social distancing and avoid gathering in groups of 10 or more.
But the federal government's ability to force the reopening of the economy is limited, as much of that power rests with state governors and mayors.
Mr. Trump's timeline also is considerably shorter than what many health experts, including some in his own administration, have said will be necessary to blunt the spread of coronavirus across the U.S. and keep the nation's health care system from being overwhelmed.
The president claimed in a tweet Wednesday that the news media was pressuring him to keep much of the economy closed in order to hurt his re-election chances in November.
White House advisers and public health experts are developing proposals that could include workplace testing of employees and intensified contact tracing to curb the spread of the infection, according to people familiar with the planning. Their goal is to release a plan before Easter. Officials are also considering implementing more widespread and targeted testing in areas of the country where there are fewer cases.
But it's not clear the U.S. currently has the testing capacity to implement such measures. State and local health labs would need more federal help to establish specific reporting sites that act as sentinels to know how fast or far the virus is spreading.
Even if Mr. Trump moves to relax the federal government's social distancing guidelines next month, his actions may have a limited effect.
While the Trump administration has issued guidelines urging Americans to stay home, the most severe restrictions nationwide have come from governors, who have ordered nonessential businesses to close in at least 24 states and have imposed restrictions on those businesses in a dozen more. Nineteen states plan to or already require residents to stay home. Federal guidelines don't trump state restrictions.
The result could be an even further decentralized patchwork of guidelines across the nation, which public-health experts say will make it harder to combat the virus's spread. The U.S., because of its decentralized structure of government and health care systems, has faced greater hurdles than some Asian countries in implementing rigorous measures to test and quarantine citizens.
""A patchwork approach is functionally a least-common-denominator approach, which is a huge problem,"" said Jeremy Konyndyk, who led the U.S. government's response to international disasters under the Obama administration. ""In the absence of uniform standards and robust surveillance, we are vulnerable to governors taking risks in their states that end up endangering other states as well.""
Mr. Trump has faced pressure from business leaders and some of his own advisers to reopen the economy soon, as uncertainty about the pandemic has sent the stock market reeling in recent weeks, and
business closures have caused millions to lose their jobs
. ""We can't have the cure be worse than the problem,"" Mr. Trump said this week.
Health experts in the administration have urged more caution. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said it will be at least several weeks before the country can reopen and on Tuesday described the Easter timeline as ""flexible.""
Governors in both parties rejected the Easter timeline the president offered and said they planned to chart their own course. Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose state has been by far the hardest hit by the virus, stressed that the federal government was offering suggestions, not decrees. ""They call them guidelines because they are guidelines,"" he said at a briefing Wednesday. ""We'll come up with a plan that works for New York.""
Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who last week ordered the state's 40 million residents to stay at home except for essential activities, said it would be ""misleading to represent"" that California would reopen by Easter.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, tweeted that he was looking forward to the day when the economy could reopen, but ""it's not yet here.""
Some states have also imposed penalties for violating state guidelines aimed at slowing the virus's spread. In Virginia, companies can lose operating licenses or face misdemeanor charges if they violate state guidelines. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat, made it a misdemeanor to open or shop at certain retail businesses such as hair salons, gyms and fitness studios and theaters.
Public health experts say it could take months, if not years, before life returns to normal. They say the U.S. is woefully behind on the type of widespread testing and quarantine measures adopted in Singapore and South Korea that were successful at reducing spread of the virus. They also say that reopening too soon could overwhelm hospitals, endanger health-care workers and fuel the virus's spread in states where it isn't prevalent now.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, warned in a briefing Wednesday that in the absence of necessary preparations, the virus could resurge once restrictions are eased. ""The last thing any country needs is to open schools and businesses, only to be forced to close them again because of a resurgence,"" he said.
Another question is the level of control the president can exert over the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines. Mr. Trump has stressed that he will listen to advice from his administration's health experts on when to reopen the economy, but that he will render the final decision on the timeline.
Ned Price, who was an adviser to former President Barack Obama, said that while Mr. Trump has authority over CDC guidelines, the agency has traditionally been granted a level of independence by previous presidents. That practice, however, is dictated ""not by laws but by norms,"" which Mr. Trump has made a habit of shattering, he said.
Americans around the country in recent days received a postcard from the federal government outlining the CDC's guidelines for social distancing. The front of the postcard reads: ""President Trump's coronavirus guidelines for America."" His first piece of advice: ""Listen and follow the directions of your STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES.""

Betting markets show Hillary Clinton is one of the top contenders in the race for the Democratic nominee.
She isn't running for president.
Prediction markets have become a popular, though not necessarily reliable, way for people to bet on political results. While notoriously volatile and often proven wrong, betting markets are drawing extra scrutiny ahead of this week's Super Tuesday contests.
Consider PredictIt, an online market run by New Zealand's Victoria University of Wellington. Offering a range of election and other political bets, PredictIt currently shows a bettor can pay 7 cents to win $1 if Mrs. Clinton wins the Democratic nomination. Those are the fourth-best odds of any nominee, better than those of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg.
Perhaps the prediction markets know something others don't, but Mrs. Clinton isn't a candidate. (A PredictIt spokesman said Mrs. Clinton's odds were likely a reflection of ""trader long-shot bias"" and the possibility of a brokered convention, among other factors.)
Other metrics also show extremes that don't mesh with what more traditional political polls show. Bettors at one point on PredictIt last month gave former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg a 33% chance of winning the nomination.
Those odds -- which placed him in second place at the time and came on some of the heaviest volume PredictIt has logged over the past 90 days -- were also far higher than the probabilities he garnered in other political polls.
The 2020 campaign has largely been a secondary factor driving recent financial-market performance. Stocks are coming off their worst week since the financial crisis on fears of how the spreading coronavirus could crimp the global economy and profits.
Yet some investors also are trying to decipher what the Super Tuesday outcomes could mean for markets, particularly as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is a leading contender for the nomination.
Chris Senyek, chief investment strategist at Wolfe Research, said the markets' recent swoon was driven by ""rising Covid-19 fears, and, to a lesser extent, Bernie Sanders' strong momentum.""
Mixing politics and portfolios has historically had a mixed record. The conventional wisdom heading into the 2016 presidential election was a Donald Trump victory would prompt stocks to go down. Betting markets played down then-candidate Trump's chances. Of course, the opposite played out.
Goldman Sachs analysts said prediction markets suggest a divided federal government is the most probable election outcome, one that could lead to additional uncertainty if corporate tax reform implemented under President Trump is reversed. Under that scenario, Goldman said, ""the impact on S&P 500 profits would be significant.""
The firm is no longer expecting U.S. companies to post any earnings growth in 2020. It expects exporters will register falling demand and companies will suffer from supply-chain disruptions as a result of the spreading coronavirus outbreak, which could pose widespread disruptions on people's everyday lives and business activity and imperil the U.S. economy's longest expansion on record.
""An economic slowdown caused by this virus certainly increases Bernie's chances,"" said Dave Lutz, managing director and head of ETF trading at JonesTrading.
The thinking is a struggling economy, or even a recession, could hurt Mr. Trump's odds at being re-elected, paving the way for whoever becomes the Democratic nominee. PredictIt shows Mr. Sanders has a greater than 50% chance of securing the nomination, but only a 31% chance of beating President Trump in the election.
One indicator Goldman Sachs analysts are watching is second-quarter gross domestic product growth. Historically, this has been one of the most important metrics to watch in gauging a sitting U.S. president's re-election probability.

WASHINGTON—Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said Thursday that the nation needs to harness a comprehensive public-health and economic response to the coronavirus, offering a look at how he would address a crisis in the White House.
The former vice president, in a speech near his home in Wilmington, Del., said the nation must respond aggressively to combat the spread of the disease, with practices and staff he described as grounded in science.
He said President Trump's labeling of the outbreak as a ""foreign virus"" during a Wednesday night Oval Office address ""does not displace accountability for the misjudgments that have been taken thus far by the Trump administration.""
""Let me be crystal clear, the coronavirus does not have a political affiliation,"" Mr. Biden said. ""It will infect Republicans, independents and Democrats alike.""
The former vice president outlined a new plan to fight the virus, saying the U.S. should lead a coordinated, global response that prepares hospitals and public-health workers and responds to the economic fallout. ""President Trump is welcome to adopt all of it today,"" he said.
Mr. Trump's campaign said in response that the president had ""acted early and decisively"" to fight the virus, and he had put the U.S. ""on stronger footing than other nations.""
""His every move has been aimed at keeping Americans safe, while Joe Biden has sought to capitalize politically and stoke citizens' fears,"" Tim Murtaugh, the Trump campaign's communications director, said.
The image of Mr. Biden standing before a backdrop of American flags in a conference room at the Hotel DuPont aimed to project steadiness and serve as a counterweight to Mr. Trump, who has been accused by Democrats of providing a halting response to the outbreak.
It came as the coronavirus has forced the presidential campaigns of Mr. Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Mr. Trump to curtail their public activities. Mr. Biden canceled events in Ohio, Florida and Illinois this week; the campaign is planning ""virtual"" events in Chicago and Miami in coming days.
Mr. Biden's campaign said in an internal memo Thursday that all staff at its Philadelphia headquarters and around the country would work from home beginning Saturday. The campaign will continue to hold smaller events such as round-tables and house parties, but all fundraisers ""will become virtual fundraisers indefinitely.""
Mr. Sanders also addressed the pandemic in a speech in Burlington, Vt., using it to highlight Medicare for All, one of his signature policies. He said even without a single-payer health-care system, the government needed to provide care at no cost.
Mr. Trump, meanwhile, canceled a trip to Colorado and Nevada, including an appearance at a Republican Jewish Coalition event in Las Vegas. That event has since been postponed.
The campaign said Thursday night that staff had been instructed to work remotely through Monday so that the office could undergo a deep cleaning. An official described the move as precautionary.
The president has publicly and privately chafed at postponing rallies and had largely defended continuing them as the virus escalated. The campaign had recently been looking at holding a rally in Tampa, but hadn't announced any plans as some allies grew concerned that Mr. Trump should put the activity on pause.
Speaking to reporters Thursday, Mr. Trump said the campaign had been looking at ""four or five"" rallies, adding that the never-announced event in Tampa was ""all sold out.""
""I think we'll probably not do it, because people would say it's better to not do. You know, we need a little separation until such time as this goes away,"" Mr. Trump said. ""It's going to go away. It's going to go away.""
Mr. Biden's speech came at a pivot point for his campaign as it readies for a likely general election battle against the president. Mr. Biden on Thursday installed Jennifer O'Malley Dillon,
a top former Obama campaign aide, as his new campaign manager
, succeeding Greg Schultz, who will focus on planning for the general election.
Mr. Biden's remarks effectively were a response to the Oval Office address of Mr. Trump, who announced a 30-day ban on most travel from Europe to the U.S.
The former vice president said Americans should have access to free testing for the virus, especially the elderly living in nursing homes, and said the nation needed to swiftly develop a vaccine for coronavirus.
Mr. Biden said the country also needed a strong economic response, and urged Congress to press for emergency paid leave for workers affected by the outbreak, an expansion and broadening of unemployment benefits and temporary loans for small businesses dealing with revenue shortfalls.
Some of those steps, including paid leave, have been pushed by the president, who has said workers affected by the virus should be able to ""stay home without fear of financial hardship.""
The president has also pressed for payroll-tax relief and said the Small Business Administration will soon offer low-interest loans to small businesses.
Mr. Biden's campaign announced Wednesday its own advisory committee on coronavirus, bringing together several former Obama officials to provide what he described as science-based, expert advice on ways the campaign can minimize health risks for the candidate, staff and supporters.
But more than simply advising the campaign, the list of people served as a preview of the type of administration Mr. Biden might assemble if elected.
The committee includes former Obama homeland security and counterterrorism adviser Lisa Monaco, Dr. David Kessler, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and Dr. Vivek Murthy, who served as the nation's surgeon general.
Mr. Biden ""was there during the economic crisis, he oversaw the bailout. He's been there,"" said Dr. Zeke Emanuel, an advisory committee member and a vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania. ""More importantly, no single person can address these issues.""

WASHINGTON—Republican leaders said they don't currently have enough votes to block witnesses in President Trump's Senate impeachment trial, after his legal team concluded its efforts to counter Democrats' charges that the president abused power and obstructed Congress.
On the third and final day of presentations by the Trump legal team, lawyers tried to cast doubts on the importance and credibility of
allegations by former national security adviser John Bolton
about the president's motives for freezing aid to Ukraine.
But at a meeting of all Republican senators late Tuesday, GOP leaders told their conference that they don't currently have the votes to prevent witnesses from being called, people familiar with the matter said. Republicans had hoped to wrap up the trial with an acquittal of the president by this week, but Democrats have said he should appear under oath to offer a firsthand account of the president's motivations for freezing aid to Ukraine—a matter at the heart of the impeachment case.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said the vote total wasn't where it needed to be on blocking witnesses or documents, these people said. He had a card with ""yes,"" ""no,"" and ""maybes"" marked on it, apparently a whip count, but he didn't show it to senators.
Sens. Cory Gardner of Colorado, Martha McSally of Arizona and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who face competitive races in the fall, warned colleagues in the meeting against backing more witnesses, people familiar with the matter said. The senators said a drawn-out trial could lead to more Democratic attacks and hurt their re-election chances, the people said. None of the three senators' offices immediately responded to requests for comment.
During Tuesday's proceedings, the president's lawyers argued that House managers hadn't established their case that Mr. Trump abused power and obstructed Congress and said the accusations fell short of the threshold needed to remove a president from office, particularly in an election year.
""The bar for impeachment cannot be set this low,"" said Jay Sekulow, one of the president's personal attorneys, of the Democrats' impeachment case. Deputy White House counsel Pat Philbin said the abuse-of-power article was ""infinitely malleable"" and allowed for too much subjectivity. ""How are we supposed to get the proof of what's in the president's head?"" he asked.
White House counsel Pat Cipollone, in closing, reminded senators that the presidential election was nine months away and said the choice should be left to voters. ""Why tear up their ballots?"" he asked.
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), following the conclusion of the session, dismissed the Trump legal team's arguments. ""Their whole argument is diversion,"" he said.
""If you don't believe the newspaper report, call the witnesses,"" he said of the
Bolton account
, which was first reported Sunday evening in the New York Times. He reminded senators that the witnesses Democrats have wanted to call but that have been blocked by the White House—which include Mr. Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney—are Republicans appointed by the president.
Democrats, who control 47 seats, need four Republicans to join them to approve motions for new testimony or documents, which need a simple majority to pass. Starting Wednesday, the Senate will have two days to ask each side questions, followed by a vote later this week on new evidence.

In Tuesday's closing, the defense team was seeking to persuade senators not to support hearing testimony from further witnesses, among them Mr. Bolton. Mr. Bolton wrote in a draft of his forthcoming book that the president told him he wanted to keep aid to Ukraine frozen until Kyiv had aided investigations into Democrats, including former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Mr. Bolton's lawyer confirmed.
The president has denied Mr. Bolton's description of the conversation. He has repeatedly said there was no link between freezing the aid to Ukraine and his push for investigations.
In a marked shift from Monday, when the defense team made scant mention of Mr. Bolton's allegations, the president's lawyers on Tuesday argued that too little is known about the claims for them to factor into the Senate trial.
Mr. Sekulow called the allegations ""inadmissible"" and pointed to the president's denials, while accusing the former adviser of seeking to boost his book sales. Impeachment, he added, ""is not a game of leaks and unsourced manuscripts. That is politics, unfortunately.""
The House last fall had sought Mr. Bolton's testimony but moved forward with articles of impeachment when he declined to appear without a subpoena. The House declined to subpoena him in an effort to move quickly and not get bogged down in court fights.
The reports of Mr. Bolton's account unsettled Republican senators and bolstered the odds of a successful vote to hear further witness testimony. Several on-the-fence Republican senators said Mr. Bolton's claims strengthened the case for further witness testimony, while the number of senators the White House believes may vote for more testimony ticked up.
Lawmakers expressed interest in learning more about Mr. Bolton's claims. One proposal by Sen. James Lankford (R., Okla.) to make the Bolton manuscript available to the Senate in a classified setting for review drew the support of Sen. Lindsey Graham (R., S.C.), a top ally of the president's.
Mr. Schumer rejected the idea of reading the manuscript behind closed doors. ""What an absurd proposal,"" he said. ""It is a book. There is no need for it to be read in the SCIF unless you want to hide something,"" referring to a secure facility. The book is set to be published in March.
While no administration officials during the fall's House hearings testified that they were told directly by Mr. Trump that he was holding up the aid to pressure Kyiv,
four current and former officials
said they understood that to be the case.

Republicans have said this week that if the Senate votes for more testimony, they want to call witnesses including Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter.
Sens. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) and Susan Collins (R., Maine) indicated on Monday that they were likely to favor witnesses. Sens. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska) and Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.) remained open to the idea.
""I think that John Bolton probably has something to offer us,"" Ms. Murkowski said Tuesday.
The White House has grown concerned in recent days that two other senators might vote in favor of more testimony: Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio, people familiar with the discussions said. The defense team has been preparing for the possibility that the Senate will vote in favor of calling more witnesses and discussing how it would go to court to fight a subpoena for Mr. Bolton's testimony.
Mr. Bolton has said he would testify
during a Senate trial if subpoenaed.
Mr. Toomey suggested at a closed-door Senate lunch on Monday an arrangement in which the Senate subpoena Mr. Bolton as well as a witness sought by the White House, an approach Mr. Romney said he found fair.
""I think if you hear from one side, you probably ought to have a chance to hear from witnesses from the other side,"" said Mr. Romney.
Republicans senators said that during the coming days of questioning they planned to ask about the elder Mr. Biden as vice president
withholding loan guarantees from the Ukrainian government
when the nation was slow to fire a prosecutor general whom Western diplomats criticized for not cracking down on corruption.
They also planned to ask about Hunter Biden's role on the board of a Ukrainian gas company while his father was vice president. Mr. Trump and his allies have argued it was corrupt for Mr. Biden to call for the ouster of the Ukrainian prosecutor because he had once investigated the gas company, Burisma Holdings, that had ties to his son. The Bidens deny wrongdoing. Hunter Biden has said that serving on the company's board showed poor judgment given his father's anticorruption efforts.

Republicans also plan to use their questions to attack the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), over his office's dealings with the whistleblower whose account of the Ukraine pressure campaign spurred the impeachment inquiry.
Democratic senators said they would like to ask questions that could allow the Democratic House managers to rebut comments from the Trump defense team.
Following the period of questioning, the Senate will hold as much as four hours of debate on whether to subpoena witnesses or documents. If that hurdle is cleared, the Senate would then proceed to vote on whether to hear from Mr. Bolton, subpoena the notes he took during his tenure as national security adviser and gather other information or hear from other witnesses.

CLINTON, Iowa—Before President Trump, no American president had ever sought re-election in the middle of
an impeachment
.
Former Vice President Joe Biden is contending with a similar distinction in the Democratic primaries, as a White House candidate caught up in the impeachment of Mr. Trump, whose trial centers around his pressing Ukraine to investigate Mr. Biden, a possible opponent in this year's election.
Days before
the Iowa caucuses
, Mr. Biden is trying to turn Republican efforts to damage him in the impeachment trial into a badge of honor and a sign of his resilience. His campaign hopes it will help him appeal to Democratic voters struggling to answer the contest's biggest question: Which Democrat is best positioned to defeat Mr. Trump in November's general election?
""This whole impeachment trial for Trump is just a political hit job to smear me,"" Mr. Biden told an audience Tuesday night in Clinton, a community along the Mississippi River. ""That's how scared Trump is about having to run against me.""
In a sign of his push to show he's the most electable Democrat, Mr. Biden planned to deliver an address Thursday to supporters in Waukee, a suburb of Des Moines, that would directly take on the president and serve as a prebuttal to Mr. Trump's evening rally at Drake University.
When Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst suggested the Senate's trial in Washington could undercut Mr. Biden's appeal in Iowa, his campaign quickly seized upon her comments and posted a digital ad.
Mr. Trump's lawyers argued this week that the president was justified in seeking investigations into Mr. Biden and his son, Hunter Biden, who served on the board of the Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma while Mr. Biden was vice president. Mr. Biden has said he did nothing wrong in pressuring Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who had at one time been involved in investigating Burisma and who was widely viewed as
insufficiently aggressive on corruption
. Mr. Biden has also noted he was carrying out the Obama administration's Ukraine policy, which was in line with international partners on rooting out corruption.
A career State Department official told lawmakers last year that he
raised concerns in 2015
about Hunter Biden's position at Burisma, which he thought could appear to be a conflict of interest. According to one official with ties to the company, Hunter Biden's compensation was around $50,000 a month.
Hunter Biden has said
that he showed ""poor judgment"" in joining the board but that he only discussed his work with Burisma with his father once.
Mr. Biden rarely hears questions from voters about the impeachment trial. But the uncertainty over how long it will last has loomed over the final week in Iowa.
Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar have been forced to scrap most of their Iowa campaign schedules to attend the trial. (A fourth senator running for president, Michael Bennet of Colorado, has focused his long-shot bid on New Hampshire).
The
possibility of testimony
at the impeachment trial from witnesses, such as former national security adviser John Bolton, could mean the proceeding spills over into campaigning ahead of the Feb. 11 New Hampshire primary.
It also could increase the likelihood that Mr. Biden's son, or even Mr. Biden himself, might be called to testify. The former vice president has rejected suggestions of an exchange involving Mr. Bolton and others for his own testimony or that of his son.
He told reporters this week that he had ""nothing to defend. This is all a game.""
Republicans, meanwhile, haven't been subtle about trying to use the trial to undermine Mr. Biden's candidacy.
Ms. Ernst, who is seeking re-election this year, told reporters on Capitol Hill that she was ""really interested"" to see how the arguments made by Mr. Trump's legal team ""informs and influences the Iowa caucus voters.""
Mr. Biden pounced, reading aloud the senator's comments during his events in Iowa. The campaign placed a homemade sign on the wall that said, ""Joni—We're w/ Joe.""
""She spilled the beans,"" said Mr. Biden, who told his supporters, ""You can ruin Donald Trump's night by caucusing for me, but also you can ruin Joni Ernst's night.""
One of Ms. Ernst's Senate colleagues, meanwhile, bought airtime in Iowa to bolster
Mr. Trump's defense
. Sen. Rick Scott (R., Fla.) cut a 30-second ad accusing Mr. Biden of getting away with a pressure campaign against Ukraine and helping his son profit from his position, charges the Bidens and supporters have denied.

This Year's Iowa Caucuses Are Different. Here's How They'll Work.

""I just see that as part of the desperation of the Republicans in facing him, that they've got to try to drag him and his son into this,"" said Jeff Hermiston, a retired teacher from West Liberty, Iowa, who saw Mr. Biden at a recent event and plans to caucus for him. ""I realize it's peripheral to the issue, but it's not the issue.""
Mr. Biden has tried to turn the GOP criticism into a sign of his strength as a candidate and his ability to move past such drama. ""I hope I've demonstrated that I can take a punch,"" he said in Cedar Falls, Iowa.

WASHINGTON—President Trump said restrictions on economic activity could be lifted in some parts of the country but not others as his administration works to develop a plan for how Americans could return to work in a few weeks without exacerbating
the spread of the new coronavirus in the U.S.

""It's time. People want to get back to work,"" Mr. Trump said in a briefing Wednesday. He said that ""large sections"" of the country could return to work far sooner than others, but that New York has a 'number of very tough weeks ahead."" The president added that ""I'm not going to do anything rash or hastily.""
Mr. Trump in recent days has repeatedly signaled his interest in reviving the economy within the coming weeks,
saying Tuesday that he hoped to do so by Easter
, which falls on April 12—just under a month after the White House issued guidelines advising Americans to practice social distancing and avoid gathering in groups of 10 or more.
But the federal government's ability to force the reopening of the economy is limited, as much of that power rests with state governors and mayors.
Mr. Trump's timeline also is considerably shorter than what many health experts, including some in his own administration, have said will be necessary to blunt the spread of coronavirus across the U.S. and keep the nation's health care system from being overwhelmed.
The president claimed in a tweet Wednesday that the news media was pressuring him to keep much of the economy closed to hurt his re-election chances in November.
White House advisers and public health experts are developing proposals that could include workplace testing of employees and intensified contact tracing to curb the spread of the infection, according to people familiar with the planning. Their goal is to release a plan before Easter. Officials are also considering implementing more widespread and targeted testing in areas of the country where there are fewer cases.
But it isn't clear the U.S. currently has the testing capacity to implement such measures. State and local health labs would need more federal help to establish specific reporting sites that act as sentinels to know how fast or far the virus is spreading.
Even if Mr. Trump moves to relax the federal government's social distancing guidelines next month, his actions may have a limited effect.
While the Trump administration has issued guidelines urging Americans to stay home, the most severe restrictions nationwide have come from governors, who have ordered nonessential businesses to close in at least 24 states and have imposed restrictions on those businesses in a dozen more. Nineteen states plan to or already require residents to stay home. Federal guidelines don't trump state restrictions.
The result could be an even further decentralized patchwork of guidelines across the nation, which public-health experts say will make it harder to combat the virus's spread. The U.S., because of its decentralized structure of government and health care systems, has faced greater hurdles than some Asian countries in implementing rigorous measures to test and quarantine citizens.
""A patchwork approach is functionally a least-common-denominator approach, which is a huge problem,"" said Jeremy Konyndyk, who led the U.S. government's response to international disasters under the Obama administration. ""In the absence of uniform standards and robust surveillance, we are vulnerable to governors taking risks in their states that end up endangering other states as well.""
White House spokesman Judd Deere said the administration is ""evaluating critical data to determine next steps"" and that the president remains in close contact with governors. ""The goal is for America to be healthy, prosperous, and again open for business, and we remain committed to reaching that goal in partnership with state and local leaders,"" he said.
Mr. Trump has faced pressure from business leaders and some of his own advisers to reopen the economy soon, as uncertainty about the pandemic has sent the stock market reeling in recent weeks, and
business closures have caused millions to lose their jobs
. ""We can't have the cure be worse than the problem,"" Mr. Trump said this week.
Health experts in the administration have urged more caution. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said it will be at least several weeks before the country can reopen and on Tuesday described the Easter timeline as ""flexible.""
Governors in both parties rejected the Easter timeline the president offered and said they planned to chart their own course. Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose state has been by far the hardest hit by the virus, stressed that the federal government was offering suggestions, not decrees. ""They call them guidelines because they are guidelines,"" he said at a briefing Wednesday. ""We'll come up with a plan that works for New York.""
Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who last week ordered the state's 40 million residents to stay at home except for essential activities, said it would be ""misleading to represent"" that California would reopen by Easter.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, tweeted that he was looking forward to the day when the economy could reopen, but ""it's not yet here.""
Some states have also imposed penalties for violating state guidelines aimed at slowing the virus's spread. In Virginia, companies can lose operating licenses or face misdemeanor charges if they violate state guidelines. Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat, made it a misdemeanor to open or shop at certain retail businesses such as hair salons, gyms and fitness studios and theaters.
Public health experts say it could take months, if not years, before life returns to normal. They say the U.S. is woefully behind on the type of widespread testing and quarantine measures adopted in Singapore and South Korea that were successful at reducing spread of the virus. They also say that reopening too soon could overwhelm hospitals, endanger health-care workers and fuel the virus's spread in states where it isn't prevalent now.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Organization, warned in a briefing Wednesday that in the absence of necessary preparations, the virus could resurge once restrictions are eased. ""The last thing any country needs is to open schools and businesses, only to be forced to close them again because of a resurgence,"" he said.
Another question is the level of control the president can exert over the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines. Mr. Trump has stressed that he will listen to advice from his administration's health experts on when to reopen the economy, but that he will render the final decision on the timeline.
Ned Price, who was an adviser to former President Barack Obama, said that while Mr. Trump has authority over CDC guidelines, the agency has traditionally been granted a level of independence by previous presidents. That practice, however, is dictated ""not by laws but by norms,"" which Mr. Trump has made a habit of shattering, he said.
Americans around the country in recent days received a postcard from the federal government outlining the CDC's guidelines for social distancing. The front of the postcard reads: ""President Trump's coronavirus guidelines for America."" His first piece of advice: ""Listen and follow the directions of your STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES.""

National security adviser Robert O'Brien sought to use a series of television interviews broadcast Sunday to rebut reports that the Russian government is trying to help President Trump be re-elected.
""There's no briefing that I've received, that the president has received, that says that President Putin is doing anything to try and influence the elections in favor of President Trump,"" Mr. O'Brien said on the CBS News program ""Face the Nation."" ""I've seen no intelligence along those lines.""
But Mr. O'Brien appeared to choose his words carefully and didn't dispute news reports that Shelby Pierson, the top election security official for the director of national intelligence, had briefed the House Intelligence Committee last week that Russia appear to
have a preference for Mr. Trump
in the 2020 presidential race.
Mr. O'Brien didn't deny that Russia is using social media and other means to interfere in the U.S. election process with the aim of exacerbating the tensions in American society.
""The Russians have always tried to interfere with elections because they want to divide Americans,"" he said.
Concerns have mounted in recent weeks among Democratic lawmakers that Russia is trying to involve itself in U.S. presidential politics to boost Mr. Trump's prospects, much as the U.S. intelligence community and Special Counsel Robert Mueller
concluded Moscow did
in 2016.
Mr. Trump has denied that Russia played a role in getting him elected in 2016 and said there is no proof that he or his campaign attempted to collude with the Kremlin.
While playing down reports alleging Russian support for Mr. Trump, Mr. O'Brien confirmed accounts that
Russia is seeking to help Sen. Bernie Sanders
win the Democratic nomination
""What I've heard from the FBI…is that Russia would like Bernie Sanders to win the Democrat nomination,"" Mr. O'Brien said. ""They'd probably like him to be president, understandably, because he wants to spend money on social programs and probably would have to take it out of the military.""
Mr. O'Brien also appeared on ABC's ""This Week"" with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday.
Some political analysts say that Russia favors Mr. Sanders's nomination because Russian officials calculate that he would be the weakest opponent as Mr. Trump seeks re-election and because each man is a polarizing figure for many Americans.
Sen. Chris Murphy, a Connecticut Democrat, criticized Mr. O'Brien for his remarks about Mr. Sanders.
""Our national security adviser should stay out of politics,"" Mr. Murphy said on the CNN ""State of the Union"" news program. ""What I am worried about is the politicization of intelligence by this administration.""
Mr. Sanders has said that he was warned by U.S. officials that Russia is trying to assist his campaign and he has urged Russia to stay out of the election.

WASHINGTON—Secretary of State Mike Pompeo reiterated on Monday that he has no plans to run next year for U.S. Senate. Still, Republican strategists say they're increasingly convinced that he will eventually jump in.
""It's my intention to stay and continue to serve as President Trump's Secretary of State,"" Mr. Pompeo said Monday on Fox News, adding: ""I've said that consistently.""
Asked if he was ruling out a run, he responded: ""I've watched my life take turns that one would never have expected. But it's not something I want to do.""
Mr. Pompeo's multiple trips to Kansas in 2019 stirred rumors that he might be weighing a Senate bid to succeed Republican Sen. Pat Roberts,
who is retiring
. Mr. Pompeo continued to stoke speculation this month with the creation of personal Twitter and Instagram accounts. Among the first photos Mr. Pompeo posted on the new Twitter feed was a picture of him meeting with members of the Kansas Farm Bureau, a crucial constituent group for a prospective candidate.
The social media accounts appeared a few weeks after President Trump opened the door to a possible Senate run by Mr. Pompeo, saying in November that he was confident Mr. Pompeo would ""
easily win in Kansas
"" if he ran. The comments marked a shift for Mr. Trump, who had previously been chilly to the idea of Mr. Pompeo leaving the cabinet for the Senate.
""Every single possible signal is that he's running: trips to the state, Trump openly discussing his replacement, engaged operatives,"" said Jeff Roe, a GOP strategist who has run statewide, congressional and caucus races in Kansas.
""The only thing left is to hit send on the yard sign order,"" Mr. Roe said.
""Actions speak louder than words, and the Secretary's recent actions paint a clear picture that he is considering a run for Senate,"" said one national Republican operative. ""It's going to be on his terms and on his own timeline, but there is
a growing belief that it's merely a matter of time
before he announces.""
National security adviser Robert O'Brien told ABC's ""This Week"" on Sunday that he hoped Mr. Pompeo didn't leave. He said he'd spoken with Mr. Pompeo recently and that Mr. Pompeo had told him he's not running for Senate.
Mr. Pompeo has plenty of time to announce a run. The filing deadline in Kansas isn't until June, ahead of the GOP primary in August. And he has nearly $1 million sitting in his dormant federal campaign account that he could use for a Senate run, under federal election rules.
Mr. Pompeo grew up in California, but moved to Kansas in the 1990s. A former businessman and Army officer, he served three terms as a congressman representing Wichita, Kan., before President Trump appointed him to lead the Central Intelligence Agency and then the State Department.

TEL AVIV—President Trump said Thursday he likely would make public his administration's long-delayed plan for peace in the Middle East—under development since 2017—before a visit to Washington next week by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main political rival, Benny Gantz.
The two Israeli political leaders accepted a U.S. invitation to discuss the peace plan during a visit to Jerusalem by Vice President Mike Pence.
Mr. Trump said he also has spoken briefly to the Palestinians, and said U.S. officials would speak further to them. Mr. Trump has taken a series of steps during his administration considered favorable to the Israelis, including recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's capital, slashing bilateral assistance to the Palestinians and backing Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank.
""I'm sure they [Palestinians] maybe will react negatively at first but it's actually very positive for them,"" Mr. Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Florida on Thursday.
Mr. Trump and others on his team have committed to time frames to release the plan before, only later to back away from them. Palestinian officials had cut off all contact with the Trump administration in late 2017, when Mr. Trump said he would move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.
The White House is considering making its peace plan public before Israel's March vote to try to get ahead of the U.S. election season and as political support in Israel grows for the release of the political blueprint.
The White House wouldn't say whether it invited Palestinian officials, but they are not expected to attend.
""This step only reaffirms our absolute rejection of what the U.S. administration has done so far,"" said Husam Zomlot, who was the Palestinians' ambassador to Washington before the U.S. closed the Palestinian mission in 2018. He is now the ambassador to the U.K.
In Jerusalem, Mr. Pence said Mr. Netanyahu and Mr. Gantz accepted President Trump's invitation.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Should the White House release its peace plan before Israeli elections? Join the conversation below.
""We very much look forward to [welcoming] you to our nation's capital to continue discussions about a broad range of issues of mutual concerns between the United States and Israel but also about the prospect of peace,"" Mr. Pence said.
Mr. Netanyahu said he suggested including Mr. Gantz ""because I think it's important we do not lose this historic opportunity with such friends in the White House.""
The White House formally announced the visit shortly after Mr. Pence's comments. The visit, on Jan. 28, is the same day Israel's parliament will begin the process of forming a panel that will debate Mr. Netanyahu's
request for immunity
from charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.
The charges stem from allegations
that he traded official favors for flattering news coverage, as well as gifts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars, including pink champagne, cigars and jewelry.
If the panel is formed before the March vote, as is expected, Mr. Netanyahu likely will see his immunity request denied, though his Likud party is trying to delay the process.
Mr. Trump's Mideast peace team, headed by his son-in-law Jared Kushner, is concerned that the window before Israel's ballot could be the last opportunity to release the blueprint before the U.S. election season, according to people familiar with the matter. The coming vote in Israel might again be inconclusive, followed by months more of political wrangling to set up an Israeli government.
Mr. Netanyahu failed after April and September elections
to form a governing coalition
, and Israel faces an unprecedented third vote in less than a year as the political deadlock continues. He remains the head of a caretaker government during the impasse.
Mr. Netanyahu has welcomed the U.S. plan, describing it as an opportunity for Israel to
annex parts of the West Bank
under a supportive administration in Washington.
Mr. Gantz also has warmed to having the plan released before the election. He initially harbored concerns that it could work to Mr. Netanyahu's advantage.
Mr. Kushner had intended to travel to Israel to meet with Messrs. Netanyahu and Gantz on the sidelines of a Holocaust forum in Jerusalem after conversations with Arab officials at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, but he canceled the trip at the last minute, citing bad weather.
Mr. Trump tapped Mr. Kushner to work on the Mideast peace plan in 2016, before taking office, and the administration has repeatedly delayed its release. Administration officials
presented a Mideast economic plan
in Bahrain in June, but it was seen as impossible to implement without a political component and none of the promised follow-up summits to sign off on the document have been held.
The administration also has been counting on support for its plan from Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, but the crown prince's
international stature was weakened
following the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at a Saudi consulate in Turkey.
Mr. Netanyahu has tried to position himself as the best person to negotiate a deal, and the plan's release could give his candidacy a boost, analysts said. But it could also make it harder for him to win the support of political parties to his right, whose support he will need in a coalition.
Meanwhile, the release could also spark protests or heighten tensions between the U.S. and regional Arab allies if it is interpreted as too favorable to Israel.
Mr. Zomlat, the Palestinian official, said the Palestinians would reject any deal that doesn't include East Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state and an end to Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.
Mr. Netanyahu has pledged to unilaterally
annex the Jordan Valley
if he is re-elected and called for the parliament to vote on the matter as early as next week. Mr. Gantz said on Tuesday that he would look to do the same by seeking consensus in Israel and with the help of the international community. American officials said they oppose any unilateral actions before the plan is released.
Israel's struggles to elect a government have added to the challenge facing any peace initiative, leaving unclear when an elected Israeli leader will emerge to take up any negotiations that spring from the plan.
Jason Greenblatt, Mr. Trump's original Middle East peace envoy,
left his job
late last year as the plan's release kept sliding amid Israel's political deadlock.
More than six months after releasing its
economic plan for the area
, U.S. officials have maintained a close hold on the political portion of the document. More than 50 pages long, it envisions that no Israelis or Palestinians in the West Bank will leave their homes and it would move Israel's border east of the internationally accepted Green Line with the West Bank, U.S. officials have said.
That, veteran peace negotiators say, indicates that the Trump plan is likely a sharp departure from past efforts that left many of the sensitive details—such as the final status of Jerusalem and security arrangements—for later talks and envisioned land swaps to resolve one of the key issues of the conflict: precise borders and what will be done with Israeli settlements.
While the Trump administration hopes the document can be a basis for serious negotiations, experts said meaningful talks will remain a challenge, even if the plan defies expectations and garners some Arab support. The unsettled Israeli political situation is exacerbated by the continuing split among Palestinians, between Hamas in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank.
""You lack leaders who are masters of their political houses on either side, and who are willing to take the risk of venturing out,"" said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and former negotiator and State Department analyst.
Dov Lieber in Tel Aviv and Alex Leary in Washington contributed to this article.

MILWAUKEE—As six Democratic candidates faced off in Iowa on Tuesday evening, President Trump, less than 400 miles away, sought to insert himself into the process at a rally for his reelection campaign.
Former Vice President Joe Biden? ""Sleepy."" Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren? ""Not going anywhere.""
But Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders? ""Surging.""
Trump campaign aides and political allies view Mr. Sanders, a self-declared socialist, as an easier opponent than other potential contenders. Mr. Trump has tweeted about Mr. Sanders twice this week, saying on Sunday that he was ""looking very good"" and stoking the
clash between the two leading liberals
in the race. ""Elizabeth is very angry at Bernie. Do I see a feud brewing?"" he
tweeted
Monday.
Mr. Sanders has
ticked up in recent national polls
, but is separated from Messrs. Biden and Warren by a few percentage points. Unlike Mr. Biden, Mr. Sanders has never polled above 30% among Democrats nationally in this election cycle.
The president also sided with Mr. Sanders in a growing clash between him and Ms. Warren over whether the Vermont senator told Ms. Warren in a 2018 meeting that he didn't believe a woman could win the election. Mr. Warren confirmed that characterization after it was reported by CNN; Mr. Sanders has denied it.
""I don't believe that he said this,"" Mr. Trump told a packed arena in Milwaukee. ""I don't particularly like him, the nasty guy, but…[it's] not the kind of thing he'd say.""
Mr. Trump had low expectations for the Democrats' face-off. ""Nobody is watching,"" he said. ""They haven't been doing great on the debates, I have to tell you.""
Mr. Trump also sought to create a split screen between his actions as president and Democrats' efforts to oust him from office, a strategy that campaign aides have said they intend to pursue over the course of the election year.
""While we're creating jobs and killing terrorists, Democrats in Congress are wasting America's time with demented, hoaxes and crazy witch hunts,"" the president said.
The House is set to vote Wednesday to name impeachment managers and send the articles of impeachment to the Senate. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said he expects to
start the president's impeachment trial next Tuesday
, when Mr. Trump is scheduled to be in Davos, Switzerland, for the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum.
Tuesday's rally marked the president's second of the election year and his first time in Wisconsin since July, when he traveled to Milwaukee to give a speech on trade.
Wisconsin, a state Mr. Trump won in 2016 by fewer than 23,000 votes, is a key battleground in the 2020 race. Top Democrats had already collectively t
raveled to the state 10 times
by September, and Wisconsin is one of four states where a top Democratic group, Priorities USA, plans to spend $150 million before the convention this summer in Milwaukee.
The Trump campaign has also signaled it plans to make Wisconsin a priority. Lara Trump, a senior adviser to the campaign and the president's daughter-in-law, traveled there for an event Monday. Jared Kushner, a senior White House adviser and the president's son-in-law, was also in Milwaukee on Tuesday for a criminal justice event.

NASHUA, N.H.—Democrats in search of a centrist nominee to challenge President Trump are increasingly worried after contests in
Iowa
and
New Hampshire
consolidated liberal support behind Bernie Sanders and divided the larger moderate vote among multiple candidates.
The party's center lane is crowded with the rising former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and former Vice President Joe Biden. Looming in the
March 3 Super Tuesday states
and beyond is former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg, buoyed by
campaign spending that dwarfs all his opponents combined
.
With no clear centrist front-runner, vulnerable freshman Democrats in Congress are texting each other anxiously, a Biden-allied fundraiser warns of a ""doomsday scenario"" and party strategists fret about what mixed early-state turnout means for November.
Predictions about which candidates are the most electable and which will prevail through a long primary season have proven unreliable in the past, particularly at this early stage of the process, before voting in the diverse states of South Carolina and Nevada. Barack Obama faced intraparty doubts in 2008, as did Mr. Trump in 2016.
With multiple contenders vowing to stay in the race, party leaders are yet again bracing for the likelihood of a protracted fight for the nomination that may not be settled by the time of the July convention in Milwaukee.
Adding to some Democrats' worries is the president's
acquittal from impeachment
and his strength among his most fervent supporters, as evidenced by the more than 11,000 who turned out for his
Monday night rally in Manchester, N.H.
, a larger crowd than any assembled by a Democrat campaigning in the state.
""There is one thing that's universal, and that is anxiety,"" said Rufus Gifford, who served as finance director for President Obama's re-election campaign and has contributed to several campaigns.

The fear among some Democrats is predicated on the idea that Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator and self-described democratic socialist, would struggle to defeat Mr. Trump in November. Mr. Sanders and his supporters believe the party could unite around him if he is the nominee and that he could energize young voters and those in crucial Rust Belt states who swung to the GOP in 2016.
The Sanders campaign disputed the notion he would hurt Democrats in swing districts, noting that candidates in states that will be crucial in 2020 had requested his help during 2018 midterms.
Mr. Sanders and Mr. Buttigieg, a 38-year-old newcomer to the national scene, essentially tied in Iowa and finished one-two in New Hampshire. Ms. Warren has faded in the first two contests but is pressing forward, while Ms. Klobuchar, the No. 3 finisher in New Hampshire, is eyeing delegates when her home state of Minnesota votes on March 3.
If Mr. Biden has a strong showing in South Carolina and Nevada, he could regain lost momentum and potentially persuade wavering Democrats to stick with him through subsequent states.
Mr. Bloomberg meanwhile has poured more than $350 million of his fortune into a series of March states, including California, Texas and North Carolina.
Philip Levine, a former mayor of Miami Beach, Fla., who supports Mr. Bloomberg, said in an interview he received ""an avalanche"" of phone calls and emails Wednesday from donors asking how they could help, and from elected officials, whom he didn't name, asking his advice on ""how to tactfully retract"" their endorsements of Mr. Biden and shift their support to Mr. Bloomberg.
Some Democratic donors say privately there will be a lot of pressure for Mr. Biden to get out after South Carolina if he performs poorly there.
""We are going to compete in Super Tuesday states,"" said Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, a Biden campaign co-chairman. ""Bloomberg is spending an awful lot of money, but he's also not had his turn in the barrel. He has not been on the debate stage. He's untested.""
Larry Rasky, who leads a pro-Biden super PAC called Unite the Country, sought to rally Biden donors in a fundraising memo Sunday by telling them that if they hedge their bets on Mr. Biden because of Mr. Bloomberg, they could be creating a ""doomsday scenario.""
""The Sanders-Warren wing of the Party is ready for the Bloomberg fight. Democrats cannot afford a split Convention. Do you really think the Sanders voters wing will support Mike Bloomberg? Do you think all the camps who have busted their butts and played by the rules will happily sign on"" to Mr. Bloomberg's campaign, he wrote.
The party's attempt to present itself as a steady, competent alternative to Mr. Trump has been
marred by the chaotic Iowa caucuses
, where more than a week later Mr. Sanders narrowly trails Mr. Buttigieg in state delegates, but Mr. Sanders leads in the popular vote. Both candidates have requested a recanvassing of certain precincts.
Party strategists are watching early-state turnout closely for clues about whether Democrats are energized to vote.

More than 176,000 people participated in the Iowa Democratic caucuses this year, a slight increase from four years ago but well behind the nearly 240,000 who caucused in 2008. New Hampshire was a brighter spot for Democrats: Turnout reached about 297,000 voters in the Democratic primary, compared with about 255,000 in 2016 and nearly 290,000 in 2008.
""Everything is splintered,"" said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist and former adviser to West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin. ""And it just shows that voters aren't falling in love with any of these candidates, and that's a problem.""
Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has conducted focus groups in early-voting states and general-election battlegrounds, said she has been struck by ""the duality of who you like and who you think can beat Trump. And they're not necessarily the same thing.""

In a sign of Democrats' interest in finding an alternative to Mr. Biden, some moderate House Democrats have embraced Mr. Bloomberg, including Reps. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey, Haley Stevens of Michigan and Scott Peters of California. On Wednesday, two African-American members of Congress, Reps. Lucy McBath (D., Ga.) and Gregory Meeks (D., N.Y.) said they were backing Mr. Bloomberg. All are members of the centrist New Democrat Coalition.
Rep. Stephanie Murphy, the chairwoman of the centrist Blue Dog Coalition caucus, said Mr. Sanders wouldn't be able to win over swing voters, and if he becomes the party's nominee, he could put the new House majority at risk. ""For many moderate districts and Trump-won districts, Bernie Sanders at the top of the ticket would create headwinds for house members running for re-election,"" she said.

Former Goldman Sachs Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, who supported Hillary Clinton in 2016, said in a tweet Tuesday that ""Sanders is just as polarizing as Trump AND he'll ruin our economy."" Mr. Sanders's campaign manager tweeted back: ""This is what panic from the Wall Street elite looks and sounds like.""
For most of the campaign, Mr. Biden has presented himself as the candidate best able to win states narrowly carried by Mr. Trump, including his boyhood state of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.
""He did not have a shot to win Iowa or do well in Iowa,"" said Rep. Tim Ryan (D., Ohio), who endorsed Mr. Biden after his own candidacy failed. ""His two strongest groups are communities of color and older voters, and both are pretty much excluded from the caucus process.""
Mr. Biden and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, joined a conference call with the campaign's top financial donors on Wednesday afternoon, according to three participants, and noted the campaign's strength in Nevada and South Carolina among Latinos and African-Americans.
Polls indicate that Mr. Buttigieg and Ms. Klobuchar both have struggled to appeal to African-American voters. Mr. Bloomberg apologized for a second time Tuesday amid a fresh round of criticism for his support of stop-and-frisk policing in New York City.
Mr. Sanders has argued that Democrats must nominate someone who can generate enthusiasm and mobilize young people and infrequent voters who were turned off by their choices in the 2016 election. The senator has arguably the best ability to command large crowds, evidenced by more than 7,500 people who showed up for a primary eve rally and concert at the University of New Hampshire.
In the last week, Mr. Sanders has taken the lead in the RealClearPolitics average of national Democratic primary polls, after Mr. Biden had led for months.
While Mr. Biden's candidacy has foundered, Mr. Bloomberg has courted members of Congress. In January, Mr. Bloomberg flew to Salt Lake City where Rep. Ben McAdams (D., Utah) hosted the former mayor at his home with local Democrats and Republicans. Mr. Bloomberg talked about his hope for a pragmatic government and answered questions on climate change and fiscal responsibility.
Mr. McAdams said he was looking for someone he could support, but also said he was looking for someone who understood a congressional district like his own, which the president carried by 7 percentage points in 2016.
About a week later, he endorsed Mr. Bloomberg.

WASHINGTON—The Trump administration said it is making an additional 35,000 seasonal guest-worker visas available this year ahead of the busy summer season, the largest increase since President Trump took office.
The additional visas announced Thursday by the Department of Homeland Security will bring the total available this year to 101,000, though the additional visas will primarily be made available to returning workers.
The seasonal-worker visa program, known as H-2B, enables U.S. employers to hire as many as 66,000 foreign workers a year, with the allotments split evenly between the winter and summer seasons. Congress permits the Department of Homeland Security each year to raise that cap by as many as 64,000 additional visas. This year's cap is slightly higher than the 30,000 workers the administration allowed last year.
DHS is adding new restrictions on the additional visas, which some administration officials and outside critics of the move said could limit how many of the visas will actually be used.
The visas will become available to employers in two tranches: 20,000 immediately and an additional 15,000 for employees beginning work on or after May 15.
Of the 35,000 total, 10,000 will be set aside for workers from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, the only countries that will be allowed to send new applicants. Those three Central American countries, collectively known as the Northern Triangle, accounted for the majority of asylum seekers crossing the border illegally last year. DHS officials said that providing these people a pathway to work lawfully in the U.S. will reduce the incentive to migrate illegally.
""The department is taking significant steps to promote integrity in the program, combat fraud and abuse, and ensure the supplemental allocation aligns with the national interest,"" a DHS spokeswoman said.
The additional visas are being made available ahead of the summer, when demand for short-term work is typically highest. Still, demand has routinely outstripped the available cap. Landscapers, fisheries, county fairs and holiday resorts—including Mr. Trump's own golf and beach clubs—all use the H-2B program to fill lower-skilled jobs.
The departments of Homeland Security and Labor had for weeks pushed for the cap to be raised by 45,000 additional visas this year, more in line with industry demands.
That higher number of visas had been approved by the White House. But the administration began facing backlash from groups advocating more immigration restrictions after
The Wall Street Journal reported
on the administration's plan. Stephen Miller, President Trump's top immigration adviser, argued internally that proceeding with the higher number risked displeasing the president's base, which views immigration skeptically, as the election season ramps up, people familiar with the discussions said.
The White House didn't respond to a request for comment.
""It's less than the lobbyists [seeking additional guest-worker visas] were pushing for, but there's still no excuse for the administration raising it at all,"" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group arguing for lower levels of immigration. ""There's no limit to the number of cheap foreign workers that employers in landscaping and hotels and restaurants could hire. This is preferable because it's easier and cheaper.""
Thursday's decision comes amid a
broader debate
inside the Trump administration over legal immigration, with some officials arguing American workers will see wages rise only if foreign workers are prevented from competing with them for jobs and undercutting them, while others believe more immigrants are needed to sustain the economic growth that Mr. Trump will put at the center of his re-election campaign.
Guest workers, like few other issues in immigration, muddle partisan lines, where Republicans who support pro-business initiatives and Democrats who advocate for immigrant rights find themselves at odds with labor unions and immigration hard-liners.
At a Senate hearing last week, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, and James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, pushed acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf to raise the H-2B visa cap by the maximum allowed under the law.
""Without immediate and meaningful H-2B cap relief, seasonal businesses will be forced to scale back operations, cancel or default on contracts, lay off full-time U.S. workers and, in some cases, close operations completely,"" a bipartisan group of 189 lawmakers wrote in a
January letter
to Mr. Wolf.
Judith Ogden, who owns a landscaping business on Long Island, said she redoubled her efforts to find American workers during her busy summer season in 2017, when Congress scaled back the annual allowance of guest workers, taking out advertisements and offering slightly more pay. But she said she couldn't find many takers, and the smaller workforce hurt her business.
""In reality Americans suffer,"" she said. ""When I can't get my workers, I have to lay off Americans that I employ and I can't purchase from local vendors.""
Top White House officials including Mr. Miller have successfully pushed through numerous policy changes that would shrink most forms of legal immigration. The most significant of those policies, the public-charge rule, which will essentially impose an income test on future green-card applicants, took effect last week.
Jared Kushner, the president's adviser and son-in-law, has been encouraged by success with the bipartisan criminal-justice overhaul passed last year and has been circulating a draft of an immigration plan to Republican lawmakers. He has also pushed the idea of coupling the bill, which focuses on border security, with a bill providing a path to legalization for the so-called Dreamers, young immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally as children.
On Thursday, Mr. Trump and Mr. Kushner led a meeting at the White House with several Republican senators, including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and David Perdue of Georgia, to discuss the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which is under review by the Supreme Court.
Republican Senate aides said that senators and members of the administration remain torn over whether they should restart DACA negotiations ahead of a potential high court decision striking down the program, with Mr. Graham arguing in favor of a fix ahead of November's election and Mr. Cotton arguing forcefully against touching the issue.

COLUMBUS, Ohio—As President Trump
backs away from conflict with Iran
, some of his most loyal supporters say they never worried about the clash getting out of hand.
In the battleground state of Ohio, Trump backers attending a Wednesday campaign event with the president's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, said they supported Mr. Trump's move to
take out an Iranian military leader
and that they didn't believe he was ever going to send ground troops into the country, based on his opposition to what he calls ""endless wars.""
""I come from a solid military family, so I know what it is to lose somebody,"" said Sherry Laughman, 57 years old, of Galena. ""He has from the beginning said he was not in it to start a war.""
Martha Verblaauw, also 57 and from Worthington, echoed that sentiment, saying: ""I knew it wasn't going to happen. He literally follows through on things he's said from way back when.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you think President Trump's decision to strike against Iran will affect the presidential race? Join the conversation below.
As Mr. Trump heads to Ohio on Thursday for his first major campaign rally since his confrontation with Iran intensified, his campaign is seizing the moment to portray him as a strong commander, touting the killing of an Iranian military leader and targeting what they see as mixed messages from Democrats. But the approach comes with risks, among them that should the conflict escalate, the president may turn off antiwar supporters.
The threat of conflict with Iran intensified last week with the U.S. strike against
Maj. Gen. Qassem Soleimani
. The president sought to take down the temperature Wednesday, signaling no more military strikes after an
Iranian missile barrage on U.S. bases
, which was seen as a tempered response to the killing.
The president's re-election campaign has kept up its tough rhetoric.
Soon after the U.S. took out Gen. Soleimani, the Trump campaign sent out an email titled ""ANOTHER dead terrorist,"" building on their tough talk after the
raid that killed an ISIS leader last year
. After the president's relatively measured address Wednesday, the campaign blasted a text to supporters, directing them to a survey that asked if they would prefer Mr. Trump in office or a ""terrorist-apologist Democrat.""
For their part, Democrats are casting Mr. Trump's effort as another example of a reckless policy. Speaking at a fundraiser Tuesday, former Vice President Joe Biden said: ""We are alone now—we're alone and we will have to bear the cost of Donald Trump's folly.""
Antiwar activists and lawmakers hosted a call Wednesday night with two Democratic presidential candidates where they discussed demonstrations set for Thursday in opposition to military action in the Middle East. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bernie Sanders of Vermont spoke briefly and urged listeners to be active in their resistance.
""This is the moment that Americans need to speak up and say we do not want another war in the Middle East, we do not want war with Iran,"" Ms. Warren said.
Mr. Trump's campaign has sought to highlight inconsistencies in Mr. Biden's foreign policy record, as well as slam Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren for their rhetoric about the strike against Gen. Soleimani.
""Now they are trying to defend killing a terrorist,"" Ms. Trump said Wednesday in Columbus. ""What is going on with the Democrats?""
From the Oval Office Tuesday, Mr. Trump said: ""I don't hear too many people other than politicians who are trying to win the presidency, those are the ones that are complaining, but I don't hear anybody else complaining.""
Some Democratic voters in Ohio expressed frustration over Mr. Trump's tactics with Iran, although these voters said they had largely already made up their minds not to support him in 2020.
""It puts his foreign policy ineptitude on display,"" said Andy Steele, 46, of Columbus, who works for a technology company and plans to vote Democratic. Tom Hohenberger, a 64-year-old retired nurse from Columbus who also plans to vote Democratic, said, ""I think he didn't get the right kind of briefing.""
Rose Mary Blair, a 57-year-old project manager who attended an event in Akron for 2020 hopeful Michael Bloomberg Wednesday, said she thinks Mr. Trump's recent moves against Iran ""put a lot of young people and our country at risk.""
Mr. Trump's entanglement with Iran offers the latest example of a foreign policy that has long swung between aggressive and isolationist impulses. As a candidate, he pledged to stop ""endless wars,"" but also promised to build up the U.S. military. In office he has sought to withdraw troops from the Middle East while also promising to unleash ""fire and fury"" in the face of a nuclear threat.
Those close to the president said his views have always been complicated. Said one Trump ally: ""Trump was never, never a noninterventionist in the way that Ron Paul was a noninterventionist.""
Some Trump backers said they would be comfortable even if he did send troops into Iran, saying they trusted his judgment.
""If they want, I'll come out of retirement and I'll go over there"" and help, said Curtis Stroede, 66, of Chillicothe, who is a veteran. ""He's showing strength, he's pushing back on bullies, he's showing them he's willing and able.""

WASHINGTON—Nearly a month passed between the House vote to impeach President Trump and its
transmission of the articles of impeachment
to the Senate.
In that time, Democrats say,
new information has raised the need for additional documents
to be subpoenaed and witnesses called, which senators will vote on after the trial begins. Mr. Trump's legal team argues
the articles of impeachment are frivolous and dangerous
and should be swiftly rejected by the Senate.
Here's what has happened since the House vote:
Giuliani associate makes a splash
Lev Parnas, who assisted Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani in his push for the Ukrainian investigations, in recent weeks
turned over documents to the House Intelligence Committee
that reveal new details about the extent of their efforts.
In prime-time interviews last week, Mr. Parnas, who has been
indicted on campaign-finance charges
in a separate matter, said Mr. Trump knew what he was doing and ""was aware of all of my movements.""
The text messages Mr. Parnas provided to the House don't corroborate his assertion that the president was aware of his activities, but do outline the
close relationship he established with Mr. Giuliani
and other high-level associates of Mr. Trump.
Documents released by the House on Tuesday included a letter in which Mr. Giuliani said he was seeking a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky
with Mr. Trump's ""knowledge and consent.""
Mr. Zelensky didn't end up taking the meeting, fearful of getting sucked into a U.S. political drama.
Congress's watchdog finds hold on Ukraine funds broke the law
Congress's nonpartisan watchdog agency, the Government Accountability Office, released a report finding that the Trump administration
lacked the legal authority to put the Ukraine security assistance on hold.

Lev Parnas Paid His Way Into Trump's Orbit

GAO wrote that the White House Office of Management and Budget improperly froze the money for policy reasons, in violation of federal law requiring the president to spend funds appropriated by Congress except under limited circumstances.
A spokeswoman for OMB said the office disagreed with GAO's opinion and said it had authority ""to ensure taxpayer dollars are properly spent consistent with the President's priorities and with the law.""
Connecticut Republican's texts suggest he had ambassador under surveillance
Among the disclosures in the trove of documents released by Mr. Parnas through the House: Information that prompted Ukraine's Interior Ministry to
launch its own probe
of ""whether there were any violations of Ukrainian and international laws…or [if it was] just bravado and fake talk in an informal conversation between two U.S. citizens.""
In the documents, a long-shot Connecticut Republican House candidate who runs a landscaping business suggested in text messages to Mr. Parnas that he had then-U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch under surveillance. The candidate, Robert Hyde, has said his texts to Mr. Parnas were a joke and that he didn't monitor the ambassador's movements. Mr. Parnas has said he didn't believe Mr. Hyde was surveilling Ms. Yovanovitch.
Still, Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel visited Mr. Hyde's Connecticut home and business last week, according to a person familiar with the matter.
OMB directed officials to 'hold off' releasing Ukraine funds after Trump-Zelensky call
In December, the Defense Department released a batch of emails, including one sent July 25 by a senior official at the White House Office of Management and Budget asking Pentagon officials to hold off releasing funds for Ukraine pending the administration's review.
The official, OMB Associate Director for National-Security Programs Michael Duffey, sent the email less than two hours after Mr. Trump pressed his Ukrainian counterpart to undertake the investigations into Mr. Biden and alleged election interference—two investigations that could benefit him politically.
Mr. Trump had ordered nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine frozen weeks before the phone call, The Wall Street Journal has reported. The assistance was ultimately released.
'I am speechless'
New emails showed a senior Pentagon official
clashing with the White House
last summer over the decision to freeze security aid to Ukraine. The official warned that the hold could complicate the administration's ability to distribute the money before the congressionally mandated deadline.
In emails to officials at the White House Office of Management and Budget, Elaine McCusker, the acting Pentagon comptroller, raised concerns about the legality of the hold.
Her frustrations escalated in early September. After she warned OMB that the U.S. might not be able to spend $120 million by the end of the fiscal year because of the hold, Mr. Duffey responded with a letter blaming the Defense Department for not doing enough to prepare to spend the funds if they were released.
""You can't be serious,"" Ms. McCusker replied. ""I am speechless.""
Bolton willing to testify—if subpoenaed
On Jan. 6, former national-security adviser John Bolton said he
would testify in a Senate trial if subpoenaed
by lawmakers—which remains unlikely.
Current and former National Security Council officials have testified that Mr. Bolton was alarmed by the push for investigations in Ukraine and urged aides to report their concerns to a White House lawyer.
Mr. Bolton's lawyer has suggested his client's testimony would be tantalizing.
In a letter to the House lawyer in November
, he said Mr. Bolton knew about ""many relevant meetings and conversations"" that had not yet been made public.

WASHINGTON—House Democrats fought to win over enough Republican senators to subpoena witnesses and documents in President Trump's impeachment trial, seeking to drive home charges of abuse of office and obstruction of Congress in their third and final day of opening arguments.
Mr. Trump ""invited foreign interference in our elections and sold out our country's security for his personal benefit, and betrayed the nation's trust to a foreign power,"" said House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.).
Friday marked the last chance for the Democratic impeachment managers—House lawmakers acting as prosecutors—to make their pitch to GOP senators who may be wavering on whether to subpoena witnesses and documents that were withheld from House impeachment investigators by the White House.
It would take a simple majority of 51 senators to vote for the additional evidence, meaning that at least four Republicans would have to join all 47 senators in the Democratic caucus to pass such a motion. If Democrats can't muster those four GOP votes, the trial could end as soon as next week.
Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Mitt Romney of Utah and Lamar Alexander of Tennessee are among those who have said they would be open to witnesses. They have been tight-lipped in recent days about how the Democrats' opening arguments might have affected their thinking.
Mr. Romney reiterated Friday that he would like to hear testimony from former national security adviser John Bolton, and he said he would make a decision about other officials later in the trial. Mr. Bolton, who was described by witnesses as alarmed at the pressure put on Ukraine,
said earlier this month that he would testify
in a Senate trial if subpoenaed by lawmakers.
Mr. Alexander told reporters Friday that he will make his decision after the questioning portion of the trial, expected next week. ""I think that question can only be answered then,"" he said.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you think Democrats will be able to sway enough Republican senators to break ranks and agree to subpoena witnesses and documents? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
The House impeached Mr. Trump last month over allegations that the president
withheld nearly $400 million in military aid
to Ukraine as part of an effort to pressure Kyiv to open investigations into Vice President Joe Biden, a Democratic political rival, and then obstructed House investigators probing the matter.
Mr. Trump says he did nothing wrong and has called the impeachment a hoax driven by politics. He derided the Democrats' presentation in a tweet Friday, saying ""the Do Nothing Democrats just keep repeating and repeating, over and over again, the same old 'stuff' on the Impeachment Hoax.""
White House officials have said they don't expect any Republicans to vote in favor of hearing from more witnesses, but Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) is privately far less certain, people familiar with the talks said.
The White House has largely delegated the task of rallying senators to vote against witness testimony to Mr. McConnell and a handful of other senators, though some White House officials including the president have been in contact with lawmakers as the trial has unfolded.
During the trial, Mr. McConnell is using daily closed-door lunches as a venue for GOP senators to have frank exchanges and relay feedback to party leadership.
Among the arguments some Republicans are making at lunch and in private conversations is that voting in favor of witness testimony would further prolong the trial with an extended court battle over executive privilege, people familiar with the talks said. Republicans also contend that witness testimony won't change the case and that the trial should end by the Feb. 4 State of the Union address.
Mr. McConnell has made that case publicly, saying in remarks on the Senate floor on Tuesday that pursuing new witnesses could indefinitely delay the Senate trial and draw the body into a protracted and complex legal fight. ""Such litigation could potentially have permanent repercussions for the separation of powers and the institution of the presidency that senators would need to consider very carefully,"" he said.
Mr. Schiff told reporters on Friday that it is ""nonsense"" that subpoenaing new witnesses or documents could make the trial last too long. ""This is not a trial over a speeding ticket or shopping ticket, this is an impeachment trial involving the president of the United States,"" Mr. Schiff told reporters on Friday. ""These witnesses have important first-hand testimony to offer, the House wishes to call them in the name of the American people and the American people overwhelmingly want to hear what they have to say.""
Sixty-six percent of Americans say the Senate should call witnesses to testify in Mr. Trump's impeachment trial, including 45% of Republicans, 65% of independents and 87% of Democrats, according to an
ABC News/Washington Post poll
released on Friday.
Rep. Jason Crow (D., Colo.) led off the Democratic arguments Friday, wrapping up managers' presentation of the
first article of impeachment
. That charge alleges Mr. Trump abused his power by withholding Ukraine aid as leverage for the country to open investigations into Mr. Biden.
Mr. Crow ran through the chronology surrounding the aid freeze, which was later released amid media reports and a bipartisan outcry in Congress. The hold on the aid ""wasn't lifted for any legitimate reason,"" Mr. Crow said. ""It was only lifted because President Trump had gotten caught.""
Managers were spending the bulk of Friday, however, on the second article of impeachment, which accuses Mr. Trump of trying to thwart
the House inquiry
by directing witnesses not to testify and refusing to allow the release of documents, and ordering executive branch agencies to do the same.
House committees issued document requests or subpoenas last year to the White House, the Office of the Vice President, Office of Management and Budget, the State Department, Department of Defense, and the Energy Department.
Democrats have stressed that the Trump administration refused to produce any documents in response to those subpoenas, even though witness testimony during the House inquiry revealed that relevant records exist.
They also were likely to highlight the White House's decision to block witnesses who have firsthand knowledge of Mr. Trump's decision to withhold assistance to Ukraine, including acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Mr. Bolton.

Analysis: Trump Impeachment Trial

Trump attorney Jay Sekulow rejected Democrats' push for more documents on Thursday, saying the president was within his rights to withhold them.
""The Constitution protects executive privilege, there's a reason for that,"" he said, citing the principle presidents use to protect communications with close aides and advisers from public scrutiny. The argument is that confidentiality is needed to protect national security and to enable the president to receive frank advice.
Executive privilege isn't explicitly mentioned in the Constitution but is understood to be implied by its separation of powers.
Democrats say executive privilege shouldn't be used to shield a president engaged in alleged misconduct.
In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled in United States v. Nixon that executive privilege couldn't be used to keep information from a prosecutor investigating a crime, but the case didn't settle the question as it relates to Congress during an impeachment inquiry or trial.
The Nixon-era Justice Department suggested at the time that a presidential refusal to comply with a congressional subpoena during an impeachment trial could spark ""a constitutional confrontation of the highest magnitude.""
Mr. Trump maintains he did nothing wrong and has called the impeachment a hoax driven by politics. He derided the Democrats' presentation in a tweet Friday, saying ""the Do Nothing Democrats just keep repeating and repeating, over and over again, the same old 'stuff' on the Impeachment Hoax.""
As vice president, Mr. Biden helped lead an international anticorruption push in Ukraine at a time when Hunter Biden served on the board of a Ukranian natural-gas company. Mr. Trump and his allies have accused the elder Mr. Biden of working to replace a Ukrainian prosecutor to protect his son, but Mr. Biden pressed for the removal with the backing of U.S. allies at a time when the prosecutor's probe into Burisma, the gas company, was dormant.

Former Massachusetts Gov. William Weld says his Republican primary
challenge to President Trump
is a moral question for the party, but the top GOP official in New York doubts he'll even make the April 28 primary ballot.
Mr. Weld, who ran the Bay State from 1991 to 1997, was born on Long Island and owns homes in both the Catskills and Adirondacks. He ran for New York governor in 2006 but ultimately lost the GOP nomination to John Faso. Democrat Eliot Spitzer won the general election.
Mr. Weld ran for vice president on the Libertarian Party ticket in 2016 and said he is challenging President Trump for the GOP nomination this year because of his moral character, his environmental positions and his fiscal policies.
""There is a Republican alternative to Trump,"" Mr. Weld said. ""My view is that it's Mr. Trump who's the Republican in name only, and he's forsaken bedrock Republican principles like economic conservatism, conserving the environment and fully engaging with the world.""
A Trump campaign spokesman declined to comment.
Mr. Weld's establishment pedigree—Harvard, Oxford, Ronald Reagan's Justice Department—should appeal naturally to whatever number of Republicans remain skeptical of Mr. Trump. But despite his New York roots, Mr. Weld hasn't drawn support from any prominent Republicans in the state who resisted Trump in 2016 and is being shunned by its formal party apparatus.
""I would be very surprised if he had any traction whatsoever,"" NYGOP Chairman Nick Langworthy said of Mr. Weld, pointing to the strength of the economy. ""I think his candidacy is kind of a joke, and it's a bunch of sour-grapes Republicans who still can't get their head around the fact that their candidate of choice lost in 2016.""
The Weld campaign has failed to make the ballot in Kentucky, Oklahoma and Ohio. Other states have canceled their GOP primaries. To qualify in New York, Mr. Weld can circulate petitions, meet a national donor threshold or be certified as ""nationally known and recognized"" by the Republican commissioners of the State Board of Elections.
Candidates must then file a slate of 162 potential delegates, and alternates, to the Republican National Committee's August nominating convention. Mr. Langworthy said he doubted Mr. Weld could accomplish that task by the Feb. 25 deadline.
A Weld campaign spokesman said it hadn't determined exactly how it would apply for a spot on the New York ballot, and declined to release the names of any potential delegates. During a recent interview, Mr. Weld asked a reporter about the exact date of the New York primary.
A Siena College Research Institute poll released last week found 70% of New York Republicans surveyed have a favorable opinion of the president. The poll didn't ask about Mr. Weld.
The Weld campaign raised $1.3 million as of September, including just over $100,000 from New York donors, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. That's more than donations from any other state except Massachusetts, but New York's Trump skeptics are hardly rallying behind Mr. Weld.
U.S. Rep. John Katko, who said he didn't vote for Mr. Trump in 2016, told the Syracuse Post-Standard editorial board that he would support the president this year. So will Chris Jacobs, a state senator from the Buffalo suburbs who was Mr. Weld's running mate in 2006. Mr. Jacobs is running for Congress.
Former U.S. Rep. Richard Hanna, a Republican from Utica who endorsed Hillary Clinton in the last election and describes himself as a Never Trumper, said he didn't know enough about Mr. Weld's campaign to say if he would support it. Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro, the GOP's 2018 gubernatorial nominee, didn't reply to inquiries asking if he would support Mr. Weld after writing in the name of another Republican in 2016.
""There really is no Weld campaign in New York, so actively supporting him would be nothing more than a statement,"" said William F.B. O'Reilly, a Republican political consultant who said he would happily vote against Mr. Trump but was turned off by Mr. Weld's support of abortion rights.
THE MEDICAID TEAM: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is banking on an outside panel, dubbed the Medicaid Redesign Team, to find $2.5 billion in savings in the health-care program to help him bridge a $6.1 billion deficit. But that is about all we know.
State Sen. Gustavo Rivera, a Bronx Democrat who chairs the chamber's health committee, said he was concerned about the lack of details and who would be able to participate in the process.
""This is a black box,"" he said.
As he unveiled his $178 billion spending plan last week, Mr. Cuomo said the panel would be co-chaired by Northwell Health President Michael Dowling and Dennis Rivera, the former leader of Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union, which represents health-care workers.
A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo said the administration would ""soon finalize membership for the Medicaid Redesign Team, as well as the scope and process, and those details will be publicly released.""
THE QUESTION: Mr. Cuomo departed for Poland Sunday to attend a Holocaust remembrance service. The nation also shares its moniker with a village in upstate New York, where lots of municipalities are named after Old World locales. How many pairs of countries and their capital cities can you find among New York's municipalities? (For example, Warsaw, in Wyoming County, makes a pair with Poland.)
—Know the answer? Leave a comment!
THE LAST ANSWER: Before Mr. Cuomo took office in 2011, governors had traditionally delivered their annual State of the State addresses in the Assembly chamber on the third floor of the State Capitol.

WASHINGTON—The U.S. and China signed
a trade deal
that officials say will lead to a sharp increase in sales of U.S. goods and services to China, further open Chinese markets to foreign firms—especially in financial services—and provide strong new protections for trade secrets and intellectual property.

The eight-part agreement
acts as a cease-fire in a two-year trade war that has roiled markets world-wide and cut into global growth. But it leaves in place U.S. tariffs on about $370 billion in Chinese goods, or about three-quarters of Chinese imports to the U.S.
Possible tariff reductions will be left to later negotiations, which will cover a host of difficult issues at the heart of the trade battle, including Chinese subsidies to domestic companies and Beijing's oversight of Chinese state-owned firms. Those talks aren't expected to begin shortly and not conclude until after the U.S. presidential election in November.
Speaking to a packed audience of business and political leaders in the East Room of the White House, President Trump said the remaining tariffs ""will all come off"" if the talks produce a second agreement. He called the deal a ""momentous step—one that has never been taken before with China—toward a future of fair and reciprocal trade.""
Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, who signed the agreement for Beijing, played up the need for both countries to act together to tackle challenges such as terrorism, aging and environmental protection.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What would you like to see in the next phase of the trade deal between the U.S. and China? Join the conversation below.
""China has established a political system and an economic development model that suits its own characteristics,"" Mr. Liu said. ""But that doesn't mean China and the U.S. can't work together.""
While the deal contains wins for the U.S., the fact that most tariffs will remain on Chinese imports clouds prospects for growth in business investment between the two countries said John Frisbie, a China expert at the trade consulting firm of Hills & Co.
""Overall uncertainty is not reduced much because there is no removal of existing tariffs [and] questions whether China can buy the quantities of goods and services the administration wants,"" he said.
U.S. stocks have surged since the countries said they were nearing a deal, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 29000 for the first time on Wednesday. But market reaction to the actual signing was muted, suggesting investors saw little that was surprising within the text of the agreement.
""Basically, we've been told repeatedly that this deal was done,"" said Mike O'Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.
The White House sees the trade deal as a win politically going into the November election. The president can laud the agreement and argue that he is the only one who can successfully press Beijing for more concessions. ""President Trump saw an opportunity to advance the U.S. positioning at a time when the Chinese are seeing great political and economic turbulence,"" said Jason Miller, a former White House spokesman.
But former Vice President Joe Biden, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, made clear that he wasn't going to cede the issue to Mr. Trump. He criticized many of the pact's provisions as ""vague, weak, or covered by previous announcements and existing agreements.""
The agreement is structured as an agreement between equals, but Beijing is making nearly all the changes in policy and purchases. The pact focuses heavily on U.S. complaints that the Chinese government and companies coerce American ones into handing over their technology to their rivals, and Mr. Trump's focus on trying to close the vast trade deficit with China.
Beijing denies it engages in coercion and has, in the past, pledged to make sure no pressure is applied. The two pages on technology transfer go beyond other agreements China has signed that dealt with that issue.
""Neither party shall require or pressure persons"" to transfer technology to do business or to get regulatory approvals, the agreement said. The deal also banned pressure ""formally or informally"" on companies to use a certain technology to get a license.
However, the section doesn't require China to change any law or regulation to fulfill its obligations. A draft agreement that fell apart in May required dozens of changes in Chinese law. Top officials in Beijing nixed that deal, and the U.S. negotiators sought to retain as much of the tentative deal as possible. The deal is written in legalese and trade jargon that will be pored over by trade experts and lawyers.
As a condition of Beijing signing the deal, the U.S.
agreed to cut tariffs
on $120 billion in Chinese goods by half, to 7.5%, within about 30 days, and to forgo other planned tariffs. None of those commitments are part of the text.
In the intellectual-property section, China agreed to stiffen protection of trade secrets and to assess criminal penalties for ""willful trade secret misappropriation."" Increasing penalties was a priority of the Trump administration. But much of the intellectual-property language was light on specific rules in new areas. The pharmaceutical portion didn't include specific targets and didn't have language about defending biologic drugs from generic imitators, a major goal of big American drug makers.
The agreement also requires China to act quickly to accept applications from bank cards and payments systems seeking to access the Chinese market, and the deal's text cites Mastercard, Visa and American Express by name. The U.S. had previously fought cases at the World Trade Organization to win access for American payment providers, but China hasn't followed through with permitting access to the firms in all cases.
The U.S. also pledged to continue to open its market to China's UnionPay system.
The provisions of the deal are subject to an enforcement mechanism that calls for several rounds of consultations. If the two sides don't reach an agreement, the complaining party could take ""remedial measure in a proportionate way""—trade lingo for reimposing tariffs. In practice, the U.S. would likely be the party bringing the complaint because it is China that is pledging to make changes and increase purchases.
So long as the tariff imposition is in good faith, Beijing agreed not to retaliate. But the good-faith and proportionality requirements give China a lot of room to act. Rather than retaliate with tariffs, the deal says the party whose actions led to the complaint could withdraw from the deal—although then China would be free to retaliate. A senior U.S. administration official said he figured Beijing would be very reluctant to take such steps, which would shatter the deal.
But it is unclear whether U.S. companies, wary of retaliation by China, will refer disputes to the enforcement mechanism. Most trade deals use arbitration panels to settle disputes, figuring they can be impartial.
""There is a strong element of Yogi Berra's quip about déjà vu all over again,"" said James Green, a former U.S. trade negotiator in Beijing under Mr. Trump. ""The dispute resolution section will have the same problem we've always faced—U.S. companies are reluctant to become poster children for market access problems or discriminatory treatment.""
The biggest section of the deal covers Chinese purchases. Beijing pledged to buy an additional $200 billion in goods and split across 2020 and 2021, with the deal calling for $77 billion in additional trade the first year and $123 billion the second year.
Across the two years, the targets call for China to boost its purchasing above the levels seen in 2017, by about $78 billion in manufacturing, by an extra $32 billion of agriculture, by $52 billion of energy and by $38 billion of services. The deal said that targets have been agreed for narrower categories of items, but these targets weren't disclosed, the administration said, to avoid distorting markets.
In 2017, the U.S. exported $186 billion of goods and services. To fulfill the targets in the deal, U.S. exports to China would need to climb to $263 billion in 2020 and $309 billion in 2021, an increase without precedent in the history of U.S. trade.
U.S.-China Deal at a Glance
Here is what you need to know about the 90-page first phase of the trade deal.
*
Buying American: Beijing will ramp up purchases of U.S. goods and services by $200 billion over the next two years, using 2017 as a benchmark. This includes increased purchases of manufactured goods by $77.7 billion over the two-year period. The category of tech services, which includes charges for cloud computing-related services and the use of intellectual property, is projected to grow by $37.9 billion. Energy purchases will increase by $52.4 billion under the deal.
*
Agriculture Purchases: The much-touted agriculture purchases have smaller goals for increased trade under the deal than energy, manufacturing and services, with an increase of $32 billion over the two-year period. In addition to the purchase targets, however, China has agreed to steps that allow more market access for U.S. dairy products, poultry, beef, fish, rice and even pet food.
*
Trade Secrets: The deal includes strong language related to preventing and punishing theft of trade secrets. The deal makes it easier for U.S. businesses to persuade authorities to initiate a criminal investigation in China. In addition, the deal says U.S. businesses operating in China should be able to operate ""openly and freely"" without pressure to transfer their technology to foreign business partners. Sharing tech blueprints ""must be based on market terms that are voluntary and reflect mutual agreement,"" it said.
*
Financial Services: The deal removes barriers to help U.S. banking institutions, insurers and other financial-services companies expand in the Chinese market. That includes quickly reviewing license applications from credit-card companies and U.S.-owned credit-rating services. The deal sets a five-month deadline for China to allow branches of U.S. financial institutions to provide securities investment-fund custody services.
*
Resolving Business Disputes: The deal calls for the creation of a dispute-resolution office, addressing longstanding complaints from the U.S. business community that their disagreements with Chinese partners haven't been fairly resolved. It laid out the framework for officials in U.S. and China to discuss how to implement this mechanism, including information sharing and an appeals process.
*
Tariff Relief: Prior to the deal, the U.S. agreed to cut the tariff rate to 7.5% from 15% for charges it had imposed on roughly $120 billion in Chinese products. The U.S. also held off on tariffs of 15% on roughly $156 billion in consumer products, including smartphones, that were set to take effect in December. The deal doesn't amend that prior agreement. President Trump on Wednesday said he would remove the tariffs if the next round of negotiations are successful.
*
Currency Manipulation: China commits not to devalue its currency or make persistent intervention in its currency market. China also commits to a schedule of regular disclosures of data regarding its foreign-exchange holdings.
—Katy Stech Ferek
The projected steep climb in exports left some potential beneficiaries skeptical. For instance, Mr. Liu said the purchases wouldn't come at the expense of other countries. That could make it harder for Beijing to meet the purchase goals.
The deal also has some terms that China could use to claim that the U.S. is at fault if it doesn't meet the purchase targets. For instance, China could request consultations if China's purchases are ""affected by an action or inaction by the United States,"" the text says. That could come into play if U.S. export rules limit the technology products the U.S. lets China buy.
A senior administration official said the provision just allows for discussions and wouldn't be a basis for China to claim it can't fulfill its commitments.

WASHINGTON—Former national security adviser John Bolton, described by witnesses who testified at President Trump's impeachment hearings as alarmed at the pressure put on Ukraine, said he would testify in a Senate trial if subpoenaed by lawmakers.
Mr. Bolton's statement Monday spurred partisan wrangling over how the Senate impeachment trial would be conducted and added pressure on Republicans to call the former official. Mr. Bolton has previously conveyed that he has new information about the White House's Ukraine policy.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What impact do you think John Bolton's testimony would have in the Senate impeachment trial? Join the conversation below.
The Democratic-led House
approved abuse-of-power and obstruction-of-Congress impeachment articles
in December alleging Mr. Trump tried to enlist a foreign power to help him in this year's election. The chamber had sought Mr. Bolton's testimony but moved forward with articles of impeachment
when he declined to testify.

""Since my testimony is once again at issue, I have had to resolve the serious competing issues as best I could, based on careful consideration and study. I have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify,""
Mr. Bolton said in a statement.
He noted that he had weighed Mr. Trump's attempt to block aides and former advisers from testifying to Congress against lawmakers' request that he testify about the White House's Ukraine policy.
The White House didn't respond to a question about Mr. Bolton's statement.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) has held off on sending the
approved articles of impeachment
to the Senate, saying she wanted to see more details on rules for a Senate trial. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the chamber's Democratic leader, has demanded the Senate request documents and testimony from the White House. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) hasn't committed to calling witnesses in the impeachment trial.
Mr. McConnell reiterated on Monday his position that requests for witnesses should be addressed after the trial begins, as during former President Clinton's impeachment trial.
""That was good enough for President Clinton, so it ought to be good enough for President Trump,"" he said on the Senate floor. New witness material was used in the Clinton impeachment after approval by the Senate.
It would take a simple majority of the 100 senators to approve any new witnesses, meaning four Republicans would be needed if all 47 senators who caucus with the Democrats backed new testimony. On Monday, some Republicans remained wary of introducing new evidence after the House concluded its probe.
""Our inquiry should be limited to whatever evidence or testimony they used when they voted on the articles of impeachment,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.). ""If the House thinks there's additional testimony and so forth then they could take the item up again.""
Others signaled they wanted to hear from Mr. Bolton.

""He has firsthand information, and assuming articles of impeachment reach the Senate, I'd like to hear what he has to say,"" Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) said.
Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) said he would be open to hearing from Mr. Bolton, anticipating he would be ""a good witness for the president.""
The House could also call Mr. Bolton to testify, though Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), chairman of the Intelligence Committee who led the investigation, said Monday that it ""makes sense"" for Mr. Bolton to testify in the Senate trial
Mr. Trump has said he did nothing wrong, tweeting on Monday that the impeachment process was a ""con game by the Dems to help with the Election!""
Mr. Bolton, according to testimony from other witnesses in the House impeachment investigation,
was alarmed at a parallel Ukraine policy
overseen by Mr. Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani aimed at pressuring Kyiv to launch investigations that would benefit him politically, including a probe of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son. Mr. Bolton referred to the matter as a ""drug deal,"" according to the
testimony of Fiona Hill
, who had been Mr. Bolton's top Eurasia specialist.
Mr. Bolton, whom
Mr. Trump fired in September
after nearly a year and a half on the job, ""was personally involved in many of the events, meetings, and conversations""
about the Ukraine matter
""as well as many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far,"" Mr. Bolton's attorney Charles Cooper wrote to the House's general counsel, Douglas Letter, in November.
Mr. Schumer has called for testimony from three new witnesses besides Mr. Bolton: acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney; Mr. Mulvaney's aide Robert Blair; and Office of Management and Budget official Michael Duffey.
""It is now up to four Senate Republicans to support bringing in Mr. Bolton, and the other three witnesses, as well as the key documents we have requested to ensure all the evidence is presented at the onset of a Senate trial,"" Mr. Schumer said.
Mr. Bolton's acknowledgment of the Senate's power to compel him to appear sidesteps a brewing conflict between the branches of government over their rights and privileges in the impeachment proceedings. Precedent on whether a president can invoke legal privilege over documents or testimony in an impeachment process, particularly a Senate trial, is scant.
In 1974, the Nixon Justice Department concluded that ""a constitutional confrontation of the highest magnitude would ensue"" if a president tried to withhold information or testimony from the Congress in an impeachment trial by claiming executive privilege over the objection of the Senate.
Mr. McConnell hasn't ruled out hearing from witnesses. Over the break, two Senate Republicans—
Lisa Murkowski of Alaska
and
Susan Collins of Maine
—indicated they would bring an independent mind-set to a trial, suggesting that witnesses could be called if enough Republicans vote for motions by Democrats to subpoena witnesses or documents.
Ms. Collins said Monday the Senate should vote on possible witnesses after the trial begins, supporting Mr. McConnell.
""I think that we will decide at that stage who we need to hear from,"" she said.
In the House impeachment testimony, witnesses described Mr. Bolton as hostile to the Ukraine pressure campaign. According to witnesses, Mr. Bolton abruptly ended a July 10 White House meeting with Ukrainian government officials after U.S. ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland linked a meeting between Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky and Mr. Trump to Ukraine's willingness to announced investigations that Mr. Trump sought.
During the House probe, Mr. Bolton declined to testify voluntarily. In his statement Monday explaining his decision to come to the Senate, Mr. Bolton said he believed he had run out of time on seeking a judicial ruling.
""It now falls to the Senate to fulfill its Constitutional obligation to try impeachments, and it does not appear possible that a final judicial resolution of the still-unanswered Constitutional questions can be obtained before the Senate acts,"" he said.

WASHINGTON—The Trump administration didn't have the legal authority to put on hold millions of dollars in security assistance to Ukraine, Congress's nonpartisan watchdog found, adding more scrutiny to the funding freeze last summer that led to the
impeachment of President Trump
.

In its decision
Thursday, the Government Accountability Office wrote that the Office of Management and Budget improperly froze the money for policy reasons.
""Faithful execution of the law does not permit the President to substitute his own policy priorities for those that Congress has enacted into law,"" GAO wrote.
The GAO, which falls under the legislative branch, doesn't enforce penalties for its legal decisions, leaving any possible follow-up to Congress. In the past, Congress has included language in spending bills requiring reports or hearings on compliance with budgetary law, or tied funding for other issues to following the law.
The Office of Management and Budget has repeatedly defended the legality of the hold, arguing that it was necessary to allow the administration to review the security assistance. In a letter to GAO in December, Mark Paoletta, OMB's general counsel, said that the administration had the legal authority to hold the funds, which were released in mid-September.
""We disagree with GAO's opinion,"" Rachel Semmel, a spokeswoman for OMB, said in a statement. ""OMB uses its apportionment authority to ensure taxpayer dollars are properly spent consistent with the President's priorities and with the law.""
Mr. Trump and members of the administration have said that the hold was in place because of concerns about corruption in Ukraine and questions about how much money other countries were contributing to Ukraine, which is battling pro-Russian forces. The Defense Department had previously certified that Ukraine had taken sufficient steps toward combating corruption to receive the funds.
Democrats, in their impeachment investigation, charged that Mr. Trump froze the aid as part of his
effort to pressure Ukraine to open investigations
that would benefit him politically.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How do you think the GAO's findings will affect the impeachment trial of President Trump, if at all? Join the conversation below.
The Democratic-controlled House passed two articles of impeachment, one focused on abuse of power and the other on obstructing Congress, in December. The GOP-led Senate, which is expected to acquit Mr. Trump of the charges, on Thursday
opened a trial to consider them
.
Meanwhile,
Ukrainian authorities opened a criminal probe
into whether American citizens placed the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine under surveillance, as text messages suggest, before she was removed from her post last year.
The GAO decision, signed by GAO General Counsel Thomas Armstrong, found that the freeze on $214 million in Defense Department funding for Ukraine didn't meet the legal standards for the administration to freeze the funds.
Under the Impoundment Control Act, the president can freeze funding in limited circumstances, including if it is to help programs run more efficiently. GAO also said that the administration didn't follow the legal procedures for notifying Capitol Hill of the hold.
""OMB did not identify—in either the apportionment schedules themselves or in its response to us—any contingencies as recognized by the ICA, savings or efficiencies that would result from a withholding, or any law specifically authorizing the withholding,"" Mr. Armstrong wrote.
Under the ICA, which was enacted in 1974, the president may formally ask Congress to defer or rescind funds—for example, if an agency can't spend the funds before the end of the fiscal year, or decides the funds are no longer needed immediately—but ultimately the decision rests with lawmakers, said William Hoagland, a former Republican staff director for the Senate Budget Committee.
Enforcement of the law, Mr. Hoagland said, is mainly a matter of embarrassing those found to have violated it. He said he didn't know of anyone ever facing criminal prosecution for a violation.
Responding to Mr. Paoletta's justification for the hold, GAO wrote that ""OMB's assertions have no basis in law.""
GAO said it was continuing to review the hold on State Department foreign military financing for Ukraine.

""OMB and State have failed, as of yet, to provide the information we need to fulfill our duties under the ICA regarding potential impoundments of [foreign military financing] funds,"" the report said.
House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D., N.Y.) said that her committee was pursuing a package of reforms to prevent similar situations in the future.
""Given that this illegal conduct threatened our security and undermined our elections, I feel even more strongly that the House has chosen the right course by impeaching President Trump,"" she said in a statement.
Sen. Mike Rounds (R., S.D.) said that the GAO decision didn't change his thinking on whether the Senate trial should have witnesses. He noted that OMB should formally notify Congress when it freezes funding.
""In the future I would expect OMB would change it and give the appropriate notices,"" he said.
Top Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.), said the GAO decision underscored the necessity of the Senate reviewing documents and hearing from witnesses during the trial.
Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.) the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee, criticized the administration for holding the funds.
""I've been here since President Ford, Democratic and Republican presidents, and I have never seen such a damning report as that,"" he said.
Some Senate Republicans were critical of GAO's ruling, while others said it was problematic only for OMB, not Mr. Trump.
""It's the Office of Management and Budget, with whom I've had a few disagreements over the years about withholding money that's been appropriated by Congress,"" said Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas). ""I think we're going to hear some more about it. But I don't think that changes anything.""
Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) said the administration was well within its rights to hold the money.
Sen. Richard Shelby (R., Ala.), the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Chairman, criticized the GAO for what he said was overreaching. ""They shouldn't be deciding who broke the law,"" he said.
The GAO opened its review after Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D., Md.) asked about the legality of the hold at an October hearing with U.S. Comptroller General Gene Dodaro, who leads the office.
In the weeks after the beginning of the funding freeze, officials at OMB and the
Pentagon raised questions
about whether the administration had the legal authority to indefinitely suspend money approved by Congress.
Mark Sandy, a career budget staffer, told impeachment investigators that he immediately flagged legal questions about freezing aid to Ukraine when Mike Duffey, his boss and a political appointee, instructed him to do so in July.
After consulting with lawyers at OMB and the Defense Department, Mr. Sandy signed the paperwork for the first pause on the security assistance.
Mr. Duffey, a former Pentagon staffer and executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party, subsequently began signing the paperwork for apportioning funds in his portfolio and kept the Ukraine aid on hold. Mr. Schumer is seeking Mr. Duffey's testimony during the Senate trial.
Mr. Sandy told investigators he had never seen a political appointee take responsibility for signing apportionments before.
In the paperwork executing the funding freeze, OMB allowed the Defense Department to continue to prepare to spend the funds while not actually releasing them. Pentagon officials repeatedly warned that the hold could prevent them from spending the money before it expired at the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30.
Congress ultimately included a provision in a short-term spending bill passed in September preventing roughly $30 million in unspent funds from expiring.

WASHINGTON—President Trump on Monday opened a series of events designed to pull back the curtain on the longest developing foreign policy initiative of his administration, a proposal for peace in the Middle East.
Mr. Trump greeted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House and met later Monday with Mr. Netanyahu's main rival, Blue and White party leader Benny Gantz.
The president said he would release details of his administration's long-delayed, 50-page political blueprint under development since 2017 before holding additional meetings with Mr. Netanyahu on Tuesday. He offered a restrained assessment of the plan's prospects.
""Peace in the Middle East has been long sought, for many, many, many years and decades and centuries,"" Mr. Trump said in welcoming Mr. Netanyahu. ""This is an opportunity, we'll see what happens. Whatever it is, it is.""
Few details of the plan have ever been made public. While economic proposals were issued by administration officials last June, the key political differences—including resolving borders, refugees and security arrangements—have been considered the most difficult part of any peace effort, and Mr. Trump hasn't divulged his administration's proposals for them.
The plan will be released around noon Tuesday, Mr. Trump said. ""We're going show a plan. It's been worked on by everybody and we'll see whether or not it gets [support],"" Mr. Trump said. ""If it does, that will be great. And if it doesn't, we can live with it too. But I think it might have a chance.""
Mr. Netanyahu sounded a somewhat more upbeat assessment. ""I look forward to making history with you tomorrow,"" he told Mr. Trump.
Palestinian officials aren't included in this week's meetings, and the coming days are shaping up to be dueling sets of handshakes between Mr. Trump and the Israeli political rivals, in the process jolting Israel's unprecedented third elections in March.
Analysts in Israel and Washington have described the Washington visit a little over one month away from Israel's vote as an election boost for Mr. Netanyahu, who has campaigned as an indispensable statesman best poised to capitalize on his close ties with Mr. Trump.
Palestinian officials cut ties with the Trump administration in December 2017 after
President Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital
and have repeatedly criticized the Trump administration peace effort, saying it could make permanent Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza.
Relations were further strained after the Trump administration slashed funds for the U.N.'s Palestinian refugee agency, cut bilateral assistance and closed the Palestinian mission in Washington.
Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said Sunday that the meeting absent any Palestinian input ""is the hoax and the fraud of the century.""
The Trump administration has said it hopes its plan could be the basis for discussions between Israel and the Palestinians. But in Israel, right-wing politicians largely have dismissed the idea that talks would result.
Palestinian officials have also said they would reject any plan that doesn't include East Jerusalem as the capital of a Palestinian state that is based on borders before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.
Members of Mr. Netanyahu's Likud party and other right-wing politicians framed the plan as a step on the road to Israeli annexation of parts of the West Bank, because the expected Palestinian rejection of the plan could then give Israel cover to follow through on Mr. Netanyahu's election pledges.
The plan's rollout could also put pressure on Mr. Netanyahu to take unilateral steps before Israel's March 2 vote and is expected to boost him domestically because of how favorable it is anticipated to be to Israel.
""Annex, we'll support. Don't annex—we'll oppose. If this whole event ends without applying sovereignty now, before the elections, with the American tailwind, then this won't be the deal of the century, but the missed opportunity of the century,"" said Naftali Bennett, head of the Yamina party that is to the right of Mr. Netanyahu's Likud.
Mr. Netanyahu has pledged to unilaterally annex the Jordan Valley if he is re-elected and called for the parliament to vote on the matter as early as this week.
Mr. Gantz said last week that he would look to do the same by seeking consensus in Israel and with the help of the international community. U.S. officials have said they oppose any unilateral actions before the plan is released.
Palestinian officials said a failed plan could have consequences, including opening ""the doors of one person one vote"" across Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. Currently, Palestinians living in the West Bank and Gaza aren't Israeli citizens and cannot vote in Israeli elections.
Israel wants to make sure that any arrangement would ensure its survival as a Jewish democratic state, which its leaders fear would be threatened if a large number of Palestinians gained voting rights through annexation of territories. Some two million Arab Israelis live inside Israel and are Israeli citizens, about one-fifth of the nation's population.
The meetings could distract from domestic political and legal problems both Messrs. Netanyahu and Trump face ahead of tough election contests. In a week that Mr. Gantz's Blue and White party had hoped would focus on Mr. Netanyahu's legal troubles, much of the Israeli political has shifted to feverish speculation about what parts of the West Bank Mr. Netanyahu may annex.
Israel's parliament is set to vote Tuesday to form a panel to hear
Mr. Netanyahu's immunity request
from bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges. In Washington, Mr. Trump is facing the second week of his impeachment trial in the Senate.
Some details of the Middle East plan have been reported in the Israeli press, but not confirmed by U.S. officials. Some of the reports said the Trump plan would provide for Israeli sovereignty over all of Jerusalem and 100 settlements as well as the establishment of a Palestinian state provided that Hamas, which controls Gaza, disarms and the Palestinians recognize Israel as a Jewish state with Jerusalem as its capital.
Trump administration officials refused to comment on the details circulating, and Mr. Trump tweeted last week
that reports about details are speculative
.
Mr. Trump said last week that Palestinian leaders had been ""briefly"" contacted but didn't elaborate. ""But we will speak to them in a period of time,"" Mr. Trump added.
Mr. Trump acknowledged the difficulty of attaining a pact for peace in the Middle East, calling it ""the toughest of any deal.""

DESERT HILLS, Ariz. -- Four years ago, the relatively humdrum scene never would have happened: A week before Christmas, more than three dozen Democrats filed into a public-school cafeteria to go over their finances and organizing goals and to hear from a local candidate.
The Maricopa County Democratic Party didn't have much of a presence in this traditionally Republican, suburban area until President Trump's election in 2016, when Ann Olsen, a 59-year-old physical therapist, decided to organize a local committee, suspecting there were others who were motivated by his surprise win.
""Even though I knew it was red . . . I knew those people were there, and I wasn't crazy for feeling the way I felt,"" Ms. Olsen said.
Now these Democrats are part of a growing network trying to win in some of the most hotly contested states in this year's presidential and Senate elections. Arizona went Mr. Trump's way in 2016, and Republicans say they are confident he will bring out voters again. But recent demographic and voting trends indicate a tougher GOP path in 2020.
Democrats saw gains in all but two of Arizona's counties in 2018, when Kyrsten Sinema became the state's first Democrat elected to the U.S. Senate since 1988. The state is also experiencing a population boom in suburban and exurban areas where voters are supporting Democrats in greater numbers.
Those factors are drawing heightened amounts of money and attention to a state that has voted for a Democrat in the presidential election only once since 1948.
Priorities USA, a Democratic super PAC, is spending $2 million on digital advertising in the state. The Democratic National Committee is adding staff and training field organizers months before it did in 2016, aiming to have infrastructure in place for whichever candidate emerges as the nominee.
David Bergstein, a DNC spokesman focused on battleground states, said the party sees an opportunity to contrast Democratic positions on health care and the economy with Mr. Trump's record in traditionally Republican suburban areas that played a big role in Ms. Sinema's victory.
""The result of the 2018 race, and the way voters rejected his record of broken promises on issues like health care and taxes, makes it clear that this is a big liability for him,"" he said of Mr. Trump.
Rick Gorka, a spokesman for the Trump Victory committee, the joint fundraising operation of Mr. Trump's campaign and the Republican National Committee, said that while the state will be competitive, the campaign doesn't believe Democrats can repeat the gains they made here in 2018.
""What we are finding with President Trump is that he brings out an electorate, unlike any other traditional Republican. And if Donald Trump is not on the ballot, there are folks that are simply just not going to go out to the polls,"" Mr. Gorka said of 2018 results.
Mr. Gorka said the campaign has identified 200,000 Arizona voters who supported the president in 2016 but didn't vote in 2018. The Trump re-election effort is working to bring those people back to the polls by deploying thousands of volunteers, armed with scripts tailored by the Republican Party's cache of data on individual voters' personal characteristics.
Republicans will also be defending the seat currently held by Sen. Martha McSally, who lost to Ms. Sinema but was appointed to fill the seat vacated when Sen. John McCain died. Ms. McSally is likely to face Democrat Mark Kelly, the former astronaut and husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. Recent polling suggests a dead heat in that race as well as in the presidential race.
A critical part of Ms. Sinema's win was driving up turnout in heavily Democratic areas of Phoenix and winning in the northern and western parts of the city's suburban ring that went for Mr. Trump in 2016, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from OpenElections, a nonprofit effort that collects and publishes official precinct results.
Ms. Sinema also outperformed 2016 nominee Hillary Clinton in heavily Latino areas within Maricopa County, where Brendan Walsh, the organizing director with Unite Here Local 11, which represents hospitality workers in Southern California and Arizona, has been working for over a decade and has knocked on hundreds of thousands of doors.
Rae Chornenky, chairman of the Maricopa County Republican Committee, said she is confident having Mr. Trump at the top of the ticket will outweigh Democratic organizing. But she added the party needs to do more to reach out to suburban women, a group she said can be a weak spot for the president.

WASHINGTON—President Trump issued a flurry of clemency orders on Tuesday, pardoning financier Michael Milken, who spent nearly two years in prison for securities-law violations, and commuting
the 14-year sentence
of ex-Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who was convicted of trying to sell a U.S. Senate seat.
Mr. Trump also issued full pardons for
former New York City Police Commissioner
Bernard Kerik, and former San Francisco 49ers owner Edward J. DeBartolo Jr. Mr. Trump has now issued a total of 35 pardons or sentence commutations since 2017, far more than his two immediate predecessors in the first three years of their administrations.
While speaking at Joint Base Andrews on Tuesday, he portrayed the clemency actions as an effort to address what he views as miscarriages of justice. Mr. Trump also said he has relied heavily on recommendations from friends and associates of those seeking clemency.
""I really rely on the recommendations of people that know them,"" Mr. Trump said.
The unexpected pardons drew Democratic and some Republican criticism. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), a leading Democratic presidential candidate, tweeted: ""Today, Trump granted clemency to tax cheats, Wall Street crooks, billionaires, and corrupt government officials. Meanwhile thousands of poor and working-class kids sit in jail for nonviolent drug convictions.""
Mr. Milken's
prosecution in the late 1980s
defined an era of financial excess. Among those pursuing Mr. Milken on criminal charges during those years was Mr. Trump's current personal lawyer and key figure in the impeachment saga, Rudy Giuliani, who at the time was the top federal prosecutor for the Southern District of New York. Mr. Giuliani said Tuesday that he supported the pardoning of Mr. Milken.
Mr. Milken, known as the ""junk bond king,"" served 22 months of a 10-year prison sentence after pleading guilty to six felonies in 1990, ranging from conspiracy to securities and mail fraud to a tax count. He was ultimately barred from the securities industry for life and paid hundreds of millions of dollars in fines, penalties and restitution to investors.
Mr. Milken, 73 years old, is credited with helping to popularize the use of junk bonds to finance bold and sometimes hostile takeovers, and became an enduring symbol of what remains one of Wall Street's brashest eras. He and his firm,
Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., also helped to shift the financial world westward.
For a time, Drexel's Beverly Hills trading floor seemed to many Wall Street insiders as the center of the universe. Southern California's financial-services industry has flourished in the decades since, in part because of the diaspora of Drexel alumni after the firm's demise who launched their own firms nearby.
After his 1993 release from federal prison, Mr. Milken established and endowed a philanthropic organization devoted to cancer research. His supporters have emphasized that his philanthropy also predated his conviction and fall from pre-eminence.

Mr. Milken has cultivated a rapport with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a personal friend who flew on Mr. Milken's private plane from Washington to California in January 2019, according to Mr. Milken.
Attorneys for Mr. Milken have long sought a presidential pardon. They lobbied President Clinton before he left office, but the move faced
strong law-enforcement opposition
.
The White House pointed to support for the pardon of Mr. Milken from prominent individuals, including conservative donors Sheldon and Miriam Adelson, property developer Richard LeFrak, Mr. Giuliani, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) and Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of News Corp, which owns The Wall Street Journal.
Mr. Milken said in a statement that he and his wife, Lori, ""look forward to many more years of pursuing our efforts in medical research, education and public health.""
Pardons can help rehabilitate the reputation of people convicted of crimes. They can also serve to restore the right to vote or serve in public office. The White House said that Mr. Milken's lifetime ban from the securities industry remains in place.
Mr. Blagojevich, 63, a Democrat, was
convicted on charges
of trying to sell a U.S. Senate seat vacated by President Obama after he won the presidency in 2008. He served almost eight years in prison.
After Mr. Blagojevich's arrest and his removal from office, but before his conviction, he was a contestant on a season of Mr. Trump's reality-TV show ""Celebrity Apprentice.""
""I don't know him very well, I've met him a couple of times, he was on for a short time on 'The Apprentice' years ago,"" Mr. Trump told reporters, referring to his reality-TV show.
Mr. Blagojevich was released Tuesday from a federal prison in Colorado.
""I can't wait to get home,"" he told reporters at the airport in Denver. ""I miss my daughters, I miss my wife. I miss home.""
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What do you think are the strongest arguments for or against clemency? Join the conversation below.
The former Democratic congressman and governor expressed his deep gratitude to the president and said, ""If you're asking me what my party affiliation is, I'm a Trump-ocrat.""
The commutation drew criticism in Illinois, where Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Mr. Trump has abused his pardon power.
""I deeply believe this pardon sends the wrong message at the wrong time,"" Mr. Pritzker said.
The five Republicans who represent Illinois in the House of Representatives also put out a joint statement
criticizing the commutation
.
Mr. Blagojevich ""is the face of public corruption in Illinois, and not once has he shown any remorse for his clear and documented record of egregious crimes that undermined the trust placed in him by voters,"" read the statement by Reps. Darin LaHood, John Shimkus, Adam Kinzinger, Rodney Davis and Mike Bost.
Mr. Kerik pleaded guilty to
eight felony counts
of tax fraud and false-statement charges in 2009. The face of the NYPD after the 9/11 attacks, he subsequently was considered for Homeland Security secretary. He is a close associate of Mr. Giuliani, who is the godfather of two of Mr. Kerik's children.
""With the exception of the birth of my children, today is one of the greatest days in my life—being made a full and whole American citizen again,"" said Mr. Kerik in a statement posted on Twitter.
Mr. DeBartolo was
convicted in 1998
of failing to report an extortion attempt by a Louisiana politician. He paid $1 million in fines and restitution but served no jail time.
Typically, the Justice Department makes recommendations on whether to issue a pardon, though the power belongs to the president alone. Mr. Trump has previously circumvented the Justice Department entirely when issuing pardons and granting clemency, relying instead on his own connections.
The Justice Department declined to say whether it had issued advice.
A person familiar with Mr. Trump's thinking said that many of the pardons had been pending for months, and that he had directed that everything be ready so that he could act. Mr. Trump finalized the timing of the announcement last week, the person said.
Mr. Trump declined to say if he was considering a pardon for longtime confidant Roger Stone. Earlier in the day, a federal judge
declined to delay
Mr. Stone's sentencing, set for Thursday. Mr. Stone was
convicted last year
of lying to Congress and witness tampering as part of Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
""I haven't given it any thought,"" Mr. Trump said, when asked about a potential pardon for Mr. Stone. ""In the meantime, he's going through a process, but I think he's been treated very unfairly.""
Mr. Trump also pardoned a number of others, including Angela Stanton, an author and TV personality who briefly served time for participation in a stolen-vehicle ring; David Safavian, a former government official convicted of making false statements; Ariel Friedler, a former government contractor who pleaded guilty to hacking into the computer systems of his competitors; and Paul Pogue, a Texas construction company owner who pleaded guilty on tax charges.
Also receiving clemency were Tynice Nichole Hall and Crystal Munoz, both convicted and serving time on drug offenses. Judith Negron, the owner of a health-care company accused of defrauding the federal government, has also been granted clemency.
President Trump issued seven pardons and four commutations on Tuesday. Here is a rundown:
PARDONS
* Edward DeBartolo Jr.: Pleaded guilty to a felony regarding a payment demanded for a riverboat casino license in Louisiana. He paid $1 million in fines and restitution, served no jail time. ""His exceptional compassion and warmth define his character to this day,"" the White House said.
* Michael Milken: Credited with helping to popularize the use of junk bonds to finance bold and sometimes hostile takeovers. Pleaded guilty to several securities-law violations in 1990. He served 22 months of a 10-year prison sentence. ""We have Mike Milken, who's gone around and done an incredible job for the world, with all of his research on cancer, and he's done this and he suffered greatly,"" Mr. Trump said.
* Ariel Friedler: Pleaded guilty to conspiracy to access a protected computer without authorization and served two months in prison.
* Bernard Kerik: The former New York Police Department commissioner was tapped by President George W. Bush to head the Department of Homeland Security in 2004, but withdrew under pressure during the background check process. He was sentenced to four years in prison for tax fraud and for making false statements. Mr. Trump said he was ""a man who had many recommendations from a lot of good people.""
* Paul Pogue: The construction company owner pleaded guilty to filing false returns and was sentenced to three years of probation.
* David Safavian: The former government official was convicted of lying to investigators about his relationship with disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff. He was sentenced to one year in prison.
* Angela Stanton: She was involved in a stolen vehicle ring and served a six-month home confinement sentence.
COMMUTATIONS
* Rod Blagojevich: The former Illinois governor was midway through a 14-year sentence for multiple counts of corruption. He was heard on wiretaps allegedly seeking to sell an appointment to the Senate seat Barack Obama vacated upon his election as president. ""That was a tremendously powerful, ridiculous sentence, in my opinion,"" Mr. Trump said.
* Tynice Nichole Hall: Served nearly 14 years of an 18-year sentence for allowing her apartment to be used to distribute drugs.
* Crystal Munoz: Spent 12 years in prison for her role in a marijuana smuggling ring.
* Judith Negron: Sentenced to 35 years in prison for her role in a scheme by her health-care company to defraud the federal government.

An intraparty Republican fight over a Georgia Senate seat is intensifying, as campaign vendors face pressure not to work with a congressman trying to unseat the state's newly appointed senator.
The battle pits 53-year-old Rep. Doug Collins, a four-term conservative congressman and defender of President Trump, against Sen. Kelly Loeffler, 49, a business executive with no political experience who has tens of millions of dollars to spend on a campaign.
Republican Gov. Brian Kemp appointed Ms. Loeffler to replace Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, who left office at the end of 2019 because of declining health. Under state law, the governor can appoint senators temporarily, but candidates must run to fill out the rest of the term at the next general election. Some Republicans worry that a divisive fight would hurt the party's prospects against the Democratic nominee in November.
If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, the two top vote-getters, regardless of party, will compete in a Jan. 5 runoff. Whoever wins the general election would be up for re-election for a new six-year term again in 2022.
Mr. Collins appeared on Fox News in January to say he would run, too. Within days, at least three campaign vendors dropped him as a client under pressure from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm of Senate Republicans, according to two people familiar with the matter. Some of the companies' clients also were warned to distance themselves from Mr. Collins, the people said. The NRSC's stance has long been that working for candidates challenging incumbent senators could cost vendors their good standing with the committee.
Stephen Lawson, a spokesman for Ms. Loeffler's campaign, said she wasn't available to comment. ""Kelly isn't worried about politics -- she's focused on supporting President Trump's agenda and creating more opportunities for Georgians to prosper,"" Mr. Lawson said.
Mr. Collins is defiant. His campaign hired new vendors and is seizing on the controversy as a way of casting him as an insurgent outsider. ""The efforts that are under way in Washington and under the Gold Dome in Atlanta have a whiff of panic about them,"" said Collins campaign spokesman Dan McLagan. ""The side that doesn't want there to be a vote is likely the side that doesn't have the votes.""
The unknown factor in the Collins-Loeffler showdown is Mr. Trump, who thanked them both recently for their support during the impeachment process. At a White House event, Mr. Trump called Ms. Loeffler ""a young woman who I didn't know at all, but she's been so supportive."" A few minutes later, he saluted Mr. Collins, saying, ""You have been so great. Thank you very much.""
The NRSC has blasted Rep. Collins's decision to run as selfish. ""With this emotional, ill-informed decision, Doug Collins has united conservatives in opposition to his candidacy and Senator Loeffler has quickly assembled more Republican support in Georgia than Collins ever knew existed,"" said NRSC spokesman Jesse Hunt.
Bryan Long, a Georgia Democratic campaign consultant, said the brewing GOP fight is great news for his side. ""Y'all see who can out Trump each other,"" he said. ""The Republicans seem to be doing everything they can to help Democrats in this race.""

Democrats are torn over whether it is acceptable in the middle of a national crisis to run political ads attacking President Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, but one of the party's largest outside groups is placing a $6 million bet that it is a smart strategy.
Such virus-themed ads are starting to show up in the nation's political bloodstream as the crisis promises to reshape many of this year's state and federal campaigns. Some, from both Democrats and Republicans, feature candidates touting their own roles in the response. Others are critical of Mr. Trump's leadership.
Priorities USA, a deep-pocketed super political-action committee, said it would run an ad starting Tuesday that uses the
president's own words to criticize him
. The spot, which will also have an online component, will run on television in the battleground states of Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
""We have it totally under control,"" Mr. Trump says in the ad, as a timeline and a rapidly growing chart of U.S. cases is displayed on the screen. ""One day, it's like a miracle, it will disappear.""
Steve Guest, a Republican National Committee spokesman, said in response: ""From the beginning, President Trump has aggressively responded"" to the coronavirus.
The Democratic debate about whether it is politically smart to attack Mr. Trump with paid advertising mirrors an argument that often plays out when there is a natural disaster or major international event during a presidential campaign: Are voters ready to critique the White House's handling of an incident, or will they view it as a callous pivot to politics at a time of nationwide anxiety?
Two strategists who led Barack Obama's presidential campaigns engaged in that familiar argument on Twitter last week, prompting some Democrats to take sides.
David Axelrod said there would be plenty of time for voters to judge Mr. Trump's handling of the crisis, ""but now doesn't seem the moment for negative ads."" That
prompted disagreement
from David Plouffe.
""Using Trump's own words and actions to remind people of his failures while he tries to rewrite history is essential,"" Mr. Plouffe wrote. ""And his campaign will spend whatever it takes to create their own reality of his 'perfect' response. Can't disarm.""
Pete Giangreco, a Democratic strategist who worked for Sen. Amy Klobuchar's presidential campaign as well as on the Obama campaigns, said he agrees more with Mr. Plouffe than Mr. Axelrod on the question.
""This is a time when facts matter, and if you are amplifying facts, in this case, the president's own words, I think that is part of the dialogue,"" he said. ""Governors of both parties have been leaders on this and the White House has followed.""
Democratic strategist Tad Devine, who has worked for Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, said he's ""more in the Axelrod camp"" on the question of attacking the president now with paid ads.
""You do have to be very careful about how this thing is handled,"" he said. ""Trump can lead you down a path you don't want to go.""
Mr. Devine said going negative in television ads tends to get much more attention than doing so online. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and the Democratic Governors Association have both recently released digital ads going after Mr. Trump over his response to the virus.
Television ads that make mention of the crisis or are completely focused on the topic are also popping up in local, state and congressional campaigns.
In one that first ran over the weekend in Kentucky, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's re-election campaign says he's ""at the center of the battle to rush aid to Americans,"" before suggesting his Democratic challenger, Amy McGrath, ""fuels fears with lies"" about the outbreak.
Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, a Republican facing a challenging re-election bid, pushes bipartisanship in a recent ad and explains that she won't be campaigning during the crisis.
A Republican doctor running for Congress in southwest Florida, William Figlesthaler, is using a campaign ad to try to drive traffic to a website his campaign created about the virus that also prominently lists his name.
Even though the ads are running at a time when many Americans are home and watching TV and computer screens more than usual, it is hard to know whether they will break through. TV ads that touch on the outbreak have also run in Georgia, Illinois, Montana, New York, Ohio and West Virginia, data from ad-tracking firm Kantar/CMAG shows. Collectively, they have run more than 2,800 times at an estimated total cost of $1.1 million, not counting those broadcast on the topic by billionaire Michael Bloomberg before he left the Democratic presidential nomination race.
Advertising experts say the numbers are certain to grow, because the pandemic is becoming the central
topic of this year's political campaigns
. Even local candidates are leaning into the issue.
An ad for a county commission candidate in Ohio flashes a global map showing the spread of the virus at the start of a 30-second spot, before delving into more routine topics like infrastructure. ""These days, there's plenty to worry about, but you shouldn't have to worry about a piece of bridge falling on your head,"" Democrat Connie Pillich says to the camera.

WASHINGTON—With a
China trade deal
signed and a new North American deal
passed by Congress
, the European Union stands out as the big U.S. trading partner unable to reach a significant trade pact with the Trump administration.
As the White House contemplates the next steps of its trade agenda, the EU suddenly finds itself, rather than China, under the most urgent threat of tariffs, and under the most pressure to negotiate.
The U.S. Trade Representative has prepared two sets of tariffs aimed at Europe: one in retaliation for a French digital-services tax, another because it says Europe hasn't done enough to end subsidies of the aircraft manufacturer Airbus SE. In addition, the administration has never abandoned the idea, first floated nearly two years ago, of imposing tariffs on the European automobile industry.
""The Europeans should take the U.S. concerns very seriously and should recognize there is a possibility that the president will go forward with aggressive action if he feels the facts justify him doing so,"" said Stephen Vaughn, a partner at King & Spalding and formerly the general counsel under U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.
The new European Commission, the EU's executive branch, has stepped up efforts to find common ground with the U.S. since taking office in December. The EU's newly appointed trade commissioner, Phil Hogan, made his inaugural visit to Washington this week for meetings with Mr. Lighthizer, other top administration officials and members of Congress.
Up next, President Trump and Mr. Lighthizer are planning to meet the new European Commission president, Ursula Von Der Leyen, and Mr. Hogan on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland next week.
Mr. Hogan's visit to Washington included a modest breakthrough: The EU, U.S. and Japan completed a proposal, largely aimed at China, to ban four types of subsidies under World Trade Organization rules. Mr. Hogan touted the deal as an example of Europe's willingness to cooperate.
""The European Union and the United States should work together on a positive agenda on trade, and we should also work together on dealing with the difficult issues in terms of unfair competition from some countries around the world, particularly China,"" Mr. Hogan told The Wall Street Journal.
Washington and Brussels announced formal talks in July 2018, after an Oval Office meeting between Mr. Trump and then-European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. But the framework left agricultural tariffs outside the scope of discussion, and negotiations have yet to make much progress in nearly 18 months.
""The fact that the European Union has refused to engage with us on agriculture has made it very difficult to have productive conversations,"" said Mr. Vaughn.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
How confident are you in President Trump's ability to renegotiate a better trade deal with the European Union? Join the conversation below.
As part of his bid to reset relations, Mr. Hogan, an Irish farmer, politician, and formerly Europe's agricultural commissioner,
has emphasized Europe's willingness to negotiate
agricultural issues, but not agricultural tariffs. He has touted an agreement in 2019 that allows more U.S. beef exports to Europe, as well as a regulatory change allowing U.S. soybeans to be used in European biofuels, helping boost exports of one of Mr. Trump's favored crops.
But the EU remains at odds with the Trump administration on many issues.
It has criticized the nature of the U.S.-China trade deal, which relies on a commitment by China to purchase large and specific amounts of U.S. exports, a break from traditional trade agreements which have attempted to open markets so that private companies can freely make decisions on how much to import and export, based on what their businesses need.
The EU has also been dismayed at one of the other major trade fights that has carried into 2020. In December, the U.S. crippled the top court at the World Trade Organization by blocking the appointment of judges until the court no longer had a quorum to operate.
""We ought to have fair rules and disciplines under the World Trade Organization structure that allows everybody to have a competitive opportunity around the world,"" said Mr. Hogan. ""We don't agree with the approach that leads to managed trade.""
Also ahead for the U.S. trade agenda in 2020: With the conclusion of Brexit, the U.K. and U.S. share a desire to rapidly negotiate a formal free-trade agreement.
Brexit negotiations represent a complication with the EU as well, which will still be attempting to negotiate trade terms with the U.K.
""The EU and the U.S. both are negotiating a free-trade agreement with the U.K., it will be an interesting affair to see how each uses the U.K. to its advantage,"" said Nicole Bivens Collinson, the president of international trade and government relations at the law firm Sandler, Travis & Rosenberg. ""So I still see turmoil ahead for the U.S-EU relationship in 2020.""
For any formal trade agreements that require congressional approval, Mr. Trump has significant time constraints. Election years complicate efforts to build the bipartisan coalitions needed to enact trade deals.
After the election, the authority needed to get trade agreements through Congress without amendments or procedural delays is set to expire in the middle of 2021.
Reauthorizing what is known as fast-track or trade-promotion authority is itself a major undertaking that would require a president to lay out plans for trade agreements and debate provisions ranging from currency manipulation to climate change.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. officials have informed Sen. Bernie Sanders that Russia is actively trying to support his campaign for the Democratic nomination as part of Moscow's broader efforts to interfere in the 2020 election, according to two people familiar with the matter.
President Trump and a small number of lawmakers have been briefed on the same intelligence, the people said.
The classified FBI briefing wasn't of the type routinely given to presidential campaigns about election security, those people said. It was given in reaction to intelligence considered compelling enough that Mr. Sanders needed to be alerted, one of the people said. But the intelligence suggested that the Russian effort to bolster Mr. Sanders hasn't approached the scale or scope of operations to support Mr. Trump's campaign in 2016, the person said.
The Washington Post earlier reported Mr. Sanders received a briefing that Russia was seeking to support him in the primary.
Speaking to reporters Friday, Mr. Sanders acknowledged a briefing had taken place but said it wasn't clear what role Russia was attempting to play in the election.
""We were told that Russia and maybe other countries were getting involved in the campaign,"" Mr. Sanders told reporters in Bakersfield, Calif. ""And look, here is the message to Russia, 'Stay out of the American election.'""
Mr. Sanders, who has been criticized for online vitriol some of his supporters have directed against his opponents, also said in a statement that it was possible ""ugly stuff"" that has been attributed to his campaign was actually coming from fake internet accounts.
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security declined to comment.
The reports emerged a month after the briefing on the day before the Nevada caucuses. Mr. Sanders is currently leading his Democratic rivals in national polls following a first-place finish in the New Hampshire primary this month, and polls suggested he was positioned for a strong finish in Nevada.
""I'll let you guess, about one day before the Nevada caucuses, why do you think it came out?"" Mr. Sanders asked.
Last week, intelligence officials told President Trump and lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee about Russia's apparent preference to have Mr. Trump re-elected, according to people familiar with the matter. During an Oval Office meeting Mr. Trump lashed out at Joseph Maguire, his acting director of national intelligence until he was replaced this week, because he was irate that lawmakers received the information first, the people said.

WASHINGTON—The House delivered two articles of impeachment against President Trump to the Senate on Wednesday, after voting to
approve seven Democratic managers
to prosecute the case before the Republican-controlled chamber.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that she stressed litigation experience in choosing managers to handle the trial over alleged presidential abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Senators are expected to be sworn in on Thursday, and the proceedings are scheduled to get under way in earnest on Tuesday.
""The emphasis is making the strongest possible case to protect and defend our Constitution, to seek the truth for the American people,"" Mrs. Pelosi (D., Calif.) said.
""President Trump has done nothing wrong,"" White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said, adding that he ""expects to be fully exonerated.""
The managers aim to advance Democrats' arguments that Mr. Trump should be removed from office. The group comprises House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York, Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff of California, Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Reps. Zoe Lofgren of California, Val Demings of Florida, Sylvia Garcia of Texas and Jason Crow of Colorado.
After a brief debate, the House approved the managers, 228 to 193, almost entirely along party lines. One Democrat, Rep. Collin Peterson of Minnesota, broke with the party and voted against the resolution. He had also opposed both articles of impeachment. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan, an independent who left the GOP last year, supported the resolution.
The Democratic-led House
voted to impeach Mr. Trump
last month. The first article of impeachment stems from Mr. Trump
pressing Ukraine to investigate
former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading candidate for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, including by
withholding almost $400 million in aid
to help Kyiv combat Russian aggression. The second article accuses Mr. Trump of impeding Congress's investigation by preventing witnesses from testifying and defying subpoenas for documentary evidence.
After the House impeached Mr. Trump, Mrs. Pelosi held off on naming the managers for nearly a month, as Democrats unsuccessfully sought guarantees from Senate Republicans that new witnesses would be heard and new evidence presented. She relented this week, after Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) ratcheted up the pressure on her by signing on to a resolution to dismiss the case.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What's your assessment of the managers picked to oversee the impeachment trial? Join the conversation below.
House Democratic leaders argue the delay paid off, as new emails and documents related to the case emerged in recent weeks, as well as documents showing the effort to undermine the then-U.S. ambassador to the country.
""It made sense to wait a while, as even more evidence piled up, but we have to proceed, because…the integrity of the election is at stake,"" said Mr. Nadler, referring to the November presidential election.
The White House doesn't believe there is a need to hear witness testimony in the Senate trial, a senior administration official said. The official said the White House considers it ""extraordinarily unlikely"" that the trial would last longer than two weeks.
But several Republican senators, including Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, have said they would be open to hearing from new witnesses, and Mr. McConnell has ruled out a quick dismissal of the case.
Witnesses sought by Democrats
include former national security adviser John Bolton and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, who were directed by the White House not to testify before the House inquiry.
Votes on witnesses and documents could extend the trial beyond the two-week time frame, potentially extending it through the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 3—the first nominating contest in the 2020 Democratic presidential race—and Mr. Trump's State of the Union address, scheduled for Feb. 4.
""If people decide they want to call witnesses, it probably could go on for a while,"" Sen. John Thune (R., S.D.), the No. 2 Senate Republican, said on Tuesday. He said that wrapping up the trial by Mr. Trump's State of the Union address ""seems like a fairly tight deadline given what we are facing.""

Republican senators briefed on a GOP draft of rules for the trial said it likely will include
a guaranteed vote on witnesses
and documents after opening arguments and a period for written questions. Moderate Republicans had been pushing for such a vote, putting them at odds with Mr. Trump, who recently renewed his call to dismiss the articles without a trial.
Some GOP senators are pushing reciprocity of witnesses, so that if Democrats hear from Mr. Bolton, Republicans would push to hear from Mr. Biden's son, Hunter Biden, according to a person familiar with the matter. The younger Mr. Biden served on the board of a Ukrainian energy company that Mr. Trump asked Ukraine's leader to investigate—one of the acts at the center of the House's impeachment case.
""If [Democrats] end up getting witnesses, I'm going to insist there be a motion that the president gets to call anybody deemed to be necessary to his defense,"" said Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) in an interview.
Both Bidens have denied any wrongdoing, and in the Democratic debate Tuesday night, Joe Biden called allegations from Mr. Trump and his allies ""flat-out lies.""
Mrs. Pelosi signed the articles of impeachment in a ceremony at the Capitol on Wednesday. Flanked by the leaders of several House committees and the impeachment managers, she again laid out the case for impeaching Mr. Trump, accusing him of abusing his oath of office and obstructing Congress. She then sat to formally sign the articles of impeachment, cycling through about a dozen pens emblazoned with her name as she did so, and finally handing one of the pens to each of the lawmakers gathered. She kept one for herself.
The House's clerk and the sergeant at arms, accompanied by all seven Democratic impeachment managers, then walked the articles to the Senate, along with a message that the House has appointed managers to exhibit the articles of impeachment.
In the Senate chamber, the camera flashes first came into view through the filigreed windows of the Senate door. At 5:34 p.m., the procession of seven House Democrats appeared at the door, met by Laura Dove, secretary for the Republicans, who signaled the group to head to the back wall.
The managers entered, single file, and walked to their places. At their desks inside the chamber, 27 Senate Democrats sat in their seats. Mr. McConnell and Sen. Kevin Cramer (R., N.D.) were in the room to bear witness.
""Mr. President, a message from the House of Representatives,"" Ms. Dove told Sen. Chuck Grassley (R., Iowa), the Senate's president pro tempore, who presided over the chamber.
Mr. McConnell acknowledged the message and said the Senate will receive the managers to present the articles of impeachment at noon Thursday.
""This is a difficult time for our country, but this is precisely the kind of time for which the framers created the Senate,"" he said.
On Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts, who will preside over the trial, is to be sworn in by Mr. Grassley. Mr. Roberts is then expected to administer the same oath, to do ""impartial justice,"" to all 100 senators, who will act as the jury. At least two-thirds of the senators would have to vote to convict Mr. Trump to remove him from office.
Mr. Trump will be summoned and given time to respond. Then the Senate is expected to break for the holiday weekend before reconvening to start the trial.
Proposed restrictions on press access during the trial have become a point of contention, with fewer ways for reporters to speak to senators and increased security within the Senate Press Gallery.

President Trump's 2020 election strategy relies largely on the white, working-class base that he excited in 2016. But he faces a demographic challenge: The electorate has changed since he was last on the ballot in ways likely to benefit Democrats.
Working-class, white voters are projected to decline by 2.3 percentage points nationally as a share of eligible voters, compared with the last election, because they are older and therefore dying at a faster rate than are Democratic groups. As those voters pass on, they are most likely to be replaced by those from minority groups or young, white voters with college degrees—groups that lean Democratic.
That means Mr. Trump will have to coax more votes from a shrinking base—or else find more votes in other parts of the electorate.
""Trump has a certain hill to climb, and this suggests that the hill gets a little steeper,'' said Ruy Teixeira, a demographer with the States of Change project, which provided assessments of the 2020 electorate.
The project is a joint venture of think tanks with different ideological leanings: the liberal Center for American Progress, where Mr. Teixeira works; the center-left Brookings Institution; the Bipartisan Policy Center; and the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, which includes participants from across the political spectrum.
While analysts say Mr. Trump will likely have to boost turnout from his core voters to counter demographic change, they also say the task is achievable. They cite Mr. Trump's strong connection to his base, as well as signs that the turnout in the fall is on track to set records, given that the president has driven up engagement among both parties.

""Demography creates the backdrop for the play. But it doesn't determine the outcome of the play,'' said Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster whose clients have included GOP Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.
Tim Murtaugh, communications director for the Trump re-election campaign, said Mr. Trump was reaching out to voters from all backgrounds, and that he had better tools than in 2016 to draw supporters to the polls.
""The voter data we have is unsurpassed, and we have maintained contact and built our voter list by tens of millions of names.…Our ability to contact and turn out the president's supporters will really be unmatched in presidential campaign history,'' he said.
The analysis by States of Change doesn't take into account myriad factors that can swing any election, including who may switch parties or whether turnout will rise or fall. It offers a starting point for assessing the 2020 electorate by looking only at changes in who will be eligible to vote on Nov. 3—who has entered and who has exited the electorate.
Projections by Mr. Teixeira and his colleagues find that the declining presence of working-class whites as eligible voters, if considered in isolation from other factors, would be enough to tip Michigan and Pennsylvania from narrow Trump wins into narrow Democratic wins, while producing the barest of margins in favor of Democrats in Wisconsin. Mr. Trump won each state by less than 1 percentage point, or a combined 77,000 votes.
Projected changes in the eligible electorate, holding other factors the same as in the last election, also narrow Mr. Trump's winning 2016 margin in three swing states in the Sunbelt analyzed by States of Change: Arizona, Florida and North Carolina.
""Demographic change is making all six of these states closer,'' Mr. Teixeira said.
If he were to rely on working-class, white voters to make up the ground he loses to demographic change, Mr. Trump would need to raise turnout among that group by 3 percentage points in Pennsylvania and Michigan and one point in Wisconsin, a Wall Street Journal analysis of the States of Change projections finds.
The Trump campaign already has a record of boosting turnout among voters without four-year college degrees, a common definition of working-class voters, who are white. Turnout among the group rose by 2.5 percentage points in 2016 compared with the prior presidential election, States of Change has calculated. That was a bigger turnout increase than among white voters with college degrees or among other ethnic or racial groups.
Moreover, the Trump campaign has the deeper well to draw upon. Analyst David Wasserman calculated that 23 million white men without college degrees—a group that leans strongly toward the GOP—sat out the 2016 election, compared with 5 million white women with college degrees, a group that leans strongly Democratic.
""I'd say that's quite a bit of upside for Trump,"" said Mr. Wasserman, of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.

Democrats hope they can build a winning coalition not only by drawing more votes from college-educated, white voters but by boosting turnout among minority groups. Turnout among African-American voters fell by nearly 5 percentage points in 2016 compared with 2012.
Mr. Murtaugh, of the Trump campaign, said that many of those minority voters would be backing the president. ""The fact is, the president's record and his policies appeal to a wide swath of Americans,"" he said. ""His support is rising in the black community, in the Latino community. Our online, small donations are about 50% from women. And so the idea that the president has this core group of voters, and that's it, is false.""
A look at some of the most competitive battlegrounds for 2020 shows that the challenge of strengthening turnout varies by state.
In Pennsylvania, every county recorded more votes for president in 2016 than in 2012, but turnout was particularly strong in some counties with lots of white, working-class voters. In Luzerne County, home to Wilkes-Barre, the number of presidential votes grew by 9%, compared with 7% statewide. Mr. Trump won 58% of the vote, 11 points higher than the Republican nominee in 2012.
Maintaining those high margins in blue-collar counties is important to Mr. Trump's prospects. It is one reason he and Vice President Mike Pence have held campaign rallies in such counties, including Luzerne.
In Wisconsin, by contrast, vote production was down in 51 of the state's 72 counties, and so increasing turnout is a top goal for both parties.
One unanswered question is whether Mr. Trump, by showing in 2016 that he can boost turnout among his core voters, is positioned to do it again—or whether Americans still sitting on the sidelines feel so distant from politics that they can't be pulled to the polls.
Drawing nonvoters into the electorate is difficult, Mr. Ayres said. ""But it is still a substantial source of votes in a country where just over 55% to 60% of eligible voters actually turn out for presidential elections.""

U.S. talks with China to complete a first-stage trade deal had hit an impasse around Thanksgiving,
raising fears a nascent accord would collapse again
—and with it, hope for a halt to the nearly
two-year-old trade war
.
Looking for a direct route to the president, Chinese Ambassador Cui Tiankai spoke with President Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, say people familiar with the episode. The U.S. offer didn't roll back enough tariffs, he told Mr. Kushner.
It was time to settle, Mr. Kushner responded. If not, on Dec. 15 the president was ready to proceed with new tariffs on about $156 billion in Chinese imports, including smartphones and toys. ""Don't think in terms of tariff reduction,"" he advised. ""Think in terms of what will happen if you don't make a deal.""
To Chinese negotiators dealing with a president they considered erratic, Mr. Kushner's words at least offered certainty, say the people familiar with episode. They also recognized an opportunity: The agreement wouldn't force them to make
economic-policy changes Washington
had long insisted on.
About two weeks later,
both sides announced the compromise
set to be signed at a White House ceremony Wednesday. ""This is an attempt to work together and solve problems,"" says Clete Willems, a former Trump White House trade negotiator who had worked on China issues. ""It's not everything the U.S. set out to do.""
Adds a Beijing regulator who has knowledge of the negotiations: ""Hopefully, this deal can help prevent the bilateral relationship from getting much worse.""

The accord promises
increased purchases of U.S. goods and services, greater access for American firms to China's banking, insurance and other financial sectors, an end to tariff threats—and a chance to reset relations between the world's largest economies. The two sides also have
agreed to semiannual meetings
to discuss trade and economic issues.
Even so, the deal isn't what either side said it had wanted. The U.S. doesn't get the fundamental reforms in Chinese economic policy it sought to help American businesses. And levies remain on about $370 billion of China's exports.
Two days before Christmas, Chinese leader Xi Jinping dined with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at the Great Hall of the People, where Mr. Abe said he hoped the so-called phase-one deal would encourage China to liberalize its economy further, say people familiar with the exchange.
China has already opened up significantly, replied Mr. Xi, trumpeting a
World Bank survey
showing China's improved business environment. ""It's good to have the phase-one agreement,"" he said, but added many issues remained unresolved and a deal ""can't solve everything.""
Trump on a warpath
This account of how the limited deal came together is based on interviews with policy makers in both capitals and people who have been consulted on the negotiations, and reveals the little-seen pragmatic side of a publicly fraught relationship.
As Washington and Beijing sweltered last summer, Mr. Trump was losing patience. Outraged that Beijing hadn't come through with what he claimed were promised purchases of soybeans and other commodities, he threatened in August to raise tariffs on half of what China sells the U.S. and impose new tariffs on the other half. China, denying it made a purchase promise, retaliated by suspending buying U.S. farm products.
The president
took to Twitter on Aug. 23
and ""hereby ordered"" U.S. firms ""to start immediately looking for an alternative to China, including bringing…your companies HOME.""
By September, both sides wanted to pull back from the brink. In Washington, a succession of CEOs paid calls on Mr. Trump and his economic advisers, warning of the tariff battle's dangers.
After the president's tweet, Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas Sands Corp. CEO who contributed $20 million to Mr. Trump's presidential campaign and whose Macau casinos depend on Chinese goodwill,
warned the president
new tariffs would hurt the economy and Mr. Trump's re-election chances by increasing consumer prices.
Mr. Trump had long claimed China was paying the cost of tariffs. Executives from Best Buy Co. were among those pointing out the burden falls on U.S. businesses and customers. A spokesman for Mr. Adelson confirmed his lobbying. Best Buy declined to comment.
Share Your Thoughts
How far should the U.S. go in compromising with China on trade? Join the conversation below.
Beijing, which worried about the trade war's impact on its economy, also signaled through U.S. business representatives that it wanted to negotiate. For China's leaders, 2019 was supposed to focus on celebrating on Oct. 1, the 70th anniversary of Communist Party rule and its success in lifting hundreds of millions from poverty. Instead, the trade war threatened to tank the economy, as
unrest in Hong Kong and other challenges
highlighted Mr. Xi's domestic problems.
Premier Li Keqiang and other top officials stressed to visiting American executives the importance of engagement to help prevent tensions from spinning out of control, figuring they would relay those views to the White House.
By mid-September, China was cracking down on shipments of the addictive drug fentanyl, a Trump priority. It also said it would exempt some U.S. soybeans and pork from tariffs. The U.S. responded by delaying tariff increases.
Best deal available
Behind the scenes, the U.S. also was debating how to compromise. Mr. Trump had long instructed his chief negotiator, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, to get a ""great deal."" Now, Mr. Lighthizer was after the best deal available.
In May, the U.S. and China had been close to a comprehensive agreement. But it would have required China to change as many as 60 laws and regulations covering intellectual property, regulatory review panels, financial services and other areas.
It fell apart
when China's lead negotiator, Vice Premier Liu He, couldn't get the top leadership approval.
Deal Points
Highlights of the U.S.-China trade deal as described by U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and his staff; Chinese officials haven't yet given a detailed summation.
* Buy American: Beijing to ramp up purchases of U.S. goods and services by at least $200 billion over the next two years, using 2017 as a benchmark.
* Tariff relief: The U.S. to cut the tariff rate in half—from 15% to 7.5%—on levies it imposed Sept. 1 on roughly $120 billion in Chinese products, including shoes and apparel. The U.S. also agreed not to impose tariffs of 15% on roughly $156 billion in consumer products.
* Technology transfer: China to stop forcing foreign companies to transfer technology to Chinese companies as a condition for market access.
* Intellectual property: Unspecified measures to address intellectual property concerns.
* Financial services: Removal of barriers to help U.S. banking, insurance and other financial services companies expand in China.
* Currency measures: Measures aimed at stopping China from devaluing its currency.
* Dispute resolution: An arrangement for both sides to resolve disputes through consultations.
Mr. Lighthizer, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin now sought to ""pocket the gains,"" as they called it, from prior negotiations even if that meant jettisoning for now demands for China to eliminate subsidies and revamp state-owned firms.
They counseled Mr. Trump to show restraint. During Oval Office meetings in August, the president had threatened to double to 50% the tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods. In the past, Mr. Lighthizer had urged him to increase rates to pressure China. Now, he joined the other two to persuade the president to threaten just a 5-percentage-point increase—as a warning to Beijing but small enough it wouldn't disrupt negotiations. The president
later delayed
putting the increase into effect.
""Bob Lighthizer isn't an ideologue. He is a realist,"" says former Trump strategist Stephen Bannon. ""His client wanted a deal, as good a deal as you could get to close.""
Negotiators on both sides started exploring a settlement with different phases, the first focused on agriculture purchases and other less contentious issues. That had long been China's strategy. Since 2018, Chinese negotiators had pushed what they called a 40-40-20 plan: They said 40% of American demands were doable because they involved reforms China planned anyway, 40% were negotiable and 20% were off-limits, impinging on national security.
Mr. Lighthizer and other negotiators had earlier privately derided the effort because Beijing categorized as off-limits issues the U.S. considered priorities. That included further opening China's cloud-computing market. Now the U.S. essentially was ready to accept China's framework.
Chinese negotiators focused on three areas important to the U.S. team, starting with increased purchases of U.S. farm goods—a priority of Mr. Trump's. China had largely stopped buying U.S. crops to retaliate against tariffs, hitting his supporters in farm states.
Beijing also offered compromises on the deal's enforcement, a priority for Mr. Lighthizer, and financial liberalization, an issue for Mr. Mnuchin.
When Mr. Kudlow sketched out a possible deal for Mr. Trump in early October, the president responded, ""I could be for that,"" though he wanted to see what the Chinese offered.
The two teams of negotiators met Oct. 10 at Washington's Metropolitan Club, a Lighthizer haunt, going over the outline of a deal. The next day, the president invited Mr. Liu into the Oval Office and with television cameras present announced what he called a ""tremendous"" deal.
""I'd suggest the farmers have to go and immediately buy more land and get bigger tractors,"" he said. Beijing would buy $40 billion to $50 billion annually in agricultural products, he said, about twice what it has ever bought from the U.S. Mr. Liu didn't contradict him but didn't confirm the claim.
Both sides wrangled over deal details during videoconferences over the next two months. Chinese negotiators continued to insist on what they called a balanced deal, not wanting to be seen as caving to foreign pressure.
To that end, enforcement provisions were relabeled ""bilateral assessment and dispute settlement,"" according to Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency. That put the emphasis on planned consultations to settle disputes rather than U.S. insistence it could impose tariffs if unsatisfied.
Beijing also wanted the U.S. to roll back tariffs sharply. Again, Chinese negotiators divided U.S. demands into hundreds of items and calculated their offer covered 72% of the demands, which they argued should be matched by commensurate tariff reduction.
No way, Mr. Lighthizer responded, the Chinese offer was worth maybe half that. On Oct. 31, the president tweeted their offer covered 60%.
Back and forth went the argument over percentages. Mr. Lighthizer offered to cut 15% tariffs on $120 billion of Chinese imports to 10% and drop plans to impose new tariffs. That represented the first U.S. offer to scale back tariffs since the trade battle started. But it left 25% tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese imports, about half what China sold to the U.S. Mr. Xi wanted all tariffs eliminated or at least a schedule to reach zero tariffs.
The Chinese ambassador relied on Mr. Kushner for a better read on what Mr. Trump wanted. To Beijing, Mr. Kushner was a trusted intermediary who had helped arrange a
Mar-a-Lago summit between Messrs. Xi and Trump
a few months after the president's inauguration.
After listening to Mr. Kushner's counsel, the Chinese side was ready to settle if Mr. Lighthizer approved one more compromise—reduce the 15% tariffs to 7.5% instead of 10%. Both sides could live with that and worked to clear remaining issues.
The U.S. side was exultant and started providing deal details on Dec. 12.
Beijing's silence
The Chinese side was silent. The following workday in Beijing, none of China's state-owned media outlets or government agencies commented on the negotiations.
First, Mr. Xi had to approve the deal, which he did. Then, Beijing had to decide how to spin the agreement to fend off any domestic criticism China made too many concessions.
Near midnight Dec. 13 in Beijing, about 90 minutes after Mr. Trump tweeted the sides
had reached ""an amazing deal,""
a half dozen vice ministers held a rare press conference. They confirmed the deal but didn't give details.
Negotiations continued, particularly over how to translate the text into Chinese, which could give Beijing wiggle room on commitments. China's state media has stayed largely quiet about the deal.
""Because of the remaining uncertainty, we're being told to be standing by,"" said a senior editor at a state-owned news agency in Beijing. ""But no news is good news,"" the editor added. ""It shows the top leader here wants to get it done.""
Before heading to a New Year's Eve celebration at Mar-a-Lago, Mr. Trump told reporters he would head to Beijing in 2020 for talks on a second-phase deal and hinted Mr. Xi might travel to the U.S.—a suggestion the president had made before.
Beijing didn't confirm any travel plans. Chinese diplomats say their priority is preparing for Mr. Xi's planned state visit to Japan this spring.
The U.S. is counting on remaining tariffs to compel Beijing to continue negotiating and agree to economic-policy changes. Failing that, Washington could use other pressure points, such as limiting the ability of Chinese firms to list shares in U.S. markets.
Still, Chinese officials feel they have little to gain from a phase-two deal forcing Beijing to ease state control of the economy, and Mr. Trump recently said that a phase-two agreement probably wouldn't conclude until after the Nov. 3 election. The Chinese government continues to plan for a future where the two economies would be less intertwined and China would develop technology rather than rely on American imports.
When Mr. Xi met with a group of foreign luminaries including former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson in a November forum in Beijing, say attendees, he told them: ""We did not start the trade war, but we won't flinch from confrontation.…Why should we change policies that are working?""

WASHINGTON—House Democrats argued that President Trump's efforts to press Ukraine to launch investigations that could help him politically warranted his removal from office, saying during the first day of
opening arguments in the impeachment trial
that his actions undercut U.S. elections and national security.
Rep. Adam Schiff, the lead impeachment manager and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, laid out the allegations underpinning the two articles of impeachment
passed by the House last month
. The first stems from Mr. Trump pressing Ukraine to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden, a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate. The second accuses Mr. Trump of impeding Congress's investigation by blocking some witnesses and documents.
""Over the coming days, you will hear remarkably consistent evidence of President Trump's corrupt scheme and coverup,"" Mr. Schiff (D., Calif.) said, standing at a lectern on the Senate floor. ""There is no serious dispute about the facts underlying the president's conduct.""
Mr. Trump, a Republican, maintains he did nothing wrong and has called the impeachment a hoax driven by politics.
The Democrats, in laying out their case, continued to try to persuade Republicans to support calling new witnesses and documents, which Democrats argue will provide more details about Mr. Trump's interactions with top aides, including former national security adviser John Bolton and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney.
Mr. Trump's legal team argues that Democrats don't have a strong case, saying that weakness is why the prosecutors seek more witnesses. They will be able to counter after the Democratic team finishes its three days of arguments.
Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow said that the team plans to ""challenge aggressively"" Democrats' case. ""There's a lot of things I'd like to rebut and we will rebut,"" he said.
Speaking at a news conference at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Trump said he was sympathetic toward the idea of a longer Senate trial with witness testimony, but didn't budge on his position regarding several witnesses sought by Democrats.
""I would rather go the long way. I would rather interview Bolton. I would rather interview a lot of people,"" he said. But he added that testimony from Mr. Bolton, as well as that of Mr. Mulvaney, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Energy Secretary Rick Perry, would pose national security concerns.
The White House had instructed many witnesses, including Mr. Bolton, not to testify in the House probe. Any new witnesses would have to be deposed privately before they could testify before the Senate.
A Democratic aide working on the impeachment inquiry said the House managers planned to fill the 24 hours allotted to them under the rules, though didn't elaborate on how.
As part of his presentation, Mr. Schiff played a clip of Mr. Mulvaney from October 2019 in which Mr. Mulvaney said, ""Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy."" Mr. Mulvaney made the comment while answering reporters' questions related to
the administration's freeze on aid to Ukraine.
Democrats have said the freeze was part of a quid pro quo for Ukraine launching investigations into Mr. Biden.
""Should we just get over it?"" Mr. Schiff asked the senators. ""Is that what we've come to? I hope and pray that the answer is no.""
Mr. Schiff argued that the senators needed to take action now, or they risk setting a precedent that could undermine future elections and the U.S.'s global standing while bolstering autocrats such as President Vladimir Putin of Russia.
""What message will we send if we choose not to hold this president accountable for his abuse of power, to solicit re-election interference in our upcoming election?"" He added: ""We have for generations been the shining city upon a hill that President Reagan described…but what worth is that idea if when tried we do not affirm the values that underpin it?""
House managers laid out the chronology of the Democrats' case, playing video clips of administration officials who testified in the House investigation about the president's push for investigations and the hold on nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. The aid later was released after bipartisan pressure in Congress.
Just before 2 a.m. Wednesday, the Senate passed a resolution in a 53-47 vote along party lines setting the structure for the trial, which doesn't include guarantees for new witnesses or documents to be subpoenaed.
Democrats still hope to win over at least four votes to seek subpoenas later in the trial. Some GOP lawmakers have said they are open to new witnesses, but they want to wait until after the Democrats and Mr. Trump's legal team have made their cases.
Headed into their opening arguments, Republicans said they were taken aback by comments from House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D., N.Y.), who, while arguing for a Democratic amendment to the trial rules, said in the early hours Wednesday that senators who voted against allowing witnesses were ""complicit in the president's coverup.""
""I was offended; I took it as very offensive as one who is listening attentively and working hard to get to a fair process,"" said Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska,), whose support Democrats likely will need to call new evidence.
Mr. Schiff tried to tamp down the controversy. As he opened his presentation, he thanked Chief Justice John Roberts, who is presiding over the trial, and the senators for their patience in listening to the case the previous evening and tried to anew to appeal to Republicans.
""If the senators are serious about wanting to learn all the facts, if the president's team wants to contest any of the facts, these documents and witnesses will need to be produced,"" he said.
Democratic senators' next chance to push for witnesses will likely be at the end of next week. After opening arguments by each side, senators will get 16 hours for questions. After that, there will be a pivotal vote on whether the Senate wants fresh testimony or new evidence.
Some Republicans have pushed the idea that for every possible witness that Democrats want to call the GOP would call in a witness of their own. That could include Mr. Biden or his son Hunter, who Republicans have criticized for serving on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company while his father was the Obama administration's point man for combating Ukrainian corruption. The Bidens have denied any wrongdoing.
The former vice president said he opposed the idea of testifying in order to call Republicans' bluff and potentially get a witness that Democrats want. ""I don't think they've got much gas in the tank to begin with,"" Mr. Biden said, adding that he doesn't want the process to ""turn into a farce.""
It takes 67 votes for the Senate to remove a president from office, a threshold that wasn't reached in the two previous impeachment trials that went to a vote, involving Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson. It is highly unlikely to happen this time with Republicans holding 53 seats.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
What do you hope to see happen during the impeachment trial? Join the conversation below.
In his presentation, Mr. Schiff also took on another aspect of the impeachment fight, arguing that a president can be impeached for an action that doesn't amount to a criminal offense. Many of Mr. Trump's allies disagree, saying an abuse-of-office charge amounts to overreach by Congress.
""This idea that you can use abuse of power as a grab bag in which to stuff all your political policy or personal grievances, I think is very dangerous,"" said Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas).
Starting at 1 p.m. Thursday, the Senate will meet again to hear House managers present their arguments for why Mr. Trump should be removed from office. The managers are set to present their case for eight hours.

Ukrainian authorities opened a criminal probe into whether the U.S. ambassador to Ukraine was put under surveillance by American citizens, as text messages made public this week suggest, before she was removed from her post last year.
The messages about Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch were among materials involving an associate of Rudy Giuliani, President Trump's lawyer,
released by House Democrats
as part of the impeachment probe into the president. Those messages and prime-time television interviews by the associate, Lev Parnas, reverberated in Washington on Thursday as the Senate opened the impeachment trial.
Democrats began weighing whether to call Mr. Parnas as a witness either in the Senate trial or in another proceeding, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) describing him as a credible witness.

Trump Impeachment Trial Begins

Republicans, meanwhile, worked to challenge that notion, noting Mr. Parnas's arrest in October on charges of campaign-finance violations, to which he pleaded not guilty.
Mr. Parnas assisted Mr. Giuliani as he sought to pressure Ukraine to undertake investigations that would politically benefit Mr. Trump—an effort that helped set off the impeachment inquiry. Mr. Trump has called the inquiry a politically motivated hoax.
In an interview Wednesday with MSNBC, Mr. Parnas tied Mr. Trump to his efforts to get Ukrainian officials to open probes into alleged election interference and into Democrat Joe Biden and his son.
Ukrainian authorities said Thursday they were investigating possible surveillance of Ms. Yovanovitch. Text messages released by Democrats showed Robert F. Hyde, a Trump backer and Republican congressional candidate in Connecticut, telling Mr. Parnas he was monitoring the ambassador's movements.
Share Your Thoughts
What could the Ukraine probe uncover that hasn't been disclosed in previous investigations? Join the conversation below.
Ukraine's Interior Ministry said it would ""investigate whether there were any violations of Ukrainian and international laws…or [if it was] just bravado and fake talk in an informal conversation between two U.S. citizens.""
""Ukraine cannot ignore such illegal activities on its territory,"" the ministry said.
The ministry appealed for the U.S. to cooperate with the probe. The State Department didn't respond to a request for comment and the Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment.
FBI personnel visited Mr. Hyde's Connecticut home and business on Thursday, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The texts Mr. Hyde sent to Mr. Parnas in the spring of 2019 included such messages as: ""they will let me know when she's on the move,"" ""They are willing to help if we/you would like to pay a price"" and ""Guess you can do anything in Ukraine with money.""
Mr. Hyde later texted, ""if you want her out they need to make contact with security forces.""
Mr. Hyde has said he was never in Kyiv and denied he was monitoring the ambassador. In an interview Wednesday with Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. television host Eric Bolling, Mr. Hyde was asked if he ever ""had eyes on Marie Yovanovitch.""
""Absolutely not, are you kidding me?"" he responded. ""I'm a little landscaper from f—ing Connecticut. Come on."" He added: ""I thought we were playing.""
The text messages and interviews by Mr. Parnas, coming just as the House turned over the articles of impeachment to the Senate, brought renewed attention to the Soviet-born businessman and his ties to Trump supporters.
Mr. Trump on Thursday reiterated that he didn't know Mr. Parnas ""at all"" and said they had taken photos together at fundraisers. ""Perhaps he's a fine man, perhaps he's not,"" the president said. ""I don't believe I've ever spoken to him.""
Joseph Bondy, a lawyer for Mr. Parnas, responded by tweeting a video of Mr. Parnas standing with the president at an event at Mr. Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in 2017.
House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), who led the impeachment inquiry and is a manager—or prosecutor—in the Senate trial, said Mr. Parnas was being evaluated as a potential witness. His TV interviews and other documents ""shed additional insights"" into the pressure exerted on Ukraine and the involvement of members of the Trump administration, Mr. Schiff said.
Republicans questioned Mr. Parnas's significance and integrity. ""If I had ever heard of him before yesterday, I'm not aware of it. This is the indicted guy, right?"" Sen. Roy Blunt (R., Mo.) said.
Aside from the campaign finance charges, Mr. Parnas has also been accused of lying about his income and assets and his business dealings are being investigated.
Also included in the new materials Democrats released this week was a letter Mr. Giuliani wrote last spring to Ukraine's then-President-elect, Volodymyr Zelensky, seeking a meeting. In the letter
he said he was writing
""in my capacity as personal counsel to President Trump and with his knowledge and consent."" The meeting didn't take place.
Mr. Trump said Thursday that he didn't know about Mr. Giuliani's correspondence, ""but if he wrote a letter it wouldn't have been a big deal.""
Beyond their relevance to the impeachment, the messages to Mr. Parnas about Ms. Yovanovitch also renewed concerns among some Democrats about her treatment by the State Department.
Sen. Bob Menendez (D., N.J.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, sent a letter on Wednesday to the State Department seeking information on whether officials there knew of the alleged surveillance of Ms. Yovanovitch and what efforts were taken to ensure her safety and that of other U.S. diplomats.
Mr. Trump ordered Ms. Yovanovitch removed from her post in late April, exercising a presidential prerogative to remove ambassadors at will. Ms. Yovanovitch told House investigators that she was alarmed the State Department didn't support her in the face of a smear campaign by Mr. Giuliani and others seeking to get her removed. Mr. Giuliani has said he told Mr. Trump that Ms. Yovanovitch displayed an anti-Trump bias, which she has denied.
Earlier this week, Ms. Yovanovitch's lawyer called for an investigation into whether her movements were being tracked, calling the text messages ""disturbing.""
Ukrainian authorities said they were also probing a cybersecurity firm's report that
Russia's military hacked into Burisma Holdings
, the Ukrainian gas company that became a focus of Mr. Trump's impeachment because former Vice President Joe Biden's son served on its board.
The Kremlin didn't respond to a request for comment Thursday. The Russian Embassy in Washington didn't respond to a request for comment on the allegations on Monday, when media reports about the hack were first published.

Results from the Iowa Democratic Party showed more than 176,000 people participated this year. PHOTO: Christopher Lee for The Wall Street Journal
Democratic turnout for this week's Iowa caucuses fell well below expectations, leading some in the party to wonder if the state has become more conservative—or if voters aren't as enthusiastic about defeating President Trump as they hoped.
Turnout in the Democratic caucuses appeared far short of the record of nearly 240,000 people in 2008, when Barack Obama defeated Hillary Clinton in his first step toward the White House.
With 100% of precincts reporting, results from the Iowa Democratic Party showed more than 176,000 people participated this year, slightly more than showed up in 2016. After record turnout nationally boosted Democrats in the 2018 midterms, the disappointing outing has some in the party worried about whether voters are as passionate about beating Republicans as they were more than a year ago.
SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS
Do you think the Iowa caucus turnout is an appropriate bellwether this year? Why or why not? Join the conversation below.
Democratic party officials had set expectations high ahead of the caucuses with state party Chairman Troy Price forecasting a record turnout in comments to the Des Moines Register last month.
""Perhaps the most alarming thing that came out of Iowa this week was not the incompetence of the party and the failed technology,"" former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke, who ended his own presidential bid in November, said in an email to supporters Friday. ""What should most concern us is that turnout might have barely kept pace with 2016 levels, and fell well below the historic turnout of 2008. We're in the middle of a national emergency, and people are staying home.""
The issue arose early during Friday night's Democratic debate in New Hampshire.
""That's a disappointment, and I think all of us probably could have done a better job in bringing out our supporters,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders said of Iowa's low turnout. ""But if there is a good spot, a good aspect ... it's that young people came out in higher numbers than they did during Obama's historic 2008 campaign.""
Political analysts who study the caucuses say turnout could have suffered because many voters remain undecided about who to back in the still-crowded field, causing them to sit out the contest. In The Wall Street Journal's conversations with dozens of voters in the final weeks before the caucuses, many said they would vote for any candidate in a general election against President Trump.
In addition, people who caucused with Democrats in 2008 might not consider themselves members of the party anymore. Mr. Obama won the state in two general elections, but President Trump won it in 2016 by 10 points. In 2018, a banner year for Democrats across the country, the party picked up two House seats in Iowa, but the Republican governor won another term.
""Democrats are simply not nearly as robust in rural Iowa as they used to be, which explains some of the decline,"" said David Wasserman, the House editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report.

In
Howard County in northeast Iowa
, the only one of America's more than 3,000 counties that voted by more than 20 percentage points for Mr. Obama in 2012 and by more than 20 percentage points for Mr. Trump in 2016, turnout in the Democratic caucuses was down roughly a third from four years ago and 57% from 2008.
Reporting issues have plagued the Iowa Democratic Party, and the Associated Press
hasn't declared a winner of the caucuses
. Former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg had a razor-thin edge over Mr. Sanders with state delegate equivalents, the metric that state and national party officials say is most important. Mr. Sanders nonetheless declared victory based on a lead in the popular vote.
Irregularities in the results released by the state party make it difficult to perform a reliable precinct-by-precinct analysis, but the tallies revealed some broad trends.
Mr. Buttigieg, who has sought to appeal to moderates in the party, performed well across swaths of the state, winning many rural areas. The 38-year-old also did well in the suburban areas of Des Moines.
Mr. Sanders, a self-described Democratic socialist, drove up his support in college towns and population centers such as Cedar Rapids and Sioux City.
Mr. Sanders had hinged his strategy on motivating large numbers of new voters, saying in the final weeks before the Iowa caucuses that the
results would be revealed early
—if turnout was high he would win, he said; if it was low he would lose. Mr. Sanders also says that he is the strongest candidate to beat Mr. Trump because he can expand the electorate.
The Sanders campaign said he won 11 of 15 precincts where more than 20% of registered voters were under 23 years old, and aides to his campaign directly attributed his margin of victory in the popular vote to an increase in youth turnout. 





According to entrance polls, Sen. Bernie Sanders carried 48% of voters between the ages of 17 and 29. PHOTO: Christopher Lee for The Wall Street Journal
During a press conference Thursday, Mr. Sanders said he was concerned that voters stayed home but felt optimistic that young voters would show up in November.
Based on entrance polls, voters between the ages of 17 and 29 accounted for 24% of the Democratic electorate in this year's caucuses. In 2016, they made up
18% of Democratic voters
, and in
2008, it was 23%
.
According to those entrance polls, Mr. Sanders carried 48% of voters between the ages of 17 and 29. Mr. Buttigieg, who would be the youngest president in U.S. history if elected, earned support from 19% of caucus-goers in that age group. Twelve percent backed Sen. Elizabeth Warren.
Iowa's population is predominantly white, but the Sanders campaign also held events in areas with sizable Latino communities. Mr. Sanders's campaign said that helped him do well in
so-called satellite caucuses
, which were held for the first time this year in addition to the traditional precinct gatherings. Some satellite caucuses were conducted in English and Spanish.
In New Hampshire, which will hold its primary on Feb. 11, Mr. Sanders returned to his focus on turnout—though he wasn't tying his own fate to the numbers there.
""Let's have the largest voter turnout in New Hampshire primary history,"" he said at a town hall in Derry.

WASHINGTON -- Former national security adviser John Bolton, described by witnesses who testified at President Trump's impeachment hearings as alarmed at the pressure put on Ukraine, said he would testify in a Senate trial if subpoenaed by lawmakers.
Mr. Bolton's statement Monday spurred partisan wrangling over how the Senate impeachment trial would be conducted and added pressure on Republicans to call the former official. Mr. Bolton has previously conveyed that he has new information about the White House's Ukraine policy.
The Democratic-led House approved abuse-of-power and obstruction-of-Congress impeachment articles in December alleging Mr. Trump tried to enlist a foreign power to help him in this year's election. The chamber had sought Mr. Bolton's testimony but moved forward with articles of impeachment when he declined to testify.
""Since my testimony is once again at issue, I have had to resolve the serious competing issues as best I could, based on careful consideration and study. I have concluded that, if the Senate issues a subpoena for my testimony, I am prepared to testify,"" Mr. Bolton said in a statement. He noted that he had weighed Mr. Trump's attempt to block aides and former advisers from testifying to Congress against lawmakers' request that he testify about the White House's Ukraine policy.
The White House didn't respond to a question about Mr. Bolton's statement.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) has held off on sending the approved articles of impeachment to the Senate, saying she wanted to see more details on rules for a Senate trial. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the chamber's Democratic leader, has demanded the Senate request documents and testimony from the White House. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) hasn't committed to calling witnesses in the impeachment trial.
Mr. McConnell reiterated on Monday his position that requests for witnesses should be addressed after the trial begins, as during former President Clinton's impeachment trial.
""That was good enough for President Clinton, so it ought to be good enough for President Trump,"" he said. New witness material was used in the Clinton impeachment after approval by the Senate.
It would take a simple majority of the 100 senators to approve any new witnesses, meaning four Republicans would be needed if all 47 senators who caucus with the Democrats backed new testimony. On Monday, some Republicans remained wary of introducing new evidence after the House concluded its probe.
""Our inquiry should be limited to whatever evidence or testimony they used when they voted on the articles of impeachment,"" said Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.). ""If the House thinks there's additional testimony and so forth then they could take the item up again.""
Others signaled they wanted to hear from Mr. Bolton.
""He has firsthand information, and assuming articles of impeachment reach the Senate, I'd like to hear what he has to say,"" Sen. Mitt Romney (R., Utah) said.
Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) said he would be open to hearing from Mr. Bolton, anticipating he would be ""a good witness for the president.""
The House could also call Mr. Bolton to testify, though Rep. Adam Schiff (D., Calif.), chairman of the Intelligence Committee who led the investigation, said Monday that it ""makes sense"" for Mr. Bolton to testify in the Senate trial
Mr. Trump has said he did nothing wrong, tweeting on Monday that the impeachment process was a ""con game by the Dems to help with the Election!""
Mr. Bolton, according to testimony from other witnesses in the House impeachment investigation, was alarmed at a parallel Ukraine policy overseen by Mr. Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani aimed at pressuring Kyiv to launch investigations that would benefit him politically, including a probe of Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son. Mr. Bolton referred to the matter as a ""drug deal,"" according to the testimony of Fiona Hill, who had been Mr. Bolton's top Eurasia specialist.
Mr. Bolton, whom Mr. Trump fired in September after nearly a year and a half on the job, ""was personally involved in many of the events, meetings, and conversations"" about the Ukraine matter ""as well as many relevant meetings and conversations that have not yet been discussed in the testimonies thus far,"" Mr. Bolton's attorney Charles Cooper wrote to the House's general counsel, Douglas Letter, in November.
Mr. Schumer has called for testimony from three new witnesses besides Mr. Bolton: acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney; Mr. Mulvaney's aide Robert Blair; and Office of Management and Budget official Michael Duffey.
""It is now up to four Senate Republicans to support bringing in Mr. Bolton, and the other three witnesses, as well as the key documents we have requested to ensure all the evidence is presented at the onset of a Senate trial,"" Mr. Schumer said.
Mr. Bolton's acknowledgment of the Senate's power to compel him to appear sidesteps a brewing conflict between the branches of government over their rights and privileges in the impeachment proceedings. Precedent on whether a president can invoke legal privilege over documents or testimony in an impeachment process, particularly a Senate trial, is scant.
Mr. McConnell hasn't ruled out hearing from witnesses. Over the break, two Senate Republicans -- Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine -- indicated they would bring an independent mind-set to a trial, suggesting that witnesses could be called if enough Republicans vote for motions by Democrats to subpoena witnesses or documents.
Ms. Collins said Monday the Senate should vote on possible witnesses after the trial begins, supporting Mr. McConnell.
During the House probe, Mr. Bolton declined to testify voluntarily. In his statement Monday explaining his decision to come to the Senate, Mr. Bolton said he believed he had run out of time on seeking a judicial ruling.

WASHINGTON—President Trump's impeachment team in his
Senate trial
will include former Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, constitutional-law professor Alan Dershowitz and former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a person familiar with the matter said Friday.
The team, which will be led by White House counsel Pat Cipollone, will also include Jay Sekulow, a personal lawyer to the president, and Robert Ray, who succeeded Mr. Starr in the broad Whitewater inquiry, which led to the impeachment and acquittal of former President Bill Clinton.
Mr. Dershowitz's role in the Senate trial will focus on the constitutional arguments against impeachment and against removing the president from office, the team said Friday.
""While Professor Dershowitz is nonpartisan when it comes to the constitution—he opposed the impeachment of President Bill Clinton and voted for Hillary Clinton—he believes the issues at stake go to the heart of our enduring Constitution,"" the team said in a statement.
Ms. Bondi, who
joined the White House in November
as an adviser on impeachment, will also be part of the team, another person familiar with the matter said. She was a prosecutor and assistant state attorney before her election as Florida attorney general and frequently appeared on Fox News.
The news of the appointments came a day after the Senate opened its impeachment trial, in which Mr. Trump faces two charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
Mr. Trump's team will be tasked with defending the president against the impeachment charges. Once the trial kicks off in earnest next week, each side is expected to have about 24 hours over two days to make their arguments, said people familiar with the planning of the Senate trial.
Democrats allege that Mr. Trump, a Republican,
improperly pressed Kyiv to launch investigations
that would help him politically in the 2020 election. Mr. Trump has denied wrongdoing. He is the third president in U.S. history to be impeached.
In his selections, Mr. Trump has picked lawyers who have defended him on television. The president often watches Messrs. Starr, Ray and Dershowitz on cable networks and tweets their quotes.
Mr. Starr, a frequent Fox News contributor, has often appeared favorable to the president's case on impeachment. Last month, he told Fox News that he believed impeachment was ""absolutely"" an effort to overthrow the president. However, he also chided Mr. Trump over a tweet in which he criticized former Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, a witness in the House impeachment probe, while she was testifying on Capitol Hill.
""Obviously this was quite injurious,"" he said on Fox News. ""I don't think it rises to the level of intimidation of a witness, but I think that's the way it will be characterized.""
Mr. Dershowitz is one of the most high-profile defense attorneys in the country. In the 1980s, Mr. Dershowitz successfully defended Claus von Bülow, erasing his convictions for attempted murder of his wife, Sunny. In the mid-1990s, he worked on O.J. Simpson's murder defense. He was the youngest full professor in the history of Harvard Law School and has written more than 40 books. Mr. Dershowitz and Mr. Starr worked on the 2007 team representing financier Jeffrey Epstein, and helped hammer out a controversial nonprosecution agreement between him and federal authorities.

What strategy should the president's impeachment team pursue? What does each member bring to the team? Join the conversation below.
Mr. Dershowitz faces a defamation suit filed against him in April by a woman who
says she was a victim of financier Mr. Epstein
and was forced to have sex with his friends, including Mr. Dershowitz. Mr. Dershowitz has countersued for defamation and infliction of emotional distress, saying her accusations were fabricated and baseless.
After serving as independent counsel in the Whitewater investigation, Mr. Starr returned to private practice, working on campaign-finance and death-penalty cases among others. He was later named president of Baylor University. In 2016, he was
forced out as president
amid allegations he turned a blind eye to accusations of sexual assaults by football players. Mr. Starr said at the time that he was profoundly sorry to victims who weren't treated with proper care and concern.
